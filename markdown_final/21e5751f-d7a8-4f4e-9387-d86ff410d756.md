## Question

FOLFIRI/cetuximab

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab in first-line RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, including efficacy, biomarkers, sidedness, maintenance, safety, and guideline positioning, with explicit self-verification of claims throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regimen's mechanism and the RAS wild-type restriction. Then, I should verify first-line efficacy versus FOLFIRI alone and versus FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. Next, I will examine predictive biomarkers, especially RAS status and primary tumor sidedness. After that, I should review maintenance strategies and their evidence base. I will then assess safety and tolerability, followed by guideline recommendations and practical dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and highlight controversies and uncertainties that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the regimen and its biological rationale. FOLFIRI combines irinotecan, leucovorin, and infusional 5-fluorouracil, and adding cetuximab, a chimeric anti-EGFR IgG1 antibody, targets the EGFR axis; however, benefit is restricted to RAS wild-type tumors due to intrinsic resistance from downstream MAPK pathway activation in RAS-mutant disease, so I need to ensure RAS testing is complete before recommending cetuximab [^116JL1xq] [^113NJ8Ht] [^1172GiWt].

> I will now examine first-line efficacy versus chemotherapy alone. In the phase III CRYSTAL trial, adding cetuximab to FOLFIRI improved progression-free survival in KRAS exon 2 wild-type disease and, in updated analyses, also improved overall survival, establishing the foundational efficacy signal for this combination in appropriately selected patients [^116JL1xq] [^116TsAan] [^113NJ8Ht].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about comparative effectiveness versus bevacizumab. In FIRE-3, FOLFIRI plus cetuximab did not improve objective response rate versus FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, PFS was similar, but OS favored cetuximab by about 3–4 months in KRAS exon 2 wild-type populations. Importantly, subsequent analyses showed the OS advantage was concentrated in extended RAS wild-type and, even more specifically, in left-sided primaries, which I should verify carefully before extrapolating broadly [^1151N7NM] [^115wnB7J] [^117R67Dx].

> Wait, let me verify the role of primary tumor sidedness because this is often decisive. Multiple retrospective and pooled analyses demonstrate that anti-EGFR therapy confers the greatest OS benefit in left-sided RAS wild-type tumors, whereas right-sided tumors have inferior outcomes and may derive limited or no OS benefit from cetuximab, reinforcing that sidedness is a key predictor of anti-EGFR efficacy in first line [^117R67Dx] [^115wnB7J] [^1157Ajph].

> Next, I should review predictive biomarkers beyond RAS. Expanded RAS testing (KRAS/NRAS exons 2–4) is mandatory, and BRAF V600E is prognostically adverse and not an indication for anti-EGFR therapy; intriguingly, exploratory analyses suggest that non-canonical MAPK pathway activating mutations may portend poor outcomes and reduced benefit from cetuximab maintenance, though this remains hypothesis-generating and should be interpreted cautiously pending prospective validation [^113NJ8Ht] [^115GWXSQ] [^116xGyng].

> I need to check maintenance strategies because practice varies. After induction FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, single-agent cetuximab maintenance improved the 6‑month progression-free rate, median PFS, and suggested OS benefit versus observation in the randomized TIME/PRODIGE 28 trial, albeit the primary endpoint was not met. Nonetheless, the PFS signal and chemotherapy-sparing profile support de-escalation in selected patients, with the caveat that right-sided or MAPK-activated tumors may not benefit from maintenance anti-EGFR, which I should explicitly discuss during shared decision-making [^1141gTKg] [^113Gd7Mn] [^116xGyng].

> Let me consider competing maintenance data to avoid overstatement. The phase III ERMES trial did not establish noninferiority of cetuximab monotherapy maintenance versus continuing FOLFIRI plus cetuximab through progression, and a subset analysis suggested patients with right-sided tumors may fare better with continuation of full therapy; taken together, maintenance cetuximab can be considered in selected RAS wild-type, left-sided patients after a finite induction, but continuation of full therapy remains reasonable, particularly for right-sided disease or when deep responses are still evolving [^114ZB1yw] [^112oLNNx].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability because it influences regimen choice. Compared with FOLFIRI alone, adding cetuximab increases grade 3 skin rash, infusion reactions, and diarrhea; versus bevacizumab, cetuximab causes more dermatologic toxicity and infusion-related events but less hypertension, proteinuria, and thromboembolism, which can matter for patients with cardiovascular comorbidity or bleeding risk; importantly, skin toxicity correlates with efficacy, which I should explain to patients up front [^116JL1xq] [^1176pkEQ] [^111Zg9XX].

> Next, I should review how guidelines synthesize this evidence. NCCN lists FOLFIRI plus cetuximab as a first-line option for RAS wild-type, primarily left-sided disease, with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab as an alternative. ASCO similarly supports anti-EGFR therapy in RAS wild-type left-sided tumors while emphasizing shared decision-making, and ESMO guidance has evolved to endorse maintenance strategies in selected contexts, though anti-EGFR maintenance evidence remains limited to phase II data [^113NJ8Ht] [^112mw54n] [^113gXZrt].

> I will now examine practical dosing to ensure accuracy. Standard FOLFIRI is irinotecan 180 mg/m2 and leucovorin 400 mg/m2 on day 1 with 5‑FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus followed by 2400 mg/m2 continuous infusion over 46–48 hours, repeated every 2 weeks. Cetuximab can be administered weekly at 250 mg/m2 after a 400 mg/m2 loading dose or every 2 weeks at 500 mg/m2, with the latter schedule often preferred for convenience, and I should confirm RAS/BRAF wild-type status before the first dose [^114dZeie] [^113NJ8Ht].

> But wait, what about controversies and negative data I must not overlook. Head-to-head U.S. data in CALGB/SWOG 80405 showed no OS difference between adding cetuximab versus bevacizumab to FOLFOX/FOLFIRI, underscoring that results vary by backbone, analysis set, and molecularly defined subgroups; similarly, the perioperative New EPOC trial found detriment with adding cetuximab around liver metastasis surgery, so anti-EGFR should be avoided in that perioperative setting; and although BRAF V600E confers poor prognosis, emerging regimens like encorafenib plus cetuximab have altered second-line standards, but BRAF-mutant tumors still should not receive anti-EGFR in first line [^112Yoxsv] [^112zGRHA] [^113V5KnP] [^115GWXSQ].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overgeneralizing. For fit patients with RAS wild-type, left-sided, non–BRAF V600E metastatic colorectal cancer, FOLFIRI plus cetuximab is a strong first-line option when the clinical priority is to maximize response, achieve early tumor shrinkage, or facilitate conversion to resectability, acknowledging a modest OS advantage in FIRE-3 and robust response metrics. For right-sided tumors or those with any RAS mutation, FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab is generally preferred, and anti-EGFR should be avoided in RAS-mutant disease. Maintenance cetuximab after induction is reasonable in selected left-sided RAS wild-type patients to reduce chemotherapy exposure, with the understanding that continuation of full therapy remains acceptable, particularly for right-sided disease or evolving responses [^115wnB7J] [^117R67Dx] [^1141gTKg] [^114ZB1yw].

---

FOLFIRI/cetuximab is a **first-line regimen** for RAS/BRAF wild-type, left-sided mCRC that improves response rates and overall survival versus FOLFIRI alone or FOLFIRI/bevacizumab in selected patients [^113Gbck2] [^115wnB7J] [^113NJ8Ht]. It is **not recommended for RAS/BRAF-mutant or right-sided tumors** due to limited benefit or worse outcomes [^1111qgEB] [^117R67Dx] [^115GWXSQ]. Key toxicities include rash, diarrhea, and infusion reactions; regular monitoring and dose adjustments are essential [^116JL1xq] [^1176pkEQ]. After induction, **maintenance cetuximab** can extend PFS and OS with fewer side effects than continued full chemotherapy in RAS wild-type disease [^112oLNNx] [^113Gd7Mn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting FOLFIRI/cetuximab

### First-line treatment

- **CRYSTAL trial**: Cetuximab + FOLFIRI improved PFS (9.9 vs 8.4 mo; HR 0.68) and OS (23.5 vs 20.0 mo; HR 0.796) in KRAS wild-type mCRC versus FOLFIRI alone [^116JL1xq] [^113NJ8Ht].

- **FIRE-3 trial**: Cetuximab + FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI + bevacizumab showed higher ORR (62% vs 58%) and longer OS (28.7 vs 25.0 mo; HR 0.77) in KRAS exon 2 wild-type mCRC [^1151N7NM].

- **Meta-analyses**: Anti-EGFR + chemotherapy improves response and OS in RAS wild-type mCRC [^notfound].

---

### Maintenance therapy

In the **TIME trial**, after FOLFIRI/cetuximab induction, single-agent cetuximab maintenance improved PFS (5.3 vs 2.0 mo) and OS (24.8 vs 19.7 mo) versus observation, enabling chemotherapy-free intervals [^116xGyng] [^113Gd7Mn]. The **ERMES trial** evaluated cetuximab maintenance after FOLFIRI/cetuximab; although the primary PFS endpoint was not met, it showed better tolerability and signals for benefit in selected subgroups [^114ZB1yw] [^112oLNNx].

---

## Patient selection criteria

### Molecular markers

For molecular markers, **RAS status** is critical: benefit is restricted to RAS wild-type tumors; RAS mutations confer resistance [^1111qgEB] [^1172GiWt]. BRAF V600E mutations are associated with poor prognosis and limited anti-EGFR benefit; **BRAF status** should be assessed [^113V5KnP] [^115GWXSQ].

---

### Tumor location

Regarding tumor location, **left-sided tumors** benefit more from anti-EGFR therapy, with higher response and OS versus right-sided tumors [^117R67Dx] [^1151N7NM]. In contrast, **right-sided tumors** derive limited benefit and may have worse outcomes with anti-EGFR therapy [^117R67Dx] [^115wnB7J].

---

## Clinical efficacy and outcomes

| **Endpoint** | **Folfiri/cetuximab** | **Folfiri alone** | **Folfiri/bevacizumab** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Objective response rate (ORR) | 57–77% | 39–65% | 56–65% |
| Median progression-free survival (PFS) | 9.9–10.4 months | 8.4–8.7 months | 10.2–10.3 months |
| Median overall survival (OS) | 23.5–33.1 months | 20.0–26.0 months | 25.0–26.0 months |

---

## Safety profile and management of adverse effects

Common adverse effects include rash, diarrhea, infusion reactions, and fatigue [^116JL1xq] [^1151N7NM]. Management strategies include premedication for infusion reactions, dose modifications, and supportive care; **skin care protocols** help mitigate rash [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other first-line regimens

Compared with **FOLFIRI/bevacizumab**, cetuximab achieves higher ORR and longer OS in left-sided RAS wild-type mCRC [^1142VX1C] [^115wnB7J]. Versus **FOLFOX/cetuximab**, efficacy is broadly similar; selection is guided by patient factors and prior therapy [^1147fS6F] [^1135vY5p].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Per NCCN, cetuximab with FOLFIRI is a **first-line option** for RAS/BRAF wild-type, left-sided mCRC [^113Gbck2]. ASCO recommends anti-EGFR therapy for RAS wild-type, left-sided tumors and advises against its use in RAS-mutant or right-sided disease [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Key challenges include the lack of benefit in RAS-mutant and right-sided tumors [^1111qgEB] [^117R67Dx], the potential for **early progression** due to rapid resistance, and significant costs and access barriers that may limit use.

---

FOLFIRI/cetuximab is effective for **RAS/BRAF wild-type, left-sided mCRC**, improving response and survival; after induction, cetuximab maintenance can sustain control with fewer side effects. It is not recommended for RAS/BRAF-mutant or right-sided tumors, and selection plus toxicity management are critical.

### Toward optimized front-line therapeutic strategies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer – an expert review from the international congress on anti-cancer treatment (ICACT) 2009 [^117KmVg3]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Metastatic colorectal cancer is a particularly frequent and severe cancer. Patients die mainly from metastatic disease; however, the survival of these patients has dramatically improved with the progress in chemotherapeutic regimens as new routes of administration and introduction of more potent cytotoxic agents administered in sequential 5-FU-folinic acid-irinotecan/5-FU-folinic acid-oxaliplatine strategies. Biologic therapies have been also developed targeting two different pathways, angiogenesis and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Their combination with chemotherapy leads to improved progression-free survival and overall survival in some cases as the addition of cetuximab in wild-type K-Ras tumors. The objectives of this expert conference were to review the different options, the available prognostic or predictive factors to optimally guide the treatment.

### Prognostic and predictive relevance of primary tumor location in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: retrospective analyses of the CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 trials [^117R67Dx]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is heterogeneous, and primary tumors arising from different regions of the colon are clinically and molecularly distinct.

Objective

To examine the prognostic and predictive value of primary tumor location in patients with RAS wild-type (wt) mCRC treated with first-line fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab in the Cetuximab Combined With Irinotecan in First-line Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRYSTAL) trial and FOLFIRI Plus Cetuximab Versus FOLFIRI Plus Bevacizumab as First-Line Treatment For Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (FIRE-3) trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective analysis patients with RAS wt metastatic colorectal cancer from the CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 trials were classified as having left-sided or right-sided mCRC, defined, respectively, as patients whose tumors originated in the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum vs appendix, cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, or transverse colon.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR) were assessed according to tumor location and treatment arm.

Results

In the RAS wt populations of the CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 trials, patients with left-sided tumors (n = 142 and n = 157, respectively) had markedly superior PFS, OS, and ORR compared with patients with right-sided tumors (n = 33 and n = 38, respectively). Among CRYSTAL and FIRE-3 study patients with RAS wt left-sided tumors, FOLFIRI plus cetuximab significantly improved OS relative to the respective comparators (FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab); in contrast, in RAS wt patients with poor-prognosis right-sided tumors, limited efficacy benefits were observed upon the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI in CRYSTAL, and comparable outcomes were observed between the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab arms of FIRE-3. A significant interaction was observed between primary tumor location and treatment for OS (CRYSTAL: hazard ratio [HR], 1.95; 95% CI, 1.09–3.48 and FIRE-3: HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23–0.70) within the RAS wt populations of both studies in multivariable models that also included sex, prior adjuvant therapy, and BRAF mutational status.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the RAS wt populations of CRYSTAL and FIRE-3, patients with left-sided tumors had a markedly better prognosis than those with right-sided tumors. First-line FOLFIRI plus cetuximab clearly benefitted patients with left-sided tumors (vs FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, respectively), whereas patients with right-sided tumors derived limited benefit from standard treatments.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112zGRHA]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

New EPOC trial — cetuximab with perioperative chemotherapy: The New EPOC trial, stopped early for protocol-defined futility, found a lack of benefit to adding cetuximab to chemotherapy in the perioperative metastatic setting (> 85% received FOLFOX or CAPEOX; prior oxaliplatin patients received FOLFIRI), with progression-free survival significantly reduced in the cetuximab arm (14.8 vs. 24.2 months; HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.00–2.25; P < .048) and a subsequent analysis showing reduced median overall survival with chemotherapy plus cetuximab compared to chemotherapy alone (55.4 vs. 81.0 months; HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.02–2.05; p = 0.036). The Panel thus recommends against panitumumab and cetuximab as perioperative treatment for resectable metachronous metastatic disease, and notes these agents should be used with caution in patients with unresectable disease that could potentially be converted to a resectable status.

### Encorafenib plus cetuximab as a new standard of care for previously treatedV600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer: updated survival results and subgroup analyses from the BEACON study [^113V5KnP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

BEACON CRC evaluated encorafenib plus cetuximab with or without binimetinib versus investigators' choice of irinotecan or FOLFIRI plus cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), after progression on 1–2 prior regimens. In the previously reported primary analysis, encorafenib, binimetinib plus cetuximab (ENCO/BINI/CETUX; triplet) and encorafenib plus cetuximab (ENCO/CETUX; doublet) regimens improved overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR; by blinded central review) versus standard of care. The purpose of this analysis was to report updated efficacy and safety data.

Methods

In this open-label, phase III trial, 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive triplet, doublet, or control. Primary end points were OS and independently reviewed ORR comparing triplet to control. OS for doublet versus control was a key secondary end point. Updated analyses include 6 months of additional follow-up and ORR for all randomized patients.

Results

Patients received triplet (n = 224), doublet (n = 220), or control (n = 221). Median OS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.2 to 10.8) for triplet and 5.9 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 7.1) for control (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.75]). Median OS for doublet was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 11.3) (HR v control, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77]). Confirmed ORR was 26.8% (95% CI, 21.1% to 33.1%) for triplet, 19.5% (95% CI, 14.5% to 25.4%) for doublet, and 1.8% (95% CI, 0.5% to 4.6%) for control. Adverse events were consistent with the prior primary analysis, with grade ≥ 3 adverse events in 65.8%, 57.4%, and 64.2% for triplet, doublet, and control, respectively.

Conclusion

In the BEACON CRC study, encorafenib plus cetuximab improved OS, ORR, and progression-free survival in previously treated patients in the metastatic setting compared with standard chemotherapy. Based on the primary and updated analyses, encorafenib plus cetuximab is a new standard care regimen for previously treated patients with BRAF V600E mCRC.

### Cetuximab plus XELIRI or XELOX for first-line therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer [^113nHhWt]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Modern chemotherapy combinations for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) comprise infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and irinotecan or oxaliplatin. The fluoropyrimidine derivative capecitabine is at least as effective as 5-FU plus leucovorin bolus regimens. It displays a favorable toxicity profile and offers the advantages of oral administration. The epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab induces synergistic antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapy. In pretreated patients, cetuximab can restore the sensitivity to irinotecan and, therefore, has been registered in this setting. Several phase I/II trials have investigated the combination of cetuximab with irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of mCRC. These combinations have been proven to be safe and have provided promising efficacy data. A recent phase III trial confirmed improved progression-free survival, response rates, and a particularly significant increase of secondary resection rates for the combination of FOLFIRI (infusional 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan) plus cetuximab compared with FOLFIRI alone. In this review, we discuss the background of combining XELIRI (capecitabine/irinotecan) or XELOX (capecit-abine/oxaliplatin) with cetuximab for the first-line treatment of mCRC and present available data of these combined cytotoxic and targeted treatment approaches.

### Efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in 1st-line treatment of older patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: an analysis of the randomised trial FIRE-3 [^114ZDWEN]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results presented here suggest that older patients have a shorter OS despite intensive treatment. This observation could be explained by the overrepresentation of right-sided tumours in elderly patients. Furthermore, in our cohort, older patients were less likely to undergo secondary resection. However, secondary resection was equally beneficial in older and younger patients.

According to our analyses, for older patients, no favoured targeted therapy emerged as both anti-EGFR- and anti-VEGF-directed treatment yielded comparable results. These findings could be taken into account in the multidisciplinary management of older patients suffering from RAS wild-type colorectal cancer.

### Encorafenib plus cetuximab for the treatment of-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer [^115GWXSQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In the second-line setting, the phase III VELOUR trial, a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of another anti-VEGF combination, comparing aflibercept plus FOLFIRI versus placebo plus FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC experiencing disease progression on or after completing an oxaliplatin-based regimen. Analysis of the 36 BRAF-V600E mutant CRC patients gave an OS of 10.3 months with FOLFIRI plus aflibercept.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR have also been tested in the BRAF-V600E population. The presence of BRAF-V600E mutations has been proposed to be a predictive marker for limited response to anti-EGFR therapies in mCRC patients. – Furthermore, a meta-analysis including nine phase III trials that compared cetuximab or panitumumab, and involving 463 BRAF mutant patients, demonstrated that the addition of an anti-EGFR agent to standard therapy did not increase the benefit, for either PFS (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.67–1.14; p = 0.33) or OS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.62–1.34; p = 0.63). These findings support BRAF mutation assessment before initiation of treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. The phase III CRYSTAL trial evaluated the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI. Sub-analysis of BRAF-V600E patients showed that in this population the addition of cetuximab did not result in a statistically significant benefit in terms of PFS or OS. Similar results were reported in a retrospective analysis of the FIRE-3 study, in which patients were randomly assigned to either FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. Analyses did not confirm an anti-EGFR benefit among BRAF-V600E mCRC patients. Thus, currently, an anti-VEGF in combination with chemotherapy is preferred over chemotherapy plus an anti-EGFR for patients with BRAF-V600E -mutated CRC, for both the upfront and refractory settings. Guidelines on the use of anti-EGFR therapies currently mandate expanded RAS/BRAF testing and that patients with BRAF-V600E mutations should not receive an anti-EGFR either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. While other treatments are recommended in the refractory CRC setting, such as trifluridine/tipiracil or regorafenib, there are no published analyses regarding the activity of these treatments in the BRAF-V600E subgroup. Promising preclinical data showed synthetically lethal activity of mitotic spindle poisons on BRAF -mutated and BRAF -like CRC models. Based on these data, a phase II trial tested the activity of vinorelbine in patients with BRAF-V600E mCRC. However despite the encouraging preclinical data, the study did not show the signs of clinical activity among the 20 enrolled patients, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 0%, while median PFS and OS were 1.0 and 2.1 months, respectively.

### Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: ASCO guideline [^111tppGF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO metastatic colorectal cancer guideline — bevacizumab plus triplet chemotherapy (FOLFOXIRI) versus doublet chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) in initially unresectable mCRC shows for overall survival: HR, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91) and Difference: 70 fewer per 1,000 (95% CI, 107 fewer to 32 fewer); for progression-free survival: Difference: 84 fewer per 1,000 (95% CI, 116 fewer to 53 fewer); for objective response rate: Difference: 109 more per 1,000 (95% CI, 62 more to 152 more); for grade 3–4 neutropenia: OR, 3.16 (95% CI, 2.54 to 3.92) and Difference: 249 more per 1,000 (95% CI, 195 more to 303 more); and for diarrhea: Difference: 95 more per 1,000 (95% CI, 54 more to 143 more).

### FOLFIRI and cetuximab every second week for first-line treatment of KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer according to phosphatase and tensin homolog expression: a phase II study [^111HGUzq]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Retrospective studies have suggested that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression might predict the efficacy of cetuximab in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The present study was designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of first-line irinotecan, fluorouracil, and folinate (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab every second week according to PTEN expression.

Patients and Methods

Originally, patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC were randomly assigned to receive either FOLFIRI or cetuximab plus FOLFIRI (FOLFIRI-C). After a protocol amendment, the FOLFIRI arm was discontinued, and additional patients received FOLFIRI-C. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the effect of PTEN and MET expression and BRAF and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α mutations on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Results

A total of 35 and 54 patients received FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI-C, respectively. For the patients assigned to FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI-C, the median OS was 17.7 and 23.3 months and the median PFS was 8.2 and 6.6 months, respectively. For patients receiving FOLFIRI-C, the loss of PTEN expression did not affect PFS or OS. Significant interactions for PFS were detected between the MET expression levels (P = 0.047) and BRAF mutation (P = 0.018) and treatment. On univariate analysis, BRAF mutation was significantly associated with shorter OS for patients receiving either FOLFIRI-C (P = 0.016) or FOLFIRI (P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of BRAF mutation on OS and that of MET expression levels on PFS (P = 0.025) and OS (P = 0.028) but only in the patients receiving FOLFIRI alone. Adverse events with FOLFIRI-C were consistent with those expected from FOLFIRI plus weekly cetuximab.

Conclusion

Although prospective analysis of PTEN did not allow a validation of the prognostic value of this biomarker, an every second week cetuximab schedule, in addition to first-line FOLFIRI, was effective and well tolerated. The possible predictive value of MET expression levels warrants additional investigation.

RAS wild-type per-protocol analysis

Table 1 summarises efficacy in the RAS wild-type per-protocol population. The ORR was significantly higher in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab group (77 vs 65%), whereas there was no difference in the disease control rate (95% in both groups, Supplementary Table S5) or PFS (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). OS was superior in the cetuximab group, with median survival of 33 vs 26 months in patients treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2b). However, these outcomes differed by primary tumour location. In both treatment groups, efficacy was consistently lower in patients with right-sided vs left-sided primary tumours (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Furthermore, the significant advantage in the cetuximab group for response and OS was observed only in patients with left-sided tumours. The OS rates in this subset were 52% for FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and 37% for FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab at 3 years, and 21 vs 11% at 5 years (Fig. 3b); the corresponding values for patients with right-sided tumours were 13 vs 23% at 3 years and 7% vs 0 at 5 years (Fig. 3d). In contrast, PFS did not differ between treatment groups in patients with left-sided tumours (Fig. 3a), while among patients with right-sided tumours, there was a trend towards longer PFS in the bevacizumab group (HR 1.56, P = 0.06) (Fig. 3c).

ASCO metastatic colorectal cancer guideline — first-line chemotherapy for previously untreated, initially unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) candidates for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab is framed by whether doublet (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) or triplet (FOLFOXIRI) cytotoxic chemotherapy is recommended. Recommendation 1.1 states that doublet (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) backbone chemotherapy should be offered as first-line therapy to patients with initially unresectable microsatellite stable (MSS) or proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) mCRC (Type: Evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). A qualifying statement specifies that treatment with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin may be substituted for FOLFOX at the clinical discretion of the treating provider, and in shared decision making with the patient.

### Chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer [^114eQTgf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2005). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen a significant survival improvement for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, fueled in large part by the arrival of active novel chemotherapeutic drugs and their incorporation into combination regimens. Several randomized trials have successfully integrated oxaliplatin and irinotecan into previously existing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimens for advanced colorectal cancer, resulting in median survivals that have risen from 9 months to almost 2 years. Even as the ideal combinations and sequences of these regimens are elucidated, targeted therapies such as recently approved bevacizumab and cetuximab have been added to treatment protocols, with favorable consequences. We review the evolution of primary chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer, focusing on the trials that have led to the new standard first-line treatments. We also review the data on newer targeted therapies, especially in combination with cytotoxic therapy.

### Treatment decisions after diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer [^115bQdcY]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) involves the use of active cytotoxic drugs (irinotecan, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], and capecitabine) and biological agents (bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab) either in combination or as single agents. Until recently, the only biological agent with proven first-line efficacy was bevacizumab, but options have expanded from the data generated with anti-endothelial growth factor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies. Anti-EGFR agents can be added to first-line FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin [folinic acid], irinotecan) or FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin [folinic acid], oxaliplatin) in patients whose tumors express wild-type KRAS. These agents may improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy, particularly progression-free survival (PFS), and in the case of cetuximab, overall survival (OS) and response rates. The selection of first-line therapy should be based on the individual treatment goals after considering the efficacy and tolerability of each regimen. For patients with metastases confined to the liver, surgical resection offers a potentially curative approach. For initially unresectable lesions, treatment regimens offering high response rates may produce sufficient tumor shrinkage to permit complete resection. Regimens with high response rates are also preferable for patients requiring symptom relief or for those with large tumor burdens. The choice between intensive vs. nonintensive management also depends on other factors, including the patient's functional status, comorbidities, and desires. A sequential single-agent strategy or an intermittent approach (combination therapy followed by maintenance) may minimize toxicity and be appropriate for patients who are not surgical candidates, irrespective of treatment response. Guidelines, such as those of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), recommend that KRAS mutational status should be determined at mCRC diagnosis to identify candidates for anti-EGFR therapy whether they are used in first or subsequent lines of treatment.

### Current role of antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^115GUr6S]. Oncogene (2007). Low credibility.

In less than 10 years, the number and importance of non-surgical treatment modalities in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have increased dramatically, both in the adjuvant and the advanced settings. However, despite the improvement of cytotoxic therapy in CRC, many patients still develop progressive disease and unfortunately in patients with disease resistant to 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, no effective cytotoxic therapy is known. The rapidly expanding knowledge in tumor biology has encouraged optimism for the possibility to find and target tumor-specific mechanisms and thereby increase both efficacy and tolerance. A great number of 'targeted drugs' are being tested in clinical trials and some of these new drugs, like bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab, are available for routine use in health care. These new targeted drugs will expand the therapeutic arsenal in CRC to a great extent, but they will also add to the complexity of treatment of CRC. In this review, we summarize the current status of antibody therapy in patients with CRC.

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^116wZWq8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The originality of our exploratory molecular analysis lies in the significant prognostic value of the MAPK-activating mutation on PFS among patients with mCRC during chemotherapy-free intervals with or without cetuximab, even after exclusion of BRAF V600E and RAS mutations. In our ITT1 population selected according to RAS status (n = 190), we reported 24 tumors (12.6%) with MAPK gene alterations other than RAS-BRAF V600E mutations. The spectrum of MAPK pathway mutations with potential therapeutic involvement encompasses rare BRAF or RAS mutations and other alterations that are not considered in current recommendations. Recent pancancer data showed that patients with tumors with MAPK pathway alterations tended to globally have worse disease outcomes. The predictive value (ie, treatment-dependent effect) of MAPK-activating mutations (ie, significant benefit from cetuximab maintenance among patients with no MAPK-mutated tumor) could not be demonstrated, probably due to underpowered analysis, and should be assessed among larger patient populations. Nevertheless, our results suggest that patients with right-sided mCRC and/or MAPK activation may not be good candidates for cetuximab maintenance or treatment break. We believe that a more complete assessment of MAPK pathway mutations could refine treatment strategy decisions for patients with mCRC. No unexpected safety issues emerged, and few severe cetuximab-related adverse events were observed during the maintenance phase, probably because cetuximab dose adaptation and treatment discontinuation occurred during induction chemotherapy, before randomization.

Limitations

Our study has some limitations. Our hypothesis for 6-month PFR was overoptimistic. Progression-free survival may appear inappropriate because it does not consider the subsequent benefit of planned reintroduction of full first-line treatment at disease progression. However, the best parameter to assess the benefit of maintenance is PFS in the interval. At the time our study was designed, the prognostic and predictive effect of primary tumor site and BRAF V600E mutation status was unknown, so our population was not selected according to these criteria. We actually observed that patients with right-sided primary tumors exhibited shorter PFS and OS and that left localization significantly increased the probability of response during the induction phase. Current guidelines recommend first-line chemotherapy with anti-EGFR antibodies only for patients with left colon tumors. For the same reasons, we did not analyze the microsatellite status that now determines the choice of first-line immunotherapy for DNA mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high tumors.

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^113gXZrt]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

For patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is not amenable to curative-intent treatment and whose disease is controlled after induction chemotherapy, the optimal duration of the upfront combination of cytotoxic drugs with a targeted agent remains controversial. Phase 3 randomized trials have shown that de-escalation significantly reduces toxic effects and improves patients' quality of life, whereas there is no benefit in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) to continuing the full induction regimen until disease progression. However, there is still debate about the best option among de-escalation modalities, including fluoropyrimidine-based maintenance, chemotherapy-free intervals with a targeted agent alone, or planned off-therapy breaks.

According to current European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, maintenance treatment with fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab or anti–epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy is recommended after oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Conversely, first-line FOLFIRI (leucovorin [folinic acid], fluorouracil, and irinotecan) should be continued until disease progression, while FOLFIRI plus targeted therapy is not considered.

A recent network meta-analysis confirmed the PFS benefit of maintenance therapy with fluoropyrimidine with or without bevacizumab vs observation; however, the OS benefit was not confirmed, leading to the conclusion that shared decision-making should include observation as an acceptable alternative. Although an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody combined with doublet chemotherapy is currently recommended as a first-line treatment option for RAS wild-type mCRC (KRAS, OMIM; and NRAS, OMIM), the level of evidence in favor of anti-EGFR–based maintenance therapy is lower because only a few randomized studies (especially randomized comparisons of anti-EGFR–free maintenance therapy) investigated maintenance options after chemotherapy plus anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (unlike bevacizumab) are active as a single-agent therapy in RAS wild-type mCRC and may allow chemotherapy-free intervals with fewer toxic effects. Therefore, the optimal duration of an anti-EGFR–based upfront treatment and maintenance strategy is still to be defined. The TIME (Treatment After Irinotecan-Based Frontline Therapy: Maintenance With Erbitux]) (PRODIGE 28 [Partenariat de Recherche en Oncologie Digestive]–UCGI 27 [UniCancer GastroIntestinal Group]) study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of single-agent cetuximab as maintenance therapy after induction chemotherapy with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for patients with RAS wild-type mCRC.

### Efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in 1st-line treatment of older patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: an analysis of the randomised trial FIRE-3 [^116GBiQ6]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In the present investigation of older patients (≥ 65 years) with RAS WT mCRC, there were no significant differences between cetuximab- or bevacizumab-based therapy with regard to ORR, PFS or OS. This result is in clear contrast to younger patients (< 65 years) as well as to the unselected population where FOLFIRI plus cetuximab led to a significantly longer OS when compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. Translating these results into clinical practice would mean that in older patients with RAS WT mCRC there is no favoured targeted therapy, since both anti-EGFR- and anti-VEGF-directed treatment yields comparable results. Due to a major survival advantage (HR 0.67, P = 0.012), there is, however, a strong recommendation to use first-line cetuximab in younger patients.

Primary tumour sidedness is not only an important prognostic factor in metastatic colorectal cancer, but it is also predictive as it affects the response to anti-EGFR-directed therapies. Thus it was shown that cetuximab-based therapy resulted in better outcomes in patients with left- compared to right-sided tumours KRAS wild-type mCRC.

Good evidence exists that patients with right-sided mCRC do either not benefit or even derive a disadvantage from anti-EGFR-directed treatment.

A strong and statistically significant superiority of cetuximab over bevacizumab was specifically shown in patients with left-sided mCRC aged < 65 years. Older patients with left-sided primary tumours treated with cetuximab had a not significantly prolonged OS when compared to bevacizumab. In contrast, in patients with right-sided primaries no benefit from cetuximab was observed independent of age.

Potential limitations of our study include its retrospective nature as well as the limited patient numbers in analysed subgroups. This issue becomes relevant specifically with regard to the subgroup of right-sided cancers, which is notably smaller than left-sided ones.

For the purpose of comparing equally sized groups, the present study elected to choose an age cut-off of 65 years. This had several reasons. Firstly, eligible patients in FIRE-3 were aged 18–75 years so subdivision of the study population at a cut-off of 65 years resulted in nearly equally sized patient cohorts. While patients aged ≥ 65 years clearly do not represent an elderly population per se, there is no widely accepted cut-off that defines the so-called elderly population in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, the present observations must be considered mainly as hypothesis-generating and clearly require confirmation by prospective studies.

### First-line use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer [^117RhWtW]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Several molecular pathways have been shown to play key roles in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). This enhanced understanding of tumor biology has provided the rationale for the design and development of novel agents that are directed against important targets, including growth factors, receptors, and tumor-specific/tumor-selective antigens. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway has received much attention over the past 5–10 years because it is overexpressed in more than 85% of tumors from patients with metastatic CRC. Cetuximab and panitumumab are monoclonal antibodies presently approved for use by the FDA in the refractory disease setting, and they have provided significant advances in the treatment of advanced CRC. However, much focus has shifted toward using these biologic therapies in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in up-front settings, such as first-line therapy and in the neoadjuvant therapy of liver-limited disease. The clinical studies conducted to date suggest that cetuximab can be safely and effectively combined with oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic CRC. Moreover, the results of the CRYSTAL phase III study provide support for the use of the combination of FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan) and cetuximab in the neoadjuvant setting and allow for R0 surgical resection with curative intent. Much work continues to investigate the critical molecular biomarkers that can be used to predict clinical response to chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies as well as to identify which patients might be at increased risk for developing drug-specific side effects.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab for advanced colorectal cancer: final survival and per-protocol analysis of FIRE-3, a randomised clinical trial [^113gzrxP]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The final OS analysis of FIRE-3 confirms the benefit of first-line treatment with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab when compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumours. After a median follow-up of almost 6 years, the observed OS times clearly favoured the cetuximab arm (HR 0.75, P = 0.011 in the per-protocol population). This result is highly consistent with the previously published data from the PEAK study comparing FOLFOX plus panitumumab to FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and is further supported by a meta-analysis of data from the three available head-to-head trials, which also included the CALGB 80405 study. With regard to toxicity, no new or unexpected toxicities were observed, and adverse events of grade 3 or higher were in accordance with previous reports. Due to expected toxicities of cetuximab, such as anaphylactic reactions, the number of patients unevaluable according to the protocol was higher in the cetuximab arm (n = 30) than in the bevacizumab arm (n = 18). Especially skin toxicities have to be discussed with the patient before cetuximab is started to ensure compliance.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab for advanced colorectal cancer: final survival and per-protocol analysis of FIRE-3, a randomised clinical trial [^112EpH2E]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The final update of FIRE-3 confirms the previously reported superiority of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab when compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. Combining a molecular marker (RAS mutational analysis) with a clinical characteristic (tumour sidedness), the patient population most likely to benefit from anti-EGFR strategy can be defined. For patients with left-sided RAS wild-type primaries, this personalised approach promises high tumour-response rates, together with a meaningfully prolonged OS, a doubling of long-term survival rates and overall manageable toxicities.

Background

Median survival of 30 months or more is now achievable for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who receive multimodal treatment as part of a continuum of care incorporating first-line and subsequent therapies.5-Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy combined with a biological agent is recommended as initial therapy for most patients, while selection of the optimum combination and sequencing depends on upfront molecular profiling of the tumour.

The FIRE-3 study (AIO KRK-0306) was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that compared the efficacy of cetuximab and bevacizumab when added to first-line 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type mCRC. During the study, the importance of additional RAS mutations in determining the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors became apparent, with extended RAS mutation testing now mandatory before administering these agents. Accordingly, a RAS wild-type subset of patients in FIRE-3 was identified and corresponds to the currently licensed population for cetuximab. As previously reported, overall survival (OS) was significantly longer with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab when compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, both in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population of patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type disease, and in the final RAS wild-type population.

This report presents a final survival update of FIRE-3 and evaluates the response rate in the per-protocol population, consisting of all patients with RAS wild-type disease who received three or more cycles of therapy and had at least one radiological evaluation post baseline. The effect of primary tumour side on outcomes is also investigated.

### Systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: current options, current evidence [^1137MxEm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Combination chemotherapy regimens including irinotecan and oxaliplatin markedly improve response rate and prolong median survival over fluorouracil with leucovorin (FU/LV), and have supplanted FU/LV as the standard systemic approach for metastatic colorectal cancer. The recent availability of five active chemotherapeutic agents has doubled the median overall survival for metastatic colorectal cancer from 10 to 20 months, and though the optimal strategy for incorporation of all drugs is still unclear, current data support the use of chemotherapy doublets in first-line rather than sequential single-agent therapy. Multidrug regimens increase both response rate and the proportion of patients able to undergo potentially curative resection. In addition, as many as 20% to 30% of patients never receive second-line chemotherapy. When used as single agents, bolus and infusional FU/LV and capecitabine are similarly effective but have differing toxicity. Chemotherapy combinations that incorporate infusion of FU are less toxic and more effective than those using bolus FU dosing. Capecitabine is under study as an alternative dosing method for use in combination regimens; however, the optimal dose has not been defined and final safety and efficacy outcomes are being addressed in ongoing phase II and III investigations. Three combinations have shown excellent first-line efficacy in phase III trials — IFL with bevacizumab, FOLFOX, and FOLFIRI — but neither of these combinations is clearly superior. Sound clinical judgment must continue to guide treatment decisions while we await data regarding the optimal combination and sequence of fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and cetuximab.

### Consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) and first-line efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab in the FIRE3 (AIO KRK-0306) trial [^113rV118]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The personalized approach to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as recommended by national (NCCN, German S3-guideline) and international (ESMO/ESMO ASIA) guidelines is limited to the mutational analyses of RAS (rat sarcoma oncogene) and B-ras associated factor and the analysis of micro-satellite (MSI) status.

Consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) based on gene-expression analysis have gained attention since being published by Guinney et al. Using gene-expression data from six different cohorts, four different types of colorectal cancer have been defined. CMS1 defined by an upregulation of immune genes is highly associated with microsatellite instability (MSI-h). CMS2 reflects the canonical pathway of carcinogenesis as defined by the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Genetically chromosomal instable tumors are associated with mutations in APC, p53, and RAS. Overall, CMS2 represents an over-activated epithelial growth factor pathway with higher expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the EGFR-ligands amphiregulin and epiregulin as far as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression. CMS3 is defined by metabolic dysregulation with higher activity in glutaminolysis and lipidogenesis. Finally, CMS4 is defined by an activated tissue growth factor (TGF)-β pathway and by epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) making it in general more chemo-resistant.

Previous data have been derived for the most from the Union International Contre le Cancer (UICC) stage II and III samples and showed a strong prognostic effect of the four CMS subgroups for both, disease-free survival and overall survival (OS). The prognostic relevance of CMS in UICC stage IV disease has remained uncertain, as well as its possible predictive effect for the use of EGFR antibodies or vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) antibodies.

The aims of these retrospective, exploratory analyses were as follows: (i) Can the prognostic value of the CMS classification be validated in the metastatic setting of CRC? (ii) Is there a predictive value for the use of the CMS classification for either bevacizumab or cetuximab in the treatment of mCRC? (iii) Do RAS mt tumors show a different pattern of CMS distribution when compared with RAS wt tumors? (iv) Are there differences in right- versus left-sided tumors with regard to data on CMS classification?

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^115wCxJX]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Safety

Of the 208 patients in the safety population, 134 (64.4%) experienced at least 1 grade 3 or higher adverse event related or unrelated to study medication during induction chemotherapy (eTable 7 in Supplement 2). Seven patients died during induction therapy from overall worsening of health condition (n = 4), septic shock (n = 2), or myocardial infarction (n = 1).

During the first maintenance therapy, patients in the cetuximab group received a median number of 8 cetuximab cycles (range, 1–47 cetuximab cycles), 50% of patients (33 of 66) experienced at least 1 dose delay, and 16.7% (11 of 66) required at least 1 dose modification. The median relative dose intensity until first progression was 95% (range, 50%-100%). The reasons for cetuximab discontinuation were mainly disease progression (51 of 67 [76.1%]) and investigator decision (7 of 67 [10.4%]), with adverse events being involved in 3 of 67 cases (4.5%).

During the maintenance phase, 30 of 67 patients in the cetuximab group (44.8%) experienced at least 1 grade 3 or higher adverse event related or unrelated to study medication. The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events in the cetuximab group were rash (8 of 67 [11.9%]) and diarrhea (4 of 67 [6.0%]) (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^114FEj57]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Although its primary end point was not met, our study is the first, to our knowledge, that included a randomized anti-EGFR–free group after irinotecan-based doublet induction chemotherapy suggesting a benefit of anti-EGFR maintenance therapy regarding PFS for patients with mCRC. Our results are in line with those of the COIN-Band PANAMAtrials evaluating the efficacy of cetuximab vs observation and of fluorouracil plus panitumumab vs fluorouracil alone, respectively, both after oxaliplatin-based doublet induction chemotherapy.

According to current ESMO guidelines, de-escalation after oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is advocated, but for patients who receive first-line FOLFIRI without targeted therapy, treatment should be continued until disease progression, while the situation of patients treated with FOLFIRI plus targeted therapy is not considered. However, several studies (most of them not including a randomized anti-EGFR–free group) have suggested that maintenance with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination with fluorouracil might be relevant maintenance options after anti-EGFR–based doublet induction chemotherapy. Although the ERMES phase 3 trial did not demonstrate noninferiority of maintenance with cetuximab monotherapy compared with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab until disease progression in terms of PFS, a higher incidence of grade 3 or higher toxic effects (coprimary end point) was reported in the combination group. Therefore, a chemotherapy-free control group may be justified.

In our study, the median PFS from randomization in the cetuximab group was close to that observed in the anti-EGFR monotherapy groups of COIN-B (5.3 and 5.7 months, respectively) but was shorter in the anti-EGFR–free groups of COIN-B and PANAMA (2.0, 3.1, and 8.8 months, respectively). Disease assessment was performed only every 3 months in COIN-B, and maintenance with fluorouracil was used in the control group of PANAMA.

The short PFS observed in the control group is most likely the result of no further maintenance therapy. On the other hand, the lack of further maintenance therapy did not seem to have a clear effect on OS because the treatment group was not found to be significantly associated with OS in the multivariate analysis. If these results are consistent with those of the meta-analysis by Sonbol et al, which did not find significant OS benefit of maintenance therapy with fluoropyrimidine with or without bevacizumab compared with observation, this remains to be elucidated in the case of anti-EGFR–based maintenance treatment.

Methods

Clinical data of the FIRE-3 clinical trial

FIRE-3 is an open-label, randomised phase III trial to compare first-line treatment in KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients (mCRC) with either cetuximab or bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). The protocol and rules of conduct were previously published, (NCT00433927). The trial was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (1996). All translational analyses were approved by the local ethics committee (University of Munich, registry no. 186–15). All patients included in this analysis provided written informed consent. 24% and 34% of the patients had female sex in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and bevacizumab arm, respectively. The sex is reported according to the study protocol, and gender cannot be distinguished retrospectively. The biological sex of patients (i.e. male or female) was assigned by the study doctor of the respective trial centre and reported to the clinical research organisation (CRO). The original intention-to-treat population consisted of 752 patients in total. Primary and secondary endpoints of the FIRE-3 trial, including the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), were expressed as months and defined as stated in the respective articles. The objective response rate (ORR) was evaluated by the RECIST 1.0 criteria.

Next-generation sequencing and genetic alterations in FIRE-3

Primary tumour tissues from 373 patients have been molecularly characterised by next-generation sequencing (NGS) with the FoundationOne® panel (Foundation Medicine, Inc. MA, USA; catalogue number not available), which identified somatic mutations and copy number alterations, i.e. deletions and amplifications, of 277 key cancer genes, microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumour mutational burden. Somatic alterations were delivered in the form of binary matrices, that reflect the mutant or wild-type status of a given gene based on single nucleotide variants (SV), copy number amplifications (AMP) and deletions (DEL). MSI is an important prognostic predictor and enriched in CMS1, which is observed in our study, with 8 of 10 MSI-H tumours being classified as CMS1. However, MSI-H tumours are less prevalent in metastatic disease (~5%). Furthermore, only six and four MSI-H tumours were treated with bevacizumab and cetuximab, respectively.

### Efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in 1st-line treatment of older patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: an analysis of the randomised trial FIRE-3 [^114YWmNZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with right-sided, RAS wild-type tumours < 65 years, the difference between treatment groups lost the level of significance and cetuximab led only numerically to superiority (21.9 vs 16.4, P = 0.31). PFS and ORR were comparable between treatment groups (PFS 7.2 vs 7.2, P = 0.19; 63.6% vs 52.4%, P = 0.71, Table 2).

For patients older than 65 years with left-sided CRC, the increase of median OS in cetuximab- compared to bevacizumab-treated patients was just numerically evident (33.2 vs 27.5 months, HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.6–1.2; P = 0.38, Table 2) and also ORR did not reach level of significance (80.6% vs 70.0%, P = 0.22, Table 2). PFS did not significantly differ between the cetuximab group and the bevacizumab group (Table 2). Importantly, older patients with right-sided primaries did not appear to benefit from cetuximab as compared to bevacizumab with regard to median OS (16.6 months vs 23.6 months, HR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6–1.87; P = 0.87, Fig. 1 b, Table 2). PFS and ORR resembled between treatment groups (PFS 8.0 vs 9.3, P = 0.44; 68.4% vs 57.7%, P = 0.54, Table 2). The median OS outcomes in older patients contrast those in younger patients (OS 21.9 months versus 16.4 months, HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.32–1.44; P = 0.31, Table 2).

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1141gTKg]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is progression-free survival among patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer improved with maintenance therapy with cetuximab?

Findings

In this phase 2 randomized clinical trial of 139 patients receiving maintenance therapy with single-agent cetuximab or no treatment after induction with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, the cetuximab group did not meet the primary end point of improvement in 6-month progression-free rate after randomization. However, meaningful progression-free survival and overall survival benefits in favor of cetuximab maintenance therapy were observed, especially for patients without a tumor-activating mutation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes.

Meaning

This study suggests a benefit of single-agent anti–epidermal growth factor receptor in the maintenance setting, while the putative association of tumor-activating mutations within the MAPK pathway warrants further investigation.

### A systematic review of treatment guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer [^111Zg9XX]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

For second-line therapy, the guidelines from the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network stated that possible treatment options following first progression in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC were FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or panitumumab; cetuximab plus irinotecan; or single-agent cetuximab or panitumumab. Treatment options after second progression in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC included cetuximab plus irinotecan, or single-agent cetuximab or panitumumab. If bevacizumab was used in a first-line regimen, it was not recommended for second or subsequent lines of therapy. Similarly, if cetuximab or panitumumab were used as part of the initial treatment regimen, neither agent was recommended in second or subsequent lines of therapy.

For chemoresistant mCRC, European guidelines also recognized the effectiveness of cetuximab or panitumumab as single agents, or irinotecan plus cetuximab, in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours.

Specific patient populations

The two most recent international treatment guidelines addressed specific patient populations. The guidelines from an international panel of 21 colorectal oncology experts focused on patients with colorectal liver metastases, and stated that FOLFIRI, FOLFOX or XELOX with the addition of cetuximab was a valuable first-line therapy in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC, while FOLFIRI, FOLFOX or XELOX with bevacizumab was valuable in unselected patients.

The task force of the International Society of Geriatric Oncology developed guidelines for the treatment of elderly colorectal cancer patients. It recommended that combination chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab should be the treatment of choice; cetuximab and panitumumab should be used within the context of their licensed indications in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC. These guidelines also considered safety in the elderly patient population, stating that monoclonal antibodies are generally safe; however, bevacizumab, in particular, has a side-effect profile that includes hypertension (the most frequent side-effect), proteinuria, thromboembolic events, bleeding, wound healing complications and bowel perforation. These possible side-effects require careful consideration when treating elderly CRC patients. In particular, arterial thromboembolic events following bevacizumab were more likely to occur in patients over 65 years of age or in those who had a previous history (> 18%) of such events.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of metastatic colorectal cancer: a consensus statement of the hellenic society of medical oncologists (HeSMO) [^1121xbqd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Available chemotherapeutic agents are fluoropyrimidines (5-FU modulated by folinic acid [FA], or XEL), irinotecan and oxaliplatin. XEL can be safely substituted by 5-FU/FA in combination with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and in combination with irinotecan (FOLFIRI), after the necessary dose adjustment of both drugs. However, FOLFIRI should be the preferred option over XELIRI as it is associated with less toxicity from the gastrointestinal tract.

Monoclonal antibodies are the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting bevacizumab and the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab. Anti-EGFR-antibodies have no activity in RAS mutant tumors. The combination of XEL, oxaliplatin with cetuximab, and also panitumumab, seem to have no additional benefit over XEL and oxaliplatin alone and should be avoided at present.

Standard combination chemotherapy regimens comprising 5-FU/LV in combination with either irinotecan, typically FOLFIRI, or oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) have been reported to facilitate the resection of 7–40% of patients with initially unresectable metastases depending upon the initial selection of patients. However, 75–80% of these patients experience cancer relapse within 2 years of resection. Data emerging from randomized trials suggest that the addition of a targeted agent (bevacizumab or cetuximab) or even scarce data of phase II trials on the combination with a third cytotoxic plus or minus a targeted agent, might be even more effective, although concerns about toxicity limit the use of this triplet to highly selected cases. The combination of a chemo-doublet plus cetuximab has led to higher resection rates (although still low in absolute numbers) in patients with liver limited unresectable metastatic RAS wild-type (wt) CRC. The combination of FOLFOX/cetuximab and FOLFIRI/cetuximab has led to similar response rates and resection rates in RAS wt tumors.

### Consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) and first-line efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab in the FIRE3 (AIO KRK-0306) trial [^11573HPm]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

FIRE-3 compared first-line therapy with FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab in 592 KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. The consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) are grouping CRC samples according to their gene-signature in four different subtypes. Relevance of CMS for the treatment of mCRC has yet to be defined.

Patients and Methods

In this exploratory analysis, patients were grouped according to the previously published tumor CRC-CMSs. Objective response rates (ORR) were compared using chi-square test. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times were compared using Kaplan–Meier estimation, log-rank tests. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated according to the Cox proportional hazard method.

Results

CMS classification could be determined in 438 out of 514 specimens available from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 592). Frequencies for the remaining 438 samples were as follows: CMS1 (14%), CMS2 (37%), CMS3 (15%), CMS4 (34%). For the 315 RAS wild-type tumors, frequencies were as follows: CMS1 (12%), CMS2 (41%), CMS3 (11%), CMS4 (34%). CMS distribution in right- versus (vs) left-sided primary tumors was as follows: CMS1 (27% versus 11%), CMS2 (28% versus 45%), CMS3 (10% versus 12%), CMS4 (35% versus 32%). Independent of the treatment, CMS was a strong prognostic factor for ORR (P = 0.051), PFS (P < 0.001), and OS (P < 0.001). Within the RAS wild-type population, OS observed in CMS4 significantly favored FOLFIRI cetuximab over FOLFIRI bevacizumab. In CMS3, OS showed a trend in favor of the cetuximab arm, while OS was comparable in CMS1 and CMS2, independent of targeted therapy.

Conclusions

CMS classification is prognostic for mCRC. Prolonged OS induced by FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the FIRE-3 study appears to be driven by CMS3 and CMS4. CMS classification provides deeper insights into the biology to CRC, but at present time has no direct impact on clinical decision-making.

The FIRE-3 (AIO KRK-0306) study had been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00433927.

### Cost-effectiveness of cetuximab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in the United States [^111fXXwX]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating recent phase III clinical trial (FIRE-3) data to evaluate clinical and economic tradeoffs associated with first-line treatments of KRAS wild-type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Materials and Methods

A cost-effectiveness model was developed using FIRE-3 data to project survival and lifetime costs of FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab. Hypothetical KRAS-WT mCRC patients initiated first-line treatment and could experience adverse events, disease progression warranting second-line treatment, or clinical response and hepatic metastasectomy. Model inputs were derived from FIRE-3 and published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported as US$ per life year (LY) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Scenario analyses considered patients with extended RAS mutations and CALGB/SWOG 80405 data; 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Results

Compared with bevacizumab, KRAS-WT patients receiving first-line cetuximab gained 5.7 months of life at a cost of $46,266, for an ICER of $97,223/LY ($122,610/QALY). For extended RAS-WT patients, the ICER was $77,339/LY ($99,584/QALY). Cetuximab treatment was cost-effective 80.3% of the time, given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/LY. Results were sensitive to changes in survival, treatment duration, and product costs.

Conclusions

Our analysis of FIRE-3 data suggests that first-line treatment with cetuximab and FOLFIRI in KRAS (and extended RAS) WT mCRC patients may improve health outcomes and use financial resources more efficiently than bevacizumab and FOLFIRI. This information, in combination with other studies investigating comparative effectiveness of first-line options, can be useful to clinicians, payers, and policymakers in making treatment and resource allocation decisions for mCRC patients.

Cetuximab and panitumumab in the non–first-line setting: For patients with wild-type KRAS/NRAS/BRAF tumors who progressed on therapies not containing an EGFR inhibitor, cetuximab or panitumumab plus irinotecan, cetuximab or panitumumab plus FOLFIRI, or single-agent cetuximab or panitumumab is recommended.

### Activity and safety of cetuximab plus modified FOLFOXIRI followed by maintenance with cetuximab or bevacizumab for RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase 2 clinical trial [^111FggZx]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The combination of a triple-drug chemotherapy regimen with an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agent as a first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) showed promising activity along with safety concerns in single-arm phase 2 trials. The role of maintenance following chemotherapy and anti-EGFR and the optimal regimen to be adopted are not established.

Objectives

To evaluate the activity and safety of cetuximab plus modified FOLFOXIRI (mFOLFOXIRI) and explore the role of maintenance with cetuximab or bevacizumab in RAS and BRAF wild-type mCRC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a prospective, noncomparative, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial, patients aged 18 to 75 years with unresectable, previously untreated RAS and BRAF wild-type (before amendment, KRAS wild-type) mCRC were recruited from 21 oncology units in Italy from October 19, 2011, to March 1, 2015 (followed up through May 31, 2017). In total, 323 patients were screened and 143 were randomized to 2 treatment arms to receive as a first-line induction a regimen of mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab followed by cetuximab (arm A) or bevacizumab (arm B) until disease progression. Primary analyses were conducted in a modified intention-to-treat population.

Interventions

mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab repeated every 2 weeks for up to 8 cycles, followed by maintenance with cetuximab or bevacizumab until disease progression.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the 10-month progression-free rate (PFR); secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival, response rate, rate of metastases resection, and adverse events.

Results

Of 143 patients randomized, 116 (81.1%) (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 59.5 [53–67] years; 34 [29.3%] women) had RAS and BRAF wild-type mCRC. At a median (IQR) follow-up of 44.0 (30.5–52.1) months, 10-month PFRs were 50.8% (90% CI, 39.5%-62.2%) in arm A and 40.4% (90% CI, 29.4%-52.1%) in arm B. The overall response rate was 71.6% (95% CI, 62.4%-79.5%). Main grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (occurring in 36 patients [31%]), diarrhea (in 21 patients [18%]), skin toxic effects (in 18 patients [16%]), asthenia (in 11 patients [9%]), stomatitis (in 7 patients [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (in 3 patients [3%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Although neither of the 2 arms met the primary end point, the findings indicate that a 4-month induction regimen of mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab is feasible and provides relevant activity results, leading to a high surgical resection rate.

NCCN Colon Cancer — Cetuximab with FOLFIRI (CRYSTAL trial) in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer: Patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI with or without cetuximab. In KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumors, adding cetuximab improved median PFS (9.9 vs. 8.7 months; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50–0.94; p = 0.02) and improved OS (23.5 vs. 20.0 months; p = 0.009). With expanded RAS testing, patients with RAS wild-type tumors derived a clear OS benefit (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54–0.88), whereas those with any RAS mutation did not (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.86–1.28). The addition of cetuximab did not affect the quality of life of participants in the CRYSTAL trial.

### The role of personalized medicine in metastatic colorectal cancer: an evolving landscape [^115TFQ5q]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Advances in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer have led to an improvement in survival from 12 months with fluorouracil monotherapy to approximately 2 years. This is partly as a result of the addition of irinotecan and oxaliplatin, but is also due to the use of monoclonal antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab. However, there are significant molecular differences between tumours which can affect both prognosis and response to treatment. Personalized medicine aims to tailor treatment according to the characteristics of the individual patient and is now a clinical reality as testing for KRAS mutations to guide treatment with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab is now part of routine clinical practice. However, not all patients who are KRAS wild type respond to anti-EGFR therapy and a validated biomarker for antiangiogenic therapy is still lacking. Therefore, other biomarkers are needed to assist with predicting response to both existing drugs as well as to drugs currently under investigation. This review summarizes the molecular biology of colorectal cancer, focusing on the genetic features that are currently most clinically relevant. Current and emerging biomarkers are reviewed along with their roles in selecting patients for targeted treatment with currently licensed therapies and drugs being evaluated in clinical trials. The value of predictive biomarkers of chemosensitivity and potential future treatment strategies are also discussed.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab for advanced colorectal cancer: final survival and per-protocol analysis of FIRE-3, a randomised clinical trial [^115eWrxj]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The per-protocol population of FIRE-3 included only patients who received at least three cycles of study medication and had a second radiologic evaluation after baseline. In this cohort, for which the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR was evaluable according to RECIST, the ORR was significantly higher with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in all patients (77 vs 65%, P = 0.014) and patients with left-sided tumours (79 vs 68%, P = 0.041), but not in the smaller subset of patients with right-sided tumours (67 vs 56%, P = 0.47). This benefit was also supported by a significantly higher rate of patients obtaining early tumour shrinkage (70 vs 50%, P = 0.0004), together with a significantly greater depth of response (50 vs 33%, P < 0.0001). For patients in need of tumour response due to symptomatic tumours or borderline-resectable metastases, anti-EGFR treatment, irrespective of the tumour location, provides the fastest and most extensive tumour response when compared to either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab.– Although PFS was comparable in both treatment arms of FIRE-3, superior ORR in the cetuximab arm was associated with a significantly longer post-progression survival, which probably resulted in the observed differences in OS. Within the trials investigating anti-EGFR treatment vs anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in the first-line treatment of mCRC patients, only the PEAK study showed a significant difference in PFS favouring the anti-EGFR arm. The reasons for this observation are not yet understood. Data with respect to the best sequence strategy in RASwt mCRC are scarce. Several retrospective analyses have shown a favourable outcome for the use of EGFR antibodies followed by bevacizumab than the other way round. Preclinical data suggest an EGFR-independent activation of the MAPK pathway by STAT3 and ERK modulated through VEGFR2 activation by higher VEGF levels. As higher VEGF levels are seen in patients pre-treated with bevacizumab, this effect may contribute to the observed clinical outcome data. In both arms, the number of patients who underwent surgery in curative intent was comparable, so secondary resectability is not the reason for the observed OS difference. The observed OS difference may therefore be attributed to the more pronounced tumour response, reflected by the depth-of-response data, in combination with the more favourable treatment sequence of anti-EGFR treatment followed by anti-VEGF than the other way round.

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^117Nj585]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

TIME was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, noncomparative phase 2 trial conducted from January 15, 2014, to November 23, 2018. Details of the protocol are described in Supplement 1. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed nonresectable mCRC, 1 or more measurable target lesions according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), RAS wild-type status (locally assessed), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less, and adequate organ functions. Key exclusion criteria consisted of any prior chemotherapy except in the adjuvant setting if the last cycle was administered more than 6 months prior to inclusion, brain metastases, and concurrent active malignant neoplasms or clinically relevant comorbidities that could interfere with the conduct of the study or affect outcomes. All participants provided written informed consent before any study-related procedure. The study was conducted in accordance with International Conference for Harmonization guidelines and applicable national laws and regulations, as well as ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki. It was approved by a central ethics committee in April 2013 and by the French Regulatory Authority in May 2013. This article was prepared in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

### Efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in 1st-line treatment of older patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: an analysis of the randomised trial FIRE-3 [^116JQ1Gd]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present analysis of the FIRE-3 trial was performed as a post-hoc analysis of patients with RAS wild-type mCRC grouped in two age cohorts. Two questions were investigated: Firstly, to what extent overall survival depends on age; secondly, which targeted therapy, as an addition to first-line treatment with FOLFIRI, should be preferred in relation to age and sidedness of tumour. In this context, it is relevant to point out that patients included in FIRE-3 were deemed fit for combination chemotherapy plus targeted therapy independent of age. Hence, the comparison of an older versus a younger age group in this study does not necessarily reflect the comparison of a frail versus a fit subgroup of patients.

Comparing different age cohorts in the overall study population of FIRE-3, OS was significantly shorter in the age cohort ≥ 65 years as compared to younger patients. This effect is likely multifactorial. Firstly, it could be attributed to a higher proportion of right-sided tumours in older patients (Table 1). As expected, older patients (≥ 65 years) in FIRE-3 showed a higher proportion of right-sided tumours than younger patients. In accordance with the published literature, right-sided primary tumour location was associated with markedly shorter OS compared to left-sided primary tumour location when considering the overall study population. This effect was observed in the younger as well as in the older patient cohort. Secondly, younger patients showed a trend toward a higher secondary resection rate. Secondary resection is associated with a better OS. To assess, if older patients profit as same as younger patients from secondary resection, OS was compared between younger and older resected patients and showed no difference. So, in the FIRE-3 population, secondary resection in older patients was safely performed and resulted in better OS.

### A systematic review of treatment guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer [^113TgFgr]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently the third most common cancer worldwide. Approximately 20–25% of patients with the disease already have metastases at the time of diagnosis and 50–60% of the remainder will develop metastases. For most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC), treatment is palliative rather than curative. The goals of systemic treatment in these patients are to prolong survival and to maintain quality of life for as long as possible. However, a small proportion of patients with mCRC (e.g. those whose metastases are confined to the liver) can be converted to a potentially curable state through surgical resection of the metastases after systemic therapy. For these patients, the goal of systemic treatment is to shrink the metastases.

A number of different drugs have significant antitumour activity in mCRC, including the systemic drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab, and the oral drug capecitabine. Different combinations of these drugs, such as the FOLFOX regimen (leucovorin, 5-FU and oxaliplatin), the FOLFIRI regimen (leucovorin, 5-FU and irinotecan) and the XELOX regimen (oxaliplatin and capecitabine), with or without a monoclonal antibody agent, have been shown to improve outcomes in mCRC.

### A systematic review of treatment guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer [^114obGuX]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

For example, in the phase III PRIME trial, panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX4 significantly improved progression-free survival compared with FOLFOX4 alone in the first-line treatment of KRAS wild-type mCRC. Another phase III trial demonstrated that panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI significantly improved progression-free survival compared with FOLFIRI alone in the second-line treatment of wild-type KRAS mCRC. Furthermore, panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy has also consistently demonstrated a trend in overall survival improvement, although not statistically significant, in both the first-line and second-line treatment of patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC.

Similarly, a recent trial of first-line treatment with cetuximab in combination with FOLFIRI showed that such treatment reduced the risk of disease progression compared with FOLFIRI alone in patients with KRAS wild-type tumours. Another trial of first-line treatment in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC showed that a combination of cetuximab and FOLFOX4 increased the likelihood of a response and was associated with a lower risk of disease progression than treatment with FOLFOX4 alone.

It is also worth noting that the recent international, European and US treatment guidelines recommend FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, with some also including XELOX, as the main chemotherapy choice or as the chemotherapy backbones for combining with monoclonal antibodies in the early-line treatment of mCRC. Finally, these guidelines discourage using the same monoclonal antibody in subsequent lines of therapy. Specifically, if bevacizumab is used in a first-line regimen, it is not recommended for second or subsequent lines of therapy; similarly, if cetuximab or panitumumab is used as part of the initial treatment regimen, neither agent is recommended for second or subsequent lines of therapy.

A large proportion of the guidelines identified in this review were retrieved by manual searching, including a search of grey literature on the Internet (25/57; 44%). Possible reasons for the manual identification of such a large proportion of relevant papers include the fact that the searching of electronic databases relies on the correct indexing of papers and the use of appropriate key words in the titles/abstracts of papers. Since guidelines, expert consensus statements and recommendations do not always fulfil these criteria, they can prove difficult to retrieve from an electronic search. In addition, organizations often publish guidelines on the Internet rather than in journals, so the guidelines can only be retrieved through grey literature searches.

### BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer between past and future [^111tmtek]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Second, results from FIRE-3 trial, comparing first-line FOLFIRI plus cetuximab with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab were not included in the metanalysis by Rowland et al. In their discussion, authors elegantly argue that FIRE-3 is not sufficiently comparable to the other included trials, as bevacizumab use in the control arm is associated with a significant benefit, as compared with chemotherapy alone. We totally agree with that observation, but, again, by a practical perspective it should be recognised that first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab is one of the most common choices worldwide. From a clinical point of view, the decision of adding an anti-EGFR mAb to chemotherapy in patients with BRAF mutation, based on the absence of interaction between BRAF status and treatment efficacy, would be totally reasonable in the absence of therapeutic alternatives. Given that an alternative is actually available, the use of an anti-EGFR mAb, instead of bevacizumab, should be probably reserved to those patients who may actually derive benefit from these drugs, with a different and often less acceptable toxicity profile. To this purpose, the metanalysis by the same authors highlighting the role of panRAS mutations as predictors of resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs, also including results from FIRE-3, is of special interest. Unfortunately, results in the RAS WT/ BRAF WT subgroup of the FIRE-3 trial have not been provided yet, thus preventing from including this trial in the present analysis. As information about BRAF mutational status is also lacking from the other head-to-head randomized trials PEAK and CALGB80409, we recognise that the question about the 'best' biologic agent to be combined with a first-line chemotherapy doublet in BRAF mutant individuals is far from being answered.

### Efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in 1st-line treatment of older patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: an analysis of the randomised trial FIRE-3 [^1133ALgY]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the study population according to targeted therapy demonstrated that significantly shorter survival in older versus younger patients was observed only in the cetuximab arm (HR 1.5, P < 0.01), but not in bevacizumab-treated patients (HR 1.1, P = 0.53) of FIRE-3. This finding may point to an age-related effect of anti-EGFR directed therapy. It has not been reported previously and thus needs confirmation. A similar observation was made by Garcia-Alfonso et al. 2021 but in the meta-analysis, factors like worse ECOG and a lower percentage of active treatment after first-line therapy have contributed to the shorter OS of older patients. In the present analysis, there were no differences in ECOG or lower percentage of second or third-line therapy but older patients treated with cetuximab had a lower secondary resection rate compared to older patients treated with bevacizumab (Table 3).

Previous reports have demonstrated that combination chemotherapy may improve PFS and OS in younger as well as in older patients. In the present study, combination chemotherapy was used as a backbone treatment with the expectation that tolerability and efficacy would be acceptable and comparable through different age groups. The present evaluation asks the question if this assumption also holds for targeted therapy with specific regard to anti-EGFR- versus anti-VEGF-directed therapy.

Previous studies support the notion that the addition of bevacizumab to FP significantly improved PFS in older patients, while the effect on OS remains less clear. There is less evidence on cetuximab-based combination therapy in first-line treatment of older mCRC patients. A combination of cetuximab with single-agent chemotherapy was shown to be more effective in KRAS WT mCRC patients. In addition, non-interventional and retrospective investigations revealed the efficacy of cetuximab plus irinotecan in older patients with pre-treated KRAS WT mCRC and had a similar safety profile compared to younger patients. However, in the PRIME study, the addition of Panitumumab to first-line treatment with FOLFOX-4 showed OS benefit in the cohort of RAS wild-type patients < 65 years but not for older patients.

Safety and tolerability

Adverse events have been reported in detail for the ITT population. The safety population for this analysis consisted of all 400 patients with RAS wild-type tumours. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in all but two patients; these were grade 3 or higher in 127 (64%) of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and 103 (51%) of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab recipients. Overall, 46 (12%) of patients were withdrawn due to treatment-related adverse events (15% in the cetuximab arm and 8% in the bevacizumab arm). Adverse events were consistent with the known toxicity profiles of each agent (see Supplementary Table S3).

Serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study medication occurred in 33 (17%) of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and 38 (19%) of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab recipients. Five deaths associated with SAEs were recorded in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group, including three deaths (1.5%) that were considered treatment-related. There were no deaths from adverse events in the cetuximab group.

Efficacy in the RAS wild-type population

The median follow-up in the overall RAS wild-type population was 71 months (95% CI, 66–77) and 76 months (95% CI, 66 to not reached) in the cetuximab and bevacizumab groups, respectively. At the time of analysis, 82% of patients in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab arm and 90% of patients in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab arm had died. OS was significantly better in the cetuximab group vs the bevacizumab group (P = 0.012), with estimated 3-year and 5-year survival rates of 43 vs 33% and 18 vs 9%, respectively (Fig. 1). Median OS was 31 months (95% CI, 25–36) in the cetuximab group and 26 months (95% CI, 23–29) in the bevacizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI, 0.62–0.94) (Supplementary Table S4). This survival benefit was limited to patients with left-sided primary tumours (n = 307, HR 0.70, P = 0.004), with no significant difference between groups in patients with right-sided primary tumours (n = 88, HR 1.27, P = 0.29) (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S2).

### Role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer [^1176e1Xn]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common health problem in Western countries. In advanced disease, either FOLFOX (oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil [5-FU]/leucovorin [LV]) or FOLFIRI (irinotecan/LV/5-FU) are accepted first-line chemotherapy regimens, but median survival appears to plateau with a chemotherapy-only approach. The use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeting monoclonal antibodies has increased the median survival of patients with advanced CRC beyond 20 months. However, the precise role of cetuximab, panitumumab and bevacizumab in combination with different chemotherapeutic regimens is still being determined in first- and second-line settings. The activity and tolerance of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib erlotinib, and EKB-569, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have been explored in patients with metastatic CRC. Regarding VEGF receptor TKIs, 2 phase III clinical trials determined the role of vatalanib in combination with FOLFOX. Efficacy of the oral multitargeted TKIs sorafenib and sunitinib is under investigation. This article aims to review the role of TKIs in advanced CRC.

### The oncology biomarker discovery framework reveals cetuximab and bevacizumab response patterns in metastatic colorectal cancer [^113D5bgD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Precision medicine has revolutionised cancer treatments; however, actionable biomarkers remain scarce. To address this, we develop the Oncology Biomarker Discovery (OncoBird) framework for analysing the molecular and biomarker landscape of randomised controlled clinical trials. OncoBird identifies biomarkers based on single genes or mutually exclusive genetic alterations in isolation or in the context of tumour subtypes, and finally, assesses predictive components by their treatment interactions. Here, we utilise the open-label, randomised phase III trial (FIRE-3, AIO KRK-0306) in metastatic colorectal carcinoma patients, who received either cetuximab or bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). We systematically identify five biomarkers with predictive components, e.g., patients with tumours that carry chr20q amplifications or lack mutually exclusive ERK signalling mutations benefited from cetuximab compared to bevacizumab. In summary, OncoBird characterises the molecular landscape and outlines actionable biomarkers, which generalises to any molecularly characterised randomised controlled trial.

In conclusion, the study did not meet the primary end point. Thus, treatment with FOLFIRI plus Cet should be continued until disease progression or patient tolerance is achieved. However, given the better safety profile, RR, and signal on OS, a de-escalation strategy may remain an option in selected cases owing to patient preference or tolerability. Preplanned translational analyses are ongoing, and results are expected to improve the selection of patients who would benefit the most from treatment de-escalation.

Results

Disposition of the RAS wild-type and per-protocol populations

Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the disposition of patients in the RAS wild-type and per-protocol populations. Of 400 patients in the RAS wild-type population, 48 were not evaluable for response: 29 received fewer than 3 cycles of chemotherapy (see below) and 19 had no post-baseline radiographic evaluation available. The remaining 352 (88%) patients constituted the per-protocol population, including 169 who received FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and 183 who received FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab.

The proportion of patients excluded from the per-protocol analysis was higher in the cetuximab group (30/199, 15%) compared with the bevacizumab group (18/201, 9%). Supplementary Table S1 summarises the reasons for exclusion: most commonly, allergic reaction (nine patients in the cetuximab group vs zero in the bevacizumab group), patient decision (four in each group), early death and thromboembolic event or bleeding (both recorded for one and four patients in the cetuximab and bevacizumab groups, respectively).

Patient characteristics were highly similar in the RAS wild-type and per-protocol populations and were generally comparable between the two treatment arms at baseline (Supplementary Table S2). Patients were aged 31–76 years, with a median age of 64–65 years in each treatment arm. The proportion of females in the per-protocol population was 24% in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab arm and 34% in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab arm. Most patients had left-sided primary tumours; in the per-protocol population, 18% of patients in the cetuximab arm and 25% in the bevacizumab arm had right-sided primary tumours.

### Zebrafish avatar-test forecasts clinical response to chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer [^115dXT1Y]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although most surgeries have a curative intent, circulating tumor cells or undetectable micrometastases can be present after surgery. Thus, patients with high-risk factors for metastatic disease have been shown to greatly benefit from post-surgical systemic therapies to reduce the likelihood of relapse and disease progression. A combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with folinic acid and either irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard systemic chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic CRC (mCRC). These regimens are generally considered interchangeable and variations of these combinations exist when introducing orally active FU-like drugs, such as capecitabine: CAPOX (capecitabine+oxaliplatin), and CAPIRI (capecitabine+irinotecan). In the last 15 years, monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab or bevacizumab, have also been included in first-line chemotherapy regimens –.

Randomized clinical trials have shown that FOLFOX and FOLFIRI are equivalent options for advanced CRC treatment, with similar average response rates (RR) ranging from 34 to 55%. This means that approximately 45 to 66% of patients do not respond to treatment. For instance, if patients start with FOLFOX as first-line and do not respond to treatment, they can switch to FOLFIRI, and vice versa. Consequently, many patients suffer unnecessary side effects and lose valuable time.

This issue extends beyond CRC to many other types of cancers, where several "equivalent" treatment options are available in the guidelines but lack a reliable predictive test to forecast the outcome and aid the clinical-decision process. With exception of some success cases, current cancer molecular and genetic biomarkers have proven insufficient when it comes to reliably predicting treatment outcomes. It has been shown that even genetically identical CRC cells may have differential response to therapy, implying that the basis for therapy response is not only genetic. Many cancer patients do not benefit from genomic precision medicine due to a combination of factors, including the absence of targetable mutations, the lack of effective drugs for specific promising targets and also the possible genetic interactions that may occur between different tumor subclones or with the tumor microenvironment. Thus, a combination of molecular-profiling precision medicine together with a functional test, where tumor cells are directly challenged with the elected therapies, is fundamental for a more accurate personalized medicine.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortalities. It is the most common cause of malignancy-related death in men age 20–49 years. Stage is the pivotal predictor of survival in CRC, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 14% for metastatic disease. Systemic chemotherapy is still the mainstay of treatment for mismatch repair proficient stage IV disease. For patients not showing symptom progression on first-line chemotherapy, maintenance therapy should be considered. Maintenance therapy is a strategy based on de-escalation of drug intensity aimed at reducing side effects and improving patients' quality of life (QoL) without jeopardizing efficacy. Fluoropyrimidine monotherapy, or in combination with bevacizumab, - is the preferred maintenance option after induction with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Instead, maintenance treatment after anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–based first-line therapy is controversial. Indeed, there are no phase III data supporting this strategy, while evidence relies only on phase II trials. - According to the ESMO guidelines, owing to the absence of cumulative side effects, first-line treatment with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) may be continued until disease progression. Major tumor shrinkage is seen within the first 3–4 months of treatment, so continued exposure to combined antineoplastic therapy might not improve disease control but rather cause more side effects in addition to the inevitable progression of the disease. ERMES was a phase III trial designed to test whether maintenance therapy with cetuximab (Cet) monotherapy after induction with first-line FOLFIRI plus Cet might represent a valid option in the continuum of care of patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Subgroup analysis for primary end point confirmed a better performance of the standard arm for all subgroups. Notably, a statistically significant positive quantitative interaction was observed for primary tumor location. In fact, patients with right-sided tumors presented a benefit from continuing FOLFIRI plus Cet until disease progression. This observation should be interpreted with caution because of the exploratory nature of this subset analysis and may require further validation.

Although noninferiority for PFS was not reached, the toxicity profile was clinically better in the experimental arm with Cet monotherapy compared with the standard arm. Indeed, after eight cycles of induction, a numerical reduction in G3–4 AEs was observed for all toxicities of clinical interest in the experimental arm compared with the standard arm. According to the statistical design, statistical analysis of the safety coprimary end point could not be performed since the primary end point was not achieved.

### A systematic review of treatment guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer [^112jNfw9]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Line of therapy

Overall (2007–2010), 16 guidelines gave guidance on or discussed targeted therapies. Of these, seven included guidance or discussion on all three approved monoclonal antibodies and six included either bevacizumab only, or cetuximab only, or bevacizumab and cetuximab.

When the recommendations for targeted therapy from international, European and US guidelines were grouped according to line of therapy and date of publication, a clear pattern was seen (Table 4). For first-line therapy, recommendations started in 2006 for combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Cetuximab did not appear in recommendations until 2009, when it was recommended for use in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours.

Table 4
Summary of recommendations for targeted therapy from international, European and US guidelines according to line of therapy.

The most recent European guidelines from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recognized the roles of bevacizumab and cetuximab (wild-type KRAS mCRC only) in the first-line treatment of mCRC, as well as cetuximab and panitumumab monotherapy in patients with chemo-refractory and wild-type KRAS mCRC (Table 4; Glimelius and Oliveira 2009, Van Cutsem and Oliveira 2009). The most recent US guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recognized the role of all three monoclonal antibodies in the early-line treatment of mCRC. These guidelines recommended that initial therapy for mCRC should consist of FOLFOX, CapeOX, FOLFIRI, 5-FU/leucovorin, FOLFOXIRI or capecitabine, with bevacizumab, cetuximab or panitumumab being added to FOLFIRI or FOLFOX (wild-type KRAS mCRC only for cetuximab and panitumumab), and bevacizumab being added to CapeOX, 5-FU/leucovorin or capecitabine.

### A review of the evolution of systemic chemotherapy in the management of colorectal cancer [^112PMMaz]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Herein we present a historical review of the development of systemic chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the metastatic and adjuvant treatment settings. We describe the discovery of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by Heidelberger and colleagues in 1957, the potentiation of 5-FU cytotoxicity by the reduced folate leucovorin, and the advent of novel cytotoxic agents, including the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan, the platinum-containing agent oxaliplatin, and the 5-FU prodrug capecitabine. The combination therapies, FOLFOX (5-FU/leucovorin and oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (5-FU/leucovorin and irinotecan), have become established as efficacious cytotoxic regimens for the treatment of metastatic CRC, resulting in overall survival times of approximately 2 years. When used as adjuvant therapy, FOLFOX also improves survival and is now the gold standard of care in this setting. Biological agents have been discovered that enhance the effect of cytotoxic therapy, including bevacizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor, a central regulator of angiogenesis) and cetuximab/panitumumab (monoclonal antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor). Despite the ongoing development of novel antitumor agents and therapeutic principles as we enter the era of personalized cancer medicine, systemic chemotherapy involving infusional 5-FU/leucovorin continues to be the cornerstone of treatment for patients with CRC.

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^116xGyng]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Although this randomized clinical trial did not meet its primary end point, maintenance cetuximab after induction FOLFIRI plus cetuximab appeared feasible and was associated with longer PFS, OS, and chemotherapy-free intervals than observation. Our exploratory multivariate analysis including molecular alterations suggests that patients with right-sided primary tumors and/or any tumor-activating mutation in MAPK pathway genes may not benefit from maintenance treatment with cetuximab nor treatment breaks after first-line FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. Further studies will need to better clarify subgroups of patients who will benefit or not benefit from maintenance with anti-EGFR antibodies and to define the most appropriate maintenance regimens according to the tumors' molecular characteristics.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab for advanced colorectal cancer: final survival and per-protocol analysis of FIRE-3, a randomised clinical trial [^113pWP2M]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Details of the FIRE-3 study design, patient-eligibility criteria, randomisation and treatment have been reported previously, and the trial protocol is available in Supplementary information 1. The trial was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with ethics committee approval from all participating centres, and written informed consent from all patients. Patients recruited during 2007–2012 at 110 German and six Austrian centres were centrally randomised in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, number of metastatic sites, white blood cell count and alkaline phosphatase levels. Randomisation of 568 patients was calculated to provide a power of 80% to detect a response rate of 62 vs 50% in favour of the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab arm with a one-sided Fisher's exact test significance level of 2.5%.

RAS mutation status

In October 2008, the protocol was amended to restrict entry to patients without KRAS exon 2 mutations. Of 752 patients who provided informed consent, 593 had KRAS exon 2 wild-type disease and began treatment; this was defined as the ITT population. In a post hoc analysis, extended RAS testing was successfully performed in tumour samples from 475 patients to determine mutation status in KRAS and NRAS exons 2–4. The extended RAS sequencing was performed in a certified, quality-assured laboratory (Institute of Pathology, LMU, Munich) and identified 400 patients with no mutations in the RAS genes tested; this was defined as the RAS wild-type population.

### Efficacy and tolerability of first-line cetuximab plus leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) versus FOLFOX-4 in patients withWild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: the open-label, randomized, phase III TAILOR trial [^1167YCik]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Oxaliplatin and Cetuximab in First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (OPUS) was a randomized phase II trial comparing cetuximab plus leucovorin, FU, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) versus FOLFOX alone in the first-line treatment of patients with mCRC. - Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX significantly improved the ORR and PFS in patients with KRAS exon 2 wt tumors. Although limited by a small number of patients, retrospective analysis of the population with RAS wt tumors suggested a significant ORR benefit from the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX and numerically increased PFS and OS. However, this has never been confirmed in a phase III setting.

Controversy persists regarding cetuximab plus FOLFOX combinations based on limited data obtained from the Continuous Chemotherapy Plus Cetuximab or Intermittent Chemotherapy (COIN) and FLOX Plus Cetuximab for Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer and Wild Type K-RAS Tumor (NORDIC VII) trials. However, previous reports have demonstrated that the unexpected lack of efficacy of adding cetuximab to non-FOLFOX, oxaliplatin-containing combinations in COIN and NORDIC VII may be attributable to the use of a nonstandard (noninfusional) bolus or oral fluoropyrimidine–containing chemotherapy regimens in combination with cetuximab rather than any issues with the oxaliplatin plus cetuximab combination. Indeed, the randomized phase III Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80405 study, Cetuximab and/or Bevacizumab Combined With Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, has suggested that cetuximab can be effectively combined with FOLFOX in patients with RAS wt mCRC; admittedly, this trial included bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, a comparator arm not available in China at the time the TAILOR trial was initiated. Additional support for cetuximab plus FOLFOX is provided by the Cetuximab in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Non-Resectable Colorectal Liver Metastases (CELIM), Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of FOLFIRI Plus Cetuximab or FOLFOX Plus Cetuximab as First-line Therapy in Subjects With KRAS Wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (APEC) -; randomized phase III trials investigating the consequences of adding cetuximab to FOLFOX are lacking.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (FIRE-3): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial [^1151N7NM]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Cetuximab and bevacizumab have both been shown to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when added to chemotherapy regimens; however, their comparative effectiveness when partnered with first-line fluorouracil, folinic acid, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) is unknown. We aimed to compare these agents in patients with KRAS (exon 2) codon 12/13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.

Methods

In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18–75 years with stage IV, histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2, an estimated life expectancy of greater than 3 months, and adequate organ function, from centres in Germany and Austria. Patients were centrally randomised by fax (1:1) to FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (using permuted blocks of randomly varying size), stratified according to ECOG performance status, number of metastatic sites, white blood cell count, and alkaline phosphatase concentration. The primary endpoint was objective response analysed by intention to treat. The study has completed recruitment, but follow-up of participants is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433927.

Findings

Between Jan 23, 2007, and Sept 19, 2012, 592 patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type tumours were randomly assigned and received treatment (297 in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab group and 295 in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group). 184 (62·0%, 95% CI 56·2–67·5) patients in the cetuximab group achieved an objective response compared with 171 (58·0%, 52·1–63·7) in the bevacizumab group (odds ratio 1·18, 95% CI 0·85–1·64; p = 0·18). Median progression-free survival was 10·0 months (95% CI 8·8–10·8) in the cetuximab group and 10·3 months (9·8–11·3) in the bevacizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·88–1·26; p = 0·55); however, median overall survival was 28·7 months (95% CI 24·0–36·6) in the cetuximab group compared with 25·0 months (22·7–27·6) in the bevacizumab group (HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·62–0·96; p = 0·017). Safety profiles were consistent with the known side-effects of the study drugs. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in both treatment groups were haematotoxicity (73 [25%] of 297 patients in the cetuximab group vs 62 [21%] of 295 patients in the bevacizumab group), skin reactions (77 [26%] vs six [2%]), and diarrhoea (34 [11%] vs 40 [14%]).

Interpretation

Although the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response did not significantly differ between the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab groups, the association with longer overall survival suggests that FOLFIRI plus cetuximab could be the preferred first-line regimen for patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.

### Management of advanced colorectal cancer: state of the art [^114wJ8Ey]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The use of irinotecan or oxaliplatin in combination with 5-FU/FA first-line is consistently associated with a clinically significant improvement in survival. If oxaliplatin is used more widely in the adjuvant setting, as seems likely given the data from recent trials, the use of irinotecan as first-line therapy is likely to increase in the future. The use of three cytotoxic drugs (irinotecan, oxaliplatin and 5-FU/FA) during the course of a patient's treatment has been shown to maximise survival.

The selection of the optimum treatment regimen for CRC remains difficult, with a number of effective choices available to patients and clinicians (Figure 2). The number of such alternatives is likely to increase over the coming years. Currently, the optimum first-line approach is to use either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI combined with a biological agent such as bevacizumab. The alternative regimen can thereafter be used as second-line treatment, again combined with a different biological agent, such as cetuximab. Although maybe not yet seen as an optimal marketing strategy by the pharmaceutical sector, as our knowledge of predictive tumour markers increases and as a more diverse range of targeted drugs becomes available, further dramatic progress in our ability to treat advanced CRC could lie in a more individualised and scientific process of treatment selection for the patient.

### Efficacy and tolerability of first-line cetuximab plus leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) versus FOLFOX-4 in patients withWild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: the open-label, randomized, phase III TAILOR trial [^114KBa8L]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Our observations suggest that adding cetuximab to FOLFOX-4 seems to benefit patients regardless of whether their tumors express EGFR, consistent with prior reports,- as well as the current European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

In the small subgroup of patients with BRAF mutations, a negative treatment effect is suggested, which is not in line with other reports, - where some benefit was described with the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy or best supportive care in patients with BRAF -mutant mCRC. Contradictory conclusions were also drawn from two meta-analyses investigating the effects of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in BRAF -mutant mCRC. Whereas Rowland et alconcluded that there is insufficient evidence to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR therapy for patients with RAS wt/ BRAF -mutant mCRC, Pietrantonio et aldiscouraged the use of these therapies in these patients. The adverse finding in the TAILOR trial might be related to nonbalanced baseline characteristics in this subgroup. However, it was clearly shown that patients with BRAF wt tumors derive a higher treatment benefit than patients with BRAF -mutated tumors, as suggested by current European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, in which doublet chemotherapies with a biologic are no longer recommended for this subgroup. Current recommendations for patients with BRAF -mutant tumors include rather toxic triplet chemotherapy, but as suggested by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 1406 trial (identifier: NCT02164916)and currently being investigated in the Study of Encorafenib + Cetuximab Plus or Minus Binimetinib v Irinotecan/Cetuximab or Infusional 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/Folinic Acid (FA)/Irinotecan (FOLFIRI)/Cetuximab With a Safety Lead-in of Encorafenib + Binimetinib + Cetuximab in Patients With BRAF V600E-mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (BEACON) trial (identifier: NCT02928224), combinations including cetuximab and a BRAF inhibitor might be the future for this currently underserved population. In addition, the FIRE-4.5 study (European Union Clinical Trials Register: AIO KRK-0116) is investigating first-line cetuximab plus FOLFOX and irinotecan versus bevacizumab plus FOLFOX and irinotecan in patients with BRAF -mutant mCRC.

### Sequencing of antiangiogenic agents in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer [^112v5eii]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Significant advances have been made with respect to our understanding of the critical role of agents targeting angiogenic pathways in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The approval of 3 agents that target angiogenic signaling, bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, and regorafenib, provides strong evidence that angiogenesis is an important process in mCRC. The addition of bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy in the first- and second-line treatment of mCRC has resulted in meaningful improvement in overall and progression-free survival. The standard of care for mCRC has evolved to incorporate cytotoxic chemotherapy as the backbone regimens (eg, FOLFOX [folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin], FOLFIRI [folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan]) with or without bevacizumab, and epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapies (eg, cetuximab, panitumumab) in the setting of wild-type KRAS. The development of ziv-aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI has improved clinical efficacy in the second-line treatment of mCRC. Regorafenib, a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor, has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as single-agent therapy in the treatment of refractory and progressive mCRC. Each of these agents has been integrated into an evidence-based-albeit, still evolving-treatment continuum for initial treatment, treatment after first progression, and treatment after second progression. However, the most effective strategy for the use of these agents, and others in development remains unclear. This review provides an overview of the current clinical evidence for the use of antiangiogenic agents targeting in the treatment of mCRC.

### Effect of first-line chemotherapy combined with cetuximab or bevacizumab on overall survival in patients with KRAS wild-type advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^115h2Jh2]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Combining biologic monoclonal antibodies with chemotherapeutic cytotoxic drugs provides clinical benefit to patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, but the optimal choice of the initial biologic therapy in previously untreated patients is unknown.

Objective

To determine if the addition of cetuximab vs bevacizumab to the combination of leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) regimen or the combination of leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen is superior as first-line therapy in advanced or metastatic KRAS wild-type (wt) colorectal cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Patients (≥ 18 years) enrolled at community and academic centers throughout the National Clinical Trials Network in the United States and Canada (November 2005-March 2012) with previously untreated advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors were KRAS wt chose to take either the mFOLFOX6 regimen or the FOLFIRI regimen as chemotherapy and were randomized to receive either cetuximab (n = 578) or bevacizumab (n = 559). The last date of follow-up was December 15, 2015.

Interventions

Cetuximab vs bevacizumab combined with either mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen chosen by the treating physician and patient.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival and overall response rate, site-reported confirmed or unconfirmed complete or partial response.

Results

Among 1137 patients (median age, 59 years; 440 [39%] women), 1074 (94%) of patients met eligibility criteria. As of December 15, 2015, median follow-up for 263 surviving patients was 47.4 months (range, 0–110.7 months), and 82% of patients (938 of 1137) experienced disease progression. The median overall survival was 30.0 months in the cetuximab-chemotherapy group and 29.0 months in the bevacizumab-chemotherapy group with a stratified hazard ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77–1.01; p = 0.08). The median progression-free survival was 10.5 months in the cetuximab-chemotherapy group and 10.6 months in the bevacizumab-chemotherapy group with a stratified HR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.84–1.08; p = 0.45). Response rates were not significantly different, 59.6% vs 55.2% for cetuximab and bevacizumab, respectively (difference, 4.4%, 95% CI, 1.0%-9.0%, P = 0.13).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with KRAS wt untreated advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the addition of cetuximab vs bevacizumab to chemotherapy as initial biologic treatment.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of metastatic colorectal cancer: a consensus statement of the hellenic society of medical oncologists (HeSMO) [^1144LJRA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

46 Aggressive treatment regiments are FOLFOXIRI (LOE II; SOR C), FOLFIRI (LOE I; SOR B) and FOLFOX (LOE I; SOR B) and could be used alone or with the addition of anti-EGFR antibodies (RAS wt) or bevacizumab (LOE II, SOR B) (ROVC: 100%)
47 Duration of induction treatment may exceed 6 months, in case of favorable response (LOE II; SOR B) (ROVC: 84%)
48 RAS mutation precludes patients from treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies at the preoperative settings (LOE II, SOR B) (ROVC: 100%)
49 Alternative regimes, in patients with progressive metastatic disease are mXELIRI ± bevacizumab or cetuximab (RAS wt) (LOE II; SOR C), or FOLFOX + panitumumab/cetuximab (RAS wt) (LOE II; SOR B) (ROVC: 100%)
50 For RAS wt tumors, induction treatment with FOLFIRI + cetuximab or FOLFOX + anti-EGFR antibodies appears to be more effective in terms of major tumor shrinkage and secondary resectability, than bevacizumab based combinations, for which less data are available (LOE II; SOR B) (ROVC: 89%)
51 FOLFOXIRI should be considered as a treatment option especially for patients with RAS mutant tumors (LOE II; SOR C) (ROVC: 96%)
52 For palliation: i) fluoropyrimidine ± bevacizumab (sequential treatment) (LOE II; SOR B); or ii) doublets chemotherapy (LOE I; SOR A); or iii) doublets chemotherapy + anti-EGFR (RAS wt) (LOE II; SOR B) can be given (ROVC: 100%)

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^116brwJm]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary end point was the 6-month progression-free rate (PFR) from the start of maintenance therapy, defined as the percentage of patients alive without documented progression 6 months after randomization. Secondary end points included the objective response rate after induction chemotherapy, during maintenance, and after rechallenge with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab; median OS and PFS in the overall and randomized populations; and time to first-line strategy failure (defined as the time between randomization and progression during reintroduced FOLFIRI plus cetuximab) or first-line strategy discontinuation due to toxic effects, patient choice, or death.

Study Populations

Intention-to-treat (ITT) populations comprised all included patients (ITT1), all randomized patients (ITT2), and ITT2 patients with proven RAS and BRAF V600 (OMIM) wild-type after centrally assessed molecular validation (ITT3). The safety population comprised all patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatments, analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab for advanced colorectal cancer: final survival and per-protocol analysis of FIRE-3, a randomised clinical trial [^115wnB7J]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cetuximab plus FOLFIRI improved overall survival compared with bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in FIRE-3, but no corresponding benefit was found for progression-free survival. This analysis aimed to determine whether cetuximab improves response and survival versus bevacizumab among response-evaluable patients receiving first-line FOLFIRI for RAS wild-type mCRC and the effect of primary tumour side on outcomes.

Methods

The intent-to-treat population included 593 patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type mCRC. Further testing identified 400 patients with extended RAS wild-type disease; of these, 352 (88%) who received ≥ 3 cycles of therapy and had ≥ 1 post-baseline scan were evaluable for response and constituted the per-protocol population (169 cetuximab and 183 bevacizumab). Patients received 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) with either weekly cetuximab or biweekly bevacizumab given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle until response, progression or toxicity occurred. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) in the per-protocol population. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The effect of primary tumour location was evaluated.

Results

Median OS in the RAS wild-type population was 31 vs 26 months in the cetuximab and bevacizumab groups, respectively (HR 0.76, P = 0.012). In the per-protocol population, outcomes favoured cetuximab for ORR (77% vs 65%, P = 0.014) and median OS (33 vs 26 months, HR 0.75, P = 0.011), while PFS was comparable between groups. The advantage of cetuximab over bevacizumab occurred only in patients with left-sided primary tumours.

Conclusions

FOLFIRI plus cetuximab resulted in a significantly higher ORR and longer OS compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab among patients with left-sided tumours. The superior response associated with cetuximab may particularly benefit patients with symptomatic tumours or borderline-resectable metastases. CLINICALTRIALS.

### Consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) and first-line efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab in the FIRE3 (AIO KRK-0306) trial [^114QYv4K]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

FIRE-3 compared first-line therapy with FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab in 592 KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. The consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) are grouping CRC samples according to their gene-signature in four different subtypes. Relevance of CMS for the treatment of mCRC has yet to be defined.

Patients and Methods

In this exploratory analysis, patients were grouped according to the previously published tumor CRC-CMSs. Objective response rates (ORR) were compared using chi-square test. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimation, log-rank tests. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated according to the Cox proportional hazard method.

Results

CMS classification could be determined in 438 out of 514 specimens available from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 592). Frequencies for the remaining 438 samples were as follows: CMS1 (14%), CMS2 (37%), CMS3 (15%), CMS4 (34%). For the 315 RAS wild-type tumors, frequencies were as follows: CMS1 (12%), CMS2 (41%), CMS3 (11%), CMS4 (34%). CMS distribution in right- versus (vs) left-sided primary tumors was as follows: CMS1 (27% versus 11%), CMS2 (28% versus 45%), CMS3 (10% versus 12%), CMS4 (35% versus 32%). Independent of the treatment, CMS was a strong prognostic factor for ORR (P = 0.051), PFS (P < 0.001), and OS (P < 0.001). Within the RAS wild-type population, OS observed in CMS4 significantly favored FOLFIRI cetuximab over FOLFIRI bevacizumab. In CMS3, OS showed a trend in favor of the cetuximab arm, while OS was comparable in CMS1 and CMS2, independent of targeted therapy.

Conclusions

CMS classification is prognostic for mCRC. Prolonged OS induced by FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the FIRE-3 study appears to be driven by CMS3 and CMS4. CMS classification provides deeper insights into the biology to CRC, but at present time has no direct impact on clinical decision-making. The FIRE-3 (AIO KRK-0306) study had been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00433927.

### Continuation of bevacizumab vs cetuximab plus chemotherapy after first progression in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: the UNICANCER PRODIGE18 randomized clinical trial [^1139RxET]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Second-line treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or cetuximab is a valid option for metastatic colorectal cancer.

Objective

To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 4 months with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab vs cetuximab for patients with progression of metastatic colorectal cancer after bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial was conducted from December 14, 2010, to May 5, 2015. The main eligibility criterion was disease progression after bevacizumab plus fluorouracil with irinotecan or oxaliplatin in patients with wild-type KRAS exon 2 metastatic colorectal cancer. All analyses were performed on the modified intent-to-treat population.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to arm A (FOLFIRI [fluorouracil and folinic acid combined with irinotecan] or modified FOLFOX6 [fluorouracil and folinic acid combined with oxaliplatin] plus bevacizumab) or arm B (FOLFIRI or modified FOLFOX6 plus cetuximab); the second-line chemotherapy regimen was chosen according to first-line treatment (crossover).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the 4-month PFS rate. Secondary end points included safety, objective response rate, overall survival, and PFS.

Results

A total of 132 patients (47 women and 85 men; median age, 63.0 years [range, 33.0–84.0 years]; 74 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 54 patients with a performance status of 1, and 4 patients with unknown performance status) were included at 25 sites. The 4-month PFS rate was 80.3% (95% CI, 68.0%-88.3%) in arm A and 66.7% (95% CI, 53.6%-76.8%) in arm B. The median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI, 5.7–8.2 months) in arm A and 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.2–6.5 months) in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.50–1.02; p = 0.06), and the median overall survival was 15.8 months (95% CI, 9.5–22.3 months) in arm A and 10.4 months (95% CI, 7.0–16.2 months) in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46–1.04; p = 0.08). A central analysis of KRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4), NRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4), and BRAF (V600) was performed for 95 tumor samples. Eighty-one patients had wild-type KRAS and wild-type NRAS tumors.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of the PRODIGE18 (Partenariat de Recherche en Oncologie DIGEstive) study showed a nonsignificant difference but favored continuation of bevacizumab with chemotherapy crossover for patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer that progressed with first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

### Antitumor efficacy of dual blockade with encorafenib + cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy in human BRAFV600E-mutant colorectal cancer [^113L2FKR]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Purpose:

Encorafenib + cetuximab (E+C) is an effective therapeutic option in chemorefractory BRAF V600E metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, there is a need to improve the efficacy of this molecular-targeted therapy and evaluate regimens suitable for untreated BRAF V600E in patients with mCRC.

Experimental Design:

We performed a series of in vivo studies using BRAF V600E mCRC tumor xenografts. Mice were randomized to receive 5-fluoruracil (5-FU), irinotecan, or oxaliplatin regimens (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX), (E+C) or the combination. Patients received long-term treatment until disease progression, with deescalation strategies used to mimic maintenance therapy. Transcriptomic changes after progression on cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted therapy were assessed.

Results:

Antitumor activity of either FOLFIRI or E+C was better as first-line treatment as compared with second-line, with partial cross-resistance seen between a cytotoxic regimen and targeted therapy with an average 62% loss of efficacy for FOLFIRI after E+C and a 45% loss of efficacy of E+C after FOLFIRI (P < 0.001 for both). FOLFIRI-treated models had upregulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and MAPK pathway activation, where E+C treated models had suppressed MAPK signaling. In contrast, with chemotherapy with E+C, EMT and MAPK signaling remained suppressed. FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, each in combination with E+C, were the most active first-line treatments as compared with E+C or to chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, FOLFOX in combination with E+C as first-line induction therapy, followed by E+C ± 5-FU as maintenance therapy, was the most effective strategy for long-term disease control.

Conclusions:

These results support the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and molecular-targeted therapy as a promising therapeutic approach in the first-line treatment of BRAF V600E mCRC.

### Cetuximab in combination with irinotecan / 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) / folinic acid (FA) (FOLFIRI) in second and third-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): safety and efficacy analysis… [^111uhUb9]. ASCO (2006). Low credibility.

Abstract 3558 Background: The Folfiri regimen demonstrated high efficacy and favorable safety profile compared to irinotecan plus bolus 5-FU/FA or irinotecan alone. Folfiri is a standard option in first line treatment of mCRC. Cetuximab, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor, which is commonly expressed in mCRC, is approved in France in combination with irinotecan after failure of an irinotecan-based therapy. We have prospectively evaluated the combination cetuximab-FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC refractory to FOLFIRI administered in first line treatment. Methods: Patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC, who progressed following first line treatment with FOLFIRI regimen were eligible for this study. Treatment consisted of cetuximab combined with FOLFIRI until either disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor reponse was assessed by CT scan every 2 months, and adverses events were registered. Results: 41 patients where included from 09/2004 to 11/2005. 78% Male/ 22% Female, mean age 63 years, median KPS 80, 68% colon primary tumour. 5 patients were treated in second line, 24 patients in third line and 12 in fourth line or more. 40 patients are evaluable for response. Conclusions: The combination of cetuximab with FOLFIRI demonstrated promising efficacy and acceptable safety profile without increasing chemotherapy adverse reactions. A prospective randomised trial would confirm the advantage of FOLFIRI over irinotecan alone in combination with cetuximab. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### Cetuximab continuation after first progression in metastatic colorectal cancer (CAPRI-GOIM): a randomized phase II trial of FOLFOX plus cetuximab versus FOLFOX [^113AaGNf]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cetuximab plus chemotherapy is a first-line treatment option in metastatic KRAS and NRAS wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. No data are currently available on continuing anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy beyond progression.

Patients and Methods

We did this open-label, 1:1 randomized phase II trial at 25 hospitals in Italy to evaluate the efficacy of cetuximab plus 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as second-line treatment of KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic CRC patients treated in first line with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab. Patients received FOLFOX plus cetuximab (arm A) or FOLFOX (arm B). Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Tumour tissues were assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This report is the final analysis.

Results

Between 1 February 2010 and 28 September 2014, 153 patients were randomized (74 in arm A and 79 in arm B). Median PFS was 6.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.7–8.0] versus 4.5 months (95% CI 3.3–5.7); [hazard ratio (HR), 0.81; 95% CI 0.58–1.12; P = 0.19], respectively. NGS was performed in 117/153 (76.5%) cases; 66/117 patients (34 in arm A and 32 in arm B) had KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA wild-type tumours. For these patients, PFS was longer in the FOLFOX plus cetuximab arm [median 6.9 (95% CI 5.5–8.2) versus 5.3 months (95% CI 3.7–6.9); HR, 0.56 (95% CI 0.33–0.94); P = 0.025]. There was a trend in better overall survival: median 23.7 [(95% CI 19.4–28.0) versus 19.8 months (95% CI 14.9–24.7); HR, 0.57 (95% CI 0.32–1.02); P = 0.056].

Conclusions

Continuing cetuximab treatment in combination with chemotherapy is of potential therapeutic efficacy in molecularly selected patients and should be validated in randomized phase III trials.

### Efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in 1st-line treatment of older patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: an analysis of the randomised trial FIRE-3 [^113hxxLY]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The evidence on the efficacy of anticancer therapy is limited in older patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This retrospective analysis of phase III FIRE-3 trial assesses the efficacy of FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab according to the patients' age and sidedness of primary tumour.

Methods

The study endpoints overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between younger (< 65 years) and older (≥ 65 years) patients, followed by stratification according to primary tumour sidedness. ORR was compared using Fisher´s exact test, OS and PFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate Cox regression analyses assessed hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for OS and PFS.

Results

Overall, older patients with RAS WT tumours had a significantly shorter OS when compared to younger patients (25.9 months vs 29.3 months, HR 1.29; P = 0.02). Also the proportion of right-sided tumours was significantly greater in older patients (27.1% vs 17.9%; P = 0.029). Secondary resection rates were numerically higher in younger patients (25.4% vs. 17.6%, P = 0.068) than in older patients. This was primarily seen in the Cetuximab arm, where older patients underwent less likely resection (13.1% vs. 26%; P = 0.02). Older patients with left-sided tumours showed only a trend towards greater efficacy of cetuximab (HR 0.86; P = 0.38). In patients with right-sided primary tumours, older patients did not appear to benefit from cetuximab in contrast to younger patients (≥ 65 years: 16.6 months vs 23.6 months, HR 1.1; P = 0.87; < 65 years: 21.9 months vs 16.4 months HR 1.5; P = 0.31).

Conclusions

In FIRE-3, OS was generally shorter in older patients in comparison to younger patients. This could be explained by the overrepresentation of right-sided tumours and a lower secondary resection rate in older patients. The efficacy of targeted therapy was dependent on tumour sidedness in older patients with RAS WT mCRC.

### Cetuximab + FOLFIRI as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal CA… [^115duNxm]. ASCO (2004). Low credibility.

Abstract 3513 Background: Cetuximab is an IgG 1monoclonal antibody targeting the EGFR. In irinotecan-refractory metastatic CRC and in first-line therapy trials cetuximab has shown to be active. This phase II trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of cetuximab combined with a FOLFIRI regimen as first-line treatment for pts with EGFR-expressing metastatic CRC. Methods: Cetuximab was given at an initial dose of 400 mg/m 2, then 250 mg/m 2i. v. weekly. FOLFIRI was administered every 2 weeks: Irinotecan 180 mg/m 2, FA 400 mg/m 2and 5-FU 300 mg/m. 2bolus plus infusion of 2, 000 mg/m 2/46h or 400 mg/m 2bolus plus infusion of 2, 400 mg/m. 2/46h. Dose limiting toxicity was defined as neutropenia/leukopenia, thrombopenia, alk.

phosphatase, bilirubin, ASAT, ALAT or skin toxicity > grade 3; neutropenia with fever/infection, anemia, diarrhea, mucositis, creatinine, or any treatment-related organ toxicity > Gd 2 during the first 3 cycles. So far, median TTP was 10. 9 months. To allow a better estimate of safety and efficacy for a planned phase III trial, further 29 patients were enrolled in the HD group that has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Safety analysis in the HD group was based on 42 pts. The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were diarrhea 14. 3%, neutropenia
11. 9%, rash, 11. 9%, and nausea/vomiting
9. 5%. Frequency of acne-like rash of grade 1/2/3/4 was 28. 6/26. 2/4. 8/0%. 5 pts were still on treatment at the time of abstract submission. Conclusion: The combination of cetuximab with FOLFIRI is safe and feasible in pts with EGFR-expressing metastatic CRC and is clearly active.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer (FIRE-3): a post-hoc analysis of tumour dynamics in the final RAS wild-type subgroup of this randomised open-label phase 3 trial [^113KvWYR]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

FIRE-3 compared first-line 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus cetuximab with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. The same study also reported an exploratory analysis of a subgroup of patients with tumours that were wild-type at other RAS genes (KRAS and NRAS exons 2–4). We report here efficacy results for the FIRE-3 final RAS (KRAS/NRAS, exons 2–4) wild-type subgroup. Moreover, new metrics of tumour dynamics were explored during a centralised radiological review to investigate how FOLFIRI plus cetuximab conferred overall survival benefit in the absence of differences in investigator-assessed objective responses and progression-free survival.

Methods

FIRE-3 was a randomised phase 3 trial comparing FOLFIRI plus cetuximab with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary endpoint of the FIRE-3 study was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 in the intention-to-treat population. A centralised radiological review of CT scans was done in a post-hoc analysis to assess objective response according to RECIST 1.1, early tumour shrinkage, depth of response, duration of response, and time to response in the final RAS wild-type subgroup. Comparisons between treatment groups with respect to objective response rate and early tumour shrinkage were made using Fisher's exact test (two-sided), while differences in depth of response were investigated with a two-sided Wilcoxon test. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433927.

Findings

In the final RAS wild-type population (n = 400), median overall survival was better in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab group than the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group (33·1 months [95% CI 24·5–39·4] vs 25·0 months [23·0–28·1]; hazard ratio 0·70 [0·54–0·90]; p = 0·0059), although investigator-assessed objective response and progression-free survival were comparable between treatment groups. Centralised radiological review of CT-assessable patients (n = 330) showed that the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (113 of 157, 72·0% [95% CI 64·3–78·8] vs 97 of 173, 56·1% [48·3–63·6]; p = 0·0029), frequency of early tumour shrinkage (107 of 157, 68·2% [60·3–75·4] vs 85 of 173, 49·1% [41·5–56·8]; p = 0·0005), and median depth of response (-48·9% [-54·3 to -42·0] vs -32·3% [-38·2 to -29·2]; p < 0·0001) were significantly better in extended RAS wild-type patients receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus those receiving FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. No differences in duration of response and time to response were observed between treatment groups.

Interpretation

This analysis provides a new framework that connects alternative metrics of response to overall survival. Superior response-related outcome parameters, such as early tumour shrinkage and depth of response, obtained by centralised radiological review correlated with the overall survival benefit conferred by FOLFIRI plus cetuximab compared with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the extended RAS wild-type subgroup.

### Maintenance therapy with cetuximab after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^113Gd7Mn]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The optimal maintenance strategy after induction chemotherapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains to be debated.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with single-agent cetuximab after FOLFIRI (leucovorin [folinic acid], fluorouracil, and irinotecan) plus cetuximab induction therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The TIME (Treatment After Irinotecan-Based Frontline Therapy: Maintenance With Erbitux]) (PRODIGE 28 [Partenariat de Recherche en Oncologie Digestive]-UCGI 27 [UniCancer GastroIntestinal Group]) phase 2 noncomparative, multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 15, 2014, to November 23, 2018, among 139 patients with unresectable RAS wild-type mCRC. The cutoff date for analysis was July 21, 2022.

Interventions

After first-line induction therapy with 8 cycles of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, patients without disease progression were randomized (1:1) to biweekly maintenance with cetuximab or observation. On disease progression, the same induction regimen was recommended for 16 weeks followed by further maintenance with cetuximab or observation until disease progression under the full induction regimen.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the 6-month progression-free rate from randomization. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. An exploratory biomolecular analysis, using next-generation sequencing, investigated the putative prognostic value of the tumor mutation profile.

Results

Of 214 patients enrolled (141 men [65.9%]; median age, 67 years [range, 23–85 years]), 139 were randomized to receive cetuximab (n = 67; 45 men [67.2%]; median age, 64 years [range, 34–85 years]) or to be observed (n = 72; 50 men [69.4%]; median age, 68 years [23–85 years]). The 6-month progression-free rate was 38.8% ([26 of 67] 95% CI, 27.1%-51.5%) in the cetuximab group and 5.6% ([4 of 72] 95% CI, 1.5%-13.6%) in the observation group. At a median follow-up of 40.5 months (95% CI, 33.6–47.5 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization was 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.7–7.4 months) in the cetuximab group and 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.8–2.7 months) in the observation group. Median overall survival (OS) was 24.8 months (95% CI, 18.7–30.4 months) in the cetuximab group and 19.7 months (95% CI, 13.3–24.4 months) in the observation group. In an exploratory multivariate analysis, any tumor-activating mutation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes was associated with shorter PFS from randomization regardless of treatment group (hazard ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.01–2.62]; p = 0.04). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxic effect in the cetuximab group during maintenance therapy was rash (8 of 67 [11.9%]).

Conclusion and Relevance

The randomized clinical trial did not meet its primary end point but suggests clinically meaningful PFS and OS benefits associated with cetuximab maintenance therapy. However, maintenance cetuximab or treatment breaks after first-line combination FOLFIRI-cetuximab therapy seems inappropriate for patients with MAPK-mutated independently of the side of primary tumor. A more complete assessment of MAPK pathway mutations warrants further investigation to the refine treatment strategy for patients with RAS wild-type mCRC.

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab for advanced colorectal cancer: final survival and per-protocol analysis of FIRE-3, a randomised clinical trial [^111LdVmX]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Study treatment

Cetuximab or bevacizumab was administered with FOLFIRI on day 1 of each 14-day treatment cycle. The initial cetuximab dose was 400 mg/m 2, then 250 mg/m² weekly, the bevacizumab dosage was 5 mg/kg of bodyweight every 2 weeks and FOLFIRI consisted of 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 (IV bolus), folinic acid 400 mg/m 2 and irinotecan 180 mg/m 2, followed by a continuous 46-h infusion of fluorouracil 2400 mg/m 2. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, treatment was continued until complete response or conversion to surgical resectability was attained, or the patient or physician decided to discontinue treatment. Tumour response, study endpoints and per-protocol analysis was performed.

The primary endpoint in FIRE-3 was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR, complete or partial response) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria, version 1.0. The first CT scan was performed after 3 cycles of therapy; thus, the per-protocol analysis included all RAS wild-type patients who received ≥ 3 cycles and had at ≥ 1 post-baseline CT scan allowing evaluation of response. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), OS, secondary resection of liver metastases with curative intent and safety. Adverse events were recorded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0.

Early tumour shrinkage, defined as a reduction of ≥ 20% in the sum of the longest tumour diameters of the selected target lesions at week 6, and depth of response, defined as the maximum percentage change in tumour size compared to baseline, were analysed using data from an independent, centralised radiological review of response using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The independent review was performed by board-certified radiologists (Radiology Consulting GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany) who were masked to treatment allocation, and included all 332 patients (n = 332) with RAS wild-type disease for whom pre- and post-treatment CT scans were available.

Primary tumour location

The effect of primary tumour location (right- or left-sided) on outcomes was retrospectively assessed in the RAS wild-type population, where right-sided refers to tumours located in the caecum to the transverse colon and left-sided to tumours from the splenic flexure to the rectum.

Neoadjuvant cetuximab and panitumumab for metastatic disease — conversion to resectability: Randomized data with anti–epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy report improved conversion of unresectable to resectable disease. In CELIM (phase II), patients were randomized to cetuximab plus FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI, with resectability increasing from 32% to 60% in wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumors (P < .0001) and median overall survival 35.7 months (95% CI, 27.2–44.2 months) without arm differences. Another RCT of mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus chemotherapy alone in unresectable colorectal liver metastases found eligibility for curative hepatic resection in 20 of 70 (29%) versus 9 of 68 (13%), R0 resection rates 25.7% versus 7.4% (P < .01), and surgery improved median survival with cetuximab 46.4 vs. 25.7 months (P = 0.007) and control 36.0 vs. 19.6 months (P = 0.016). A phase III CAIRO5 cohort of initially unresectable RAS/BRAF wild-type, left-sided tumors randomized bevacizumab versus panitumumab with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI is described.

### The oncology biomarker discovery framework reveals cetuximab and bevacizumab response patterns in metastatic colorectal cancer [^113cwZXw]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) significantly improved upon the introduction of targeted treatments, including anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF directed monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, respectively. Tumours of colorectal cancer patients were shown to exhibit, for instance, either KRAS or NRAS mutations (referred to as RAS mutations) with a rate of about 50%, which tend to occur mutually exclusive. These RAS mutations are clinically approved predictive biomarkers of resistance against anti-EGFR directed monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab. Bevacizumab has been reported to improve progression-free survival in first-line mCRC trials; however, no comparable biomarker has been depicted yet.

In this study, we focused on the open-label randomised phase III clinical trial FIRE-3. Here, patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type mCRC were randomised to receive either cetuximab or bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a first-line regimen. Several retrospective subgroup analyses revealed potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers based on tumour DNA and clinical characteristics, such as the relevance of the molecular status, i.e. alterations other than KRAS exon 2, such as KRAS exon 3–4, NRAS exon 2–4 and BRAF V600E, or primary tumour sidedness –. For example, targeting EGFR in RAS wild-type mCRC tumours located in the left hemicolon (left-sided) was shown to be beneficial, whilst RAS wild-type tumours located in the right colon (right-sided) were less likely to respond. Additionally, in the more recent FIRE-4.5 study, it was demonstrated that patients with BRAF V600E mutant tumours may benefit from the treatment with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) backbone plus bevacizumab, whereas in contrast, these patients lacked benefits from cetuximab. This hints towards tumour subtype-specific interactions and alternative mechanisms to acquire EGFR inhibitor resistance.

### Efficacy of FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in 1st-line treatment of older patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: an analysis of the randomised trial FIRE-3 [^1118uSic]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Impact of age on treatment efficacy of cetuximab and bevacizumab in left- and right-sided primary tumours

Considering all tumour localisations together, the comparison of OS by treatment arm clearly demonstrated that FOLFIRI plus cetuximab was markedly superior to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in patients aged ≤ 65 years (OS 33.1 months vs 25.6 months; HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.5–0.91; P = 0.012, Fig. 1 a). Within the older patients, no significant difference in efficacy between cetuximab- and bevacizumab-treated patients could be observed (27.1 vs. 26.0 months; HR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.66–1.2; P = 0.46, Table 2). The analysis of ORR in younger patients showed a markedly greater benefit from cetuximab compared to bevacizumab (76.2% vs 62.9%, P = 0.076). In older patients ORR was only numerically greater in the cetuximab arm (77.9% vs 66.3%, P = 0.13) and this effect did not reach the level of statistical significance (Table 2). For further clarification, the age subgroup analysis was extended to sidedness (left versus right) of colorectal cancer. In the overall study population, patients with left-sided primary tumours lived longer compared to patients with right-sided primary tumours (30.8 months versus 21.2 months, P < 0.01). Only 90 patients with right-sided primary tumours were evaluated in the present analysis (36 patients aged < 65 years and 54 patients aged ≥ 65 years, Table 2).

### Cetuximab and chemotherapy as initial treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer [^116JL1xq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

We investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer and sought associations between the mutation status of the KRAS gene in tumors and clinical response to cetuximab.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases to receive FOLFIRI either alone or in combination with cetuximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival.

Results

A total of 599 patients received cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, and 599 received FOLFIRI alone. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival in the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group as compared with the FOLFIRI group was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.99; P = 0.048). There was no significant difference in the overall survival between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.07; P = 0.31). There was a significant interaction between treatment group and KRAS mutation status for tumor response (P = 0.03) but not for progression-free survival (P = 0.07) or overall survival (P = 0.44). The hazard ratio for progression-free survival among patients with wild-type-KRAS tumors was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94), in favor of the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group. The following grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI than with FOLFIRI alone: skin reactions (which were grade 3 only) (in 19.7% vs. 0.2% of patients, P < 0.001), infusion-related reactions (in 2.5% vs. 0%, P < 0.001), and diarrhea (in 15.7% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.008).

Conclusions

First-line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, as compared with FOLFIRI alone, reduced the risk of progression of metastatic colorectal cancer. The benefit of cetuximab was limited to patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00154102.)

### FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab for advanced colorectal cancer: final survival and per-protocol analysis of FIRE-3, a randomised clinical trial [^111R2gQA]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

While the addition of anti-EGFR agents to chemotherapy clearly improves tumour response, it is hypothesised that development of resistance may be faster in right-sided tumours, resulting in shorter PFS and post-progression survival. Therefore, anti-EGFR treatment may be considered in right-sided tumours if induction of tumour response for conversion therapy is the primary goal; to avoid a negative impact on OS, this approach requires an immediate switch of therapy in patients not responding to induction treatment. If OS is the primary goal in RAS wild-type right-sided tumours with a widely disseminated disease not amenable to surgery, anti-EGFR substances may be discussed but are not the primary choice.

Bevacizumab with FOLFIRI for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): Results from a phase IV trial in 209 patients with mCRC who received bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI as first-line therapy showed that this combination was as effective and well-tolerated as bevacizumab with other 5-FU–based therapies, and a phase III trial in Japan showed FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab is noninferior to mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab with regard to PFS. Therefore, the addition of bevacizumab to FOLFIRI is recommended as an option for initial therapy; alternatively, cetuximab or panitumumab (only for left-sided tumors characterized by wild-type RAS/BRAF) can be added to this regimen.

Panitumumab plus FOLFOX — first-line advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer: In the large, open-label, randomized PRIME trial in KRAS/NRAS wild-type advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), panitumumab plus FOLFOX showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.90; p = 0.004) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.94; p = 0.009) versus FOLFOX alone; therefore, the combination of FOLFOX and panitumumab remains an option as initial therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic disease, while the addition of panitumumab had a detrimental impact on PFS for tumors with mutated KRAS/NRAS. Panitumumab in combination with either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI has also been studied in the first-line treatment of patients with mCRC.

Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI with or without cetuximab.

Clinical outcome according to the tumor mutation status of KRASand BRAFwas assessed in the expanded patient series. The addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI in patients with KRASwild-type disease resulted in significant improvements in overall survival, progression-free survival. 1The tumor response was also statistically significantly enhanced in the cetuximab plus FOLFIRI arm, as was the R0 resection rate of metastases with curative intent.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of metastatic colorectal cancer: a consensus statement of the hellenic society of medical oncologists (HeSMO) [^116vXyWH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The combination of a fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin/bevacizumab has led to a non-significant trend in an increased resection rate compared with the chemo-backbone alone, although no increase in response rate was shown. In a more recent study, it was shown that backbone chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab is associated with increased response and resectability rates and improved survival. There are no data available from randomized studies comparing a chemo-doublet plus bevacizumab with a chemo-doublet plus cetuximab.

Limited data exist concerning the three-drug combination FOLFOXIRI and the possibility to use it as an alternative option to FOLFIRI/FOLFOX + cetuximab with probably more toxicity, especially when targeting agents such as cetuximab are not available or are contraindicated. Possible chemotherapeutic regimens, also including targeting agents are listed in Table 2.

First-line regimens depend on the chosen treatment strategy. For potentially resectable and/or symptomatic disease, first line treatment should ideally be a chemotherapy doublet in combination with a monoclonal antibody or a triplet. If tumor shrinkage is desirable, treatment with FOLFIRI and cetuximab for RAS wt or FOLFOXIRI should be considered. First-line treatment with monotherapy or doublet (either chemotherapy or chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies) could be a valid option for patients, for whom a secondary resection is not feasible, and who have no symptoms or risk for deterioration of the disease.

Selected induction chemotherapy should be given for at least 8 weeks, and first re-assessment is performed, in order to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy application in case of early progression. If the treatment aim is pure palliation, the timing of first evaluation is of less importance, and an interval of 12 weeks might be more appropriate. The overall induction treatment duration depends on the treatment aim. If secondary surgery is attempted, induction chemotherapy should be continued until R0 resectability can be achieved, with the first evaluation after 8 weeks, as mentioned above. If the chosen chemotherapeutic regimen continuous to be active, a 4-month duration of treatment is recommended; if resectability is still not achievable, duration of treatment can be extended to 6 months. Further treatment with the same regimen is not recommended.

### Cetuximab plus irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer: updated analysis of overall survival according to tumor KRAS and BRAF mutation status [^116TsAan]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The addition of cetuximab to irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was shown to reduce the risk of disease progression and increase the chance of response in patients with KRAS wild-type disease. An updated survival analysis, including additional patients analyzed for tumor mutation status, was undertaken.

Patients and Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI with or without cetuximab. DNA was extracted from additional slide-mounted tumor samples previously used to assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Clinical outcome according to the tumor mutation status of KRAS and BRAF was assessed in the expanded patient series.

Results

The ascertainment rate of patients analyzed for tumor KRAS status was increased from 45% to 89%, with mutations detected in 37% of tumors. The addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI in patients with KRAS wild-type disease resulted in significant improvements in overall survival (median, 23.5 v 20.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.796; p = 0.0093), progression-free survival (median, 9.9 v 8.4 months; HR, 0.696; p = 0.0012), and response (rate 57.3% v 39.7%; odds ratio, 2.069; P < .001) compared with FOLFIRI alone. Significant interactions between KRAS status and treatment effect were noted for all key efficacy end points. KRAS mutation status was confirmed as a powerful predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI. BRAF tumor mutation was a strong indicator of poor prognosis.

Conclusion

The addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI as first-line therapy improves survival in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC. BRAF tumor mutation is an indicator of poor prognosis.
