## Question

Is spironolactone safe for women of reproductive age?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether spironolactone is safe for women of reproductive age and, if so, under what conditions it should be used safely and monitored. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about fetal and teratogenic risk if pregnancy occurs. Then, I should verify contraception requirements and guideline positions. Next, I will review maternal adverse effects, drug interactions, and laboratory monitoring. After that, I need to check lactation safety. Then, I will consider indication-specific contexts such as acne, hirsutism/PCOS, heart failure, and resistant hypertension. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation with practical steps clinicians should follow.

> Let me first confirm the core fetal risk signal. Mechanistically, spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with anti-androgenic activity that crosses the placenta, and animal studies demonstrate feminization of male fetuses and endocrine effects in exposed females, which is why FDA labeling advises avoiding spironolactone in pregnancy and counseling about potential risk to a male fetus, with Australia categorizing it as B3 given animal harm and limited human data, so pregnancy should be avoided during therapy [^112VM7Zm] [^113mguGK] [^1157mmoL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about magnitude of human risk; I should double-check the human data. The published evidence is limited to case reports and small series and has not shown a signal for major congenital malformations, but the evidence quality is very low and cannot exclude anti-androgenic effects, so from a clinical risk management perspective the correct approach remains to treat spironolactone as contraindicated in pregnancy despite the absence of definitive human teratogenicity data [^112VM7Zm] [^114E6Peg].

> Next, I should review contraception requirements and guideline alignment. The Endocrine Society recommends avoiding anti-androgen monotherapy for hirsutism unless effective contraception is used, and SOGC advises counseling on male fetal feminization risk and ensuring reliable contraception, while AAD acne guidance urges potassium risk stratification and emphasizes contraceptive counseling; notably, even in the SAFA acne RCT with baseline pregnancy testing and contraceptive advice, seven pregnancies occurred, underscoring the need to document effective contraception and check a baseline pregnancy test before starting spironolactone in any woman of reproductive potential [^1163J78f] [^115FrRWw] [^114upf6y] [^112ZaghW] [^111fnaQQ].

> I need to assess maternal safety and monitoring pragmatically. Common adverse effects include menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, dizziness, nausea, and hyperkalemia, with hyperkalemia risk amplified by renal impairment, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, NSAIDs, and potassium supplements; FDA labeling advises baseline serum potassium and renal function and rechecking potassium within one week of initiation or dose increase, then periodically, and consensus from dermatology and SAFA suggests that in young, healthy women without risk factors, extensive ongoing potassium monitoring may be unnecessary after a normal baseline, though I should individualize based on comorbidities and concomitant drugs [^115LgVwx] [^114PFsPq] [^116K1ha6] [^114upf6y] [^112ZaghW].

> Wait, let me verify dose–tolerability relationships across indications. For dermatologic use, typical doses are 50–200 mg daily with generally favorable tolerability in trials and adolescent series, whereas cardiovascular indications commonly use 25–50 mg daily and showed good tolerability with modest potassium increases in PATHWAY-2; this supports that safety is dose and risk–context dependent and that young women without renal disease tolerate acne and hirsutism doses well with appropriate screening [^112Nx1To] [^113fwhod] [^117DGa4T] [^111J3t7t].

> But wait, what if the patient is on other agents that affect potassium. I should confirm interaction risks. Concomitant ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, potassium supplements, and potassium-sparing agents increase hyperkalemia risk and warrant closer monitoring or avoidance; special caution applies with drospirenone-containing contraceptives, a spironolactone analogue with anti-mineralocorticoid activity, where labeling advises potassium monitoring in higher-risk users, so if drospirenone is chosen for contraception, I should plan targeted potassium checks and consider alternative contraceptives in patients with any hyperkalemia risk factors [^116K1ha6] [^115LgVwx] [^112NRQjC] [^113343yb] [^113wUtrr].

> I will now examine lactation. Initially I thought spironolactone might be present in milk, but wait, I should verify the pharmacokinetics; the parent drug is not detected in human milk, while the active metabolite canrenone appears at low levels expected to be clinically inconsequential, with a single case reporting no short-term infant harms and dermatology sources generally deeming spironolactone compatible with breastfeeding, although long-term infant effects remain unknown and diuresis could theoretically reduce milk supply, so individualized risk–benefit discussion is prudent [^115DX6US] [^115DX6US].

> Let me consider indication-specific safety context for acne. The SAFA trial in adult women showed spironolactone improved acne outcomes with acceptable safety over 24 weeks and highlighted real-world pregnancy risk despite counseling, while AAD supports its use with risk-stratified potassium monitoring; given teratogenic concerns, combined oral contraceptives remain first-line for hirsutism and often for acne, with anti-androgens added only with effective contraception and appropriate monitoring, aligning with Endocrine Society and PCOS evidence syntheses that prioritize COCPs first and reserve anti-androgens for selected cases [^112ZaghW] [^111fnaQQ] [^114upf6y] [^112ihpNK] [^116Rog1a].

> Now, I should review hirsutism and PCOS specifically. Guidelines and meta-analyses recommend COCPs as initial therapy because they both treat hyperandrogenic symptoms and provide contraception, with spironolactone considered second-line or adjunctive only when adequate contraception is assured, reflecting the teratogenic mechanism and the need for sustained pregnancy prevention during anti-androgen therapy in reproductive-age women [^112ihpNK] [^115FrRWw] [^1163J78f] [^112dxxiT].

> Next, I should verify cardiovascular indications. For resistant hypertension, PATHWAY-2 demonstrated that 25–50 mg spironolactone is highly effective and generally well tolerated, with manageable electrolyte changes under monitoring, and for HFrEF, labeled dosing of 12.5–25 mg titrated to 25–50 mg is standard with routine renal and potassium surveillance; in reproductive-age women using spironolactone for these indications, the same pregnancy avoidance and contraception counseling apply given anti-androgenic fetal risk [^117DGa4T] [^111J3t7t] [^113TDUJC] [^111yj9hp] [^1124VLQT] [^116zLJHw].

> I should confirm considerations in adolescents. Retrospective pediatric dermatology data suggest good efficacy and tolerability in females aged 14–20, but the same principles apply: document effective contraception, obtain a baseline pregnancy test before initiation, and tailor potassium monitoring to risk factors rather than testing universally at every visit in low-risk teens with normal baseline labs [^113fwhod] [^112ZaghW] [^114upf6y].

> Let me synthesize the practical risk–benefit stance and correct any misconceptions. Spironolactone can be used safely in women of reproductive age when pregnancy is actively prevented and baseline labs are checked, with counseling that the drug's anti-androgenic mechanism and animal data imply potential harm to a male fetus despite limited human teratogenicity data, requiring documented effective contraception, a baseline pregnancy test, and baseline serum potassium and renal function with a repeat potassium about one week after starting or dose escalation and risk-stratified monitoring thereafter; in young, healthy women without interacting drugs or renal disease, ongoing frequent potassium checks may not be necessary, but I need to ensure vigilance when ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, or drospirenone are in the mix, and reassure that breastfeeding appears acceptable with caution about limited long-term infant data [^112VM7Zm] [^114E6Peg] [^116K1ha6] [^114upf6y] [^112ZaghW] [^115DX6US] [^112NRQjC].

---

Yes, spironolactone is **safe for reproductive-age females** when used with effective contraception [^1163J78f] and appropriate monitoring [^114upf6y]. It is effective for acne [^111fnaQQ], hirsutism [^1163J78f], and PCOS-related hyperandrogenism [^112dxxiT], but **must be avoided in pregnancy** [^112VM7Zm] due to potential fetal harm [^114E6Peg]. The main risks are hyperkalemia [^116K1ha6] and menstrual irregularities [^114PFsPq]; baseline renal function and potassium should be checked, with periodic monitoring [^114upf6y] if risk factors are present. Spironolactone is compatible with breastfeeding [^115DX6US], with only low levels of the metabolite canrenone detected in milk [^115DX6US].

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

Spironolactone is **commonly prescribed** [^114upf6y] for reproductive-age females for the following indications:

- **Acne vulgaris**: Effective for moderate-to-severe acne [^111fnaQQ], particularly with hormonal flares.

- **Hirsutism**: Reduces androgen-mediated hair growth in PCOS [^113JAwaL] and idiopathic hirsutism [^1163J78f].

- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Improves hyperandrogenism symptoms [^112dxxiT] such as hirsutism and acne [^112ihpNK].

- **Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)**: Alleviates physical symptoms like bloating [^1123hMJq] and breast tenderness [^117NXckq].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Spironolactone is **generally well tolerated**, but clinicians should be aware of the following adverse effects:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Potassium-sparing effect [^114upf6y] can cause hyperkalemia [^116K1ha6], especially with renal impairment or potassium-elevating drugs [^115LgVwx].

- **Menstrual irregularities**: Amenorrhea, breakthrough bleeding, and cycle changes are common [^114PFsPq] [^116K1ha6].

- **Breast tenderness and gynecomastia**: Dose-dependent breast effects can occur [^116K1ha6] [^115LgVwx].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea [^114PFsPq], vomiting, and abdominal cramps may occur.

- **Rare serious adverse effects**: Hepatotoxicity [^116K1ha6], Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and agranulocytosis are rare but possible [^114PFsPq].

---

## Teratogenicity and pregnancy considerations

Spironolactone is **contraindicated in pregnancy** [^112VM7Zm] due to potential fetal harm, particularly feminization of male fetuses observed in animal studies [^114E6Peg]. Although human data are limited [^113mguGK], the potential risk necessitates **strict contraception** [^1163J78f] during therapy [^115FrRWw], and **regular pregnancy testing** is advised to detect unintended pregnancies early.

---

## Impact on fertility

Spironolactone **does not significantly impair fertility** in reproductive-age females. Animal studies [^116s62PS] suggest potential effects on ovulation and implantation at high doses, but clinical relevance at therapeutic doses is unclear. Menstrual irregularities may temporarily affect fertility, but these effects are generally reversible upon discontinuation.

---

## Monitoring and clinical guidelines

Clinical guidelines **recommend** the following monitoring and precautions:

- **Baseline assessment**: Renal function and serum potassium should be checked before starting therapy [^114upf6y] [^116K1ha6].

- **Periodic monitoring**: Potassium and renal function should be monitored periodically [^114upf6y], especially in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia [^116K1ha6].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be informed about potential side effects, the importance of contraception, and the need for regular monitoring [^114upf6y].

---

## Long-term safety

Long-term use of spironolactone is **generally safe** with appropriate monitoring. No significant increase in breast cancer risk has been observed in long-term studies [^113131c8]. Regular monitoring of electrolytes and renal function [^116K1ha6] is essential to minimize risks.

---

## Alternative medications

Alternative medications for similar indications include [^114upf6y] [^1163J78f]:

| **Indication** | **Alternative medications** |
|-|-|
| Acne vulgaris | - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - Topical retinoids <br/> - Antibiotics |
| Hirsutism | - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - Finasteride <br/> - Flutamide |
| PCOS | - Metformin <br/> - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - Lifestyle modifications |
| PMS | - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - SSRIs <br/> - Lifestyle modifications |

---

## Special considerations

Breastfeeding is **generally compatible** [^115DX6US] with spironolactone, with low levels of the active metabolite canrenone detected in breast milk [^113mguGK]. In **adolescents**, the medication is effective and safe for acne, with a favorable side-effect profile [^113fwhod].

---

Spironolactone is **safe and effective** for reproductive-age females when used with appropriate monitoring and contraception. It is effective for acne, hirsutism, and PCOS-related hyperandrogenism, but **should be avoided in pregnancy** due to potential fetal harm.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of spironolactone PO (also known as Aldactone, Carospir):

- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as spironolactone may cause electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.

- **Gynecomastia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as spironolactone can cause gynecomastia in a dose-dependent manner, with an onset varying from 1–2 months to over a year. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.

- **Hypotension and renal dysfunction**: Use caution in patients with salt depletion or concomitant use of ACEis/ARBs or nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs. Monitor volume status and renal function periodically. Monitor the diuretic effect when co-administered with NSAIDs.

- **Increased serum lithium levels**: Use caution in patients taking lithium preparations. Monitor lithium levels periodically.

- **Increased serum potassium**: Use caution in patients with renal impairment or concomitant use of potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or medications increasing potassium serum levels, such as ACEis or ARBs. Monitor serum potassium levels within 1 week of initiation or up-titration and regularly thereafter.

### Aldactone [^112VM7Zm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, spironolactone may affect sex differentiation of males during embryogenesis (see Data). Rat embryofetal studies report feminization of male fetuses and endocrine dysfunction in females exposed to spironolactone in utero. Limited available data from published case reports and case series did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with spironolactone. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with heart failure, cirrhosis, and poorly controlled hypertension during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Because of the potential risk to the male fetus due to the anti-androgenic properties of spironolactone and animal data, avoid spironolactone in pregnant women or advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a male fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%–4% and 15%–20%, respectively.

- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Pregnant women with congestive heart failure are at increased risk for preterm birth. Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. Clinical classification of heart disease may worsen with pregnancy.

### CaroSpir [^115DX6US]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Lactation**:
	- Spironolactone is not present in breast milk; however, limited data from a lactating woman at 17 days postpartum report the presence of the active metabolite, canrenone, in human breast milk in low amounts expected to be clinically inconsequential. In this case, no adverse effects were reported for the breastfed infant after short-term exposure to spironolactone; however, long-term effects on a breastfed infant are unknown. There are no data on spironolactone effects on milk production. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for spironolactone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from spironolactone or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Pediatric use**:
	- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. CaroSpir is not recommended for the treatment of hypertension in pediatric patients because of the potential risks associated with the antiandrogenic, progestogenic, and estrogenic properties of spironolactone in pediatric patients.

- **Geriatric use**:
	- CaroSpir is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, monitor renal function.

- **Use in renal impairment**:
	- CaroSpir is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112ihpNK]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

While other anti-androgen pharmacological agents, such as spironolactone, may be considered for treating clinical hirsutism, first-line therapy remains the COCP. This is because the COCP can improve menstrual cyclicity while providing effective contraception, whereas anti-androgens are teratogenic since they can interfere with the external genital development of male fetuses. Consistent with our findings, a systematic review and network meta-analysis by Barrionuevo et al. of 43 studies reported that anti-androgens in combination with the COCP may have additive benefits for hirsutism, noting important methodological limitations in the available evidence. However, Barrionuevo et al. investigated women with idiopathic hirsutism and specifically excluded women with PCOS. An earlier systematic review of 28 studies by Koulouri et al. identified improvements in hirsutism following anti-androgen treatment, which were associated with BMI; however, this review included broader hirsute populations, rather than PCOS specifically, and is likely outdated given that the search was conducted 17 years ago (in 2006). Although PCOS constitutes 65–75% of hirsutism cases, other causes of hirsutism such as Cushing's syndrome, androgen-producing tumours, hyperprolactinaemia, and peripheral androgen activity may necessitate different and more nuanced treatment approaches than those needed in PCOS, particularly due to the cardiometabolic implications of the latter. Here, we extend the potential benefits of anti-androgens on hirsutism to women with PCOS, while maintaining that COCP remains first-line therapy.

### A guide to the management of hidradenitis suppurativa in pregnancy and lactation [^113mguGK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is frequently used in female patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) to counteract hormonal influences on disease activity. Spironolactone is not compatible with pregnancy because of its antiandrogen properties and ability to cross the placenta, which can interfere with the sexual development of a male fetus. A 2019 systematic review evaluating exposure to spironolactone in utero did not find significant evidence of feminization of male individuals; however, human data were limited to case reports. Of note, spironolactone is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding despite a potential risk of lactation suppression from diuresis.

- **Oral contraceptive pills**: Combined oral contraceptive pills are used as monotherapy or in combination with spironolactone for female patients with HS, but are contraindicated during pregnancy. In terms of compatibility with breastfeeding, oral contraceptive pills may suppress lactation and there are some reports of infants experiencing breast enlargement while being breastfed by exposed mothers. Thus, it is generally recommended to wait until at least six weeks after delivery to start oral contraceptive pills.

### Carospir [^116s62PS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a three-litter reproduction study, female rats received dietary doses of 15 and 50 mg spironolactone/kg/day. There were no effects on mating and fertility, but there was a small increase in the incidence of stillborn pups at 50 mg/kg/day. When injected into female rats (100 mg/kg/day for 7 days, i.p.), spironolactone increased the length of the estrous cycle by prolonging diestrus during treatment and inducing constant diestrus during a two-week post-treatment observation period. These effects were associated with retarded ovarian follicle development and a reduction in circulating estrogen levels, which would be expected to impair mating, fertility, and fecundity.

Spironolactone (100 mg/kg/day), administered i.p. to female mice during a two-week cohabitation period with untreated males, decreased the number of mated mice that conceived — caused by an inhibition of ovulation — and decreased the number of implanted embryos in those that became pregnant — caused by an inhibition of implantation. At 200 mg/kg, it also increased the latency period to mating.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in England as well as Wales: Pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^112ZaghW]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

Although spironolactone has been widely used in the community to treat hypertension and some related disorders, it is not licensed for managing acne. Therefore, some clinicians might be reticent to prescribe it off-license in this context. The findings from this trial show the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of spironolactone in women with acne. Adopting a combined approach using oral spironolactone and topical agents could reduce the long-term prescribing of oral antibiotics and, consequently, reduce the likelihood of emerging bacterial resistance. Treatment courses of spironolactone over three months are likely more beneficial than shorter treatment durations.

Participants were given contraceptive advice at each visit, and a pregnancy test was carried out at baseline. Despite this measure, seven pregnancies were reported in the trial. Although spironolactone is cautioned against in pregnancy, its effects are probably less teratogenic than oral tetracyclines, which are commonly used for acne in young women. Thus, in usual practice, spironolactone would be treated with no special restriction beyond contraceptive counseling. Consensus is growing that, although baseline checks of renal function and potassium levels are advisable before starting patients on spironolactone, ongoing monitoring is unnecessary for most young women.

Overall, spironolactone provides a safe and effective alternative to oral antibiotics for adult women with persistent acne.

### Spironolactone and risk of incident breast cancer in women older than 55 years: Retrospective, matched cohort study [^113131c8]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with about 80% of cases being hormonally dependent, usually estrogen receptor positive. Due to the effects of spironolactone on the breast, including tenderness in women and gynecomastia in men, alongside its known antiandrogenic and progestogenic actions, there is a concern that spironolactone could promote breast cancer development. Anecdotally, many doctors avoid prescribing spironolactone to patients with a history of breast cancer or those at high risk, as published reports have expressed concerns that the drug could increase the risk of breast cancer and other cancers in humans. However, other studies have shown no increased risk. Overall, studies in this area have been small and limited.

Many other factors are known to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. These factors include age, sex (only 0.5% of cases occur in men), alcohol use, smoking, postmenopausal obesity, age at menarche, age at first childbirth, age at menopause, parity, breastfeeding, use of exogenous estrogens (such as hormone replacement therapy or combined oral contraceptive pill), family history, and, in some cases, germline mutations (such as BRCA1). Patients who receive long-term spironolactone treatment for hypertension or heart failure tend to be older, and this is also the group of patients most at risk of breast cancer. We aimed to investigate whether exposure to spironolactone affects the risk of incident breast cancer in women over 55 years of age in the UK.

### Interventions for hirsutism [^113JAwaL]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: What medical therapies are associated with greatest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating hirsutism?

- **Bottom line**: Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been associated with improvement for mild hirsutism, as has flutamide (250 mg) taken twice daily and spironolactone for more severe cases. Finasteride and gonadotropin-releasing analogues are associated with inconsistent results, while metformin is not associated with any benefit.

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in England as well as Wales: Pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^111fnaQQ]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

The study SAFA was published in 2023 in the journal BMJ and focuses on the disease acne vulgaris. The trial aimed to answer the question: what is the effect of spironolactone in female patients with acne vulgaris? The study design was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 410 female patients. The inclusion criteria included adult female patients with facial acne for at least six months, requiring oral antibiotics. Key exclusion criteria were an Investigator's Global Assessment acne score of 0–1, previous use of spironolactone, use of oral isotretinoin in the past six months, and use of oral antibiotics for more than one week for acne within the previous month.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Spironolactone group**: n = 201 (50 mg/day until week 6, increasing to 100 mg/day until week 24)
	- **Placebo group**: n = 209 (matching placebo)

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant increase in improvement in the Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 12 (19.2 points vs. 17.8 points; AD 1.27 points, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.46).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in improvement in the Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 24 (21.2 points vs. 17.4 points; AD 3.45 points, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.75).
	- Significant increase in self-assessed overall improvement score of 3–6 at week 24 (82% vs. 63%; OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.93).
	- Significant increase in Investigator's Global Assessment for treatment success at week 12 (19% vs. 6%; OR 5.18, 95% CI 2.18 to 12.28).

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112dxxiT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age with PCOS, diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception.

Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration, or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups, were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes, prioritized during guideline development for GRADE purposes, included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where applicable.

### Use of spironolactone to treat acne in adolescent females [^113fwhod]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Studies assessing the utility of spironolactone for treating acne in adolescent females are lacking. Therefore, we sought to examine spironolactone's role in treating this patient population.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was performed to determine the efficacy of spironolactone treatment in adolescent females seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, from 2007 to 2017.

- **Results**: In a cohort of 80 pediatric patients with a median age of 19 years (range, 14–20 years), 64 patients (80%) experienced improvement of acne on treatment with spironolactone (median dose, 100 mg daily) with a favorable side effect profile. Approximately a quarter of patients (22.5%) had a complete response; more than half (58.8%) had a complete response or a partial response greater than 50%. Initial and maximal responses were observed at a median of 3 months and 5 months, respectively. Patients received treatment with spironolactone for a median duration of 7 months (range, 3–45 months) with limited side effects.

- **Conclusions**: Spironolactone demonstrated efficacy in treating acne in adolescent females and is a safe long-term alternative to systemic antibiotics in these patients.

### Impavido [^114fbTGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMPAVIDO and for 5 months after the last dose [see Boxed Warning, and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. If vomiting and/or diarrhea occurs, women using oral contraceptives should use an additional non-oral method of effective contraception during IMPAVIDO therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

Women who become pregnant while being treated with IMPAVIDO should discontinue treatment and seek counseling from their healthcare provider about the potential risk to the fetus [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Male patients should be advised that semen quality and sperm parameters may be adversely affected by treatment with IMPAVIDO. Additionally, the effects of IMPAVIDO on spermatogenesis may persist for an unknown duration of time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. IMPAVIDO may impair fertility in both females and males of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.3), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Male patients should also be informed about the possibility of diminution in ejaculate volume, including temporary absence of ejaculate, and scrotal tenderness during treatment. Any concerning genitourinary symptoms should be reported to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

### Spironolactone in dermatology [^111nzxoU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is a drug similar in structure to aldosterone and acts as an aldosterone receptor antagonist with an anti-androgenic effect. This drug has proven to be useful in several dermatological entities; however, its use has not been well explored. Its application in diseases such as acne has opened the door to the possibility of new therapies, depending on the clinical manifestations of the patients, and its potential use as a first-line treatment. Other diseases associated with the use of spironolactone where its effects have been shown to be useful are hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and female pattern androgenetic alopecia.

In this review, we discuss the use of spironolactone in different skin diseases that are common in our environment, dosage according to different studies, treatment recommendations, and adverse effects; all of the above mentioned are in order to use this drug in daily clinical practice.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116Rog1a]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Limitations in the review process should also be noted. Due to being poorly reported or presented in a format which was not amenable to meta-analysis, some data were excluded, leading to missing or incomplete information for some comparisons. Although exclusion of these data was necessary to ensure consistency and rigor in the review process, this meant that sample sizes were small for many comparisons and it is possible that their inclusion may have impacted our results, urging caution in the interpretation of these findings. We addressed this limitation to some extent via sensitivity analysis by RoB; however, this was not possible for all comparisons or outcomes due to the small number of included studies. Moreover, studies in languages other than English were excluded due to resource and time constraints, and some full texts were not found; hence, potentially relevant results may have been excluded from the review. Lastly, publication bias cannot be ruled out given that this could not be adequately judged by inspection of funnel plots, since less than 10 studies were assessed in each analysis, and grey literature (unpublished work) was not sourced or included in the review.

In summary, anti-androgens may have possible benefits on clinical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hirsutism) in combination with effective contraception but, per guideline recommendations, should be used in circumstances where COCP (and/or cosmetic options including mechanical laser and light therapies for hair reduction) are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or have been ineffective for a minimum period.

### Spironolactone for hypertension [^114tVnfi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, considered fourth-line therapy for hypertension in patients already treated with multiple medications.

- **Objectives**: Primary: to determine the effect of spironolactone on patient mortality, morbidity, and to quantify the magnitude of blood pressure lowering effect of spironolactone monotherapy. Secondary: to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions observed with spironolactone monotherapy and to determine if there is a blood-pressure lowering dose response with spironolactone.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (2005 - Sept. 2009), and EMBASE (2007 - Sept. 2009). References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension, and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.

- **Main results**: Meta-analysis of the five cross-over studies found a reduction in SBP of 20.09 mmHg (95% CI: 16.58–23.06, p < 0.00001) and a 6.75 mmHg (95% CI: 4.8–8.69, p < 0.00001) reduction in DBP. These results were statistically significant.

### SPL drug information for spironolactone [^1157mmoL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of spironolactone PO (also known as Aldactone, Carospir) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is recommended to avoid its use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Spironolactone PO is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. However, studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Testosterone therapy in women: A clinical challenge [^113GdaWk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The physiology of testosterone as a normal female hormone in reproductive years and beyond is poorly taught and understood. This has led to unregulated and dangerous prescribing practices by physicians and other healthcare professionals. There are data for safe use, and as women's healthcare practitioners, we owe it to our patients to follow these guidelines and practices, as well as advocate for more research and safer, regulated products to prescribe.

### Otrexup [^113HPvZg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise females of reproductive potential that Otrexup can cause fetal harm and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should ensure pregnancy is excluded before starting Otrexup. They must be fully informed of the serious risk to the fetus if they become pregnant while undergoing treatment. Patients should contact their physician if they suspect pregnancy [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during Otrexup therapy and for six months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Similarly, males of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during therapy and for three months following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Infertility**: Patients of reproductive potential should be advised that Otrexup may impair fertility, potentially leading to oligospermia and menstrual dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Lactation**: Females should not breastfeed during treatment with Otrexup and for one week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^115yRv3M]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the somewhat limited evidence available, some tentative conclusions can still be drawn. First, at a daily dose of 200 mg, spironolactone was found to be significantly superior to placebo versus inflamed lesions in a crossover trial, in which 21 of 29 women completed 3 months of treatment. Baseline imbalance and a possible carryover effect of spironolactone into the second phase would have reduced the magnitude of the difference in efficacy between spironolactone and placebo, which was already large. This statistically significant result was not reported by the authors of a frequently cited Cochrane review, which evaluated the effects of spironolactone for hirsutism and acne. Equally, the Cochrane review may have also inadvertently misled authors of subsequent reports by stating that "there was no evidence for effectiveness [of spironolactone] for the treatment of acne vulgaris". In contrast to the crossover trial, no conclusions can be drawn from the two parallel group comparisons versus placebo regarding the absolute efficacy of lower doses of spironolactone. Spironolactone appeared to be more effective than placebo, but by how much was not quantified and indeed the difference may not have been clinically significant. The very low-quality evidence provided by the case series consistently shows that lower doses do have a measure of anti-acne activity, but they contributed no information on relative efficacy.

The trials that assessed comparative efficacy versus the anti-androgens flutamide, finasteride, cimetidine, ketoconazole, and various COCs consistently found no evidence of effectiveness of spironolactone for acne.

### Anti-androgenic therapy using oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in Asians [^116YLPm9]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Few studies have addressed anti-androgenic therapy using oral spironolactone for acne in Asians. Obtaining this race-specific information is important because Westerners and Asians respond differently to hormone therapy. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of oral spironolactone used to treat acne in Asians.

- **Methods**: Spironolactone (initial dose, 200 mg/day) was administered orally to 139 Japanese patients (116 females and 23 males) with acne. Serum laboratory data, including various hormones and electrolytes, were examined for 25 of the subjects.

- **Results**: Most of the female patients who completed the 20-week regimen exhibited excellent improvement (evaluated by a photographic grading scale), although some discontinued treatment because of menstrual disturbances or other reasons. The treatment was less efficacious for the males than for the females, and because gynecomastia developed in three male patients, spironolactone treatment for males was stopped. Examination of the serum of 25 patients did not identify any toxicity associated with the treatment. Drug eruptions and edema in the lower extremities were each seen in three patients.

- **Conclusion**: Oral spironolactone is effective and safe for the treatment of acne in Asian females, and can be a good option for severe, recurring, and widespread types of the condition.

### Tlando [^116EcK2E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tlando is contraindicated in pregnant women and not indicated for use in females [see Contraindications (4)] due to its teratogenic nature, which may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. This is based on data from animal studies [see Data] and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. In animal developmental studies, in utero exposure to testosterone resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring, as well as structural impairments of reproductive tissues in both female and male offspring. These studies did not meet standards for nonclinical development toxicity studies.

- **Data**:
	- In developmental studies conducted in rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus monkeys, pregnant animals received intramuscular injections of testosterone during the period of organogenesis. Testosterone treatment at doses comparable to those used for testosterone replacement therapy resulted in structural impairments in both female and male offspring.

	- **Female offspring impairments**: Increased anogenital distance, phallus development, empty scrotum, absence of external vagina, intrauterine growth retardation, reduced ovarian reserve, and increased ovarian follicular recruitment.
	- **Male offspring impairments**: Increased testicular weight, larger seminal tubular lumen diameter, and higher frequency of occluded tubule lumen. Increased pituitary weight was seen in both sexes.

### Cyproterone acetate for hirsutism [^111ZPWsn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is a distressing and relatively common endocrine problem in women, which may prove difficult to manage. Cyproterone acetate, an anti-androgen, is frequently used to treat hirsutism, usually in combination with ethinyl estradiol.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of cyproterone acetate alone, or in combination with ethinyl estradiol, in reducing hair growth in women with hirsutism secondary to ovarian hyperandrogenism.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register was searched (last search - June 4, 2002). The register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (1980 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), PsycINFO (1987 to 2002), and CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2002 of the Cochrane Library), including the handsearching of several journals and conference proceedings, as well as searches of several key grey literature sources. All publications of randomized controlled trials of cyproterone acetate with or without estrogen versus placebo or other drug therapies for hirsutism were identified.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled studies comparing cyproterone acetate to placebo, cyproterone acetate with ethinyl estradiol to placebo, cyproterone acetate with ethinyl estradiol to cyproterone acetate alone, and cyproterone acetate (with or without estradiol) to other medical therapies for the treatment of hirsutism were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Eleven studies were identified which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Nine randomized studies were included in the analysis.

Overdosage:

There have been no reports of serious deleterious effects from the overdosage of Slynd. Symptoms that may occur include nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. There are no antidotes available, and treatment should be aimed at providing symptomatic support.

Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue and has anti-mineralocorticoid properties. Therefore, serum potassium and sodium levels, as well as evidence of metabolic acidosis, should be monitored in cases of overdose.

### Effect of spironolactone and cyproterone acetate on breast growth in transgender people: A randomized clinical trial [^117GYZU3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

People with a female or nonbinary gender whose sex was recorded male at birth commonly use antiandrogens with estradiol to induce physical changes such as breast development, body fat redistribution, and decreased facial and body hair. Antiandrogens decrease the effects and/or synthesis of testosterone through androgen receptor antagonism, inhibition of synthetic enzymes, and/or suppression of gonadotrophins. Common antiandrogens include spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, but the use of nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonists (e.g. bicalutamide), gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues, progestogens, and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors is well described.

Cyproterone acetate causes potent progestogenic suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and moderate androgen receptor antagonism. It is associated with greater suppression of serum testosterone than spironolactone, but the effects on feminization remain unclear. A systematic review of antiandrogens in transgender people identified low-quality studies which suggested that cyproterone acetate, progestogens, and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues resulted in greater suppression of serum total testosterone concentrations than spironolactone or estradiol alone. Subsequently, a 12-week single-blinded randomized trial in transgender people on estradiol showed that those using cyproterone acetate had lower median serum total testosterone concentrations compared to spironolactone (0.26 nmol/L vs 14.23 nmol/L, P < 0.001). These findings supported cross-sectional data but unfortunately did not include clinically relevant outcomes.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^117PMqF4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Women with non-classic CAH may present in adolescence or adulthood with hirsutism, ovulatory dysfunction, or infertility, or they may even be asymptomatic. They are often clinically indistinguishable from women with PCOS. Importantly, women with non-classic CAH may show a PCOM appearance on transvaginal ultrasound in 30%–40% of cases. Women with CAH are less likely to have oligomenorrhoea than those with PCOS (17%–30% vs. 80%), whereas raised LH, insulin resistance, and higher body weight are more common in PCOS.

A family history of CAH is an important clue to the diagnosis. Identifying women with non-classic CAH highlights the selective use of glucocorticoids as a treatment option for hirsutism, alongside other measures such as the combined oral contraceptive pill. This also has wider implications, for example, for fertility and pre-pregnancy genetic counselling. Therefore, 17OHP should be included in the initial evaluation of women with suspected androgen excess. Whereas a raised 17OHP above 30 nmol/L is considered diagnostic for CAH, a mildly raised 17OHP > 5–7 nmol/L taken in the early follicular phase should alert clinicians to the possibility of underlying CAH and trigger a synthetic ACTH-stimulated 17OHP measurement. It should be noted that 17OHP levels may also be significantly elevated in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, and therefore adrenal imaging is recommended at diagnosis in adulthood.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^117DGa4T]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

One contributor to sodium retention could be the under-dosing of background diuretic treatment. An alternative or additional possibility is that some patients with resistant hypertension have undetected aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs). Recent studies have shown that specific somatic mutations in the adrenal gland can result in micro-APAs, which are difficult to detect by conventional imaging. Additionally, some high-renin patients will have an element of secondary aldosteronism, explaining why spironolactone retains some efficacy at the upper end of the renin distribution. Determination of whether spironolactone is particularly effective in treating resistant hypertension because it antagonizes the effects of aldosterone will require a head-to-head comparison of spironolactone with an increase in the dose of the background diuretic.

As well as being the most effective treatment for resistant hypertension, spironolactone was well tolerated. The doses of spironolactone used in the present study are low compared with the 200–400 mg daily used in other clinical circumstances. The 25–50 mg daily doses in PATHWAY-2 are consistent with previous studies of resistant hypertension in which 25 mg was the most common daily dose. These studies have shown that the main biochemical effects associated with spironolactone treatment are a reduction in serum sodium and an increase in potassium. We noted a magnitude of change (–1.19 mmol/L in sodium and 0.45 mmol/L in potassium) very similar to that reported in summary data from previous studies. Despite almost 14% of our patients having typ…

### Aveed [^113xSiUV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Aveed is contraindicated in pregnant women. Testosterone is teratogenic and may cause fetal harm based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. In animal development studies, exposure to testosterone in utero resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring and structural impairments of reproductive tissues in both female and male offspring. These studies did not meet standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies.

- **Data**:

- **Animal data**: In developmental studies conducted in rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus monkeys, pregnant animals received intramuscular injection of testosterone during the period of organogenesis. Testosterone treatment at doses that were comparable to those used for testosterone replacement therapy resulted in structural impairments in both female and male offspring.
	- **Female structural impairments**: Increased anogenital distance, phallus development, empty scrotum, no external vagina, intrauterine growth retardation, reduced ovarian reserve, and increased ovarian follicular recruitment.
	- **Male structural impairments**: Increased testicular weight, larger seminal tubular lumen diameter, and higher frequency of occluded tubule lumen.
	- Increased pituitary weight was observed in both sexes.

Testosterone exposure in utero also resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring, with hypertension observed in some cases.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111J3t7t]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) was published in 2015 in the journal Lancet. The study focused on drug-resistant hypertension. The primary research question was whether spironolactone was superior to add-on doxazosin in patients with drug-resistant hypertension.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 335 patients (105 females, 230 males). The inclusion criteria required patients to be aged 18–79 years with a seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months. Key exclusion criteria included secondary or accelerated hypertension, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.

- **Interventions**:
	- N = 285 received spironolactone (25 mg/day through week 6, with forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12).
	- N = 282 received doxazosin (4 mg/day through week 6, with forced uptitration to 8 mg/day through week 12).

- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in the reduction of home SBP was observed from week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.7 mmHg; absolute difference 4.03 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.02 to 5.04).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant reduction in home SBP at week 12.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^112pcqAL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The findings of this systematic review have several key implications for future research. First, there is an urgent need for a well-designed, adequately powered RCT versus placebo, preferably of monotherapy, so that it is possible to establish whether spironolactone is effective against inflamed and non-inflamed lesions without concomitant use of a topical agent that would inhibit comedogenesis. Women who are stably maintained on an oral contraceptive can be considered for inclusion in such a trial, as long as they remain on the oral contraceptive throughout and have been taking it sufficiently long enough for any anti-acne effect to be maximized. If such a study confirms the utility of spironolactone, then head-to-head comparisons versus widely used oral therapies (antibiotics, COCs, isotretinoin) could follow. The need for and utility of combinations could also be explored. Within these trials, validated outcome measures should be carefully selected, and any dose-related effect on sebum secretion should be explored early on.

Monitoring serum androgens within such RCTs is unnecessary unless the trial is intended to identify subgroups of women less or more likely to benefit based, at least in part, on a combination of hormone profiles and clinical presentation.

### Drug treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome [^1129czrJ]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition present in approximately 5 to 10 percent of women of childbearing age. Diagnosis can be difficult because the signs and symptoms can be subtle and varied. These may include hirsutism, infertility, menstrual irregularities, and biochemical abnormalities, most notably insulin resistance. Treatment should target specific manifestations and individualized patient goals. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians must take into account comorbidities and the patient's desire for pregnancy. Lifestyle modifications should be used in addition to medical treatments for optimal results. Few agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for use in polycystic ovary syndrome, and several agents are contraindicated in pregnancy.

Insulin-sensitizing agents are indicated for most women with polycystic ovary syndrome because they have positive effects on insulin resistance, menstrual irregularities, anovulation, hirsutism, and obesity. Metformin has the most data supporting its effectiveness. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are also effective for ameliorating hirsutism and insulin resistance. Metformin and clomiphene, alone or in combination, are first-line agents for ovulation induction. Insulin-sensitizing agents, oral contraceptives, spironolactone, and topical eflornithine can be used in patients with hirsutism.

Composite outcomes in cardiovascular trials often group events of unequal clinical importance, and conventional analyses may obscure treatment trade-offs. Generalised pairwise comparisons (GPC), expressed as a win ratio (WR), allow for hierarchical ranking of events and incorporation of outcomes, providing a potentially more intuitive assessment of benefit-risk.

- **Methods**: In a prespecified exploratory analysis of the 2×2 factorial, randomised CLEAR (Colchicine and Spironolactone in Patients with Myocardial Infarction) trial (7062 patients within 72 hours of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and percutaneous coronary intervention), we applied both time-to-first and recurrent-event GPC to reassess low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) and spironolactone (25 mg daily) versus placebo. For the colchicine comparison, the hierarchical benefit-risk outcome included all-cause death, stroke, reMI, unplanned ischaemia-driven revascularisation, serious infection, or diarrhea. For the spironolactone comparison, the outcome included all-cause death, stroke, MI, new or worsening heart failure, significant ventricular arrhythmia, hyperkalemia, or gynaecomastia/gynaecomastia. GPC results were compared with Cox, logistic, and Andersen-Gill models.

- **Results**: For colchicine, the time-to-first event GPC showed a 12% lower proportional win rate compared with placebo (WR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; win difference -2.10%, 95% CI -3.84 to -0.37), driven largely by excess diarrhea. For spironolactone, patients experienced a 14% lower win rate (WR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; win dif

### Spironolactone in dermatology: Uses in acne and beyond [^117Cea4c]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is a synthetic aldosterone receptor antagonist and is used off-label in various dermatological conditions. Its antiandrogenic properties make it suitable for diseases characterized by excess androgen production, leading to unwanted and psychologically distressing manifestations in susceptible females. Treatment with spironolactone aims to attenuate androgen-mediated conditions, including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, female pattern hair loss, and hirsutism.

We discuss the emerging utility of spironolactone in dermatology, its potential adverse effects, and considerations for monitoring.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^117Mno5k]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Recommendations suggest the use of the COCP alone with cosmetic therapy for at least 6 months prior to considering antiandrogens. Where COCPs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, and in the presence of effective forms of contraception, antiandrogens could be considered to treat hirsutism or androgen-related alopecia. The use of effective contraception is essential due to the teratogenic potential of antiandrogens and their impairment of external genital development in male fetuses.

This conditional evidence-based recommendation of very low GRADE quality was based mainly on studies in adult women and included the use of flutamide, finasteride, or spironolactone alone or in combination with a diet intervention. The reported side effects were gastrointestinal, including mild elevation of transaminases. There was only one study including a small number of adolescents with PCOS (n = 14) that evaluated finasteride, but it lacked a direct comparison between groups and did not report side effects. There was insufficient evidence to make an evidence-based recommendation in relation to the efficacy of specific types of antiandrogens; the trials included small numbers of subjects and some were not RCTs [see Section 4.6 in the Technical Report].

This recommendation was also informed by the Endocrine Society guidelines for the management of hirsutism, which recommend the use of cosmetic and COCP therapy as the first-line treatment for hirsutism in women with PCOS.

### Spironolactone in adolescent acne vulgaris [^111y6w6P]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (AV) is the most common skin condition affecting adolescents, most likely due to elevated androgen levels during puberty. Androgens stimulate and enlarge the sebaceous glands and keratinocytes, resulting in increased production of sebum and abnormal hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, which lead to the formation of acne lesions. Standard care for AV includes topical therapies for mild cases and antibiotics or oral retinoids for severe cases.

In recent years, spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist and diuretic, has been applied to the treatment of AV due to its anti-androgen effects. Spironolactone is currently recommended for women who use oral contraceptives, are refractory to or contraindicated for standard treatment, show clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, or present with late-onset or persistent AV past the teenage years. It is not prescribed to adolescents due to potential side effects. However, data studying adults indicate that most side effects are mild, and that potential associations with hyperkalemia and increased risk of cancer are not sufficiently supported. Hence, we believe that spironolactone may be a safe and effective therapy for adolescent AV.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^1135W71s]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). High credibility.

This systematic review, while endorsing key aspects of expert opinion with hard data and providing new insights, highlights important gaps in the evidence regarding the optimal use of oral spironolactone for managing acne in women. The review identifies key areas needing clarification, such as:

- **Optimum dose and dosing regimen**: The best strategies to maximize benefits while minimizing the risk of side effects.
- **Lowest effective dose**: Determining the minimal effective dose required for optimal outcomes.
- **Possible requirement for concomitant therapies**: The necessity and identification of potential complementary treatments.
- **Responsive types of acne**: Identifying which types of acne are likely to respond.
- **Effectiveness compared to standard therapies**: Comparing spironolactone's efficacy with other standard treatments.

Interestingly, several acne treatment guidelines and recommendations include spironolactone based on consensus or expert opinion. However, other guidelines either do not mention it or declare it ineffective, not recommended, or lacking sufficient supporting evidence. These guidelines, even those claiming to be evidence-based, have failed to identify most of the studies included in this review.

Despite the unavailability of five relevant studies, two of which are likely duplicate publications of included case series, we are confident that all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating spironolactone for acne in women have been retrieved, and no clinical trial evidence has been overlooked. Until higher-quality evidence becomes available, guideline developers will need to rely on recommendations based largely on expert experience or consensus from expert panels.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^111kApTA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Two authors of this review confirm that, based on their extensive experience with the successful use of the drug to treat large numbers of women with persistent or late-onset acne, spironolactone is pivotal to their clinical practice. Such experience suggests that the important role of spironolactone in this hard-to-manage patient population has been largely underrecognized and provided the rationale for this systematic review. The review highlighted a paucity of high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females. The results should not be misinterpreted to mean that the drug is ineffective at safe dosages but rather that there is a lack of robust evidence to support expert opinion, which currently drives treatment recommendations either for, or against more widespread use.

Every one of the 10 RCTs was at high risk of bias, with the most common reason being lack of blinding. Even in the more recent trials, sample sizes were not justified by reporting power calculations or the assumptions on which they had been based. This lack of difference in efficacy between treatments might have been due, at least in part, to insufficient power. Moreover, as no single outcome measure had been used consistently across the trials, pooling of data from similar comparisons was not possible.

The trials fell into two categories:

- **Spironolactone monotherapy versus placebo**
- **Mono or combination therapy versus active treatment**.

GRADE assessments of the quality of the trials indicated the varying degrees of bias present in the conducted studies.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111yj9hp]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The PATHWAY-2 study, published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet, investigated treatments for drug-resistant hypertension. The study focused on evaluating whether spironolactone is superior as an add-on to bisoprolol in patients with drug-resistant hypertension.

- **Study design**: The trial was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.
- **Population**: The study included 335 patients, consisting of 105 females and 230 males.

	- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients aged 18–79 years with a seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months.
	- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusions were secondary or accelerated hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Spironolactone group (n = 285)**: Participants received 25 mg/day for the first 6 weeks, increasing to 50 mg/day through week 12.
	- **Bisoprolol group (n = 285)**: Participants received 5 mg/day for the first 6 weeks, increasing to 10 mg/day through week 12.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant reduction in home SBP from week 6 to week 12, with a reduction of 12.8 mmHg for spironolactone compared to 8.3 mmHg for bisoprolol (adjusted difference of 4.48 mmHg, 95% confidence interval 3.46 to 5.5).

- **Secondary outcomes**: The study also evaluated additional reductions in home SBP, though detailed results for secondary outcomes are not fully provided here.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and/or acne [^111xVCSq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women and is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. It is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones, also known as androgens. Additionally, hirsutism is affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in the hair follicles and the secretory glands around the hair follicles, called sebaceous glands. Spironolactone is an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist used to treat this condition.

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone, either alone or in combination with steroids (including oral contraceptive pills), in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

To achieve this, we searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register, with the last search conducted on 12 June 2003. This register is compiled from regular searches of medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL, as well as the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings. Searches of key grey literature sources were also included. Furthermore, all reference lists of relevant trials were examined, and drug companies were contacted for details of unpublished trials.

All randomized controlled comparisons were included, with categories such as spironolactone versus placebo, steroids (oral contraceptive pill included), spironolactone at varying dosages, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

Seven trials were included in the review.

### Slynd [^112NRQjC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Slynd contains drospirenone, a progestin with anti-mineralocorticoid activity, which includes the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk females. This effect is comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Slynd is contraindicated in females with conditions such as renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency that predispose them to hyperkalemia. Females on daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium checked before starting and during the first treatment cycle.

- **Monitoring and risk management**: Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in females at increased risk for hyperkalemia, particularly those taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term alongside Slynd. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Continuous monitoring is advised for females on Slynd who later develop medical conditions or start medications that increase their hyperkalemia risk.

Most females with hyperkalemia in the clinical development of Slynd experienced mild potassium elevations and/or isolated increases that normalized during continued use of the medication. No adverse reactions were attributed to hyperkalemia. In a pivotal trial, two females (0.2%) discontinued Slynd due to persistent potassium elevations.

Epidemiological studies have not indicated a significant association with thromboembolic disorders.

### Imatinib and spironolactone suppress hepcidin expression [^115psTgB]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

The potential for drug re-positioning was assessed, particularly focusing on the safety profile of imatinib and spironolactone. Imatinib is excluded from re-positioning possibilities due to its safety concerns. This compound may cause peripheral edema, nausea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Moreover, patients on imatinib might develop congestive heart failure as a result of severe left ventricular dysfunction.

In contrast, spironolactone presents relatively minor adverse effects. Approved in 1959 and initially used as supplementary therapy for refractory hypertension, it is generally well-tolerated. Nevertheless, its antiandrogenic effects have been reported, primarily due to cross-reactivity with the androgen receptor and alterations in the peripheral metabolism of testosterone. These properties led to undesirable effects in males, such as gynecomastia, but were beneficial in treating conditions like acne and hirsutism in females. In women, spironolactone treatment often caused menstrual irregularities and increased diuresis, although these side effects were transient and usually not significant enough to warrant discontinuation of treatment.

The safety profile of spironolactone, together with its potential to influence hepcidin levels in vivo, makes it a promising candidate for repurposing for diseases characterized by elevated hepcidin synthesis. However, it remains to be tested whether spironolactone can modulate hepcidin expression under disease-associated conditions, such as inflammation, and whether prolonged spironolactone-mediated hepcidin suppression influences tissue iron content.

### Spironolactone versus placebo or in combination with steroids for hirsutism and/or acne [^115wuSuG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is the presence of excessive hair growth in women, which is an important cosmetic condition often resulting in severe distress. It is most often caused by increased production of male sex hormones, also known as androgens. Additionally, it is affected by increased sensitivity to androgens in hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Spironolactone, an antiandrogen and aldosterone antagonist, is used to treat hirsutism. Since 1978, many studies have been conducted to determine its effectiveness. The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone, alone or in combination with steroids (including oral contraceptive pills), in reducing excess hair growth and/or acne in women.

- **Search strategy**: All publications of randomized controlled trials of spironolactone versus placebo and/or in combination with steroids (including oral contraceptive pills) were identified. The search strategy was developed by the Menstrual Disorder Group. All accessible electronic databases were searched. Furthermore, all reference lists of relevant trials were examined, and drug companies were contacted for details of unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled comparisons of spironolactone versus placebo, steroids (including oral contraceptive pills), varying dosages of spironolactone, or spironolactone and steroids versus steroids alone were included when used to reduce hair growth and acne in women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Six trials were included in the review, while seven trials were excluded.

### Nikki [^113wUtrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with anti-mineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. The estrogen in Nikki is ethinyl estradiol.

- **Contraception**: Two studies evaluated the effect of 3 mg DRSP / 0.02 mg EE combinations on the suppression of ovarian activity, as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone (progesterone and estradiol) analyses during two treatment cycles (21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period). More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP / 0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen.

- **Acne**: Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of EE and DRSP increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, further information on its effect was unavailable due to truncation.

### Ovarian cyst in a premature infant treated with spironolactone [^11744UJo]. American Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

We describe the late occurrence of an ovarian cyst in a premature infant, the second of a set of monochorionic diamnionic twins, during treatment with spironolactone. Spironolactone is commonly used in the management of neonatal chronic lung disease in combination with other diuretics because of its potassium-sparing effect. It has progestational activity and has been reported to cause gynecomastia. It is used widely for its antiandrogenic properties in the treatment of female hirsutism and hyperandrogenism, and it plays a role in managing familial male-limited precocious puberty. However, the estrogenic influence induced during therapy may significantly alter the hormonal milieu in newborn females, resulting in the formation of ovarian cysts. Simple ovarian lesions under 5 cm merit close ultrasonographic surveillance for resolution, while larger complex masses may warrant surgical intervention.

### Animal models to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114jhm1d]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Pregnant women with PCOS provide the ideal opportunity to investigate the impact of PNA exposure on their female offspring, as it has recently been demonstrated that daughters of women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing PCOS. While there is no safe and ethical way to accomplish this, PNA and PAMH animal models offer translatable alternatives. PNA and PAMH mouse models, with or without DIO to mimic a key maternal PCOS condition, provide important models to investigate transgenerational effects and whether exposed lineages have increased susceptibility to a PCOS-like reproductive and metabolic phenotype in F1 to F3 offspring. These studies are analogous to those simulating maternal metabolic syndrome in mice and the transgenerational transmission of metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction in F1 to F3 offspring.

Recently, for the first time, it was demonstrated that PNA mice derived from F0 dams exposed to DHT during late pregnancy, but not maternal DIO, display both reproductive and metabolic PCOS-like phenotypes transmitted across generations, known as transgenerational transmission. More specifically, the PNA but not DIO lineage exhibits longer anogenital distance, irregular cycles, increased fat mass, enlarged adipocytes, and liver triglyceride content, as well as lower respiratory exchange ratio and energy expenditure. PNA lineage female mice may therefore demonstrate constrained switching between lipids and other carbon sources for energy metabolism during fasting.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^113TDUJC]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to hypertension. The trial question was: What is the role of add-on spironolactone in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? The study design was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population consisted of 335 patients (105 female, 230 male).

The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months. Key exclusion criteria included secondary/accelerated hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), eGFR < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.

The interventions included:

- **N = 285**: Spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12)
- **N = 274**: Placebo (matching placebo daily for 12 weeks)

The primary outcome was a significant increase in the reduction of home SBP from week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 4.1 mmHg; AD 8.7 mmHg, 95% CI 7.69 to 9.72). The secondary outcomes included a significant increase in the reduction of home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 4.2 mmHg; AD 10.2 mmHg, 95% CI 8.74 to 11.7).

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116aAjtF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hirsutism, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend avoiding testing for elevated androgen levels in eumenorrheic patients with unwanted local hair growth (in the absence of an abnormal hirsutism score) because of the low likelihood of identifying a medical disorder that would change management or outcome.

### SPL drug information for fludrocortisone acetate [^112ez66P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fludrocortisone PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is essential to monitor neonates for signs of hypoadrenalism. Complications, including cleft palate, stillbirth, and premature abortion, have been reported when corticosteroids were administered during pregnancy. The drug fludrocortisone PO is classified under category A in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Antiandrogen therapy in hidradenitis suppurativa: Finasteride for females [^112P3zfJ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Given its widely accepted efficacy, androgen blockade therapy for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) has become a standard of care. Although much less frequently used than spironolactone, a small number of HS studies have reported finasteride as an alternative treatment for women. In this study, we describe the response to and perception of finasteride therapy in a diverse cohort of women with HS.

- **Aim**: To describe finasteride therapy in a diverse cohort of female patients with HS.

- **Methods**: We conducted an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review and telephone survey of 20 female patients aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of HS. Finasteride was prescribed by a single provider at a specialized HS center.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 34.3 ± 13.5 years. Finasteride was initiated predominantly because of one or more contraindications or poor responsiveness to spironolactone. Most patients interviewed (90%; n = 18) were willing to take finasteride again or continue with therapy if indicated. Of the 20 patients, 10 (50%) reported overall satisfaction with finasteride, while 7 (35%) were neutral and 3 (15%) were dissatisfied. No patient reported worsening disease activity while on finasteride and only one (5%) reported decreased quality of life. When asked about adverse effects of finasteride, 80% (n = 16) reported none, while 20% (n = 4) experienced one or more of the following: headache, nausea, menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, or reduced libido/sexual function.

- **Conclusions**: Our study suggests that androgen blockade therapy with finasteride is promising for HS management in women.

### Severe hypokalaemia in primary aldosteronism during pregnancy [^113XJowA]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is rarely seen in pregnancy despite being a common cause of secondary hypertension. Spironolactone, the first-line treatment, is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential anti-androgenic effects; treatment options are thus limited. We present a case in which severe hypokalaemia associated with PA was discovered during pregnancy. Eplerenone was used as a short-term treatment without adverse effects on the fetus before unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in the second trimester after the patient was refractory to medical treatment. This case report adds to the limited literature on the management of PA in pregnancy, which could influence future risk-benefit discussions regarding surgical versus medical management of this condition.

Regarding medical management for primary aldosteronism, specifically concerning mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, the ES 2025 guidelines recommend initiating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists over epithelial sodium channel inhibitors, such as amiloride or triamterene, in patients with PA receiving specific medical therapy. Exceptions include clinical conditions where spironolactone is contraindicated, such as hyperkalemia, advanced renal impairment, or pregnancy, or when a non-spironolactone mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is indicated for other non-PA conditions, such as heart failure.

### Topamax [^113EJ9iV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider the benefits and risks of topiramate when prescribing this drug to women of childbearing potential, particularly when topiramate is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death. Because of the risk of oral clefts to the fetus, which occur in the first trimester of pregnancy, all women of childbearing potential should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus from exposure to topiramate. Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of topiramate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients.

- **Labor or delivery**: Although the effect of Topamax on labor and delivery in humans has not been established, the development of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis in the mother and/or in the fetus might affect the fetus' ability to tolerate labor. Topamax treatment can cause metabolic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The effect of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis has not been studied in pregnancy; however, metabolic acidosis in pregnancy (due to other causes) can cause decreased fetal growth, decreased fetal oxygenation, and fetal death, and may affect the fetus' ability to tolerate labor. Pregnant patients should be monitored for metabolic acidosis and treated as in the nonpregnant state [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Newborns of mothers treated with Topamax should be monitored for metabolic acidosis due to the transfer of topiramate to the fetus.

### SPL drug information for flutamide [^111mxfGw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Flutamide is not intended for use in females, particularly pregnant patients in any trimester, due to the potential for fetal harm. The manufacturer considers flutamide contraindicated for females, especially for non-serious or non-life-threatening conditions. Although there are reports of flutamide being used for treating hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women, the potentially serious risks, such as life-threatening hepatotoxicity, should be carefully considered before prescribing this drug to any woman. Flutamide is classified in FDA pregnancy risk category D.
