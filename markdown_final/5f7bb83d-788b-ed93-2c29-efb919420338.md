## Question

What’s the first line for diabetes mellitus type 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line therapy is for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal foundation of lifestyle therapy. Then, I should verify the default pharmacologic first-line agent and why it is preferred. Next, I will examine the major guideline shifts that now allow GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors as alternate first-line choices in specific high-risk phenotypes. After that, I need to check when combination therapy at diagnosis is appropriate. Finally, I will consider special populations, cost/access constraints, and synthesize a practical decision framework with monitoring and escalation triggers.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: lifestyle interventions are first-line for everyone with type 2 diabetes, and I should not jump past that. Dietary patterns such as Mediterranean, plant-predominant, or low-carbohydrate approaches, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate activity, weight management, restorative sleep, and stress reduction are core, and they should be initiated and reinforced at diagnosis and ongoing visits [^260177ae] [^d1f1c037] [^8a25e568].

> Now, I need to verify the default pharmacologic first-line agent. Metformin remains the preferred initial medication for most adults with type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated, owing to durable A1C lowering, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality or loss, favorable safety profile, and low cost. This is consistently endorsed by ADA/EASD, AAFP, and Canadian guidelines, and supported by long-standing clinical experience and cost-effectiveness considerations [^c75549e5] [^41baddc5] [^209f8081] [^9b450c04].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that metformin is the only first-line option. I should review the paradigm shift: contemporary guidelines now recommend that in patients with established ASCVD, high ASCVD risk, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven cardiorenal benefit should be considered as first-line or early add-on, independent of baseline A1C, because these agents reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalization, and kidney outcomes. This is reflected in ADA/EASD consensus, AACE, VA/DoD, and BMJ guidance, and is a key departure from older algorithms [^c75549e5] [^1ddee0cd] [^3bdadfae] [^35d9d31a] [^74766923].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about "first-line" versus "preferred". Some summaries say ADA no longer recommends metformin as first-line in all patients; that overstates the change. ADA still lists metformin as preferred for most, but explicitly elevates GLP-1 RAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors to first-line consideration in the presence of ASCVD, HF, or CKD, and emphasizes a complication-centric, patient-centered approach rather than a one-size-fits-all metformin mandate [^c75549e5] [^9d6b2de9].

> I should double-check when to start combination therapy at diagnosis. In adults with marked hyperglycemia, such as A1C greater than 1.5% above the individualized target or A1C at or above 10%, guidelines support initiating combination therapy to more rapidly achieve goals and mitigate glucotoxicity; the choice of second agent should align with comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and patient preferences, with metformin typically as the backbone when tolerated [^3aa90611] [^d76bacae] [^ae6f8169].

> Next, I should review special populations and exceptions. In children and adolescents, metformin is first-line unless insulin is indicated for severe hyperglycemia or ketosis; in older adults, I need to balance glycemic targets with hypoglycemia risk and functional status; in pregnancy or planned pregnancy, insulin is preferred and metformin may be considered when insulin is not feasible; in advanced CKD, metformin is generally avoided when eGFR is below 30, and SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs may be favored based on kidney function and cardiorenal benefit profiles [^24fd2f2b] [^6e11d149] [^6c60c230] [^1ddee0cd].

> I need to ensure I address cost and access, because these often determine real-world first-line choices. Metformin's low cost and wide availability sustain its role as the practical default in many settings, whereas SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs, despite robust outcome data, face formulary barriers and higher out-of-pocket costs; shared decision-making should explicitly incorporate affordability, insurance coverage, and health equity considerations to avoid therapeutic inertia and disparities [^9d6b2de9] [^bf21f956] [^50574f92].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. For most patients without ASCVD, HF, or CKD, start with lifestyle therapy and metformin, titrating to tolerance and adding a second agent if A1C remains above target after 3–6 months. For patients with established ASCVD, high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, prioritize a GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven benefit, with metformin when not contraindicated. For marked hyperglycemia at diagnosis, consider initial combination therapy. Throughout, individualize based on age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and patient preferences, and reassess quarterly to avoid inertia [^c75549e5] [^1ddee0cd] [^3aa90611] [^6e11d149].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implementation details. Start metformin low with meals and titrate to reduce GI effects; in eGFR below 45, use caution and generally avoid below 30; when adding SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs, counsel on adverse effects, monitor volume status and renal function, and coordinate with cardiovascular or nephrology care as indicated; and remember that most patients will eventually require combination therapy as beta-cell function declines, so set expectations early and plan for escalation [^f887ff34] [^1ddee0cd] [^d6b21ae5].

Metformin is the **first-line pharmacologic therapy** for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) unless contraindicated or not tolerated, owing to its efficacy, safety, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality or loss, and low cost [^41baddc5] [^9b450c04]. Lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise, weight loss) are **essential at diagnosis** and should continue throughout care [^260177ae] [^d1f1c037]. In patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, **SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists** should be initiated early, regardless of A1C, due to their cardiovascular and renal benefits [^c75549e5] [^1ddee0cd]. Metformin should be started at 500 mg twice daily with meals and titrated to 2,000 mg/day if tolerated, with dose adjustment for renal function (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^f887ff34].

---

## Lifestyle interventions as foundational therapy

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of T2DM management and should be initiated at diagnosis and continued throughout treatment [^260177ae] [^d1f1c037]. These include:

- **Dietary modifications**: Emphasis on whole foods, plant-predominant diets, reduced refined carbohydrates, and portion control [^260177ae] [^8a25e568].

- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, supplemented by resistance training [^260177ae] [^6eec3708].

- **Weight loss**: Initial goal of 5–10% weight reduction to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control [^260177ae] [^5c7c17f9].

- **Behavioral support**: Structured programs and ongoing counseling to enhance adherence and sustainability [^260177ae] [^06fba6c6].

---

## Metformin: first-line pharmacologic therapy

Metformin is the **preferred initial pharmacologic agent** for T2DM unless contraindicated or not tolerated, based on its robust evidence base and favorable profile [^41baddc5] [^9b450c04].

---

### Mechanism of action

Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity, thereby lowering fasting glucose and A1C [^4122d360] [^f58a303a].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting metformin

- **Efficacy**: Reduces A1C by approximately 1–1.5% in monotherapy, with durable effects [^f59065fc].

- **Safety**: Low risk of hypoglycemia, weight neutrality or loss, and favorable cardiovascular profile [^9b450c04] [^f58a303a].

- **Mortality benefit**: Associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality compared to sulfonylureas and insulin [^4122d360] [^4e767a3a].

---

### Dosage and administration

- **Initial dose**: 500 mg twice daily with meals to minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^f887ff34].

- **Titration**: Gradually increase to 2,000 mg/day if tolerated.

- **Renal function**: Adjust dose if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; avoid if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^notfound].

---

## Situations where metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated

Metformin should be avoided or discontinued in the following scenarios:

- **Renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or rapidly declining renal function [^notfound].

- **Hepatic disease**: Severe hepatic impairment or acute liver disease.

- **Risk of lactic acidosis**: Conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, or severe infection.

- **Gastrointestinal intolerance**: Persistent nausea, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort despite dose adjustment or use of extended-release formulations [^332efdc3].

---

## Alternative first-line therapies in special populations

Recent guidelines recognize that certain patients may benefit from **alternative first-line therapies**, particularly when comorbidities are present:

| **Patient population** | **Recommended alternative first-line therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Established ASCVD or high risk | GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors | - Cardiovascular risk reduction <br/> - Renal benefits [^c75549e5] [^1ddee0cd] |
| Heart failure | SGLT-2 inhibitors | - Reduced heart failure hospitalization <br/> - Cardiovascular death [^dc373b10] |
| Chronic kidney disease | SGLT-2 inhibitors | - Renal protection <br/> - Slowed progression of kidney disease [^c75549e5] [^1ddee0cd] |
| Obesity or significant weight concerns | GLP-1 receptor agonists | - Weight loss <br/> - Improved glycemic control [^7979cdce] |

---

## Combination therapy considerations

Combination therapy may be considered at diagnosis in patients with marked hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 1.5% above target) or when monotherapy fails to achieve glycemic targets. Common second-line agents include **SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and insulin**, selected based on patient-specific factors and comorbidities [^3aa90611] [^d76bacae].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **glycemic control, renal function, hepatic function, and cardiovascular risk factors** is essential. A1C should be checked at least twice yearly if stable, or quarterly if therapy changes or targets are unmet [^6e11d149].

---

Metformin remains the **first-line pharmacologic therapy** for T2DM, with lifestyle interventions as the foundation. Alternative therapies should be considered in patients with specific comorbidities or when metformin is contraindicated. Regular monitoring and individualized care are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^15f0ee9d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy.While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient.Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target.In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe.Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Should metformin still be the first-line of treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus? A comprehensive review and suggested algorithm [^cfd63b7b]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

For more than a century, the high occurrences of coronary and peripheral artery diseases in diabetes mellitus patients has been well recognised; despite that, the ability to improve CV event rates by optimizing glycaemic control has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen several cardiovascular outcome clinical trials (CVOTs) of many antihyperglycemic agents that reported promising results for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This leads to a hot debate on the ideal drug choice for first-line treatment in T2DM. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the use of metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and incretin-based therapies for the management of individuals with T2DM and, discuss the rationale for selection.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^c93ddd6c]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Metformin has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus as monotherapy or concomitantly with other glucose-lowering therapies due to its efficacy, safety, and affordability. Recent studies on the cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have influenced guidelines on diabetes management to consider these newer agents as alternative first-line therapies. This paper explores the literature supporting the use of these newer medications alone as a first-line agent in place of metformin.

Methods

A review of citations from the most recent guidelines along with a literature search via PubMed was completed to review (1) what, historically, made metformin first-line (2) if newer agents' benefits remain when used without metformin (3) how newer agents compare against metformin when used without it.

Results

Evaluation of the historical literature was completed to summarize the key findings that support metformin as a first-line therapy agent. Additionally, an assessment of the literature reveals that the benefits of these two newer classes are independent of concomitant metformin therapy. Finally, studies have demonstrated that these newer agents can be either non-inferior or sometimes superior to metformin when used as monotherapy.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i can be considered as first line monotherapies for select patients with high cardiovascular risks, renal disease, or weight loss requirements. However, pharmacoeconomic considerations along with lesser long-term safety outcomes should limit these agents' use in certain patients as the management of diabetes continues to transition towards shared-decision making.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^fc25c424]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01),although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control.However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

### What next after metformin in type 2 diabetes? Selecting the right drug for the right patient [^0d9bec04]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The evidence from this study can potentially be used to support better targeting of second-line T2DM therapy. The choice of which drug to offer after metformin should be based on the individual person’s phenotypic characteristics (including gender, age, BMI, eGFR and duration of T2DM), considering their treatment goals, extent of hyperglycaemia, comorbidities and the beneficial and adverse effects of each class of drug to select the right drug for the right patient.

### Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus with noninsulin pharmacotherapy [^41baddc5]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, metformin, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin as first-line therapy for the management of T2DM due to its effectiveness and low cost.

---

### What next after metformin in type 2 diabetes? Selecting the right drug for the right patient [^4931cf90]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses comparing the effectiveness of the different drug classes have demonstrated similar clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c for all classes of second-line drugs when they are added to metformin as dual therapy, but with differences in weight gain and risk of hypoglycaemia. However, the real-world effectiveness of these drugs in routine clinical practice is less well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the real-world efficacy profiles of OHAs following metformin monotherapy in terms of glycaemic control as a function of baseline phenotypic characteristics. By using data collected from routine primary care practice, the study will generate valuable evidence that is currently lacking to inform clinical decision making on the management of people with T2DM who have failed metformin monotherapy. A better understanding of patient profiles and treatment practices may lead to improved disease management through better targeting of second-line regimens according to demographic and clinical characteristics to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.

### Intensifying insulin therapy: what options are available to patients with type 2 diabetes? [^513abcb1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires practitioners to periodically evaluate patients and intensify therapy when glycemic targets become unattainable with their current treatment regimen. Traditional first- and second-line antidiabetic agents such as metformin and the sulfonylureas do not prevent the characteristic decline in beta-cell function associated with T2D; insulin replacement therapy can therefore quickly become a necessity in some patients. Basal insulin initiation provides an excellent platform to which rapid-acting prandial insulin doses can easily be added, potentially in a stepwise manner, as disease progresses. Premix insulin regimens are another effective intensification option following basal insulin initiation, but are most effective in insulin-naïve patients. The use of insulin in combination with modern T2D agents, such as the incretin-based therapies, has the potential to improve glycemic control while limiting insulin-associated weight gain and hypoglycemia. Further clinical data and approval are required before practitioners can fully endorse this novel approach.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^b8f3e5a5]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The International Diabetes Foundation recommended metformin as the gold standard first-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (DMII) in 2005 due to its proven efficacy and safety profile. In 2006, the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) also endorsed metformin as the first line medication in DMII. Metformin has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce the risk of microvascular complications, and improve cardiovascular outcomes independent of glucose control.

However, in a paradigm shift reflecting recent clinical data, the guidelines for management of DMII have been modified to elevate the use of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) and European Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ESC/EASD) both updated their treatment algorithms in 2019 to recommend the use of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i as alternate therapy options to metformin based on cardiovascular (CV) and renal comorbidities independent of glycemic control. This was followed by the ADA updating their 2021 guidelines with the same recommendation. In 2022, the ADA/EASD published a consensus report that removed metformin as the only first-line therapy and provided the emphasis of using GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2i as first line options in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease.

### What next after metformin? Thinking beyond glycaemia: are SGLT2 inhibitors the answer? [^07c55b3b]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Current T2DM Therapeutic Approach

In order to achieve normoglycaemia, patients with T2DM are initially managed with lifestyle modifications. For many patients whose blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone, glucose-lowering medications are required. Metformin is the most widely accepted first-line treatment for T2DM due to its high efficacy in reducing plasma glucose, good safety profile, tolerability and low cost. It also has beneficial effects beyond glycaemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, haemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles and fat redistribution.

Although there is general agreement for the use of metformin as first-line treatment for almost all patients with T2DM, there is uncertainty regarding the choice of second-line therapy once metformin is no longer effective in achieving recommended glycaemic targets. Various drug treatments have been approved [e.g. sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists]. However, the question of ‘what next after metformin?’, particularly in the context of the proliferation of therapy options, remains a complex clinical decision.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^bf21f956]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) 2023 type 2 diabetes algorithm—core themes emphasize lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus (DM) care, along with appropriate management of dyslipidemia and hypertension risk factors. A notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding lifestyle/pharmacologic choices, including decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for persons with DM. The algorithm also incorporates access/cost of medications as health equity factors in clinical decision-making, and acknowledges that health care disparities and lack of access to newer medications remain a significant barrier for some persons with DM.

### Is time ready for combination therapy at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes? [^3a8c5060]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence is showing a range of beneficial effects for GLP-1 receptor agonists and especially SGLT-2 inhibitors on the cardio-renal axis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Preliminary findings suggest that: 1- such benefit extends also to patients with T2D without pre-existing CVD; and 2- background therapies do not modify the effect of these drugs. Given these considerations, some authors advanced the hypothesis that these novel agents might undermine the first-line position of metformin in the treatment algorithm of T2D. Here, we briefly discuss some pros and cons of such scenario, proposing a "starting" combination therapy with metformin plus one novel agent with trial-proven benefit as the best option to make use of the available knowledge and minimize the risk of complications in patients with newly diagnosed T2D.

### Metformin monotherapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^4e767a3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, there is an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin is still the recommended first-line glucose-lowering drug for people with T2DM. Despite this, the effects of metformin on patient-important outcomes are still not clarified.

Objectives

To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy in adults with T2DM.

Search Methods

We based our search on a systematic report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and topped-up the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews, as well as health technology assessment reports and medical agencies. The date of the last search for all databases was 2 December 2019, except Embase (searched up 28 April 2017).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one year's duration comparing metformin monotherapy with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs in adults with T2DM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed risk of bias, and extracted outcome data independently. We resolved discrepancies by involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs with multiple study arms (N = 10,680). The percentage of participants finishing the trials was approximately 58% in all groups. Treatment duration ranged from one to 10.7 years. We judged no trials to be at low risk of bias on all 'Risk of bias' domains. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-fatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), non-fatal stroke (NFS), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Two trials compared metformin (N = 370) with insulin (N = 454). Neither trial reported on all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI, NFS or ESRD. One trial provided information on HRQoL but did not show a substantial difference between the interventions. Seven trials compared metformin with sulphonylureas. Four trials reported on all-cause mortality: in three trials no participant died, and in the remaining trial 31/1454 participants (2.1%) in the metformin group died compared with 31/1441 participants (2.2%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on SAE: in two trials no SAE occurred (186 participants); in the other trial 331/1454 participants (22.8%) in the metformin group experienced a SAE compared with 308/1441 participants (21.4%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported on CVM: in one trial no CVM was observed and in the other trial 4/1441 participants (0.3%) in the metformin group died of cardiovascular reasons compared with 8/1447 participants (0.6%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred, and in the other trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 15/1441 participants (1.0%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported no NFS occurred (very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Seven trials compared metformin with thiazolidinediones (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Five trials reported on all-cause mortality: in two trials no participant died; the overall RR was 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39; P = 0.57; 5 trials; 4402 participants). Four trials reported on SAE, the RR was 0,95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; P = 0.49; 3208 participants. Four trials reported on CVM, the RR was 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.39; P = 0.58; 3211 participants. Three trial reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred and in one trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 25/1456 participants (1.7%) in the thiazolidinedione group. One trial reported no NFS occurred. No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Three trials compared metformin with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (one trial each with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin with altogether 1977 participants). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI and NFS (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). One trial compared metformin with a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (very low-certainty evidence for all reported outcomes). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, CVM, NFMI and NFS. One or more SAEs were reported in 16/268 (6.0%) of the participants allocated to metformin compared with 35/539 (6.5%) of the participants allocated to a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue. HRQoL or ESRD were not reported. One trial compared metformin with meglitinide and two trials compared metformin with no intervention. No deaths or SAEs occurred (very low-certainty evidence) no other patient-important outcomes were reported. No trial compared metformin with placebo or a behaviour changing interventions. Four ongoing trials with 5824 participants are likely to report one or more of our outcomes of interest and are estimated to be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 trials with 2369 participants are awaiting assessment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear evidence whether metformin monotherapy compared with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs influences patient-important outcomes.

### Navigating the spectrum of 4 evidence-based nutrition options for type 2 diabetes management [^8a25e568]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, pervasive disease that creates a health and financial burden. The goal is to head off progression to insulin requirement, and dietary changes have been recognized as a first-line intervention in the treatment protocol. Four evidence-based nutritional options are reviewed and their benefits for metabolic consequences.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature using the PubMed database for recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and original research articles.

Evidence Synthesis

The Mediterranean and plant-based diets have demonstrated benefits for the prevention and treatment of diabetes, weight reduction, lipid improvements, and overall cardiovascular risk reduction. A low carbohydrate diet is another viable option for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, though it is not as uniformly defined and is difficult to maintain long term. The ketogenic diet is similarly very restrictive and produces significant HbA1c reductions.

Conclusion

Type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment is crucial in this widespread disease. The first-line treatment is lifestyle modifications with dietary interventions being at the forefront. With a unique clinical model and a variety of dietary options, our program strives for individualized evidence-based care. Nutritional modifications are the best initial approaches to overcoming insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. All dietary modifications, like any medical intervention, require education on benefits vs risks.

Specific advantages and disadvantages of individual main drug classes

Metformin.

Metformin as first-line therapy is in the general consensus, since its efficacy is similar to other antihyperglycemic drugs—besides insulin. It has a large safety margin and can be used by most patients other than a small number who experience gastrointestinal side effects. It decreases hepatic glucose production, has a mild effect on peripheral resistance, and increases both total and active endogenous glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 in response to food. Metformin might also be cardioprotective, mainly in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Moreover, recently published observational studies, as well as animal and cell-line studies, suggest that this drug might be effective in reducing cancer-related morbidity. Thus, metformin is accepted as first-line therapy by both guidelines and pathophysiologic reasoning.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^5c7c17f9]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus focus on three areas: intensive lifestyle intervention that includes at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity, weight loss with an initial goal of 7 percent of baseline weight, and a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet; aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria) with the use of aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; and normalization of blood glucose levels (hemoglobin A1C level less than 7 percent). Insulin resistance, decreased insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose output are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and each class of medication targets one or more of these defects. Metformin, which decreases hepatic glucose output and sensitizes peripheral tissues to insulin, has been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes and is considered a first-line agent. Other medications include sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. Insulin can be used acutely in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to normalize blood glucose, or it can be added to a regimen of oral medication to improve glycemic control. Except in patients taking multiple insulin injections, home monitoring of blood glucose levels has questionable utility, especially in relatively well-controlled patients. Its use should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent disease with incidences increasing globally at a rapid rate. The goal of T2DM treatment is to control glucose levels and prevent the aggravation of glycemic symptoms.

Treatment Options

T2DM regimen include metformin as the first-line, with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione (TZD), GLP-1, DPP4I, and SGLT2 inhibitor as the second-line treatment options. However, even with a multitude of choices, patient-to-patient variability due to pharmacogenomic differences still prevail.

Conclusion

This review aims to discuss the responses of the major T2DM medications influenced by pharmacogenomics and investigate improved personalized therapy for T2DM patients.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^f58a303a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Changes in treatment satisfaction over 3 years in patients with type 2 diabetes after initiating second-line treatment [^2acfb00e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The number of people with diabetes mellitus (DM) in Japan is growing. The prevalence has increased from 7.2 million patients in 2015 to 11 million patients in 2021. The treatment goals for diabetes are the prevention of the onset or exacerbation of comorbidities associated with DM, including micro- and macrovascular complications, as well as improvement in quality of life (QoL) of patients. Therefore, management of risk factors, including hyperglycemia, at each clinical visit is essential.

Since type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease, improving the QoL and preventing comorbidities associated with T2DM are important for the patient to lead a healthy life. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) was developed to assess and measure the quality of diabetes-specific treatment satisfaction with prescribed antidiabetic regimens. It is recommended by both the World Health Organization and International Diabetes Federation and is currently used worldwide. In Japan, a translated version of the DTSQ has been prepared and validated. Saisho highlighted that DTSQ can be used to compare treatment satisfaction and assess the quality of diabetes care in clinical settings, which will ultimately support a better understanding of patient needs and improve diabetes treatment.

The DISCOVERing Treatment Reality of Type 2 Diabetes in Real World Settings (DISCOVER) study program (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02322762 and NCT02226822 [DISCOVERing Treatment Reality of Type 2 Diabetes in Real World Setting in Japan; J-DISCOVER]) was set up to address the knowledge gaps in the management and clinical outcomes of patients with T2DM. The overarching aim of the program was to describe patient characteristics, evolution of disease management patterns, clinical outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes over 3 years in patients with T2DM who were initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy in a real-world setting. These patients were chosen as the focus of the study because of the diversity of treatment options recommended at this stage of the disease. A better understanding of practice variations across and within different countries, their determinants, and associated patient outcomes is key for providing effective treatment decisions.

Here we report the results of the DTSQ analysis from the J-DISCOVER study, which examined changes in treatment satisfaction over 3 years in 1798 Japanese patients with T2DM who had initiated a second-line glucose-lowering treatment (defined as an add-on option to first-line treatment of a glucose-lowering drug or a switch between treatments). The analysis aimed to identify factors related with treatment satisfaction after initiation of second-line treatment in patients who have a relatively short duration of the disease.

### Options for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: comparison of the ADA / EASD position statement and AACE / ACE algorithm [^6e576906]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Treating patients with diabetes is one of the most challenging and important activities a physician (primary care physician or specialist) can undertake. A key to successful therapy for type 2 diabetes is the insight that this condition is progressive and that the need for additional agents over time is normative. The ability to individualize therapy by patient and medication characteristics comes from experience and knowledge of pertinent clinical studies. However, guidelines from expert bodies such as the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology can help clinicians of all levels of expertise to approach therapy choices more rationally. There is unity across these guidelines about the role and benefits of metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment, probability of good efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, modest weight loss, and overall long-term data. Unfortunately, this unity does not extend to recommendations for subsequent pharmacological agents and their use in combination to intensify treatment when insulin is not (yet) appropriate. Across both statements, some drug classes seem more prominent, and looking at their benefit-risk profile, it is clear why this is the case. The most profound recent change in diabetes therapy has been the introduction of incretin therapies. Incretin therapies minimize 2 important adverse effects seen with many other therapies: hypoglycemia and weight gain. These agents have increased the range of options available for early intensification of treatment of type 2 diabetes. In combination with more established therapies, there are more opportunities than ever to accommodate patient preferences while improving glycemic control and harnessing extraglycemic benefits of a second (or third) agent.

### Secondary metformin monotherapy failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^d67f4e57]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Estimates from national studies and surveillance registries in the USA estimate the prevalence of diabetes among adults age 18 and older is 13%, of which 21.4% are undiagnosed.For most patients, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care state that ‘An A1C goal for many non-pregnant adults of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate’, although less stringent targets may be appropriate for some patients.Half of patients with T2DM have suboptimal glycemic control.Optimal glycemic control reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, obesity, and other microvascular complications.

Unless contraindicated, the ADA recommends metformin monotherapy (MM) as the first-line pharmacologic agent for T2DM treatment.Clinicians may consider second-line therapies on the basis of efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, weight change, side effects, and cost.If MM treatment does not result in glycemic control at a maximal tolerated dose over 3–6 months, individuals may receive either treatment intensification on top of metformin or switch to another antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) if metformin is not tolerated.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in developing countries: balancing optimal glycaemic control and outcomes with affordability and accessibility to treatment [^50574f92]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the ADA/EASD consensus statement, a patient-centred approach is the key. Factors such as efficacy in achieving glycaemic control, reduction of microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, safety, patient adherence and barriers, such as cost and access to therapies, must be considered when deciding on a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Considering all of these factors, and particularly where cost is an issue, the ADA/EASD consensus statement recommends metformin followed by a second-line sulfonylurea.

This review will, therefore, consider the evidence for efficacy, outcomes, availability and accessibility of these treatment options in the management of type 2 diabetes in restricted-resource settings.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^3c6d0cf6]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Case Studies

The glycemic management of type 2 diabetes requires clinicians to identify the most therapeutic combinations of treatments, with a maximum of three oral treatments being prescribed. The choice of initial therapy is usually clear, with metformin being identified as first-line therapy in asymptomatic individuals and those with eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and a sulfonylurea in symptomatic patients.

The choice of second-line therapy is more complicated, with factors such as weight, hypoglycemic risk, occupation, and age to be taken into consideration. Third-line treatment would be required if HbA1c remains at 58 mmol/mol or greater, or above the agreed target. Figure 2 was developed by one of the authors as a tool to facilitate treatment choices for patients with type 2 diabetes in response to local demands from healthcare professionals who wanted more guidance in oral hypoglycemic agents. Past experience has shown that some clinicians swap one treatment which was effective for another treatment and the HbA1c then declines. Figure 2 also indicates that HbA1c should be monitored after a new treatment has been initiated and that treatments which have not had the therapeutic effect of a 6 mmol/mol reduction in HbA1c should be discontinued. With an estimated £10 billion annually spent by the National Health Service on diabetes, which equates to £1 million each hour, it is imperative that treatments are discontinued if they are not proving to be effective.

Type 2 diabetes—antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Three-year glycaemic control and management in patients with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line treatment in Japan: a prospective observational study, J-DISCOVER [^f74b2722]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The DISCOVER study programme and J-DISCOVER in Japan were set up to address the knowledge gaps in the management and clinical outcomes of patients with T2DM. The overarching aim of the programme was to describe patient characteristics, evolution of disease management patterns and clinical outcomes over 3 years in patients with T2DM who were initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy in a real-world setting. These patients were chosen as the focus of the study because of the diversity of treatment options recommended at this stage of the disease. A better understanding of practice variations across and within different countries, and their determinants and associated patient outcomes, is key for providing effective treatment decisions.

Unlike ADA/EASD guidelines, the JDS guidelines do not specify metformin as the first-line glucose-lowering agent. Instead, first-line treatments are to be chosen in light of their pharmacological and adverse effect profiles, and depending on the individual patient’s disease condition. In patients for whom first-line treatment does not achieve HbA1c targets, consideration may be given to increasing the dose of the first-line treatment, switching to a more potent glucose-lowering agent, or combining the first-line treatment with another glucose-lowering agent with a different mechanism of action. Observational data on the treatment of patients with T2DM in Japan are available from large cohort studies. However, these studies are becoming outdated owing to the clinical availability of newer oral antidiabetic drugs, including sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). In addition, the previous studies enrolled patients exclusively from diabetes specialist settings and, as a result, many patients included had mid- to late-stage diabetes with a long disease duration. Furthermore, most of these studies focused on first-line treatment, and there has not been sufficient clinical data to describe real-world second-line treatment in Japan. Therefore, to obtain a holistic, up-to-date understanding of real-world T2DM treatment patterns in Japan, data from patients in the early stages of T2DM managed by both diabetes specialists and non-specialists (e.g. cardiologists, primary care physicians) are needed.

Here we report the results of the J-DISCOVER study, which examined real-world treatment and long-term glucose control, including individualized HbA1c targets, of patients with T2DM who were initiating second-line diabetes treatment, at both diabetes specialist and non-specialist sites across Japan, to understand clinical practice in the early disease stage.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Initial combination therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus: is it ready for prime time? [^6a6ddc87]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is primarily being driven by the increasing global rates of overweight/obesity. Given the magnitude of this epidemic, we can expect these metabolic abnormalities to play an increasing role in the development of cardiovascular disease. In a pathophysiologic sense, type 2 diabetes is a multiorgan, multifactorial condition, characterized by β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and the liver, defective incretin activity, and elevated levels of free fatty acids and proinflammatory mediators. Despite the considerable burden of disease associated with type 2 diabetes, most patients are not at, or are unable to achieve, recommended glycemic control guideline targets. In part, this is because of the relentlessly progressive nature of the disease, but it may also be attributable to the current diabetes treatment paradigm, which is characterized by ineffective lifestyle interventions, followed by monotherapy and frequent early treatment failure with prolonged periods of elevated glucose as a consequence of clinical inertia. Thus, it is most appropriate to rethink the current treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes in the context of a more aggressive initial therapy; specifically with early initiation of combination therapy. Our current understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease and the progressive deterioration in glycemic control over time supports the philosophy of earlier intervention with a more comprehensive initial therapy. Thus, while control of hyperglycemia remains the paramount goal, focusing on the underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is increasingly becoming the therapeutic strategy, with the aim of potentially providing disease modification. Although this is a logical approach, it remains to be demonstrated that early combination therapy will result in disease modification in a clinical setting. Not surprisingly, the incretin-based therapies have gained a great deal of attention in the context of being a component of initial combination therapy, given their potential beneficial effects on β-cell function with lowered risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia.

Metformin is the recommended first-line oral glucose-lowering drug initiated to control hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It acts in the liver, small intestines, and skeletal muscles with its major effect on decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. It is safe, inexpensive, and weight neutral and can be associated with weight loss. It can reduce microvascular complication risk and its use is associated with a lower cardiovascular mortality compared with sulfonylurea therapy. It is also used to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, in treating gestational diabetes, and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

### Clinical benefits of treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with iGlarLixi: a patient-level simulation study [^fe65c9ef]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a lifelong chronic condition that is imposing a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems and affects more than 536 million people worldwide, a number which is expected to grow to 642 million by 2030. As per the 2022 National Diabetes Statistics Report, about 37.3 million people in the United States (US) have diabetes, accounting for $379 billion in health care costs, with the largest share (73%) attributable to direct medical treatment. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for more than 95% of all diabetes cases. Among adults ≥ 65 years in the US, about 29.2% have the disease and 48.8% are believed to live with prediabetes.

Historically, metformin was prescribed as the first-line therapy for T2DM due to its high efficacy, low cost, weight neutrality, and few adverse events ; however, evidence points to the need for treatment intensification for patients with T2DM who fail to achieve their optimal glycemic targets. The 2023 standards of care in diabetes (SOC) guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend treatments like sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) or gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP)/GLP-1RA, based on existing comorbidities and other patient-centered treatment factors, as the first line of therapy. The ADA now also recommends GLP-1 RA or GIP/GLP-1RA as the first injectable for patients not meeting A1C targets and the addition of basal insulin as a free or a fixed-ratio combination for those unable to achieve A1C goals with GIP/GLP-1 RA.

### Comparative effectiveness of second line oral antidiabetic treatments among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: emulation of a target trial using routinely collected health data [^0f26f22b]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Study population

We defined the study population according to eligibility criteria, which had to be met before time zero (baseline) and was analogous to the time of randomisation in a randomised controlled trial. Time zero was defined by the date of the first prescription for any of the three oral second line treatments that were added to metformin (see supplementary table 1). We followed precedent research by including people with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus who were aged 18 years or older,registered with a general practice in England, and who intensified treatment from first line to second line oral antidiabetic treatment between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2020 with a first ever prescription of sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or SGLT-2 inhibitors added to metformin. Those eligible had to have at least one prescription for metformin monotherapy within 60 days before the first prescription for second line treatment, to ensure their use of metformin monotherapy was continuous before intensification. We excluded individuals with pregnancy recorded within 12 months before initiation of second line treatment and people whose last recorded eGFR was <30 mL/min/1.73m 2, since prescribing guidelines recommend different treatments for these groups. We also excluded people whose general practices had not consented to the required linkage of Hospital Episodes Statistics data. We followed precedent research in excluding those who were not prescribed metformin on the same day or within 60 days after initiating second line treatment,as it is unlikely that their treatment with metformin continued. Supplementary tables 1 and 2 present detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Treatments under comparison

We compared DPP-4 inhibitors with sulfonylureas and SGLT-2 inhibitors with sulfonylureas and DPP-4 inhibitors as second line oral antidiabetic treatments added to metformin. Information was extracted on the prescribed duration of each treatment and any subsequent antidiabetic treatment.

The study used an intention-to-treat approach so that individuals contributed to the treatment group to which they were assigned at baseline until the end of the follow-up period (see supplementary table 1), irrespective of the extent to which they adhered to the treatment prescribed. We defined the end of follow-up as the earliest of the date the general practice stopped contributing to CPRD, the date the individual left the general practice, the date of death, or the last date of available data (31 December 2021 for continuous outcomes or 31 March 2021 for time-to-event outcomes). We described the duration of second line and third line treatments by comparison group.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes—general principles state that individualized pharmacotherapy for persons with T2D should be prescribed based on evidence for benefit that includes glucose lowering, avoidance of hypoglycemia and weight gain, and reduction of cardio-renal risk; persons with T2D and their health care professionals should use patient-centered shared decision-making to agree on therapy targets and treatments as well as a regimen for glucose monitoring; glycemic targets include A1C, BGM, and, for those using CGM, achievement of CGM targets such as time in range (TIR), percentage in low and very low range, time above range, and glycemic variability, while nonglycemic targets include avoidance of hypoglycemia, control of BP, lipids, other CVD risk factors, and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight; independent of glycemic control, targets, or treatment, if there is established or high risk for ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD, clinicians should prescribe a GLP-1 RA or an SGLT2i with proven efficacy; DM therapy should be individualized based on level of glycemia and the presence of comorbidities, complications, and access, with metformin often the preferential initial therapy and other agents appropriate as first-line or in addition to metformin to reduce BG and/or address specific comorbidities; clinicians should discuss with persons with T2D the likelihood that most persons with T2D ultimately require a combination of multiple complementary agents to attain and maintain optimal glycemic control, and the DM care team should assess medication adherence and safety and glycemic control in persons with T2D quarterly or more frequently as needed.

### First-line renin-angiotensin system inhibitors vs. other first-line antihypertensive drug classes in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^144db4ac]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

First-line renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are recommended for diabetic patients because of their potential nephron-protective properties. For hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, little is known about first-line RAS inhibitors vs. other first-line antihypertensive agents in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the comparative efficacy of first-line RAS inhibitors vs. other first-line antihypertensive drug classes in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We identified RCTs by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to December 15, 2015. Eighteen RCTs involving 18,862 participants were included. First-line RAS inhibitors were not different from first-line diuretics for all the primary outcomes. First-line RAS inhibitors reduced major cardiovascular events (2 RCTs, relative risk [RR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66, 0.91) and heart failure (4 RCTs, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.83) compared to first-line calcium channel blockers. Compared to β-blockers, RAS inhibitors reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (1 RCT, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47, 0.84), major cardiovascular events (1 RCT, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62, 0.93) and heart failure (1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40, 0.92). Our meta-analysis indicates that, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced adverse cardiovascular events to the same degree as first-line diuretics but to a greater degree than first-line calcium channel blockers and first-line beta blockers.

### Factors influencing the prescribing preferences of physicians for drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the real-world setting in Japan: insight from a web survey [^603e8e3b]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the findings from the present survey show that DPP-4is are the preferred first-line treatment by physicians in Japan due to their ease of use in patients with renal impairment, frequency of administration, and HbA1c-lowering effect. The next most popular first-line treatment is metformin, due to the resulting improvement in insulin resistance and its cost effectiveness. The patient characteristics taken into account when choosing the first-line OAD as well as when deciding upon treatment intensification were essentially the same regardless of whether the physician was a diabetes specialist or nonspecialist. In this regard, the information provided by this study should prompt discussion of the differences in T2DM treatment between Japan and other counties.

### Trends in first-line glucose-lowering drug use in adults with type 2 diabetes in light of emerging evidence for SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA [^a1103ee0]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We evaluated recent use trends and predictors of first-line antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Using two large U.S. health insurance databases (Clinformatics and Medicare), we identified adult patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated antidiabetes treatment from 2013 through 2019. Quarterly trends in use of first-line antidiabetes treatment were plotted overall and stratified by cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multinomial logistic regressions were fit to estimate predictors of first-line antidiabetes treatment, using metformin, the recommended first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as the common referent.

Results

Metformin was the most frequently initiated medication, used by 80.6% of Medicare beneficiaries and 83.1% of commercially insured patients. Sulfonylureas were used by 8.7% (Medicare) and 4.7% (commercial). Both populations had low use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i, 0.8% [Medicare] and 1.7% [commercial]) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ra; 1.0% [Medicare] and 3.5% [commercial]), with increasing trends over time ( P < 0.01). Initiators of antidiabetes drugs with established cardiovascular benefits (SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA) were more likely to be younger and had prevalent CVD or higher socioeconomic status compared with initiators of metformin.

Conclusions

Among adult patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin was by far the most frequent first-line treatment. While the use of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA was low from 2013 through 2019, it increased among patients with CVD.

### Choosing first-line therapy for management of type 2 diabetes (...) [^8a5ceb31]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Each month, three presenters will review an interesting journal article in a conversational manner. These articles will involve “hot topics” that affect family physicians or will “bust” commonly held medical myths. The presenters will give their opinions about the clinical value of the studies discussed. The opinions reflect the views of the presenters, not those of. What should the family physician do. Mark: I would begin medical therapy with metformin and use sulfonylureas and insulin as second-line treatment options. If you use glitazones, watch for adverse events, including increased fluid retention, CHF, and cardiovascular events. Bob: CHF has been seen with glitazone use in the past. In 2002, the FDA recognized the increased rates of CHF associated with glitazones and required the makers of pioglitazone and Avandia to strengthen the warnings concerning adverse cardiovascular events. Andrea: I agree. Start with metformin.

This study should also serve as a warning that abstracts may not reflect the true results of a study, even in journals like the New England Journal of Medicine. You should evaluate the study yourself before you change your clinical practice. Main Points Glitazones are associated with fluid retention, increased CHF rates, and, possibly, increased rates of cardiovascular events compared with sulfonylureas and metformin. The FDA and the Canadian government have issued warnings about CHF and cardiovascular events with rosiglitazone. Metformin should be the first-line drug for managing type 2 diabetes. Insulin and sulfonylureas should be second line, and glitazones should be reserved for third line. Metformin is the only drug for type 2 diabetes that does not cause weight gain, which is an important advantage. EBM Points The data and conclusion in the abstract of an article may not be the same as the data in the paper.

If you read only the abstract, you may be misled. A lot of studies use surrogate markers as outcomes. These are DOEs. What we care about are POEMs. Something can be statistically significant but clinically meaningless.

### Emerging role of insulin with incretin therapies for management of type 2 diabetes [^0a0bd5bc]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease warranting intensification of treatment, as beta-cell function declines over time. Current treatment algorithms recommend metformin as the first-line agent, while advocating the addition of either basal-bolus or premixed insulin as the final level of intervention. Incretin therapy, including incretin mimetics or enhancers, are the latest group of drugs available for treatment of T2DM. These agents act through the incretin axis, are currently recommended as add-on agents either as second-or third-line treatment, without concurrent use of insulin. Given the novel role of incretin therapy in terms of reducing postprandial hyperglycemia, and favorable effects on weight with reduced incidence of hypoglycemia, we explore alternative options for incretin therapy in T2DM management. Furthermore, as some evidence alludes to incretins potentially increasing betacell mass and altering disease progression, we propose introducing these agents earlier in the treatment algorithm. In addition, we suggest the concurrent use of incretins with insulin, given the favorable effects especially in relation to weight gain.

### Comparative effectiveness of second line oral antidiabetic treatments among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: emulation of a target trial using routinely collected health data [^409d2cbd]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

About 463 million people worldwide (9.3%) have type 2 diabetes mellitus.In most people this disease is progressive, and it is associated with risks of multiple complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease.Interventions that improve biomarkers of type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), blood pressure, and lipid levels, can reduce the risk of these complications.International clinical guidelines recommend additional drugs (second line treatment) if glycaemic control is inadequate after metformin monotherapy.A recent study of second line treatments for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus across 38 countries reported that the most commonly used oral drugs were dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (48.3%), sulfonylureas (40.9%), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (8.3%).

Of these oral treatments, SGLT-2 inhibitors are newer and more costly classes of drugs.In England, SGLT-2 inhibitors are recommended second line treatments in preference to other drug classes for some people with type 2 diabetes mellitus—those with pre-existing CVD, at high risk of CVD, or with kidney disease.For most people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, however, evidence on the comparative effectiveness of these alternative drugs classes, particularly in relation to reducing HbA 1c levels, is insufficient to recommend a particular second line treatment.An international consensus statementand guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE)therefore leaves the choice of second line treatment for most people with type 2 diabetes mellitus to clinicians and patients, which has led to wide variation across groups of primary care providers in England in the proportion of people prescribed each drug class.Current NICE (2022) guidelines recommend other antidiabetic treatments, such as insulin based therapy and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, only if HbA 1c levels are not controlled after second line treatment with oral antidiabetics.Hence in many countries, including England, the proportion of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are prescribed glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists as second line treatment is low.

Background

Description of the condition

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic, complex, and progressive metabolic disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its prevalence among adults in 2021 was 537 million and is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030. Diabetes was responsible for 6.7 million deaths in 2021. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most frequent type of diabetes mellitus worldwide and is characterised by insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues and progressive impairment of insulin secretion from the dysfunctional β‐cell of the pancreas.

Lifestyle modifications and diabetes management, education, and support are the foundation for achieving long‐term glycaemic control, minimising the risk of hyper‐ and hypoglycaemia, and delaying, or even preventing, the onset of microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications. In the absence of contraindications, supportive pharmacotherapy can be started at the time of T2DM diagnosis.

Although metformin remains the first‐line therapy for most individuals, the progressive nature of T2DM commonly requires the use of second‐line therapies, either in combination with metformin or as an alternative, to achieve the targeted glucose levels. The choice of these therapies should be highly individualised and depend on the balance between many person‐centred factors, such as glycaemic control goals and risk of hypoglycaemia, effect on body weight, the patient's comorbidity profile including cardiovascular risk, cost, and individual patient preference.

### Real-world treatment patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus initiating treatment with oral semaglutide [^7979cdce]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus affects one in ten Americans, with 90‒95% of patients with diabetes diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM rarely occurs on its own and is typically associated with a host of comorbid conditions. Comorbidities among patients with T2DM are associated with a lower quality of life, increased healthcare utilization and worse treatment outcomes. Among patients with comorbid T2DM and overweight/obesity, even a small weight loss can result in improved glycemia and a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, while a larger weight loss may result in sustained remission of T2DM for at least 2 years and long-term reductions in cardiovascular and mortality risk.

Physicians treating patients with T2DM face competing clinical concerns and complex treatment situations that require prescription of additional medications and dosing adjustments for patients to obtain optimal levels of HbA1c, blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. While metformin has historically been the treatment of choice in first-line therapy, guidelines now recommend a patient-centered approach with any mono- or combination therapy that allows patients to maintain treatment goals. Nearly all FDA-approved obesity medications have been shown to improve glycemia in people with type 2 diabetes and delay progression to type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals. In people with T2DM and overweight or obesity, the preferred pharmacotherapy should be a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 RA with greater weight loss efficacy, especially considering their added weight-independent benefits (e.g. glycemic and cardiometabolic).

With the increasing availability of more effective treatments, individuals with diabetes and overweight or obesity should be informed of the potential benefits of both modest and more substantial weight loss and guided in the range of available treatment options. In patients with T2DM, comorbid conditions such as obesity may decrease the benefit of treatment and negatively influence patients’ emotional wellbeing and ability to self-manage their T2DM. Semaglutide, a GLP1-RA, was initially granted market authorization for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise. In 2021 and 2022, regulatory agencies in the USA and Europe licensed semaglutide for the treatment of individuals who are obese or overweight and who have at least one weight-related comorbidity. Manufacturer-sponsored randomized controlled trials have shown a loss of almost 12% of body weight over a 68-week period. Once the medication was stopped patients regained most of their pretreatment weight.

### Should metformin continue as first-line pharmacotherapy (...) [^0dd2a8a8]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice Metformin has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus for decades. The glucose-lowering effects of metformin were first discovered in the 1920s. 1 After extensive use throughout Europe, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with a 1995 randomized controlled trial demonstrating metformin's safety and efficacy. 2 Following two decades of widespread use in the United States, extended-release and combination formulations were introduced. 4 This study shifted primarily sulfonylurea-based regimens to metformin-first regimens for the treatment of non–insulin-dependent diabetes. Subsequent studies demonstrating reduced mortality in populations with atherothrombosis or heart failure and its affordable cost further solidified metformin as the preferred initial treatment for diabetes.

5, 6 Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, and American College of Physicians. 7–9. During the years the FDA guidance was in effect, two novel classes of medications were developed, studied, and marketed: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Both have been shown to reduce ASCVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes, leading to questions about whether they should be considered first-line therapy. 17 However, selecting therapy to meet patient goals is the approach every clinician should use for those with type 2 diabetes; this does not automatically exclude the use of metformin.

The goals for each patient are different and include considerations such as costs, adverse effects, and administration. Metformin's established safety and effectiveness at A1C reduction—in addition to its relatively low cost and widespread availability to patients—make it an ideal first-line option for many patients with diabetes. Because of safety concerns, metformin is preferred over other older and inexpensive options such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.
9. Metformin should be included in first-line medication regimens. Whether additional therapies are started concurrently or deferred depends on individual patient goals. Primary care physicians should not overstate the ASCVD benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonist medications.

### Baseline characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line treatment in Japan: findings from the J-DISCOVER study [^e115bda2]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

J-DISCOVER aims to research the treatment reality of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who begin second-line treatment. Here we report baseline characteristics and factors associated with selection of second-line treatment.

Methods

J-DISCOVER is a prospective, observational, multicenter, cohort study in patients with type 2 diabetes (aged ≥ 20 years) beginning second-line treatment after first-line oral monotherapy. Baseline characteristics and treatment patterns were descriptively summarized. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with specific second-line treatments.

Results

A total of 1806 patients (mean age 61.7 years) were enrolled between September 2014 and December 2015. Mean ± standard deviation of baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) were 7.7 ± 1.3% and 25.5 ± 4.6 kg/m 2, respectively. The most prescribed medication as first-line treatment was dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (53.7% of patients) followed by biguanides (21.4%), sulfonylureas (7.2%), and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (6.8%). Second-line treatments included dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (31.0%), biguanides (27.9%), sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (12.2%), and sulfonylureas (10.9%). First- and second-line treatments had different modes of action in 76.3% of patients. Those receiving first-line dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors were more likely to receive second-line biguanides and vice versa. Selection of second-line treatment was also associated with age, BMI, HbA1c, and renal function.

Conclusions

This study showed the treatment reality and factors associated with choice of second-line treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The choice of second-line treatment was associated with age, BMI, HbA1c, renal function, and the mode of action of the first-line treatment.

### Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiovascular outcomes in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a target trial emulation study [^fa1aabe3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Research insights

What is currently known about this topic? 
Older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus face high cardiovascular complications. Blood pressure control is a key strategy to reduce this risk. ACEIs and ARBs are both recommended as first-line antihypertensive therapies.

What is the key research question? 
Is there a difference in the efficacy between ACEIs and ARBs in reducing cardiovascular risk among older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus?

What is new? 
This study employs an active-comparator, new-user design within the target trial emulation framework to evaluate the cardiovascular outcome of ACEIs’ relative to ARBs in Chinese older adults with type 2 diabetes. The findings indicate that initiating ACEIs is associated with a trend toward lower risk of major cardiovascular events compared to ARBs.

How might this study influence clinical practice? 
The findings may support healthcare professionals in China should be cautious to prioritize ARBs over ACEIs for older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, potentially informing treatment guidelines and prescribing practices.

### Diabetes: the place of new therapies [^aaf6fd2e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in prescribing practice

It was the publication of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) that propelled the use of metformin as the main first-line agent for treating diabetes in 1998.Since then many national and international guidelines have promoted the use of metformin as the first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes. – However what should be the second line has been a matter of conjecture and debate for some time. Given that sulfonylureas have become so cheap their use as second-line agents has been very common until the appearance of the agents that were launched in the 21st century.However, with the suggestions that their use is associated with an increase in severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular mortality their use has been in decline. – The most recent data are now suggesting that in the UK the DPP-4 inhibitors have now overtaken the use of sulfonylureas as second-line agents, with the most common third-line agents now being SGLT-2 inhibitors. The use of thiazolidinones was rising between 2000 and 2006, but then declined sharply after the publication of data suggesting that at least one of these agents, rosiglitazone, was associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality. –

The result of these newer agents being much more commonly prescribed, is an associated increase in cost, such that on average in the UK it costs £100 per patient with type 2 diabetes per year to treat them with glucose-lowering drugs.

In 2015, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association updated their recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes.After the use of metformin as the first-line agent, they suggest that any of the other treatment classes, including basal insulin, could be second line, and then any combination of the remaining classes could be third or fourth line, although they recommended injectable therapy as the ideal fourth line in addition to the preceding agent.

Whilst there are increasing numbers of head to head studies looking at the new agents with older agents, there are still no clear data to suggest which agent should be used as second or third line in preference to any other. This has led to a huge variety in prescribing practice, and therefore spending. In those geographical areas which continue to use metformin and sulfonylureas as the preferred agents, prescribing is associated with the lowest cost, whilst those areas that use some of the newer agents are increasing in cost, with a range of between £60 and £200 per person per year in the UK.

Oral agents and noninsulin injectables.

Important properties of antihyperglycemic agents that play a role in the choice of drug(s) in individual patients are summarized in Table 1. Ultimately, the aims of controlling glycemia are to avoid acute osmotic symptoms of hyperglycemia, to avoid instability in blood glucose over time, and to prevent/delay the development of diabetes complications without adversely affecting quality of life. Information on whether specific agents have this ability is incomplete; an answer to these questions requires long-term, large-scale clinical trials—not available for most drugs. Effects on surrogate measures for glycemic control (e.g. HbA 1c) generally reflect changes in the probability of developing microvascular disease but not necessarily macrovascular complications. Particularly from a patient standpoint, stability of metabolic control over time may be another specific goal.

Table 1 
Properties of currently available glucose-lowering agents that may guide treatment choice in individual patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

Metformin, a biguanide, remains the most widely used first-line type 2 diabetes drug; its mechanism of action predominately involves reducing hepatic glucose production. It is generally considered weight-neutral with chronic use and does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is associated with initial gastrointestinal side effects, and caution is advised to avoid its use in patients at risk for lactic acidosis (e.g. in advanced renal insufficiency, alcoholism), a rare complication of therapy. As noted earlier, there may be some cardiovascular benefits from this drug, but the clinical trial data are not robust.

The oldest oral agent class is the sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues. Through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on β-cells, these drugs stimulate insulin release. While effective in controlling glucose levels, their use is associated with modest weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia. In addition, studies have demonstrated a secondary failure rate that may exceed other drugs, ascribed to an exacerbation of islet dysfunction. Shorter-acting secretagogues, the meglitinides (or glinides), stimulate insulin release through similar mechanisms but may be associated with less hypoglycemia. They require more frequent dosing, however.

Although metformin was a commonly used background drug in most large trials of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes,several post hoc analyses have demonstrated benefit with GLP1RAs or SGLT2is regardless of background use of metformin.Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology no longer recommend metformin as the preferred first line agent for all individuals with type 2 diabetes, and instead suggest consideration of cardiac and kidney comorbidities when selecting first line treatment.Cost is a major consideration in selecting the most appropriate treatment, however, probably contributing to differences in these recommendations from guidelines used in other countries. In the US, insurers have not caught up with the guidelines, and require that metformin is used before other agents. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) still recommends metformin as the first line treatment for people with cardiac or kidney comorbidities, or both, with introduction of an SGLT2i in people who cannot tolerate metformin or need intensification of treatment.Despite robust outcome data, GLP1RAs are not recommended ny NICE until failure of triple oral drug treatment and only in people with a high body mass index or in whom insulin treatment cannot be used.Insurance formulary restrictions on prescribing GLP1RAs and SGLT2is, including the requirement of step treatment starting with metformin, still persist but should be reconsidered to better align with scientific evidence.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus [^6c60c230]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although it has been accepted for decades that women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk for future development of type 2 diabetes, vigorous debate regarding the value of detecting and treating GDM has persisted into the twenty-first century. Although results from 2 randomized trials provide strong evidence that treating GDM reduces adverse perinatal outcomes, it remains to be determined whether treatment impacts long-term offspring outcomes. Insulin is the first-line pharmacologic treatment and is added when glycemic goals are not met with nutritional modifications. Oral agent use is controversial, as data on long-term offspring outcomes are lacking.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^24fd2f2b]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 10- to 18-year-old patients makes recommendations for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM, and the recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated, and at any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained in or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made; if a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model.

Conclusion

In patients with T2DM, SGLT2i as first-line treatment may be associated with decreased events of heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause mortality, compared with metformin as first-line treatment. However, there may be an increased events of ischemic stroke using SGLT2i compared to metformin.

### Use of new diabetes medicines (...) [^284f4e22]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What did this study examine. In 2022, the ADA and EASD jointly released new medication recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes. They recommended newer types of diabetes medications as first-line treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes who also have:
- A heart disease called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- Heart failure.
- Kidney disease.
- High risk for ASCVD. This study examined how many US adults with type 2 diabetes would meet the recommended criteria to use these medications. Terms to know Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s, are a type of medicine for people with diabetes. They lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT-2s are a type of medicine for people with diabetes. Similar to GLP-1s, they lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys.

Because GLP-1s and SGLT-2s work in different ways, they can be taken together. Study results CDC researchers studied 1, 330 nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes between 2017 and 2020. Researchers estimate that with new ADA and EASD guidelines, 82% of US adults with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take a GLP-1, or SGLT-2, or both. They also estimate that almost all Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take these medicines. Very few US adults were taking GLP-1s or SGLT-2s during the study timeframe. This is because they were not yet approved for first-line treatment. Only 9% were already taking either a GLP-1 or an SGLT-2 medication. What's important about this study. This study showed that over 8 in 10 US adults with type 2 diabetes are eligible for new, effective diabetes medicines. These medicines are not just beneficial for blood sugar management.

They also help reduce risk for diabetes complications by protecting the heart and kidneys, and help people lose weight if needed.

### Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes mellitus: blood pressure goals, choice of agents, and setting priorities in diabetes care [^6b016aee]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a prevalent condition that leads to substantial morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To evaluate the goals and optimal agents for treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

Review of the medical literature

Study Selection

Randomized trials that evaluated the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes and reported microvascular and macrovascular outcomes.

Data Extraction

Studies were identified by using the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, meta-analyses, review articles, and expert recommendation. The searches of the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE were performed in May 2000 and updated in April 2002. Data were abstracted to standardized forms by a single reviewer and were confirmed by a second reviewer.

Data Synthesis

Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes provides dramatic benefit. Target diastolic blood pressures of less than 80 mm Hg appear optimal; systolic targets have not been as rigorously evaluated, but targets of 135 mm Hg or less are reasonable. Studies that compare drug classes do not suggest obviously superior agents. However, it is reasonable to conclude that thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, and perhaps angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be the preferred first-line agents for treatment of hypertension in diabetes. beta-Blockers and calcium-channel blockers are more effective than placebo, but they may not be as effective as diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, or ACE inhibitors; however, study results are inconsistent in this regard.

Conclusions

Treatment of hypertension in type 2 diabetes, with blood pressure goals of 135/80 mm Hg, provides dramatic benefits. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be the best first-line treatments, although other agents are usually necessary and goals may not be achieved even with three or four agents. Aggressive blood pressure control may be the most important factor in preventing adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^3bdadfae]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)—glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors: This guideline reviewed no evidence on the combination use of GLP-1 RAs with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Whether these classes should be used as first-line therapy or as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with ASCVD is unclear, and large cardiovascular outcome trials included 71–82% of patients on metformin as baseline therapy. For adults with T2DM and ASCVD, a GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor with proven CV benefits should be a part of the treatment regimen, regardless of HbA1C, to decrease the risk of MACE.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor versus metformin as first-line therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multi-institution database study [^4eae8e1b]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) has shown evidence of cardiovascular benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently metformin is the guideline-recommended first-line treatment. We aimed to investigate the benefit of SGLT2i vs metformin as first-line therapy.

Methods

Electronic medical records from Chang Gung Research Database during 2016–2019 were retrieved for patients with T2DM. Patients aged < 20, not receiving anti-diabetic medication, first-line treatment neither metformin nor SGLT2i were excluded. Primary outcomes were heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. Patients were followed up for events or December 31, 2019, whichever comes first.

Results

After exclusion criteria, a total of 41,020 patients with T2DM were eligible for analysis. There were 1100 patients with SGLT2i as first-line and 39,920 patients with metformin as first-line treatment. IPTW was used for propensity score matching. During one year follow-up, the hazard ratio (HR) of patients on SGLT2i as first-line treatment to patients on metformin as first-line treatment were HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.41–0.54, p < 0.0001) in heart failure hospitalization, HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.41–0.61, p < 0.0001) in acute coronary syndrome, HR 1.21 (95% CI 1.10–1.32, p < 0.0001) in ischemic stroke, and HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.44–0.55, p < 0.0001) in all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

In patients with T2DM, SGLT2i as first-line treatment may be associated with decreased events of heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause mortality, compared with metformin as first-line treatment. However, there may be an increased events of ischemic stroke using SGLT2i compared to metformin.

### A systematic review and mixed-treatment comparison of dapagliflozin with existing anti-diabetes treatments for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by sulfonylurea monotherapy [^de53ff17]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly prevalent, primarily due to increases in obesity and physical inactivity. With this comes an associated increase in healthcare resource burden, including, but not limited to, the cost of anti-diabetes agents, hospital inpatient care and treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as retinopathy and amputation [-]. The primary treatment goal of diabetes management is to reduce glycaemic levels, lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels to below or around 7% [-], in order to most effectively reduce diabetes-related macro and microvascular complications [-]. More effective drug therapies, enabling better disease stabilisation, could therefore have a significant impact on reducing healthcare resources required to treat such complications. Guidelines for treatment management include lifestyle modification at diagnosis, followed by metformin monotherapy as a first-line pharmacological treatment in most cases. However, for patients where metformin is contraindicated, sulfonylureas (SUs) can be used as an alternative first-line pharmacological intervention. Contraindications to metformin are quite common among T2DM patients, with one retrospective study identifying as many as 60% metformin users as having at least 1 contraindication, of which heart failure and renal impairment were the most frequently present. SUs exert their glucose-lowering effect by stimulating insulin secretion and are able to reduce HbA1c levels to a similar extent as metformin monotherapy.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^ae6f8169]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. >16.7–19.4 mmol/L [>300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

Results

Study population

There were 282,292 patients with T2DM identified between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019 identified in the CGRD. After exclusion criteria, a total of 41,020 patients were enrolled, and separated into 1100 patients with SGLT2i as first-line treatment and 39,920 patients with metformin as first-line treatment (Fig. 1). Using IPTW, almost all variables such as age, sex, diabetes duration, LVEF, medication, selected lab results, and follow-up period have ASMD < 0.1 (Table 1). The mean age in SGLT2i as first-line treatment group was 57.6 ± 13.0 with 63.36% male and the mean age in metformin as first-line treatment group was 59.3 ± 12.9 with 56.03% male. The mean follow-up diabetes duration was 1.6 ± 7.2 years and 1.5 ± 1.21 years for SGLT2i and metformin as first-line treatment patients respectively. When the patient return to clinic after 3 months, those patients with A1c goal was not achieved, second anti-diabetic medication was added (Table 1).

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^331da4ca]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019—Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) primary prevention recommendations state that for all adults with T2DM, a tailored nutrition plan focusing on a heart-healthy dietary pattern is recommended to improve glycemic control, achieve weight loss if needed, and improve other ASCVD risk factors. Adults with T2DM should perform at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity to improve glycemic control, achieve weight loss if needed, and improve other ASCVD risk factors. For adults with T2DM, it is reasonable to initiate metformin as first-line therapy along with lifestyle therapies at the time of diagnosis to improve glycemic control and reduce ASCVD risk. For adults with T2DM and additional ASCVD risk factors who require glucose-lowering therapy despite initial lifestyle modifications and metformin, it may be reasonable to initiate a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk.

### A claims-based cohort study on the treatment patterns of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the association of early first physician visit with time to prescription of oral hypoglycemic agents [^f29723f0]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The early group experienced a longer median time to prescription of first-line (Fig. 2) and second-line (Fig. 3) antidiabetic drugs compared with the delayed group. For first-line treatment, the median time to prescription in the early vs. delayed physician visit groups was 92 days vs. 15 days (p < 0.0001), with a 12-month rate of 73.7% vs. 84.1% and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24, 1.39] (Fig. 2). The early group had a statistically significant delay in time to prescription across all baseline HbA1c levels below 9% (Supplementary Table S3). For second-line treatment, the median time to prescription for the early vs. the delayed group was 1599 days vs. 1315 days (p < 0.0001), with a 12-month rate of 12.7% vs. 21.2% and an HR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.11, 1.34) (Fig. 3). The early group had a statistically significant delay in time to prescription across all baseline HbA1c levels (Supplementary Table S4). The delayed group was also more likely to receive combination therapy as first-line treatment than the early group (two-class combination: 11.5% vs. 6.3%; three classes or greater: 2.1% vs. 1.3%) (Table 1).

### Baseline characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line treatment in Japan: findings from the J-DISCOVER study [^8333e3a1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This analysis of J-DISCOVER baseline data has shown patient characteristics associated with choice of second-line treatment as well as the treatment reality for Japanese patients with T2DM who are initiating second-line treatment. Whereas metformin is the preferred first-line treatment for T2DM in US and European guidelines, in this Japanese study DPP4is were the most frequently prescribed agents both first- and second-line treatment. Biguanides were also commonly used, while SGLT2is were prescribed in a relative minority of patients. The results of this study indicate that physicians chose second-line treatment by considering the mode of action of first-line treatment, as well as patients’ background characteristics and clinical conditions (age, BMI, HbA1c, and renal function).

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^dc373b10]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2023 type 2 diabetes—cardiovascular risk therapy selection states that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in meta-analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.93, P < .001), while sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, including a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.61-0.76]) and a 15% reduction in CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.93]) versus placebo. For persons with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk, a GLP-1 RA with cardiovascular benefit should be initiated as first-line therapy independent of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and as an alternative clinicians may recommend an SGLT2i with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce MACE or CV death in persons with T2D and established ASCVD. SGLT2is should be recommended in persons with T2D and HF regardless of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and they have been shown to improve HF-related symptoms irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction and background therapies. High-risk trial features included “albuminuria or proteinuria, HTN and LV hypertrophy, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and/or ABI <0.9.” DPP-4 inhibitors show neutrality for MACE, but saxagliptin increased HF hospitalizations and caution is advised with alogliptin in New York Heart Association Class III or IV CHF. Thiazolidinediones can worsen fluid retention and should not be used in symptomatic HF, and initiation of pioglitazone is contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV CHF.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^d6b21ae5]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Although the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin therapy can be successfully treated with basal insulin alone, some, because of progressive diminution in their insulin secretory capacity, will require prandial insulin therapy with shorter-acting insulins. This is typically provided in the form of the rapid insulin analogs, insulin lispro (B28Lys,B29Pro human insulin), insulin aspart (B28Asp human insulin), or insulin glulisine (B3Lys,B29Glu human insulin), which may be dosed just before the meal. They result in better postprandial glucose control than the less costly human regular insulin, whose pharmacokinetic profile makes it less attractive in this setting.

Ideally, an insulin treatment program should be designed specifically for an individual patient, to match the supply of insulin to his or her dietary/exercise habits and prevailing glucose trends, as revealed through self-monitoring. Anticipated glucose-lowering effects should be balanced with the convenience of the regimen, in the context of an individual's specific therapy goals (Fig. 1).

Proper patient education regarding glucose monitoring, insulin injection technique, insulin storage, recognition/treatment of hypoglycemia, and “sick day” rules is imperative. Where available, certified diabetes educators can be invaluable in guiding the patient through this process.

KEY POINTS

Glycemic targets and glucose-lowering therapies must be individualized.
Diet, exercise, and education remain the foundation of any type 2 diabetes treatment program.
Unless there are prevalent contraindications, metformin is the optimal first-line drug.
After metformin, there are limited data to guide us. Combination therapy with an additional 1–2 oral or injectable agents is reasonable, aiming to minimize side effects where possible.
Ultimately, many patients will require insulin therapy alone or in combination with other agents to maintain glucose control.
All treatment decisions, where possible, should be made in conjunction with the patient, focusing on his/her preferences, needs, and values.
Comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction must be a major focus of therapy.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^332efdc3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The management of T2DM requires aggressive treatment to achieve glycemic and cardiovascular risk factor goals. In this setting, metformin, an old and widely accepted first line agent, stands out not only for its antihyperglycemic properties but also for its effects beyond glycemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution. These properties may have contributed to the decrease of adverse cardiovascular outcomes otherwise not attributable to metformin's mere antihyperglycemic effects. Several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently launched, introducing the need to evaluate the role of metformin as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs. There is increasing evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies supporting its anti-proliferative role in cancer and possibly a neuroprotective effect. Metformin's negligible risk of hypoglycemia in monotherapy and few drug interactions of clinical relevance give this drug a high safety profile. The tolerability of metformin may be improved by using an appropiate dose titration, starting with low doses, so that side-effects can be minimized or by switching to an extended release form. We reviewed the role of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and describe the additional benefits beyond its glycemic effect. We also discuss its potential role for a variety of insulin resistant and pre-diabetic states, obesity, metabolic abnormalities associated with HIV disease, gestational diabetes, cancer, and neuroprotection.

Introduction

Diabetes is an emerging global epidemic—this chronic metabolic condition affected 1 in every 11 adults worldwide in 2017 and 9.4% of the US population in 2015. Diabetes can lead to many micro- and macrovascular complications and accounted for 10.7% of global all-cause mortality among people 20–79 years old. Diabetes was estimated to cost $727 billion (US dollars; USD) in 2017, responsible for 6–16.6% of total healthcare expenditures worldwide. About half of the global diabetes budget is spent in the US, where patients with diagnosed diabetes on average spend about $13700 on medical services annually, which is about 2.3 times higher than that spent by people without diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetes cases. Due to the progressive nature of diabetes, the initiation of pharmacologic agents is recommended at the time of diagnosis of T2DM, along with lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to achieve glycemic control. With metformin as the preferred 1st-line therapy, additional anti-diabetic drugs are often considered and, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), patient’s history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease plays a key role in the selection of the add-on therapy.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^bb7e3798]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Pediatric type 2 diabetes—care coordination and expert consultation—states that primary care providers “should endeavor to obtain the requisite skills to care for children and adolescents with T2DM, and should communicate and work closely with a diabetes team of subspecialists when such consultation is available, practical, and appropriate,” with consultation frequency that “should usually be obtained at diagnosis and then at least annually if possible.” “When treatment goals are not met, the committee encourages clinicians to consult with an expert trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM.” In addition, “when first-line therapy (eg, metformin) fails, recommendations for intensifying therapy should be generally the same for pediatric and adult populations,” and clinicians “should, therefore, remain alert to new developments with regard to treatment of T2DM,” with expert advice helping “ensure that the treatment goals are appropriately set.”
