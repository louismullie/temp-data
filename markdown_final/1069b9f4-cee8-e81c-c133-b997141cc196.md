## Question

Kay exalate increases gi necrisis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate, SPS) increases the risk of gastrointestinal necrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and historical safety concerns, especially the role of sorbitol. Then, I should verify the regulatory position and labeled warnings. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and histopathology. After that, I need to appraise the clinical evidence hierarchy, including case reports, observational studies, and meta-analyses. Finally, I will quantify risk, identify high-risk populations, and compare SPS with alternatives before synthesizing a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the drug and the safety issue. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation-exchange resin that binds potassium in the colon and has been used for decades, but it has long-standing warnings for intestinal necrosis and other serious GI adverse events, particularly when combined with sorbitol, which was historically added as a cathartic to prevent fecal impaction [^116cvW3r] [^114w2n4Z].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory stance before drawing conclusions. The FDA explicitly warns that cases of intestinal necrosis, which may be fatal, have been reported with SPS, with the majority of cases involving concomitant sorbitol; the label advises against adding sorbitol and lists risk factors such as prematurity, intestinal disease or surgery, hypovolemia, and renal insufficiency or failure, while recommending avoidance in patients with impaired bowel function or constipation risk and advising discontinuation if constipation develops [^116cvW3r].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility. SPS crystals can cause direct mucosal injury and foreign-body reactions, and hyperosmolar sorbitol may provoke ischemia via osmotic effects and reduced perfusion; histopathology frequently shows transmural necrosis and SPS crystals embedded in the bowel wall, supporting both mechanical and ischemic mechanisms, and case reports document necrosis even without sorbitol, indicating SPS itself can be injurious under the right conditions [^113LuDEt] [^113iNugs] [^111tHQsm] [^113H7XyU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from case reports alone. I should review the broader evidence. A systematic review of 58 cases showed 76% colonic involvement and 62% transmural necrosis with 33% mortality; importantly, 17 cases occurred without sorbitol, confirming risk beyond the osmotic component, though case series are inherently biased and cannot establish causality [^113iNugs]. Observational cohorts in advanced CKD consistently associate SPS initiation with higher risks of serious GI events, including ulcers and perforations, with dose-related signals and stronger associations at per-label doses; for example, adjusted hazard ratios around 1.25–1.54 have been reported in large nationwide datasets, and E-value analyses suggest moderate robustness to unmeasured confounding, though confounding by indication remains a limitation [^111y1ojj] [^111ebtpB] [^112zHX6z] [^117VBtqf].

> I should double-check whether randomized or controlled data exist. There are no large, high-quality RCTs specifically designed to assess GI necrosis with SPS, and a 2021 meta-analysis pooling six observational studies found no statistically significant increase in intestinal necrosis versus controls, although a pooled hazard ratio for severe GI adverse events was 1.46, reinforcing a signal for serious GI harm even if necrosis per se is rare and confidence intervals are wide; this aligns with the notion that absolute risk of necrosis is low but not negligible, especially in high-risk patients [^113VPL54].

> Let me consider absolute risk and context. Estimates from case-control and observational data suggest colonic necrosis on the order of roughly 0.14–0.3% in selected inpatient or CKD populations, with the caveat that ascertainment and coding limitations likely underestimate true incidence; nonetheless, given the severity and mortality, even a low absolute risk can translate into meaningful harm at the population level, particularly in vulnerable groups [^112zHX6z] [^111g41Y5].

> I should confirm who is highest risk so I can counsel appropriately. High-risk features repeatedly cited include advanced CKD or ESRD, postoperative ileus or recent abdominal surgery, prematurity or low birth weight, chronic constipation or bowel obstruction risk, ischemic colitis or vascular disease, and concomitant sorbitol; pediatric patients, especially neonates, warrant particular caution due to impaction and necrosis risk, and SPS should not be given orally to neonates [^116cvW3r] [^1163RSB1].

> But wait, what if safer alternatives exist. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate have modern randomized evidence and guideline support for chronic hyperkalemia management, with favorable safety profiles and no established signal for necrosis; in acute settings, SZC has shown noninferior potassium lowering to SPS without necrosis signals in comparative studies, and contemporary guidelines increasingly favor these agents over SPS when available, reserving SPS for select scenarios with careful risk mitigation [^111QeeCL] [^1171zCDB] [^114Kdv7g] [^111Psrjw].

> I should synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable answer. Yes, Kayexalate (SPS) increases the risk of gastrointestinal necrosis, particularly in the colon, and this risk is multifactorial: SPS crystals can cause direct mucosal injury and foreign-body reactions, sorbitol adds osmotic ischemic stress, and patient factors such as CKD, postoperative states, constipation, and vascular disease amplify vulnerability; while absolute risk appears low, the consequences can be severe and fatal, so SPS should be used only when benefits clearly outweigh risks, avoided in high-risk patients, administered without sorbitol, and discontinued if constipation develops, with preference given to patiromer or SZC when feasible [^116cvW3r] [^1171zCDB] [^113iNugs] [^111y1ojj] [^111QeeCL].

Kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate) is associated with **gastrointestinal necrosis**, including colonic necrosis and perforation, particularly when combined with sorbitol or used in patients with risk factors such as renal failure, bowel surgery, or constipation [^116cvW3r] [^1171zCDB]. The risk is **dose-related** and higher with per-label dosing; case reports and observational studies show a small but real increase in severe GI events, with mortality up to 33% in some series [^111y1ojj] [^113iNugs]. Modern guidelines recommend avoiding sorbitol-containing formulations and using caution in high-risk patients; newer potassium binders like patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are preferred when available [^1171zCDB] [^111QeeCL].

## Evidence linking kayexalate to gastrointestinal necrosis

Multiple sources document a **link between Kayexalate and GI necrosis**:

- **FDA warnings**: The FDA has repeatedly warned about intestinal necrosis, bleeding, ischemic colitis, and perforation with Kayexalate, especially when combined with sorbitol [^116cvW3r] [^1171zCDB].

- **Case reports**: Numerous case reports describe fatal or severe colonic necrosis and perforation with Kayexalate, with or without sorbitol, including in neonates and adults with renal failure or postoperative states [^113iNugs] [^111tHQsm] [^113H7XyU].

- **Observational studies**: Large cohorts show a dose-related increase in serious GI events (ulcers, perforations, ischemia/thrombosis) after Kayexalate initiation, particularly at per-label doses, with adjusted hazard ratios around 1.25–1.54 [^111y1ojj] [^111ebtpB] [^112zHX6z].

- **Meta-analysis**: A 2021 meta-analysis found no statistically significant increase in intestinal necrosis versus controls, but did find a significant increase in severe GI adverse events (HR ~1.46), suggesting a real though uncommon risk [^113VPL54].

## Risk factors and patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **higher risk** of GI necrosis with Kayexalate:

| **Risk factor** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Sorbitol co-administration | Hyperosmolar sorbitol can cause ischemic injury and necrosis; FDA warns against sorbitol with SPS [^116cvW3r] [^1171zCDB] |
| Renal insufficiency/failure | Uremic patients have impaired gut motility and ischemia risk; SPS crystals may lodge and cause injury [^112XktuB] [^112MkKiD] |
| Postoperative states | Recent bowel surgery or ileus increases ischemia and perforation risk [^111g41Y5] |
| Constipation/impaction | Delayed transit allows resin retention and mucosal injury [^116twGuJ] |
| Prematurity/low birth weight | Neonates have immature GI tracts and high risk of necrosis [^1163RSB1] [^111tHQsm] |
| Per-label dosing | Higher doses are associated with more GI events in observational data [^111y1ojj] [^111ebtpB] |

---

## Mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal necrosis

Proposed mechanisms include **direct mucosal injury** from SPS crystals causing mechanical trauma and inflammation, and **ischemic injury** from sorbitol-induced hyperosmolarity leading to vascular compromise and necrosis. Additional contributors include **delayed transit** with resin retention and **electrolyte disturbances** such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia that impair mucosal integrity.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **risk mitigation**:

- **Avoid sorbitol**: Do not combine Kayexalate with sorbitol due to necrosis risk [^116cvW3r] [^1171zCDB].

- **Use caution**: Avoid in patients with constipation, bowel obstruction, ischemic colitis, or postoperative ileus [^116cvW3r] [^1171zCDB].

- **Monitor for constipation**: Discontinue if constipation develops [^116twGuJ].

- **Prefer alternatives**: Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are preferred for chronic hyperkalemia when available [^114w2n4Z] [^111QeeCL].

---

## Comparison with alternative potassium-lowering agents

Compared with Kayexalate, **patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate** have superior safety profiles without reports of GI necrosis in clinical trials, and are guideline-preferred for chronic hyperkalemia management [^114w2n4Z] [^111QeeCL].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Kayexalate can cause **gastrointestinal necrosis**, particularly with sorbitol or in high-risk patients; the risk is small but clinically significant given severity and mortality. Clinicians should avoid sorbitol-containing formulations, use the lowest effective dose, monitor for GI symptoms, and consider newer binders when feasible.

### Gastrointestinal adverse events with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (kayexalate) use: a systematic review [^113iNugs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) is a cation-exchange resin routinely used in the management of hyperkalemia. However, its use has been associated with colonic necrosis and other fatal gastrointestinal adverse events. Although the addition of sorbitol to sodium polystyrene sulfonate preparations was previously believed to be the cause of gastrointestinal injury, recent reports have suggested that sodium polystyrene sulfonate itself may be toxic. Our objective was to systematically review case reports of adverse gastrointestinal events associated with sodium polystyrene sulfonate use.

Methods

MEDLINE (1948 to July 2011), EMBASE (1980 to July 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1993 to July 27, 2011), bibliographies of identified articles, and websites of relevant drug agencies and professional associations in the United States and Canada were reviewed to identify eligible reports of adverse gastrointestinal events associated with sodium polystyrene sulfonate use. Causality criteria of the World Health Organization causality assessment system were applied to each report.

Results

Thirty reports describing 58 cases (41 preparations containing sorbitol and 17 preparations without sorbitol) of adverse events were identified. The colon was the most common site of injury (n = 44; 76%), and transmural necrosis (n = 36; 62%) was the most common histopathologic lesion reported. Mortality was reported in 33% of these cases due to gastrointestinal injury.

Conclusions

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate use, both with and without sorbitol, may be associated with fatal gastrointestinal injury. Physicians must be cognizant of the risk of these adverse events when prescribing this therapy for the management of hyperkalemia.

### A phase 2 study on the treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease suggests that the selective potassium trap, ZS-9, is safe and efficient [^1139Ug39]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease, and it limits the use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in the populations expected to derive the most benefit from this drug class. Despite the need for safe, effective, and predictable hyperkalemia treatment, current treatment options remain limited.

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS; Kayexalate®) is the only product approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemia. Kayexalate is an organic polymer resin that nonselectively binds potassium (K +) and other divalent cations (e.g. calcium (Ca 2+), magnesium (Mg 2+)), and subsequently removes them via defecation, often stimulated by the additive sorbitol (a laxative and cathartic). Despite its long history of use, Kayexalate has never been evaluated in a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled setting. Its association with poor gastrointestinal tolerability and other substantial adverse events (AEs; e.g. sodium loading, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, colonic necrosis), makes it unsuitable for chronic administration.

### Vancomycin-resistantbacteraemia as a complication of kayexalate (sodium polystyrene sulfonate, SPS) in sorbitol-induced ischaemic colitis [^114WPzM7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

We present the case report of an 80-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease stage G5 admitted to the hospital with fluid overload and hyperkalaemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, Kayexalate) in sorbitol suspension was given orally to treat her hyperkalaemia, which precipitated an episode of SPS in sorbitol-induced ischaemic colitis with the subsequent complication of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteraemia. SPS (Kayexalate) in sorbitol suspension has been implicated in the development of intestinal necrosis. Sorbitol, which is added as a cathartic agent to decrease the chance of faecal impaction, may be primarily responsible through several proposed mechanisms. The gold standard of diagnosis is the presence of SPS crystals in the colon biopsy. On a MEDLINE search, no previous reports of a VRE bacteraemia as a complication of biopsy-confirmed SPS in sorbitol ischaemic colitis were found. To the best of our knowledge, ours would be the first such case ever reported.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis in a 850 Gram infant receiving sorbitol-free sodium polystyrene sulfonate (kayexalate): clinical and histopathologic findings [^111tHQsm]. Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

We report a 27-week, 850 g infant with severe Streptococcus group B sepsis and life-threatening hyperkalemia due to progressive anuria. On the fourth day of life, after he failed treatment with diuretics, salbutamol, insulin, calcium gluconate and sodium bicarbonate, he was treated with sorbitol-free Kayexalate enemas. Potassium level slowly decreased from 9.2 mmol/l to normal level along with a recovery of normal urine output. On the 11th day of life, clinical and radiological signs of a perforated necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) occurred and the patient required surgical intestinal resection. Histologic examination of the ileum specimen revealed areas of necrosis with fibrosis and giant cell reaction to a nonpolarizable material consistent with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Usually, Kayexalate is suspended in hyperosmolar sorbitol solutions and the elevated osmolarity seems to be responsible for hemorrhagic colitis, transmural necrosis and definitely NEC. Our case report shows that Kayexalate per se, and not necessarily suspended in sorbitol, can lead to gastrointestinal tract complications and NEC in preterm infants.

### Rectal stenosis caused by foreign body reaction to sodium polystyrene sulfonate crystals (kayexalate) [^113gCe21]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) (Kayexalate) is a cation-exchange resin used to treat hyperkaliema. Administered with sorbitol, it usually has minor adverse effects, but it may cause colonic or intestinal necrosis in uremic patients. We report an unusual case of rectal stenosis due to SPS crystals in a 46-year-old man. The patient had been involved in a car accident with severe thoracic and abdominal trauma. During his hospitalization, he presented traumatic acute pancreatitis with ischemic colitis because of hypotension, and acute renal insufficiency treated by hemofiltration and Kayexalate administered by nasogastric tube without sorbitol. Left colon was resected and Hartmann's procedure was performed. Restoration of the colon continuity was performed 13 months later. The rectal lumen was narrowed with a thickened rectal wall. Microscopic examination revealed fibrosis of the submucosa containing numerous basophilic polygonal crystals surrounded by macrophages. This is the first case report of rectal stenosis caused by foreign body reaction to SPS crystals after ischemic colitis.

### Risk of intestinal necrosis with sodium polystyrene sulfonate: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VPL54]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reports of severe gastrointestinal side effects associated with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), particularly intestinal necrosis, have led some to recommend costlier alternative medications. No prior systematic review has included studies with controls reporting intestinal necrosis rates associated with SPS.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection from database inception through October 4, 2020. We included any clinical trial, cohort, or case-control study reporting an association between SPS and intestinal necrosis or severe gastrointestinal side effects.

Results

Six studies including 26,716 patients treated with SPS with controls met inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of intestinal necrosis was 1.43 (95% CI, 0.39–5.20). The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for intestinal necrosis from the two studies that performed survival analysis was 2.00 (95% CI, 0.45–8.78). The pooled HR for the composite outcome of severe gastrointestinal adverse events was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.01–2.11).

Conclusion

Based on our review of six studies, the risk of intestinal necrosis with SPS is not statistically greater than controls, although there was a statistically significantly increased risk for the composite outcome of severe gastrointestinal side effects based on two studies. Because of the risk of bias from potential confounding and selective reporting, the overall strength of evidence to support an association between SPS and intestinal necrosis or other severe gastrointestinal side effects is low.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^116UjKWP]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As life expectancy in many countries increases into the 80s and beyond, degenerative joint disease is creating an increasing burden for patients and healthcare systems. For osteoarthritis especially, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) remain the most effective option for pain relief, short of surgical alternatives such as joint replacement. However, gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and their complications are well-known NSAID side effects that are more prevalent in the elderly and are, at times, life-threatening.

The recognition that NSAIDS damage the stomach and duodenum (at least partly) by blocking the mucosal production of protective prostaglandins catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 led to the development of COX-1-sparing NSAIDs. These selectively inhibit COX-2, which mediates synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The strategy has been successful: highly selective COX-2 inhibitors do reduce (but do not eliminate) the risk of GI ulceration. However, an unanticipated risk that surfaced in several randomized studies was an increase in adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in patients taking COX-2 inhibitors for months or years. The European Medicines Agency responded promptly, stating, in 2005, that ' COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease… '. On the other hand, the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), in the same year, declined to make such a limiting statement – noting that it was unclear whether COX-2 inhibitors carried a greater vascular risk than the older non-selective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs), that further research was required, and that in the meantime warnings about the possibility of increased CV risk with all NSAIDs should be included in drug labeling.

### ▼ patiromer for the management of hyperkalaemia [^1161UUFN]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, in which there is an abnormally high concentration of potassium ions in the blood. 1,2 Cation-exchange resins (e.g. calcium or sodium polystyrene sulfonate) that bind potassium in the gastrointestinal tract to increase faecal elimination have been used as part of the management of hyperkalaemia but they have some serious adverse effects, including potentially fatal gastrointestinal necrosis. 3,4 Patiromer (▼Veltassa - Vifor Fresenius) is a cation-exchange polymer that is licensed for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in adults and, unlike other exchange resins, its licence is not restricted to people with anuria, severe oliguria or those requiring or undergoing dialysis. 5,6 Here, we review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of patiromer and consider its place in the management of hyperkalaemia.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114w2n4Z]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Potassium exchange agents — sodium- or calcium-polystyrene sulfonates (SPS/CPS), patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) — are contrasted for dosing, onset, administration timing, and adverse effects. SPS/CPS dosing is Oral: 15–60 g/d (up to 4 times per day) and Rectal: 30 g/d (for SPS up to a maximum of 50 g/d), with maintenance 15–60 g/d orally per day depending on potassium level and level of tolerability; onset is variable, hours to days, and duration is variable, 6–24 hours. Patiromer dosing is Initial: 8.4 g orally once per day (maximum 25.2 g orally once per day); dose can be increased by 8.4 g increments at 1-week intervals, with maintenance 8.4–25.2 g orally once per day. SZC dosing is Initial: 10 g orally 3 times per day for up to 48 hours, with maintenance 5 g every second day to 10 g once per day; it starts to reduce potassium within 1 hour with normokalemia typically at 24–48 hours. Administration timing includes separating SPS/CPS from oral medications by at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after administration and, if gastroparesis, separating other medications by 6 hours; SZC should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after oral medicinal products with clinically meaningful gastric pH-dependent bioavailability. Adverse effects for SPS/CPS include GI events and potentially serious GI adverse events (intestinal necrosis, bleeding, ischemic colitis, and perforation).

### Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kionex) [^116cvW3r]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Intestinal Necrosis

Cases of intestinal necrosis, which may be fatal, and other serious gastrointestinal adverse events (bleeding, ischemic colitis, perforation) have been reported in association with sodium polystyrene sulfonate use. The majority of these cases reported the concomitant use of sorbitol. Risk factors for gastrointestinal adverse events were present in many of the cases including prematurity, history of intestinal disease or surgery, hypovolemia, and renal insufficiency and failure. Concomitant administration of additional sorbitol is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Use only in patients who have normal bowel function. Avoid use in patients who have not had a bowel movement post-surgery.
Avoid use in patients who are at risk for developing constipation or impaction (including those with history of impaction, chronic constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, vascular intestinal atherosclerosis, previous bowel resection, or bowel obstruction).
Discontinue use in patients who develop constipation.

Alternative Therapy in Severe Hyperkalemia

Since the effective lowering of serum potassium with sodium polystyrene sulfonate may take hours to days, treatment with this drug alone may be insufficient to rapidly correct severe hyperkalemia associated with states of rapid tissue breakdown (e.g., burns and renal failure) or hyperkalemia so marked as to constitute a medical emergency. Therefore, other definitive measures, including dialysis, should always be considered and may be imperative.

### Treatment of hyperkalemia: something old, something new [^1179RgeH]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment options for hyperkalemia have not changed much since the introduction of the cation exchange resin, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate, Covis Pharmaceuticals, Cary, NC), over 50 years ago. Although clinicians of that era did not have ready access to hemodialysis or loop diuretics, the other tools that we use today-calcium, insulin, and bicarbonate-were well known to them. Currently recommended insulin regimens provide too little insulin to achieve blood levels with a maximal kalemic effect and too little glucose to avoid hypoglycemia. Short-acting insulins have theoretical advantages over regular insulin in patients with severe kidney disease. Although bicarbonate is no longer recommended for acute management, it may be useful in patients with metabolic acidosis or intact kidney function. Kayexalate is not effective as acute therapy, but a new randomized controlled trial suggests that it is effective when given more chronically. Gastrointestinal side effects and safety concerns about Kayexalate remain. New investigational potassium binders are likely to be approved in the coming year. Although there are some concerns about hypomagnesemia and positive calcium balance from patiromer, and sodium overload from ZS-9 (ZS Pharma, Coppell, TX), both agents have been shown to be effective and well tolerated when taken chronically. ZS-9 shows promise in the acute treatment of hyperkalemia and may make it possible to avoid or postpone the most effective therapy, emergency hemodialysis.

### Pathological effects of drugs on the gastrointestinal tract: a review [^113LuDEt]. Human Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Drug-induced injury of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is increasingly common but generally under-recognized. Although there is an overwhelming number of drugs that are associated with adverse GI effects, there is a limited number of characteristic injury patterns that should prompt consideration of drug-induced GI pathology. These include the following: erosions, ulcers, and strictures; crystal deposition; parietal cell changes; reactive gastropathy; pseudodysplastic changes; microscopic colitis; infectious or necrotizing enterocolitis; ischemic colitis; focal active colitis; and increased epithelial apoptosis. This article reviews morphological and pathophysiological features of some of the more common and pathologically recognizable drug-related injury patterns and provides a practical guide for the recognition and diagnosis of drug-induced pathology in the upper and lower GI tract.

### Effect of patiromer on reducing serum potassium and preventing recurrent hyperkalaemia in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease on RAAS inhibitors [^115cw9bP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality as well as hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) in patients with chronic HF and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and have been accorded a class 1 indication in international guidelines. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicating their HF, renal excretion of potassium (K +) is compromised and is in part compensated by an increase in colonic excretion, which often is not sufficient to avoid hyperkalaemia. 7 Patients with CKD and HFrEF are therefore at an increased risk of death but paradoxically often receive suboptimal doses of RAASi because of fear of inducing hyperkalaemia (serum K + > 5.0 mEq/L) and its consequences, including sudden cardiac death. 8, 9, 10 While there are several options for the treatment of acute hyperkalaemia, options for the management of chronic hyperkalaemia, and thereby maintaining RAASi use in patients with HF, are limited. Agents that have been employed to manage persistently high K + levels include diuretics (with or without sodium bicarbonate) and the K + ‐binding resins, calcium polystyrene sulphonate (CPS) and sodium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS). 11, 12 Calcium polystyrene sulphonate and SPS can lead to serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), including colonic necrosis and perforation, 11, 12, 13, 14 which has led to warnings in the prescribing information. 11, 12, 15 In addition, because sodium is the counter exchange ion with SPS, caution is advised when treating patients who cannot tolerate even small increases in sodium load (e.g. those with severe congestive HF, severe hypertension, or marked oedema). 11 Patients with chronic HF who develop hyperkalaemia therefore often have their dose of RAASi reduced or discontinued, 8, 10, 16 thereby exposing them to increased cardiovascular risk.

### Portomesenteric venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to mesenteric ischaemia [^111Xx27P]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The most common cause of PI and PVG is bowel ischaemia (∼70% of cases); however, with the increased use of CT imaging, both PI and PVG are being encountered more frequently and owing to several other conditions including mechanical causes such as complete or partial bowel obstruction, trauma, radiation and diverticulitis, as well as benign idiopathic causes such as recent surgery, inflammatory bowel disease and kayexalate use. Such findings therefore present a dilemma in the differential diagnosis and management of PVG; and/or PI as an exploratory laparotomy performed on all these patients would result in up to 30% of patients being subjected to an unnecessary procedure.

Although ischaemic bowel carries a high mortality rate of up to 75–90%, the presence or degree of PVG and PI does not necessarily confer a higher mortality rate. Both PVG and PI may occasionally be found even in patients with only partial mural bowel ischaemia. Therefore, neither PVG nor PI can be used to distinguish between transmural bowel infarction and only partial mural bowel ischaemia, if they are encountered as mild and isolated findings. However, transmural infarction of the affected bowel does become likely if PI is pronounced and band like as opposed to bubble like and, more importantly, if it is combined with PVG, as in the case described.

Currently, the basis for determining the mortality or morbidity in cases of PVG or PI is related to the underlying cause and not the presence or extent of these radiological findings. However, there are no data in the literature to suggest whether the presence of PVG or PI on CT is an indicator of an adverse prognosis in patients suffering from transmural infarction.

Learning points

Although the most common cause of portal venous gas (PVG) or pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is bowel ischaemia, several other benign causes have been identified and therefore a laparotomy is only indicated when suspecting intestinal ischaemia based on all the radiological and clinical findings.
Transmural infarction is more likely in the presence of both PI and PVG, however, they do not necessarily indicate a worse prognosis and prompt surgical intervention is essential to achieving a favourable outcome.

### Initiation of sodium polystyrene sulphonate and the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide study [^112XktuB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings add to previous evidence and provoke concern, suggesting caution in the use of this medication. Observational evidence is also supported by some, but not all, animal studies, which demonstrate that the administration of SPS enemas at high doses with or without sorbitol results in colonic necrosis. However, neither our observational study nor previous evidence can yet prove causality in the associations reported. In our study, we cannot ascertain whether the risk observed is explained by the use of SPS or by other conditions that make the patient prone to both hyperkalaemia requiring SPS and GI complications. This reverse causality is plausible in patients with CKD, who are predisposed to non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia by often advanced arteriosclerosis through angiotensin II–mediated vasoconstriction and often subjected to concomitant hypotension, ileus-induced colonic distension (resulting in reduced colonic blood flow) and decreased gut motility as a result of opioids, uraemia and constipation. Constipation and reduced GI motility can theoretically increase potassium bioavailability in the intestine leading to hyperkalaemia.

To conclude, this real-world evidence analysis shows that SPS is frequently used by persons with advanced CKD/ESKD chronically and at lower dosages than specified on the product label. Compared with non-use, we observed an increased relative risk of the combined endpoint of intestinal ischaemia, thrombosis or ulceration/perforation for SPS use. In addition, SPS use was associated with a higher rate of laxative dispensations. These associations were more evident in patients prescribed per label SPS dosages.

### Celebrex [^116Hnm7c]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Physicians and patients should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during CELEBREX therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Celebrex is contraindicated in patients with active GI bleeding.

Borderline elevations of one or more liver-associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including CELEBREX [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical trials of CELEBREX, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for CELEBREX and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking CELEBREX and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.

### Mitigating GI risks associated with the use of NSAIDs [^114VXTG7]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have multiple established adverse effects on various organ systems. Among those associated with high mortality are gastrointestinal complications. We address the scope of the problem and the scientific basis for risk mitigation.

Design

This review covers the most successful of such strategies published to date.

Results

Mitigation strategies to enable ongoing anti-inflammatory benefit are well studied, albeit imperfect.

Conclusions

Such strategies may involve the choice of NSAID or the combined use of gastroprotective measures in association with NSAIDs.

### Sodium polystyrene sulfonate [^1171zCDB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Intestinal Necrosis:

Cases of intestinal necrosis, which may be fatal, and other serious gastrointestinal adverse events (bleeding, ischemic colitis, perforation) have been reported in association with sodium polystyrene sulfonate use. The majority of these cases reported the concomitant use of sorbitol. Risk factors for gastrointestinal adverse events were present in many of the cases including prematurity, history of intestinal disease or surgery, hypovolemia, and renal insufficiency and failure. Concomitant administration of sorbitol is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Use only in patients who have normal bowel function. Avoid use in patients who have not had a bowel movement post-surgery.
Avoid use in patients who are at risk for developing constipation or impaction (including those with history of impaction, chronic constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, vascular intestinal atherosclerosis, previous bowel resection, or bowel obstruction).
Discontinue use in patients who develop constipation.

Alternative Therapy in Severe Hyperkalemia:

Since effective lowering of serum potassium with sodium polystyrene sulfonate may take hours to days, treatment with this drug alone may be insufficient to rapidly correct severe hyperkalemia associated with states of rapid tissue breakdown (e.g., burns and renal failure) or hyperkalemia so marked as to constitute a medical emergency. Therefore, other definitive measures, including dialysis, should always be considered and may be imperative.

Hypokalemia:

Serious potassium deficiency can occur from therapy with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. The effect must be carefully controlled by frequent serum potassium determinations within each 24 hour period. Since intracellular potassium deficiency is not always reflected by serum potassium levels, the level at which treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate should be discontinued must be determined individually for each patient. Important aids in making this determination are the patient's clinical condition and electrocardiogram. Early clinical signs of severe hypokalemia include a pattern of irritable confusion and delayed thought processes.

Electrocardiographically, severe hypokalemia is often associated with a lengthened Q-T interval, widening, flattening, or inversion of the T wave, and prominent U waves. Also, cardiac arrhythmias may occur, such as premature atrial, nodal, and ventricular contractions, and supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. The toxic effects of digitalis are likely to be exaggerated. Marked hypokalemia can also be manifested by severe muscle weakness, at times extending into frank paralysis.

PRECAUTIONS

Caution is advised when sodium polystyrene sulfonate is administered to patients who cannot tolerate even a small increase in sodium loads (i.e., severe congestive heart failure, severe hypertension, or marked edema). In such instances, compensatory restriction of sodium intake from other sources may be indicated.

Precautions should be taken to ensure the use of adequate volumes of sodium-free cleansing enemas after rectal administration.

In the event of clinically significant constipation, treatment with Kionex Suspension should be discontinued until normal bowel motion is resumed. (see WARNINGS, Intestinal Necrosis).

### Etodolac [^113tiYEY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, and who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly of debilitated patients, and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at a greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Emergency potassium normalization treatment including sodium zirconium cyclosilicate: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ENERGIZE) [^116szBgG]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte condition in the emergency department (ED) population. It is estimated that more than 800,000 hyperkalemia‐related ED visits occur annually in the United States. 1 Although literature on hyperkalemia epidemiology in the ED is limited, one study reported that hyperkalemia was observed in 3.6% of all ED patients. 2 When left untreated, severe hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. 3, 4 Indeed, severe hyperkalemia is associated with increased all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. 3, 5, 6

Emergency department patients with severe hyperkalemia require immediate therapy. 3 Dialysis is extremely effective, but logistic issues often preclude its rapid implementation. 7 Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and patiromer, may be effective, but evidence regarding efficacy and onset of action is varied. 8, 9 SPS has been reported to cause severe gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, including colonic necrosis. 10, 11 Together with the lack of demonstrated efficacy of SPS, its risk–benefit profile suggests that it may not be a suitable emergency treatment of hyperkalemia. 10, 11 Bicarbonate can be used in a limited population of acidotic patients and beta agonists may be effective for a short period. 12 Unfortunately, with the exception of diuretics, dialysis, and potassium binders, no treatment removes potassium from the body. 12

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastrointestinal toxicity [^113ddmWE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Toxic effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract, primarily complicated gastric and intestinal ulcers, are the most common undesirable effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. During the last several years, there have been several advances, both in the laboratory and clinically, toward reducing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs' gastrointestinal toxicity. Some of these important developments are the delineation of mechanisms of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, identification of groups at highest risk for development of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal complications, recognition of co-therapies that could reduce nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity, and, most recently, development of classes of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with improved gastrointestinal safety profiles. Many of these advances have occurred during the last year. This review focuses on several of the important recent observations that have improved understanding and safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the gastrointestinal tract.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^113MRRNL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Hepatotoxicity

Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials with NSAIDS. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.

Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^115KKUyb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

To reduce the potassium load within the patient, it is advised to discontinue all dietary sources of exogenous potassium in meals, drinks, formulas, and potassium-raising medications. For the elimination of excess potassium, diuretics can increase potassium urinary excretion in children with preserved diuresis. Loop diuretics have the highest kaliuretic effect. The utilization of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), a sodium/potassium exchange resin, is also recommended. This can be administered either as an enema in 20% sorbitol or orally as a powder mixed with liquid. Enema administration is preferred for its higher effectiveness in inducing potassium losses through diarrhea. The typical dose of SPS is approximately 1 g/kg, resulting in a reduction of serum potassium by around 0.8 meq/L. To ensure efficacy, it is essential to retain the resin in place for at least half an hour. Potential complications of SPS administration include hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, sodium overload, and hypokalemia. Therefore, when administering SPS orally, it is important to avoid concurrent use of laxatives and antacids. An additional cation exchange resin that can be used to eliminate potassium includes sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate. These exchange sodium or calcium for potassium within the large intestine. These resins are administered orally or rectally and can be used preferentially for patients with chronic hyperkalemia. Although they can bind up to 1 mmol of potassium per 1 g of resin, their administration may lead to electrolyte abnormalities and gastrointestinal disturbances as side effects. Currently, their use in acute hyperkalemia cases is not supported by high-quality evidence. Various medical therapies for acute hyperkalemia are shown in Table 5. In cases of persistent hyperkalemia despite conservative measures, renal replacement therapy is utilized, with hemodialysis being the preferred modality due to its rapid and immediate effectiveness.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^111QeeCL]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — potassium binders for persistent hyperkalemia: In patients with chronic kidney disease, we suggest using potassium binders in the management of persistent, non-life-threatening hyperkalemia (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). The newer potassium binding agents, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC/ZS-9) and patiromer, significantly reduced mean potassium levels compared to placebo, and older agents, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) and Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate (CPS), were shown to significantly reduce mean serum potassium when compared to placebo. One study suggests that use of potassium binders is effective at controlling hyperkalemia, which allows continuation of RAAS blockade in patients with CKD or heart failure. The overall strength of the evidence for the outcomes assessed in the evidence base is Low to Very low due to the limitations in the methodological quality of the included RCTs. Natale et al. indicated no difference in cardiovascular death or hospitalization between the newer potassium binding agents versus placebo; there were no hospitalizations noted with the older potassium binding agents or placebo, and in Dong et al., there were no recorded deaths with SPS or CPS. Two deaths, one of which was cardiovascular, were reported in the SZC/ZS-9 group and none in the other studied groups, and the authors did not specify whether the deaths were related to bowel necrosis or hyperkalemia. The side effect profile of potassium binders consists primarily of GI side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation, and with SPS there is a rare side effect of bowel necrosis seen with older formulations; treatment of hyperkalemia with potassium binders is appropriate in CKD to reduce the risk of life-threatening hyperkalemia and permit the use of medications to slow the progression of CKD.

### Ion-exchange resins for the treatment of hyperkalemia: are they safe and effective? [^116dLKGT]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), an ion-exchange resin designed to bind potassium in the colon, was approved in 1958 as a treatment for hyperkalemia by the US Food and Drug Administration, 4 years before drug manufacturers were required to prove the effectiveness and safety of their drugs. In September 2009, citing reports of colonic necrosis, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning advising against concomitant administration of sorbitol, an osmotic cathartic used to prevent SPS-induced fecal impaction and to speed delivery of resin to the colon, with the powdered resin; however, a premixed suspension of SPS in sorbitol, the only preparation stocked by many hospital pharmacies, is prescribed routinely for treatment of hyperkalemia. We can find no convincing evidence that SPS increases fecal potassium losses in experimental animals or humans and no evidence that adding sorbitol to the resin increases its effectiveness as a treatment for hyperkalemia. There is growing concern, however, that suspensions of SPS in sorbitol can be harmful. It would be wise to exhaust other alternatives for managing hyperkalemia before turning to these largely unproven and potentially harmful therapies.

### NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injury: a focused update for clinicians [^113nUh3x]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Gastroenterologists care for users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when the vast population exposed to the medication class experiences a relatively uncommon serious gastrointestinal (GI) side effect. As serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of these drugs have also been recognized, there remains continued confusion about the best treatment for patients who benefit from NSAID therapy and are at risk for GI and CV adverse events. Recognition of those patients at risk and strategies to reduce the adverse side effects of NSAIDs continues to provide an opportunity to improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the injury induced by these agents throughout the GI tract as well as strategies to prevent acute injury and reduce the development of serious adverse events. NSAID medication selection as well as GI cotherapy should balance individual patients' GI and CV risks.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Kionex Suspension may cause some degree of gastric irritation. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation may occur especially if high doses are given. Also, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and significant sodium retention, and their related clinical manifestations, may occur (see WARNINGS). Occasionally diarrhea develops. Large doses in elderly individuals may cause fecal impaction (see PRECAUTIONS). Rare instances of intestinal necrosis have been reported. Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide, when used in combination with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, has been reported.

The following events have been reported from worldwide post marketing experience:

Fecal impaction following rectal administration, particularly in children;
Gastrointestinal concretions (bezoars) following oral administration;
Ischemic colitis, gastrointestinal tract ulceration or necrosis which could lead to intestinal perforation; and
Rare cases of acute bronchitis and/or bronchopneumonia associated with inhalation of particles of polystyrene sulfonate (see WARNINGS).

### Initiation of sodium polystyrene sulphonate and the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide study [^112zHX6z]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The main finding in our study is the estimation of adverse risks associated with SPS use, which, to our knowledge, has not been shown before, except in case–control studies, single-centre retrospective analyses and case reports. We observe a dose-dependent increased incidence of serious GI adverse events for CKD patients initiating SPS therapy. SPS was prescribed as a solo agent, and no SPS user took concomitant sorbitol, in accordance with recommendations from the medical agencies. Previous reports have focused on the risk of colonic injury/necrosis, often requiring pathological confirmation for identification. This outcome is certainly a rare occurrence. In a case–control analysis of adult inpatients at a tertiary medical centre, 0.14% of individuals receiving SPS had colonic necrosis, compared with 0.07% of individuals who were not given SPS. In another study of haemodialysis patients, colonic surgery (taken here as a marker of colonic necrosis) was no more common in patients who received SPS (0.6%) than in those not given SPS (1.0%). We focused instead on a composite of serious GI complications that reflects the broad spectrum of reported GI injury with SPS use. In this context, we observed an increased relative risk of ulcers and perforations after SPS initiation, particularly at per label dosages. The association with the risk of intestinal ischaemia/thrombosis was less evident, possibly impacted by the limited number of these events (< 3 per 1000 patient-years). Overall, although relative risks are higher, absolute risks for our composite outcome remain low. Furthermore, this information needs to be contextualized with the varying SPS prescription rates across countries. As shown by Jadoul et al. in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, SPS was used by an average of 40–45% of French dialysis patients, followed by Sweden with a 20–25% SPS prescription rate. Other countries such as Italy, Belgium and Canada prescribed it to 5–15% of their patients, and countries such as the UK, USA, Australia/New Zealand and Germany have SPS prescription rates < 5%.

### Damned if you do, damned if you don't: potassium binding resins in hyperkalemia [^111g41Y5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) potassium binding resins increase colonic potassium excretion and are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hyperkalemia. In 2009, the FDA recommended that sorbitol, a cathartic often given with SPS to prevent obstipation, not be added to SPS powder because of associated colonic necrosis. A premixed oral suspension of SPS in 33% sorbitol was not included in this warning. SPS resins increase stool potassium excretion in normokalemic subjects, but proportionately more potassium is excreted due to cathartics when the two are combined. In hyperkalemic patients, oral SPS mixed in water significantly decreases serum potassium within 24 hours. SPS/sorbitol-associated colonic necrosis is most commonly seen in patients who have received enemas in the setting of recent abdominal surgery, bowel injury, or intestinal dysfunction. It is a rare event, on the order of 0.2 to 0.3%, almost exclusively present in patients at risk. The agent most likely associated with colonic necrosis is 70% sorbitol, and animal data support that etiology. There is very little data to suggest that oral SPS given with 33% sorbitol (in the premixed form) or SPS powder in water orally or as an enema causes colonic necrosis. SPS ion-exchange resins are the only agents, other than dialysis and diuretics, available to increase potassium excretion in hyperkalemia, and when used appropriately, they appear to be clinically effective and reasonably safe.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the prophylactic effect of pentoxifylline (Ptx) on complications related to radiation.

Study Design and Setting

Seventy-eight patients who had postoperative radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were enrolled into a prospective study. Patients were randomly assigned to the Ptx group (40 patients) and the control group (38 patients). Ptx was given to the patients at a dose of 400 mg 3 times a day orally to a total of 1200 mg. We noted radiotherapy complications in each group.

Results

Four patients were not able to tolerate this drug due to the development of gastrointestinal symptoms and dizziness. Late skin changes, fibrosis, and soft tissue necrosis were more severely in the control group than in the Ptx group (P < 0.05). We could find no positive effects on acute skin reactions and pain (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

Our study suggests that Ptx has a prophylactic effect on the radiation complications. This can be explained by protective effect of Ptx against vascular pathology.

### Gastrointestinal effects of NSAIDs and coxibs [^114356Bo]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used drugs in the world, but their use is limited because of their propensity to cause gastrointestinal (GI) injury. All patients are at risk of GI injury but certain risk factors increase the likelihood of adverse GI effects. The most important include a history of ulcer or GI complications, increasing age, concomitant anticoagulation, concomitant corticosteroid use, and high-dose NSAIDs or multiple NSAIDs (including an NSAID plus low-dose aspirin). Concurrent illness (e.g., severe rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease) has also been reported to increase the risk of GI events. NSAID-associated GI side effects markedly increase health care costs, with up to 31% of cost of managing arthritis patients accounted for through the management of GI side effects. The COX-2 specific inhibitors (coxibs) were developed with the aim of maintaining anti-inflammatory efficacy but improving gastrointestinal safety in comparison to non-selective NSAIDs. The use of COX-2 specific inhibitors significantly decreases the rate of endoscopic ulcers as compared to traditional NSAIDs. Prospective GI outcomes studies also indicate that these agents decrease clinical GI events as compared to non-selective NSAIDs. The number of patients needed to treat to avert one clinical event in one year is approximately 40–100. The cost-effectiveness of coxibs increases (the cost per GI event averted decreases) in patients with high-risk clinical features because they have higher rates of GI hospitalizations and greater use of expensive prophylactic co-therapy.

### Role of vitamin dcombined to alginates in preventing acid and oxidative injury in cultured gastric epithelial cells [^111v4pRi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of gastric diseases (for example chronic gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulceration, adenocarcinoma and gastric MALT lymphoma) on human health is a worldwide problem in modern society. For example in the USA, studies have reported gastrointestinal illness rates in the range of 0.5–2 episodes/year/person and incidence of 5–100 episodes/1000/week according to seasons and age. The number of episodes of gastrointestinal illnesses is similar in both 40-year-old studies and in recent ones. Human stomach is extremely vulnerable to various attacks; trauma can cause erosion and mucosal epithelium damage which lead to gastrointestinal tract bleeding and/or ulcer perforation and finally worsen the original disease. The gastrointestinal epithelium is a fundamental barrier protecting the gastrointestinal mucosa from damage against the outside environment. The cytoprotective functions against damage may be accomplished in the early phase of epithelial repair known as restitution, which is the ability of epithelial cells to spread and migrate across the basement membrane to repair the damage. This event is the basis of repair of mucosae after injury and is an important element to grant continuity over broad areas within hours. This reparative event occurs rapidly. The damage to gastric mucosa deriving from stress ulcer has been shown in in vivo models to be possibly repaired within 24 h. Gastric acid (HCl) secreted from gastric parietal cells has been reported to determine gastric mucosal injuries such as peptic ulcer and to induce gastropathy. A prolonged exposition to strong acidic environment causes coagulation necrosis resulting from the desiccating action of the acid on proteins in exposed tissues. A mild gastritis condition is often associated with overindulgence in food and alcohol or stress and each episode causes more lasting damage, eventually resulting in cellular injury which in turn causes inflammation. Consequent inflammation produces free radicals which in turn create even more tissue destruction eventually injuring DNA and potentially leading to stomach cancer, which is one of the most lethal malignancies known so far. In addition, HCl enhances the process of lipid peroxidation in gastric mucosa; the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential thus induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria causing lipid peroxidation. ROS, including H₂O₂, are a major cause of cellular oxidative damage and they play a critical role in the pathogenesis of gastric disorders. Under physiological conditions, gastric epithelium is exposed to high levels of ROS, derived from physical, chemical, or microbiological agents existing in gastric lumen, far higher than in other tissues or biological fluids. Accumulation of intracellular ROS is caused by incomplete reduction of oxygen and this imbalance leads to oxidative stress. H₂O₂ is a stable, small and uncharged molecule, that freely diffuses through cell membranes. An excessive level of H 2 O 2 causes apoptosis, necrosis, and other oxidative damages. When the lower esophageal sphincter is weak, the acid unnaturally moves up into the esophagus, causing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), whose cardinal symptom is heartburn, mainly occurring postprandially.

### Intestinal necrosis associated with orally administered calcium polystyrene sulfonate without sorbitol [^113H7XyU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of extensive intestinal necrosis with oral intake of calcium polystyrene sulfonate without sorbitol.

Case Summary

A 73-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed widespread dilatation of the bowel. The diagnosis of acute colonic pseudoobstruction was made. On day 3, her serum potassium level rose to 5.6 mEq/L. It was treated with hydrocortisone 100 mg/day and calcium polystyrene sulfonate 15 g/day via nasogastric tube from day 3 to day 6. On day 6, the severe abdominal pain recurred, with abdominal tenderness. CT scan showed pneumoperitoneum and peritoneal effusion. At surgery, 2 lenticular jejunal perforations and an ischemic cecum were found. Microscopic findings indicated that the transmural abscess contained massive inflammatory infiltrate and the cecal mucosa showed ulceration and inflammation with a fibrinous and purulent coating. Small gray-purple or blue angulated crystals were embedded in the cecal and most of the jejunal mucosal ulcers. On day 19, the patient died of multiple organ failure after her third laparotomy.

Discussion

Ion-exchanging resins are given orally or by retention enema for the treatment of hyperkalemia. The most commonly used and best-established resin is sodium polystyrene sulfonate. However, it is known to promote colonic necrosis when sorbitol is also given or especially in patients with renal failure or postoperative ileus. Calcium polystyrene sulfonate is another ion-exchange resin. There are few reports of adverse effects in the literature. Our case is interesting for 2 reasons: the resin given was calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol was not used.

Conclusions

Like sodium polystyrene sulfonate, calcium polystyrene sulfonate is an ion-exchanging resin that can promote bowel necrosis. We believe that it should not be used with sorbitol or when bowel transit time is slowed.

### Fractal deposits of a hemostatic hydrophilic polymer in mohs micrographic surgery frozen sections: a histologic analysis and comparison with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (kayexalate) [^1143JE3h]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hydrophilic polymer with potassium ferrate (HPPF) powder is available as an over-the-counter hemostatic agent used by patients to stop superficial bleeding. In dermatology, it is applied to stop bleeding after superficial shave or punch biopsies or in open wounds after Mohs micrographic surgery. Despite its widespread availability, however, HPPF in histopathologic skin sections is highly unusual. We noted HPPF in skin closely resembles sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) seen in colonic necrosis; SPS is a potassium binder given orally or rectally in hyperkalemic patients with end-stage renal disease. We describe the in vivo and in vitro histologic appearance of HPPF, compare HPPF with SPS, and discuss its potential migration into blood or lymph vessels.

### Macrophagic reaction to sodium polystyrene sulfonate crystals mimicking peritoneal carcinomatosis on 18 F-FDG PET / CT in rectal cancer [^117XSZ24]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A 68-year-old man presented with rectal bleeding 1 year after a highly complicated surgical course for upper rectal cancer. Endoscopic biopsy confirmed a local recurrence at the rectal stump. 18F-FDG PET/CT showed intense uptake in peritoneal nodules, suggesting peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, exploratory laparoscopy and pathologic analysis identified basophilic crystals consistent with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) as the cause of a foreign-body granulomatous reaction, with no evidence of tumor recurrence. This case underscores the importance of considering rare causes of peritoneal false-positive PET/CT findings in patients with a history of severe abdominal complications, ensuring accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^112x2H2C]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS)

SPS was introduced to the market in 1958 prior to the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments, laws that established protocols for drug safety and efficacy. SPS can be administered orally or rectally, and exchanges Na + for K + within the distal colon. The drug also has an affinity for divalent cations including calcium (Ca 2+) and magnesium (Mg 2+), thus there is a potential risk of hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. In rare cases, SPS has been associated with intestinal necrosis and increased mortality when combined with 70% sorbitol, resulting in a 2009 FDA black-box warning against long-term use for hyperkalemia management. Sorbitol was initially added for its laxative properties, to minimize bowel impaction with SPS. A review of case reports published between 1948–2011 identified 58 cases of SPS serious adverse events (41 preparations with sorbitol and 17 preparations without sorbitol); there was an associated 33% mortality rate. This is a rare event; approximately 5 million doses of SPS are administered in the United States annually.

SPS was the only K + lowering resin available for over 50 years, and remains widely used among clinicians today (without sorbitol or with much lower concentrations of the sugar-alcohol). There has been one randomized controlled trial which compared SPS vs. placebo in the outpatient setting, in 31 CKD patients with mild hyperkalemia (5.0–5.9 mEq/L). SPS without sorbitol dosed 30 g/day for 7 days was effective in decreasing serum K + by an average of 1.04 mEq/L. While SPS is widely used as an adjunct therapy for acute hyperkalemia, randomized controlled trials in the ER and hospital setting are lacking.

### Systemic treatment-induced gastrointestinal toxicity: incidence, clinical presentation and management [^117UGvLL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Several cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. The Bevacizumab Regimens Investigation of Treatment Effects and Safety (BRiTE) registry reported gastrointestinal perforation in 1.7% of 1,987 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The clinical pattern and severity of perforation seen was variable, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal perforations. Most gastrointestinal perforations occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment. The incidence of perforations was greatest in cases of an intact primary tumor or a recent history of sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. On the other hand, long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds or a history of peptic ulcer disease or diverticulosis was not associated with a high risk of gastrointestinal perforation. A rapid response to molecular-targeted cancer drugs could be associated with toxic effects and necrosis as evidenced by perforation. It has also been suggested that treatment with bevacizumab following radiation of the pelvis might increase the risk of ischemic bowel damage (Table 2). Discontinuation of the regimen in patients who experience such adverse effects is mandatory.

### Maternal death related to misoprostol overdose [^117WQ2u1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Misoprostol is an important drug in obstetrics and gynecology because of its uterotonic and cervical-ripening activities. The side effects are dose-related, usually transitory, and well tolerated. The toxic dosage in humans is unknown, and there is no specific antidote.

Case

An adolescent developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding after self-medication with misoprostol orally (12 mg) to cause abortion. She presented with multiorgan failure, acute abdominal signs, and hemodynamic instability. Emergency laparotomy showed gastric and esophageal necrosis. After several episodes of cardiac arrest, and despite resuscitation efforts, the patient died.

Conclusion

Temporal relationship (48 hours after the beginning of medication) strongly suggests that misoprostol was the agent directly involved in the maternal death. The mechanism implicating misoprostol in gastrointestinal ischemia and necrosis is unknown.

### Initiation of sodium polystyrene sulphonate and the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide study [^117PqTPL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, our analysis also quantifies the risk of minor adverse events associated with SPS use. We chose to model the de novo prescription of anti-diarrheal and laxative medications, for these were the most commonly reported minor adverse events in the trial of Lepage et al. In line with the clinical experience of this drug, we observed that laxatives are commonly initiated after SPS use in all our analyses and anti-diarrheal medication use was also increased in our short-term risk analysis, particularly among patients following a per label dose. Unfortunately we were unable to study other reported adverse effects of SPS such as hypernatraemia, hypophosphataemia or hypomagnesaemia, as the capture of these events by ICD codes has poor reliability.

Additional strengths of our study include the large sample size and nationwide inclusion of cases. The linkage via each citizen's unique personal identification number allows a complete recollection of clinical adverse events without loss to follow-up. However, our study also has limitations. We lack information on the serum potassium level that prompted SPS initiation, which would have better allowed us to separate indications of acute versus chronic hyperkalaemia management. Although the validity of ICD diagnoses in Swedish health care is believed very high, we depend on the event being noticed and reported, a hindrance intrinsic to any register-based research. However, the lack of outcome reporting could be considered a non-differential misclassification and would likely affect both SPS users and non-users similarly. We lacked pathology data that could suggest a causal relationship between SPS use and adverse GI events. Finally, despite our large dataset, there remained a limited number of severe events, particularly those of intestinal ischaemia and thrombosis. Given the scarcity of these outcomes, the unspecificity of some diagnoses and the plausible risk of misclassification between them, we were unable to evaluate differential risk profiles at the stomach versus the intestine.

### Meclofenamate sodium [^114muivm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal Effects

Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meclofenamate sodium, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

### Nuances in diagnosis and management of acute esophageal necrosis [^116utkwp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dr. Dias et al present a comprehensive review on black esophagus (BE), a rare but important entity in gastroenterology. The clinical significance of BE, with its striking endoscopic appearance of necrotic mucosa preferably affecting the distal esophagus with a sharp transition at the gastrointestinal junction, has notably risen over the last decade, with advances in gastrointestinal endoscopy and its increased recognition in the medical literature. It is therefore important to acknowledge Dr. Dias' work while commenting on some of the important aspects of acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) mentioned therein.

First, the role of vasoconstrictive agents for achieving mean arterial blood pressure control in sepsis may come at the expense of splanchnic blood flow, possibly resulting in a decrease in distal esophageal tissue perfusion. It is the secondary effect of such agents — namely, maintaining vital organ circulation in sepsis, an underlying critical condition — that may lead to decreased mortality in AEN. An interesting correlate would be to evaluate the potential delay in the time to esophageal mucosal healing and the risk of stricture formation in patients who have received vasoconstrictive agents. This could certainly be addressed in future studies.

Second, there have been a number of case reports linking the use of various drugs to the development of BE. While it is well known that the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine produce a decrease in tissue perfusion, the causative relationship between some prescription medications and AEN described in the literature so far was often purely observational. The lack of scientific proof makes such a hypothesis likely to be coincidental. For example, bisphosphonates are known to cause a chemical injury-type tissue ulceration in the mid esophagus, typically due to the known anatomic impression from the aortic arch — an entity called "pill esophagitis" — but would not cause diffuse circumferential black-appearing tissue necrosis spanning the entire esophagus. Such reports of AEN are likely to be related to underlying or transient hemodynamic compromise in a vasculopathic patient and massive reflux of gastric contents in the setting of associated duodenal ulcer disease.

### Misoprostol [^115bRr5M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The toxic dose of misoprostol in humans has not been determined. Cumulative total daily doses of 1600 mcg have been tolerated, with only symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort being reported. In animals, the acute toxic effects are diarrhea, gastrointestinal lesions, focal cardiac necrosis, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, testicular atrophy, respiratory difficulties, and depression of the central nervous system. Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, palpitations, hypotension, or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy.

It is not known if misoprostol acid is dialyzable. However, because misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be appropriate treatment for overdosage.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^111Psrjw]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance with a reported incidence of 1.1% to 10.0% in hospitalized patients. Non–life-threatening hyperkalemia episodes occurring in acute care settings are frequently treated with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), a cation-exchange resin that eliminates total body potassium through the gastrointestinal tract. Despite a long history of SPS use, efficacy data are limitedand complicated by the variable onset of action (2–6 hours) and duration of action (6–24 hours) as well as an elevated risk of hypokalemia owing to overcorrection. In addition, SPS may be associated with adverse drug events, including hypernatremia, colonic necrosis, and rare instances of bowel perforation, and with increased risk of hospitalization for serious gastrointestinal events. The approval of SPS by the US Food and Drug Administration preceded the era of evidence-based medicine; however, it remains the preferred treatment modality to lower total body potassium levels in institutional settings.

Patiromer is a novel, sodium-free, nonabsorbed polymer agent that significantly reduces potassium within 7 hours of the first dose. Furthermore, the absolute reduction of potassium is more pronounced in patients with significant elevation of potassium levels at baseline, suggesting that rapid and significant potassium level reductions may occur in patients with acute hyperkalemia. Patiromer exchanges potassium for calcium in the colon, where potassium is most abundant. Numerous clinical trials, have established its usefulness for the treatment of chronic hyperkalemia in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease and/or who are taking concurrent renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. The tolerability, safety, and efficacy of patiromer, renders it an attractive alternative to SPS; however, its use for acute non–life-threatening hyperkalemia is limited by a scarcity of evidence. An initial pilot studyin emergency departments suggested that patiromer may be associated with short-term reductions in potassium levels, but the applicability was limited by a small sample size. The current study aimed to address this knowledge gap by evaluating real-world patiromer use and analyzing outcomes associated with its use as monotherapy for non–life-threatening hyperkalemia at institutional settings in a racially and ethnically diverse urban population.

### Medication overview… [^114ZZTUs]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Of the direct oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and edoxaban have the highest renal elimination and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. 14 Each of the direct oral anticoagulants has a risk of bleeding. Compared with vitamin K antagonists and with other direct oral anticoagulants, apixaban has less major bleeding. In addition, rivaroxaban and dabigatran have a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with apixaban. 15 Real world experience with direct oral anticoagulants in terms of safety and effectiveness seems consistent with published trials. 15, 16. According to these recommendations, a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score as low as 1 for men and 2 for women warrants consideration for anticoagulation therapy.

21 Guidelines also recommend that if a therapeutic INR range of 2 to 3 cannot be attained more than 70% of the time, then consideration should be given to changing the treatment to a direct oral anticoagulant. Kcentra is preferred over a fresh frozen plasma infusion because of its smaller volume, faster infusion rate, and superior effectiveness in INR reduction. For nonmajor bleeding that does not require hospitalization or supportive care, holding vitamin K antagonists and possible administration of vitamin K is recommended depending on INR. The SELECT-D trial evaluated dalteparin with rivaroxaban in patients with active cancer. 2 The study found an absolute VTE recurrence reduction of 7% at six months in favor of rivaroxaban. 2 The major bleeding rate at six months was 4% for dalteparin and 6% for rivaroxaban.

2 Most of the major bleeding was gastrointestinal, primarily in patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was higher in the rivaroxaban group.

### Salbutamol versus cation-exchange resin (kayexalate) for the treatment of nonoliguric hyperkalemia in preterm infants [^113jZLAA]. American Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of rectal cation-exchange resin (Kayexalate) versus salbutamol infusion for the treatment of nonoliguric hyperkalemia (NOHK) in preterm infants. Data of all neonates born with NOHK during the study period of 6 years and 8 months were recorded. Diagnostic criteria of NOHK included serum potassium (SK) concentration ≥ 7 mmol/L during the first 72 hours of life with urine output ≥ 1 mL/kg/hour. This before-after study was divided according to the date of admission; the first 15 patients were treated with Kayexalate enema 1 g/kg every 4 hours, and the remaining 30 patients were treated with intravenous salbutamol infusion as 4 mug/kg every 4 hours. Treatment discontinued when SK became < 6 mmol/L. SK was measured every 4 hours. Daily urine was collected. Fluid intake and output, serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine, and glucose concentrations were obtained in all infants every 12 hours. All infants were observed with a cardiorespiratory monitor and oxygen saturation and blood pressure measurements. Perinatal characteristics in both groups were comparable. Mean gestational age was 26 and 28 weeks for salbutamol and Kayexalate, respectively. The peak of SK ranged between 7 and 9.3 mmol/L in the Kayexalate group and between 7 and 8.7 mmol/L in the salbutamol group (P = 0.64). At 12 hours of treatment, SK became normal in only 4 patients (26%) in the Kayexalate group compared with 18 patients (60%) in the salbutamol group (P = 0.003). The number of doses of Kayexalate administration was significantly higher than the doses of salbutamol (P = 0.003). No significant side effects were detected in the salbutamol-treated infants. In contrast, there were two cases of severe ventricular tachycardia and one case of intestinal obstruction in the cation-exchange resin group. We concluded that salbutamol infusion is more effective with faster action and safer than cation-exchange resin (Kayexalate) for the treatment of NOHK in preterm infants.

### A metaanalysis of severe upper gastrointestinal complications of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [^115899Pg]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Prior metaanalyses of the risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) have focused on the published English language epidemiologic literature and/or only a portion of the relevant evidence, restrictions that are now known to be associated with bias in metaanalysis. We synthesized the published and unpublished evidence to determine the least biased estimates of the risks of perforations, ulcers, and bleeds (PUB) associated with NSAID use from all study designs and all languages.

Data Sources

Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, HEALTHSTAR, and BIOSIS, we searched for English and non-English language studies of NSAID from 1966–1998 reporting primary data on GI complications. We obtained unpublished data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new drug application (NDA) reviews. NDA were hand searched to identify unpublished studies with inclusion criteria identical to those used for published reports.

Study Selection

Studies had to assess the use of oral NSAID for more than 4 days duration in subjects > 18 years of age and report on the clinically relevant upper GI outcomes of PUB.

Results

Two reviewers evaluated 4881 published titles and identified 13 NSAID versus placebo randomized clinical trials and 3 previously unpublished FDA placebo controlled randomized controlled trials, 9 cohort studies, and 23 case control studies sufficiently clinically homogeneous to pool. Two reviewers extracted data about study characteristics and study quality.

Data Synthesis

The majority of clinical trials were of good quality, but observational studies had methodologic limitations. The pooled odds ratio (OR) from 16 NSAID versus placebo clinical trials, comprising 4431 patients, was 5.36 (95% CI: 1.79, 16.1). The pooled relative risk of PUB from 9 cohort studies comprising over 750,000 person-years of exposure was 2.7 (95% CI: 2.1, 3.5). The pooled OR of PUB from 23 case control studies using age and sex matching, representing 25,732 patients, was 3.0 (95% CI: 2.5, 3.7). Data were insufficient to justify subgroup analyses stratified by age, comorbid conditions, drug, or dose.

Conclusion

These data support an association between the use of NSAID and serious upper GI complications, including estimates from different study designs. Prior pooled estimates about the effect of patient and drug variables on increased risk must be viewed with caution.

### Systemic treatment-induced gastrointestinal toxicity: incidence, clinical presentation and management [^116Ttynz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Capecitabine is an orally available tumor-selective fluoropyrimidine carbamate. Gastrointestinal side effects include mainly diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, abdominal pain and infrequently constipation and dyspepsia. Hepatic side effects consist of hyperbilirubinemia and hepatic failure.

6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is an analogue of the natural purine base hypoxanthine. It is active in the S phase of cell proliferation. It is absorbed well orally and dissected by hepatic xanthine oxidase to inactive metabolites. Allopurinol can inhibit this enzyme and therefore if both drugs are coadministered, care is needed in order to reduce the risk of increased toxicity. Gastrointestinal effects include intestinal ulceration. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia have been infrequently reported during initial administration. Mild diarrhea and sprue-like symptoms are occasionally experienced. An increased risk of pancreatitis may be associated with the investigational use of mercaptopurine in inflammatory bowel disease. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations.

Cytarabine follows the same metabolic pathways and thus requires to be transported to the cell for activation. Cytarabine triphosphate (ara-CTP) is the cytotoxic metabolite of cytarabine and is considered as an S-phase-specific drug, although it is active at other phases of the cycle. Gastrointestinal side effects comprise oral and anal inflammation or ulceration, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Nausea and vomiting most frequently follows rapid intravenous injection. Bowel necrosis, stomatitis, pancreatitis and hepatic dysfunction have also been described (Table 1).

Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analogue structurally similar to cytarabine. Accumulation of its active cytotoxic metabolite is higher than ara-CTP and its elimination is much more prolonged. Gemcitabine can be incorporated both into DNA and RNA. In the aspect of the gastrointestinal toxicity, nausea and vomiting were commonly reported but were usually of mild to moderate severity. Diarrhea and stomatitis occur less frequently. Gemcitabine was associated with transient elevations of one or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to gemcitabine (Table 1).

Pediatric Use

The effectiveness of sodium polystyrene sulfonate in pediatric patients has not been established. In neonates, sodium polystyrene sulfonate should not be given by the oral route. In both children and neonates particular care should be observed with rectal administration, as excessive dosage or inadequate dilution could result in impaction of the resin.

Due to the risk of digestive hemorrhage or intestinal necrosis, particular care should be observed in premature infants or low birth weight infants.

### Sodium polystyrene sulfonate [^114PArdU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate may cause some degree of gastric irritation. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation may occur especially if high doses are given. Also, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and significant sodium retention, and their related clinical manifestations, may occur (see WARNINGS). Occasionally diarrhea develops. Large doses in elderly individuals may cause fecal impaction (see PRECAUTIONS). Rare instances of intestinal necrosis have been reported. Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide, when used in combination with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, has been reported.

The following events have been reported from worldwide post marketing experience:

Fecal impaction following rectal administration, particularly in children;
Gastrointestinal concretions (bezoars) following oral administration;
Ischemic colitis, gastrointestinal tract ulceration or necrosis which could lead to intestinal perforation; and,
Rare cases of acute bronchitis and/or broncho-pneumonia associated with inhalation of particles of polystyrene sulfonate.

### Gastrointestinal perforations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in Sweden: a nationwide cohort study [^114UDwcM]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been reported to be at an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications compared to patients who did not have RA. Among these, GI perforations are rare but potentially lethal, and it is unclear to what extent a risk increase may be caused by inflammation or other RA processes, or rather by the treatments used in RA.

An association to treatment is established for glucocorticoids (GC), which have been shown to increase the risk of bleeding and perforation in both upperand lower GI tract, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), where recent evidence suggest involvement in intestinal perforation in addition to well-known risk increases for upper GI ulceration.

While conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) do not seem to modify the risk of GI perforations, uncertainty remains around the possible risks associated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Cases of GI perforations have been reported in etanercept-treated patients, and GI perforations are included in the product information of infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab as uncommon or rare adverse reactions. However, one large analysis of data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register found no difference in risk, comparing tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) versus csDMARDs, after adjusting for GC use and other risk factors.

### Sodium polystyrene sulfonate as an additional contributing factor to repeated gastric ulcers among other multiple factors in a patient undergoing hemodialysis: a case report [^116QCkq1]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Conclusion

Herein, the patient who had been taking SPS regularly developed bleeding gastric ulcers, wherein deposition of a basophilic crystal-like substance, which was thought to be a cation-exchange resin, was detected in the ulcer lesion. We discuss the cause of gastric ulcers during oral administration of cation-exchange resins, which are uncommon.

Adverse reactions to SPS, including perforation and mucosal necrosis of the small intestine, colonic ulcers, and necrosis of the colon, have been reported when it is administered orally after suspension in water or sorbitol solution; the package insert also alerts the public to such reactions. In general, the mechanisms of drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders are classified into direct mucosal irritation by drugs, disorders caused by pharmacological actions of drugs, or both. Mechanisms of SPS-induced gastrointestinal disorders include mechanical irritation by crystals and inflammation and fibrosis caused by reactions to foreign substances. In an observational study by Laureati et al. on SPS-naive patients with CKD, SPS initiation was found to be associated with the occurrence of serious gastrointestinal adverse events (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.49), with ulcers and perforations being frequently observed. In a previous study, Panarelli et al. reported cases of gastrointestinal perforations in which crystal-like substances were observed at the perforation site in patients taking cation-exchange resins, and the perforation sites often occurred in the sigmoid colon or rectum, where the contents tended to deposit.

As a next step, we evaluated dose responses comparing the adverse outcome risk associated with initiating SPS with a per label dose or a lower dose. For this, individuals receiving low–moderate and low dosages (see methods) were grouped together. Some individuals (2% of the sample) did not have information recorded on their prescribed dose and these were conservatively assigned to the 'per label dose' group. As a sensitivity analysis, we restricted the follow-up after SPS initiation to 1 year, given that SPS intake is erratic and the time from SPS exposure to reported adverse GI events is believed to be rapid. Finally, we further evaluated the risk of unmeasured confounding through the E-value methodology, which identifies the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both treatment and outcome, conditional on the measured covariates, to fully explain the observed association. This estimates what the relative risk would have to be for any unmeasured confounder to overcome the observed association of SPS initiation with the risk of GI events.

frequency of serum AT elevations also is not a good indicator of a potential for severe DILI, because drugs such as tacrine can cause AT elevations in as many as 50 percent of patients. Very high levels of observed ATs may be a somewhat better indicator of.

### Diclofenac potassium tablets (diclofenac potassium) [^115ub9RP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids and the patient should be observed closely for any evidence of adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of arthritis.

The pharmacological activity of diclofenac potassium tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Information for Patients

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies each prescription dispensed. Inform patients, families, or their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with diclofenac potassium tablets and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events).

Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their health care provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).

Hepatotoxicity

Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (eg, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop diclofenac potassium tablets and seek immediate medical therapy (see WARNINGS; Hepatotoxicity).

### Sodium polystyrene sulfonate as an additional contributing factor to repeated gastric ulcers among other multiple factors in a patient undergoing hemodialysis: a case report [^112R1624]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) is a cation-exchange resin used to treat hyperkalemia. Colorectal ulcers are common side effects of SPS administration, and mucosal protection has been reported to decrease with its long-term oral use. Although the addition of sorbitol to SPS preparations was previously thought to be the cause of gastrointestinal problems, recent reports have suggested that SPS itself might be toxic. In addition, according to a review of serious gastrointestinal adverse events associated with SPS use by Harel Z, et al. upper gastrointestinal injuries associated with SPS use occurred in 2 patients, whereas lower gastrointestinal injuries occurred in 56 patients. The colon was the most common (n = 44), followed by the small intestine (n = 12). Histopathological findings associated with SPS use were necrosis of the bowel wall (n = 36), ulcer formation (n = 28), and perforation (n = 5), with upper gastrointestinal injuries less frequently reported. We report a case of recurrent gastric ulcer during SPS administration and discuss the pathogenesis of gastric ulceration.

### Rofecoxib: a possible cause of acute colitis [^114zNVTG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents may cause relevant small bowel and colonic side effects, apart from gastroduodenal lesions. The synthesis of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors has been an important breakthrough in antiinflammatory therapy by decreasing the incidence of upper gastrointestinal lesions. However, there is little information available concerning their effects on gut mucosa distally to the duodenum. A case history is described of a 52-year-old woman with a temporary colostomy after resection of a sigmoid tumor and who presented with bloody diarrhea 5 days after beginning therapy with rofecoxib. The hemorrhage had its origin in the transverse colon, and the endoscopic appearance was that of actively bleeding acute hemorrhagic colitis. No other colonic lesions were detected, nor was there any evidence of related infection, bleeding diathesis, or other systemic diseases. On discontinuing rofecoxib and instituting parenteral rehydration, the bleeding and diarrhea stopped. Endoscopic follow-up revealed regenerating mucosa in the transverse colon. The time relation, the absence of other causes of hemorrhage, and the clinical evolution all strongly support the probability of a causal relation between rofecoxib and hemorrhagic colitis. This case may raise awareness concerning the possibility of colonic lesions related to the new COX-2 inhibitors, similar to what is known about nonselective antiinflammatory agents.

### A pilot study of alternative substrates in the critically ill subject using a ketogenic feed [^113qJuCY]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Definitions

Adverse Events are any untoward medical occurrence or effect in a patient participating in the trial, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with trial treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the trial treatment, whether or not it is related to the allocated trial treatment.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are AEs that Result in death; Are life-threatening; Require in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; Result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or Result in a congenital anomaly/birth defect

All AEs were graded for severity:

0. **None**: indicates no event or complication.

1. **Mild**: complication results in only temporary harm and does not require clinical treatment.

2. **Moderate**: complication requires clinical treatment but does not result in significant prolongation of hospital stay. Does not usually result in permanent harm and where this does occur the harm does not cause functional limitation to the patient.

3. **Severe**: complication requires clinical treatment and results in significant prolongation of hospital stay, permanent functional limitation.

4. **Life-threatening**: complication that may lead to death.

5. **Fatal**: indicates that the patient died as a direct result of the complication/adverse event.

7.2 Potential "expected" AE's in patients with multi-organ failure
Abdominal distension – new, clinically significant change in appearance. Considered severe if acute obstruction.
Abdominal pain – new, localised to abdomen and requiring more than just simple analgesia. Considered severe if not controlled with opiates.
Electrolyte disturbance – new change that is clinically significant requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylactic reaction) – anaphylactic reaction.
Hypoglycaemia – new, clinically significant hypoglycaemia requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Ischaemic bowel – inferred on radiology or diagnosed visually, e.g. surgery or endoscopy.
Nausea requiring treatment with anti-emetics; Vomiting – any episode
Regurgitation/aspiration – any episodes

### Unexplained colonic necrosis in a patient with end-stage kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis: case report and review of uremic colitis [^112MkKiD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Cases of intestinal necrosis in uraemia patients were first reported many years ago. Risk factors for ischaemic colitis in nonuraemic patients include low cardiac output due to intrinsic cardiac causes (heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia) or extrinsic factors (sepsis, hypovolemia, shock). Vascular risk factors include atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and microembolism. Ischaemic colitis in nonuraemic patients can be caused by several drugs, such as digoxin, vasopressors, diuretics, and oestrogens. Constipation and colonic distension have also been reported. However, ischaemic colitis can also occur without any known trigger. All risk factors for colon necrosis are applicable to both uraemic patients and nonuraemic patients. In addition, it has been reported that the combination of sorbitol and sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with intestinal necrosis in uraemia patients.

### Initiation of sodium polystyrene sulphonate and the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide study [^111ebtpB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

When restricting the follow-up after SPS initiation to 1 year, the short-term risk association between SPS use and serious GI events became less precise (CI crossing zero) but was still 29% higher overall compared with non-SPS (Supplementary data, Table S5). In the short-term, the risk of minor GI events remained, this time attributed to a higher rate of both laxatives and anti-diarrheal medication dispensations. Once more, the associations were stronger in magnitude in those patients following a per label dose. E-values for study outcomes ranged between 1.4 and 2.4, which we interpret as moderately robust to potential unmeasured confounders (Supplementary data, Table S6). For instance, E-values for the primary composite outcome indicated that the observed HR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.05–1.49) could only be explained by an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both initiation of SPS and severe GI risk by an HR > 1.80 above and beyond that of the confounders that were measured in this study. We note from the multivariable-adjusted model that most confounders were generally below this value and therefore the probability that an unknown comorbidity or medication may abrogate this association may be judged moderately low, particularly for the per label dose association (E-value 2.44). For instance, the multivariable-adjusted HR in our primary Cox model was 1.25 (95% CI 1.04–1.49) for hypertension, 1.37 (1.18–1.59) for heart failure and was 1.30 (0.95–1.99) for recent hyperkalaemia diagnosis.

Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer — mortality and adverse effects include a higher incidence of treatment-related mortality than chemotherapy alone (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02–1.73; P = 0.04), with hemorrhage (23.5%), neutropenia (12.2%), and GI perforation (7.1%) being the most common causes of fatality, while venous thromboembolisms were not increased. Additional analyses report significantly higher risk of hypertension, GI hemorrhage, and perforation, an increased risk of stroke and other arterial events especially in those ≥ 65 years, and gastrointestinal perforation as a rare but important side effect; extensive prior intra-abdominal surgery such as peritoneal stripping may predispose to GI perforation, and peritoneal debulking surgery may be a risk factor whereas the presence of an intact primary tumor does not seem to increase risk. The FDA approved a safety label warning of the risk for necrotizing fasciitis, sometimes fatal and usually secondary to wound healing complications; GI perforation; or fistula formation after bevacizumab use.

### Peptide YY improves local and systemic parameters and prevents death in lethal necrotizing pancreatitis [^115U1u1s]. Pancreas (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peptide YY (PYY) is a gastrointestinal hormone with multiple inhibitory effects on the proximal digestive tract, including suppression of secretion by the exocrine pancreas.

Aim

To determine whether peptide YY would reduce mortality in a lethal model of necrotizing pancreatitis by improving local and systemic parameters of this disease.

Methodology

Necrotizing pancreatitis was induced in three groups of 30 mice by feeding a choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet. Osmotic pumps placed in 10 control mice delivered normal saline. In the two study groups, PYY was delivered at 200 pmol/kg/hr. The prophylactic group received PYY pumps at the onset; the therapeutic group received pumps 24 hours later. Ten mice from each group were followed to assess survival. Remaining mice were killed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Pancreata were graded on a nine-point histologic scale. Amylasemia was quantified by kinetic determination. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) values were determined by ELISA.

Results

Both prophylactic and therapeutic PYY significantly reduced mortality compared with that seen in controls (p = 0.05 and p = 0.007). Five-day survival was 33% in controls, 80% in those receiving prophylactic PYY, and 100% in the therapeutic group. Amylasemia was reduced in the therapeutic group by day 3 (p < 0.02) and in the prophylactic group by day 4 (p < 0.01). Histologic changes mirrored those in serum amylase. Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of PYY suppressed early circulating levels of IL-6.

Conclusion

PYY reduces mortality and improves local and systemic parameters in this murine model and may be of clinical benefit in the management of human necrotizing pancreatitis, particularly as this study demonstrates a clear survival benefit when PYY is given after the onset of disease.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (toronova SUIK) [^114W7cya]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs, in general, on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than the users of either drug alone.

Aspirin

When ketorolac tromethamine is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ketorolac tromethamine is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.

Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that ketorolac tromethamine can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS – Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

Probenecid

Concomitant administration of oral ketorolac tromethamine and probenecid resulted in decreased clearance and volume of distribution of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately three-fold from 5.4 to 17.8 mcg/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately two-fold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours. Therefore, concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.

### Pretreatment of formula or expressed breast milk with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (kayexalate (®)) as a treatment for hyperkalemia in infants with acute or chronic renal insufficiency [^117Jv1cD]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect on serum potassium of treating infant formula or expressed breast milk (EBM) with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) before patient consumption.

Design and Setting

Retrospective cohort study of patients at Seattle Children's Hospital who received SPS-treated formula or EBM.

Subjects and Intervention

Thirteen patients less than 2 years of age with a diagnosis of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease that had received formula or EBM pretreated with SPS between September 2009 and May 2012 were identified. Hyperkalemia was defined as a serum potassium concentration greater than 5.5 mEq/L.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary endpoint was the mean change in serum potassium 48 hours after receiving pretreated formula or EBM. Serum potassium levels before and after patient consumption were averaged and compared using a paired t test.

Results

Pretreatment of formula or EBM with SPS resulted in a 24% decrease in serum potassium levels (6.3 mEq/L to 4.8 mEq/L; P < .0001). There was a significant difference in before and after calcium and creatinine levels (P < .05), and no significant differences in blood urea nitrogen, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, chloride, or bicarbonate levels.

Conclusion

Pretreatment of formula or EBM with SPS before consumption is an effective treatment for hyperkalemia in infants. Caution needs to be taken in patients who have sodium restrictions because the exchange for potassium produces a sodium-rich formula.

### Treatment of opioid-induced constipation: inducing laxation and understanding the risk of gastrointestinal perforation [^111hk35w]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening condition in which there is a loss of integrity in the GI lining and leakage of intraluminal contents into the otherwise sterile peritoneal cavity. A variety of situations may cause GI perforation, including bowel obstruction, infection, inflammation, malignancy, and trauma. In cases of bowel obstruction, distention of the GI lining results in decreased perfusion (ie, ischemia), leading to full-thickness necrosis (eg, pressure necrosis from fecal mass) and ensuing perforation of the lining. Medical conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, and peptic ulcer disease may cause erosive penetration through the GI lining. Mechanical penetration through the GI lining may result from external injury (ie, penetrating or blunt trauma), ingestion of a harmful object (eg, a sharp, pointed, and/or jagged foreign body), or medical instrumentation (eg, injury due to endoscope or cleansing enema device tip). –

Certain medications may increase the risk of GI perforation. Antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies used to treat cancer (eg, bevacizumab, erlotinib, ramucirumab, sorafenib) have been associated with cases of GI perforation in patients with cancer. – An increased risk of GI perforation has also been reported among patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, with perforation occurring most frequently in the lower GI tract and the greatest risk reported with tocilizumab and tofacitinib, after controlling for potential confounding factors. – Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and systemic corticosteroids have been associated with increases in GI perforation risk among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and other conditions. –

In addition, intestinal perforation, including stercoral perforation, can occur in the setting of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), a common complication of opioid analgesics administered for the management of pain. – Acute or chronic opioid exposure can alter the gut microbiota and/or GI barrier function, which can promote intestinal inflammation, infection risk, and GI permeability. – In addition, OIC can be, but is not necessarily, chronic in all patients. Chronic constipation has been linked to cases of stercoral perforation, including spontaneous colonic perforation (ie, in the absence of disease, such as diverticulosis, malignancy, or injury). – In these cases, fecal mass retention due to chronic constipation can result in GI lining ischemia, inflammation, and necrosis, which, in some cases, leads to colonic rupture (feculent perforation).

### 'Gut health': a new objective in medicine? [^115K1zzP]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chemoprevention by taking aspirin, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and calcium may reduce the recurrence of adenomas and/or the incidence of advanced adenomas in individuals with an increased risk of CRC, and taking aspirin may reduce the incidence of CRC in the general population. However, both aspirin and NSAIDs are associated with adverse effects, so it will be important to consider the risk-benefit ratio before recommending these agents for chemoprevention. Other chemopreventive strategies, such as retinoid-based therapy and tumour necrosis factor-related, apoptosis-inducing ligand in patients at risk for CRC, are based on animal experiments and need to be confirmed in human studies. In the upper GI tract, chemopreventive strategies, such as the use of celcoxib, have been shown to be less successful; therefore, endoscopic surveillance strategies are still indispensable in patients at risk for GI malignancies.

An interesting idea is whether gut health can be further supported by using modulators of the intestinal microbiome or the GI barrier, such as probiotics or prebiotics. Indeed, it has been shown that chronic bowel diseases such as IBD are associated with adherence of commensal bacteria to the otherwise sterile intestinal epithelium and that selected probiotics can prevent the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to the intestinal mucosa or restore leaky gut by improving the molecular composition of tight junctions. Moreover, probiotic bacteria can support the normal development of the mucosal immune system, such as through the C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) gene expressed on lamina propria lymphocytes and the production of protective IgA and antimicrobial defensins such as the CCR6 ligand human β-defensin 2 (or hBD2) that are both lacking in many chronic IBDs. These few selected examples indicate the strong rationale for using probiotics, possibly also in synergistic combinations with prebiotics, to maintain gut health.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Sprix) [^111jy56U]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

SPRIX is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation [see Contraindications (4)].

NSAIDs, including ketorolac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Do not use Sprix in those with active GI bleeding.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue SPRIX until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Use great care when giving SPRIX to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.

### Long-chain polyphosphate is a potential agent for inducing mucosal healing of the colon in ulcerative colitis [^116pubFT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a condition of chronic intestinal inflammation, the pathogenesis of which is largely unknown. While steroids and mesalamine are the standard treatments for relieving symptoms, a treatment strategy for curing the disease has not yet been established. Most patients experience relapses repeatedly and suffer from abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia for more than 50 years. "Mucosal healing", which is defined by a sufficient intestinal barrier function, leads to a significantly long‐term remission; 1 however, more than half of UC patients fail to achieve mucosal healing, even when using recently developed anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α treatments. 2

Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts 3 and are used as functional foods as well as drugs for the treatment of acute intestinal inflammation and necrotizing enterocolitis. 4, 5, 6 Probiotics possess sufficient safety to be used for a long time; however, their efficacy as a treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases remains controversial 7 because the function of live bacteria is influenced by the intestinal conditions in individual patients. To solve this weak point of probiotic treatment, we have considered using the bioactive molecules produced by probiotics, which enhance the intestinal barrier function regardless of the intestinal conditions, as do drugs.

### Gastroprotective therapy and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers: risk reduction by COX-2 therapy [^113H6zF8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and misoprostol decrease the risk of development of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug induced gastric ulcers and aid healing of upper gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers. H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) are less effective for this task, but are widely used by patients and physicians for the treatment of GI symptoms and duodenal ulcers. Sucralfate is a weaker agent that is sometimes used for prophylaxis or treatment of upper GI ulcers. We investigated the effect of GI drugs and selective and nonselective NSAID on the incidence of GI ulcer development in a cohort of patients immediately after the release of celecoxib and rofecoxib to investigate the effect of confounding by indication when effective GI agents and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors are prescribed to a high risk population.

Methods

During a 6 month period of observation 8547 NSAID users were evaluated by mailed questionnaire concerning NSAID drug use and ulcer development. In the first half of 1999, patients took 12,177 separate NSAID courses. GI therapy that followed the development of upper GI ulcers was excluded from analysis. Ulcer reports were confirmed by followup validation.

Results

GI drugs were used concomitantly in this population by 42% of patients using an NSAID. GI drugs were associated with an increased risk of ulcer. But this risk was confined to PPI (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.95, 5.69), and not to other GI drugs. Overall, patients using nonselective NSAID compared to those taking COX-2-specific inhibitors had an increased risk of upper GI ulcers (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43, 3.34). Patients taking nonselective NSAID plus PPI were also at increased risk for upper GI ulcers compared to those taking nonselective NSAID alone (OR 5.09. 95% CI 3.88, 6.67). Similarly, the risk of upper GI ulcers was increased in the nonselective NSAID plus PPI group (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.32, 6.31) compared to the COX-2 plus PPI group.

Conclusion

PPI use, but not other GI drug use, is a marker for increased susceptibility to ulcers among NSAID users. This risk of upper GI ulcers is increased in PPI users regardless of which NSAID is used (nonselective or COX-2-specific inhibitor). Although COX-2 use is associated with greater risk factors for upper GI ulcers due to channeling bias, COX-2 users have significantly fewer ulcers than equivalent nonselective NSAID users regardless of concomitant PPI utilization.

### Initiation of sodium polystyrene sulphonate and the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide study [^111y1ojj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Despite long-standing clinical use of sodium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS) for hyperkalaemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD), its safety profile remains poorly investigated.

Methods

We undertook an observational analysis of nephrology-referred adults with incident CKD Stage 4+ in Sweden during 2006–16 and with no previous SPS use. We studied patterns of use and adverse events associated to SPS initiation during follow-up. Patterns of SPS use were defined by chronicity of treatment and by prescribed dose. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with SPS initiation (time-varying exposure) for the risk of severe (intestinal ischaemia, thrombosis or ulceration/perforation) and minor (de novo dispensation of laxatives or anti-diarrheal drugs) gastrointestinal (GI) events.

Results

Of 19 530 SPS-naïve patients with CKD, 3690 initiated SPS during follow-up. A total of 59% took SPS chronically, with an average of three dispensations/year. The majority (85%) were prescribed lower dosages than specified on the product label. During follow-up, 202 severe and 1149 minor GI events were recorded. SPS initiation was associated with a higher incidence of severe adverse events [adjusted HR 1.25 95% CI 1.05–1.49)], particularly in those receiving per label doses [1.54 (1.09–2.17)] and mainly attributed to ulcers and perforations. SPS initiation was also associated with higher incidence of minor GI events [adjusted HR 1.11 (95% CI 1.03–1.19)], regardless of dose, and mainly accounted for by de novo dispensation of laxatives.

Conclusions

Initiation of SPS in patients with advanced CKD is associated with a higher risk of severe GI complications as well as the initiation of GI-related medications, particularly when prescribed at per label doses.

### Single dose of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate versus sodium polystyrene sulfonate in hospitalized patients with hyperkalemia [^114Kdv7g]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is an inorganic zirconium silicate compound that selectively exchanges potassium for hydrogen and sodium. "Once" doses of SZC (with option to redose) in patients with hyperkalemia in hospitalized settings have not been evaluated. We hypothesized that a once dose of SZC would be non-inferior to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) in reducing serum potassium.

Objective

The objective of our study is to evaluate the effect of a "once" dose of SZC when compared with SPS in reducing serum potassium levels.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of patients who received either a "once" dose of SZC or single or repeated doses of SPS for hyperkalemia. The primary endpoint was mean absolute reduction in the first serum potassium value at least 4 hours after administration. The secondary efficacy endpoints were the rate of additional potassium-lowering therapies and the rate of normokalemia within 48 hours. Safety endpoints were the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, hypertension, hypotension, and colonic necrosis.

Results

A total of 260 patients were included in the analysis. The mean initial serum potassium was similar between groups (5.6 ± 0.4). The absolute serum potassium reduction was -0.88 ± 0.64 mEq/L and -0.75 ± 0.65 mEq/L with SZC and SPS, respectively. The "once" regimen of SZC demonstrated non-inferiority compared with SPS (P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients achieving normokalemia within 48 hours and the proportion of patients receiving additional potassium-lowering therapies did not differ between groups.

Conclusion and Relevance

The "once" dose regimen (with redose option) of SZC was non-inferior to the "once" or repeated dosing regimen of SPS with regard to absolute potassium reduction. There were no significant differences in the rate of additional potassium-lowering therapies and the rate of normokalemia at 48 hours. The incidence of hypertension was less common among patients who received SZC.

### Gastrointestinal perforations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in Sweden: a nationwide cohort study [^111hVxQG]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare incidence rates of gastrointestinal (GI) perforations between patients with RA and the general population, and between patients treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and non-TNFi biologics.

Methods

In this nationwide cohort study, a total of 63 532 patients with RA, with 26 050 biological treatment episodes (TNFi, rituximab, abatacept or tocilizumab) and 76 304 general population controls, were followed between 2009 and 2017 until the first outcome event. The main outcome was hospitalisation or death due to lower GI perforations, identified according to a prespecified list of ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) codes. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used for adjustment.

Results

The sex-standardised and age-standardised incidence rates of lower GI perforations were 1.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.3) events per 1000 person-years among general population controls, 1.6 (1.5–1.7) among bionaïve patients and ranged from 1.8 (1.4–3.6) (TNFi) to 4.5 (2.7–10.4) (tocilizumab) among biologics-treated patients. After adjustment for glucocorticoid use, the risk in bionaïve, TNFi-treated, abatacept-treated or rituximab-treated patients with RA was no longer different from the general population, while for tocilizumab it remained significantly higher. Comparing tocilizumab to TNFi, the adjusted HR for lower GI perforations was 2.2 (1.3–3.8), corresponding to one additional GI perforation per 451 patient-years treated with tocilizumab instead of TNFi.

Conclusion

Tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of lower GI perforations compared with alternative biologics. In absolute numbers, the risk remained low on all biologics commonly used to treat RA, but the accumulated evidence across settings and outcome definitions supports that this risk should be considered in treatment guidelines for RA.

### American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update: management of pancreatic necrosis [^116WbqGS]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Pancreatic necrosis — antimicrobial prophylaxis and diagnostic sampling — evidence indicates that in patients with severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis, the administration of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics has no impact on rates of developing infected necrosis, systemic complications, mortality, or need for surgical intervention. In addition, there is a lack of evidence to support prophylactic use of antifungal therapy in patients with pancreatic necrosis, and thus routine administration is not recommended. Computed tomography–guided percutaneous biopsies of necrotic collections with samples sent for Gram stain and cultures can be performed to confirm the presence of infection; however, this is unnecessary in the vast majority of cases.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^111k6kg1]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to gastrointestinal excretion, patiromer, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to administer patiromer as an option for the management of persistent hyperkalemia with a confirmed serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L in adult patients with CKD stage 3b-5 (not on dialysis) or HF receiving a suboptimal dose or not receiving RAAS inhibitors due to hyperkalemia. Start patiromer only in secondary care.

### Initiation of sodium polystyrene sulphonate and the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide study [^117VBtqf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results are in line and expand a recent population-based study from Canada of older adults initiating SPS. The authors observed a higher incidence of hospitalization for serious adverse GI events among SPS users compared with non-users. While SPS is approved in Canada for the management of hyperkalaemia in general, in Sweden its use is specific to persons with CKD. In the Canadian study, only 1% of the included sample was undergoing dialysis. Potential limitations are that they did not have information on sorbitol use, subsequent SPS dispensations or prescribed dosages. This may be more relevant in the case of chronic hyperkalaemia of CKD, given that previous case reports suggested the existence of a dose-dependent response between SPS and intestinal injury and that low-dose SPS is less likely to cause GI injury. This hypothesis is supported by our findings, whereby individuals following per label SPS doses (15% of all SPS users) had a higher outcome risk than those receiving low SPS doses. Adverse events are believed to appear rapidly; in a systematic review of adverse GI events across 30 case reports with SPS use (about half of them without sorbitol), symptoms were observed a median of 2 days after SPS initiation. When we attempted to address this by evaluating 1-year risk as short term, we experienced a lack of power due to the small number of events, but the overall risk for serious GI events remained 30% higher for SPS use compared with no use.

### Initiation of sodium polystyrene sulphonate and the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide study [^111RcDCB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Summary statistics are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) or number and percentage. We explored adverse events associated to SPS use by estimating cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression with time-updated exposure. Thus a patient who started SPS during follow-up contributed to the non-exposed group during his/her time before the SPS dispensation and thereafter to the SPS-exposed group. Covariates were recalculated again at the time of incident SPS use, updating potential new comorbidities (such as hyperkalaemia and heart failure) that may have prompted the prescription. We estimated multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in SPS-exposed versus SPS-free periods for the study outcomes. Assumptions of Cox models were assessed by looking at the Schoenfeld residuals and there were no violations in the fitted models. Additionally, we tested two-way interactions between SPS initiation and CKD status (non-dialysis CKD or undergoing dialysis) in the adjusted models.

Once SPS was initiated, we assumed the patient remained exposed for the whole period, because this drug is often prescribed at low dosages or for use when needed. For the analysis of secondary outcomes, we excluded patients with ongoing laxatives or anti-diarrheal medication (defined as a dispensation within the preceding 5 months). We purposefully decided not to study the risk of death (by any cause), because confounding by indication bias is high for SPS (i.e. patients initiating SPS do so because of hyperkalaemia, which can be life-threatening). However, we included deaths attributed to severe GI events in our primary outcome definition above. Commencement of dialysis or kidney transplantation was not considered a censoring or competing event since GI injury related to SPS use would persist regardless.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and aspirin [^115Yigsw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions

Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.

Hydrocodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regulatory evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.

Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

The aspirin in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets can cause GI side effects including stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Physicians should inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
