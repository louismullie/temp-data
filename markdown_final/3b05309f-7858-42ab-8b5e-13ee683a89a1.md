## Question

How does CVP correlate with cardiac output?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how central venous pressure (CVP) correlates with cardiac output and how to interpret that relationship clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological framework that links CVP, venous return, and cardiac output. Then, I should verify the empirical evidence on whether CVP predicts fluid responsiveness or cardiac output changes. Next, I will examine the clinical implications, including when CVP is still useful and when it is misleading. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, bedside approach that integrates CVP with dynamic measures and organ perfusion markers, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the physiological foundation. CVP reflects right atrial pressure and is the downstream pressure for venous return; venous return is driven by the gradient between mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf) and right atrial pressure, divided by resistance to venous return, so venous return equals (Pmsf − CVP)/Rv, and at steady state venous return equals cardiac output, which means CVP is both a determinant and a result of the equilibrium between return function and cardiac function [^116rYmfu] [^116TZcmS] [^117F336j].

> Wait, let me verify the directionality so I don't overstate causality. CVP is not an independent determinant of cardiac output; rather, cardiac output emerges from the intersection of a venous return curve and a cardiac function curve, with CVP as the equilibrium right atrial pressure at that intersection, so changes in CVP can reflect changes in venous return, cardiac function, or both, and not necessarily predict a change in stroke volume or output by itself [^113aLs7p] [^111X1Zn7] [^117F336j].

> I should confirm the empirical correlation data. Multiple meta-analyses show that baseline CVP correlates poorly with fluid responsiveness, with pooled correlations around 0.18 and ROC AUCs near 0.56, indicating no better than chance discrimination; similarly, changes in CVP during a fluid challenge do not reliably track changes in stroke volume or cardiac output, reinforcing that CVP is an unreliable standalone predictor of volume responsiveness [^115rpdcY] [^116ivv8A] [^113uTjT5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether extreme CVP values carry any signal. Reviews suggest that very low CVP values, roughly less than about 6–8 mmHg, are more often associated with fluid responsiveness, whereas very high CVP values, roughly greater than about 12–15 mmHg, are more often associated with non-responsiveness, but intermediate values occupy a wide gray zone where prediction is unreliable, so even "extreme" guidance is probabilistic and context dependent [^114SQcv6].

> Let me consider the clinical implications carefully. Elevated CVP can signal venous congestion and impaired organ perfusion, particularly renal and hepatic, and higher CVP has been independently associated with acute kidney injury and mortality in critically ill adults and with worse renal function in children with cardiovascular disease, so persistently high CVP should prompt evaluation for right ventricular dysfunction, tamponade, positive pressure effects, or excessive volume rather than reflexive fluid administration [^113joPyS] [^113LUyZJ] [^113Eu9pW] [^112so6s6].

> But wait, what if CVP is rising during a fluid challenge; does that mean we are helping or harming. In preload-responsive patients, a fluid bolus tends to increase Pmsf more than CVP, widening the venous return gradient and increasing cardiac output with only a small CVP rise, whereas in non-responders CVP rises substantially without improving output, indicating poor cardiac tolerance and a risk of congestion, so a large CVP rise with little output gain is a warning sign to stop fluids and reassess [^114MnrzL] [^11157zJf].

> I should double-check the role of CVP in specific contexts. In perioperative and critical care settings, CVP trends and waveform morphology can inform right ventricular function, tricuspid regurgitation, and juxta-cardiac pressure effects, and expert consensus recommends using CVP as part of multimodal monitoring rather than as a sole guide; in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure, abrupt CVP increases may herald RV decompensation and warrant urgent evaluation and targeted therapy [^115nPNqa] [^117BkENF] [^114P6LZz].

> Next, I should review what to use instead of CVP for predicting fluid responsiveness. Dynamic indices such as stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation in mechanically ventilated patients, passive leg raising with real-time cardiac output measurement, and mini-fluid challenges provide superior diagnostic accuracy and are endorsed by guidelines to guide fluid therapy, whereas static pressures like CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure perform poorly for this purpose [^115fLWoS] [^111A5xTi] [^116FmUrF].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and make sure it aligns with physiology and evidence. First, interpret CVP in conjunction with a measured cardiac output or a validated surrogate and with clinical signs of perfusion; second, if CVP is very low, a cautious fluid challenge with objective output measurement is reasonable, but if CVP is high or rising disproportionately without output gain, stop fluids and evaluate for RV failure, tamponade, or excessive PEEP; third, use dynamic tests and trends to individualize therapy and avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload, recognizing that CVP remains useful for detecting congestion and right heart issues even if it cannot predict responsiveness [^113xnpca] [^114MnrzL] [^115fLWoS].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise. CVP does not reliably correlate with cardiac output or fluid responsiveness on an individual basis, because cardiac output is determined by the interaction of venous return and cardiac function with CVP as an equilibrium marker; therefore, CVP should be integrated with dynamic measures and organ perfusion endpoints rather than used in isolation to guide volume management decisions [^117F336j] [^115rpdcY] [^115fLWoS].

---

CVP and cardiac output are **inversely related** via the venous return gradient: cardiac output rises as CVP falls, and falls as CVP rises, because venous return depends on the difference between mean systemic filling pressure and CVP [^116rYmfu] [^113aLs7p]. This inverse relationship is **nonlinear and context-dependent**, shaped by venous return, right heart function, and intrathoracic pressure; CVP alone cannot predict fluid responsiveness or cardiac output, so it must be interpreted with dynamic measures and clinical context [^115rpdcY] [^115fLWoS] [^112oqctg].

---

## Physiological basis of the relationship

### Guyton's model of venous return

- **Venous return equation**: VR = (Pmsf − CVP) / Rvr, where Pmsf is mean systemic filling pressure, CVP is central venous pressure, and Rvr is resistance to venous return [^116rYmfu] [^112d5p5B].
- **Inverse relationship**: As CVP increases, the gradient (Pmsf − CVP) decreases, reducing venous return and thus cardiac output; conversely, as CVP decreases, venous return and cardiac output increase [^113aLs7p] [^112d5p5B].
- **Equilibrium point**: Cardiac output is the intersection of the cardiac function (Starling) and venous return curves, with CVP as the equilibrium right atrial pressure [^111X1Zn7] [^111PsUpL].

---

### Frank-Starling mechanism

The Frank-Starling mechanism states that **increased preload** augments stroke volume and cardiac output, but only up to a plateau; beyond this, further increases in preload (and CVP) do not raise output and may reduce venous return [^113aLs7p] [^115ZdoKC]. The **plateau effect** means that once the heart reaches its maximal output, additional volume increases CVP without increasing output, reflecting a shift along the flat portion of the Starling curve [^113aLs7p] [^111KuF3f].

---

## Clinical evidence of the relationship

### Fluid responsiveness and CVP

- **Poor correlation**: CVP correlates poorly with fluid responsiveness; meta-analyses show pooled correlation ~0.18 and AUC ~0.56, indicating limited predictive value [^115rpdcY] [^116ivv8A] [^113uTjT5].
- **Gray zone**: CVP values between ~8–12 mmHg are indeterminate; extreme values may be more informative, but overall CVP alone cannot reliably predict fluid responsiveness [^114SQcv6] [^1136xGxV].
- **Dynamic measures**: Stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and passive leg raising outperform static CVP for predicting fluid responsiveness [^115fLWoS] [^111A5xTi].

---

### Clinical scenarios illustrating the relationship

| **Clinical scenario** | **Cvp trend** | **Cardiac output trend** | **Physiological explanation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemia | Decreased | Increased (with fluids) | - Low CVP increases venous return gradient <br/> - Fluids restore preload and output [^11157zJf] |
| Heart failure | Increased | Decreased | - High CVP reduces venous return gradient <br/> - Impaired forward flow [^113aLs7p] |
| Positive pressure ventilation | Increased | Decreased | - Elevated intrathoracic pressure reduces venous return <br/> - Despite high CVP, output falls [^112ZFVZT] |
| Passive leg raising | Minimal change | Increased (if responsive) | - Transfers volume to increase preload without changing CVP much <br/> - Output rises if preload responsive [^11157zJf] |

---

## Factors influencing the relationship

Several factors **modulate the CVP–cardiac output relationship**:

- **Venous return**: Determined by Pmsf, CVP, and Rvr; changes in any can shift the equilibrium and alter cardiac output [^116rYmfu] [^116TZcmS].
- **Cardiac function**: Systolic and diastolic function, contractility, and compliance determine the cardiac function curve and its intersection with the venous return curve [^1166cpgQ] [^111X1Zn7].
- **Intrathoracic pressure**: Positive pressure ventilation or PEEP elevates CVP and can reduce venous return and cardiac output [^112ZFVZT] [^111PsUpL].
- **Autonomic tone**: Sympathetic activity alters venous tone and capacitance, affecting Pmsf and venous return [^112d5p5B] [^111X1Zn7].

---

## Clinical implications and limitations

- **Limited predictive value**: CVP alone cannot reliably predict fluid responsiveness or cardiac output; dynamic measures and clinical context are essential [^115rpdcY] [^115fLWoS].
- **Indicator of congestion**: Persistent elevation of CVP may signal venous congestion and organ dysfunction, particularly renal injury, independent of cardiac output [^113joPyS] [^115RreKA].
- **Integrated approach**: Use CVP alongside cardiac output, dynamic indices, and organ perfusion markers to guide therapy [^113xnpca] [^112oqctg].

---

CVP and cardiac output are **inversely related** through the venous return gradient, but the relationship is nonlinear and shaped by multiple factors. CVP alone cannot predict fluid responsiveness or cardiac output; it should be interpreted within a multimodal hemodynamic framework.

### Central venous pressure: a useful but not so simple measurement [^111KuF3f]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical use of central venous pressure measurements.

Data Sources

The Medline database, biographies of selected articles, and the author's personal database.

Data Synthesis

Four basic principles must be considered. Pressure measurements with fluid-filled systems are made relative to an arbitrary reference point. The pressure that is important for preload of the heart is the transmural pressure, whereas the pressure relative to atmosphere still affects other vascular beds outside the thorax. The central venous pressure is dependent upon the interaction of cardiac function and return function. There is a plateau to the cardiac function curve, and once it is reached, further volume loading will not increase cardiac output.

Conclusions

If careful attention is paid to proper measurement techniques, central venous pressure can be very useful clinically. However, the physiologic or pathophysiological significance of the central venous pressure should be considered only with a corresponding measurement of cardiac output or at least a surrogate measure of cardiac output.

Guyton's curves

A more complete understanding of the relationship between CVP and Starling's law required knowledge of the forces that return blood to the heart. During the 1950s to 1970s, Guyton integrated these features into a comprehensive model of the circulation and the control of cardiac output. Guyton confirmed Starling's belief that the metabolic activity of the peripheral organs is a key factor regulating the rate of venous return to the heart. According to Guyton's model, venous return depends on the pressure gradient between the average vascular pressure (called the mean systemic filling pressure) and the right atrium. Therefore, an elevated right atrial pressure opposes venous return. CVP is the clinical measurement of right atrial pressure. The gradient between the mean systemic filling pressure and CVP creates venous return and cardiac output. The mean systemic filling pressure arises from the force acting between the blood and the walls of the blood vessels and is largely independent of pulsatile left ventricular contraction.

Guyton used the combination of two curves to model the circulation. The intersection of these two curves determines the cardiac output (Figure 6). The venous return curve shows the rate of blood return to the heart and depends on the mean systemic filling pressure, right atrial pressure, and vascular resistance. An increase in vascular pressure that drives blood into the heart shifts the curve upward. The sinusoidal cardiac function curve depends on ventricular afterload, autonomic tone, and many intrinsic factors that determine cardiac performance. The cardiac function curve would be rotated downward and to the right in a poorly performing heart and intersects the venous return curve at a lower rate of cardiac output. The cardiac performance curve is analogous to a Starling curve. For a given cardiac performance, increasing venous return intersects the cardiac performance curve at a higher point and results in higher cardiac output. This is a graphic representation of Starling's Law of the Heart. The plateau of the cardiac performance curve shows that there is a limit to the heart's ability to accommodate increases in venous return. If venous return increases beyond this limit, blood wells up in the heart and raises atrial pressure drastically. Moreover, if a given venous return curve intercepts a cardiac performance curve from an ineffective heart, cardiac output is lower and right atrial pressure is higher. This is precisely what Starling showed: if increasing amounts of blood are returned to a fatigued heart, atrial pressures rise as cardiac output falls.

Question 3: Can changes in CVP during fluid administration be used as an indication of the response to fluids?

Yes and no! The increase in CVP does not reflect changes in cardiac output! According to Guyton, venous return is inversely related to the difference between mean systemic pressure (Pms) and CVP, suggesting that the higher the CVP, the lower the cardiac output. The role of the heart in this context is to try to keep CVP as low as possible to maintain the gradient between Pms and CVP. The goal of fluid resuscitation is to increase the gradient between Pms and CVP by increasing Pms, not by increasing CVP itself. Analyzing data published by Cecconi et al. who measured cardiac output, CVP, and Pms during fluid challenge in postoperative patients, it becomes clear that Pms increased similarly in fluid responders and nonresponders. In contrast, CVP increased minimally in responders so that the gradient for venous return and hence cardiac output increased. In the nonresponders, CVP increased markedly so that the gradient for venous return and thus cardiac output remained unchanged. Hence, cardiac tolerance to volume loading is a greater determinant than changes in Pms for determining the response to fluid challenge.

Accordingly, changes in CVP during fluid challenge should be analyzed together with changes in cardiac output; a large increase in CVP with minimal change in cardiac output indicates poor tolerance to fluids, whereas minimal change in CVP together with an increase in cardiac output indicates fluid responsiveness (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Relationship between preload, cardiac output, and central venous pressure (CVP). Relationship between cardiac output and preload (left panel) and between CVP and blood volume (right panel) in a fluid responder (a) and a nonresponder (b). In the fluid responder, the administration of fluids increases blood volume and cardiac preload; the increase in preload is associated with a large increase in cardiac output and a minimal increase in CVP. In the fluid nonresponder, the same increase in blood volume and preload is associated with no change in cardiac output and major changes in CVP. Accordingly, an increase in CVP cannot be used to suggest a positive response to fluids. Volume measurements better evaluate changes in preload in preload-responsive patients while pressure measurements better evaluate changes in preload in preload-nonresponsive patients

### Does central venous pressure predict fluid responsiveness? A systematic review of the literature and the tale of seven mares [^115rpdcY]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous pressure (CVP) is used almost universally to guide fluid therapy in hospitalized patients. Both historical and recent data suggest that this approach may be flawed.

Objective

A systematic review of the literature to determine the following: (1) the relationship between CVP and blood volume, (2) the ability of CVP to predict fluid responsiveness, and (3) the ability of the change in CVP (DeltaCVP) to predict fluid responsiveness.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

Study Selection

Reported clinical trials that evaluated either the relationship between CVP and blood volume or reported the associated between CVP/DeltaCVP and the change in stroke volume/cardiac index following a fluid challenge. From 213 articles screened, 24 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. The studies included human adult subjects, healthy control subjects, and ICU and operating room patients.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, correlation coefficient between CVP and blood volume, correlation coefficient (or receive operator characteristic [ROC]) between CVP/DeltaCVP and change in stroke index/cardiac index, percentage of patients who responded to a fluid challenge, and baseline CVP of the fluid responders and nonresponders. Metaanalytic techniques were used to pool data.

Data Synthesis

The 24 studies included 803 patients; 5 studies compared CVP with measured circulating blood volume, while 19 studies determined the relationship between CVP/DeltaCVP and change in cardiac performance following a fluid challenge. The pooled correlation coefficient between CVP and measured blood volume was 0.16 (95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.28). Overall, 56 ± 16% of the patients included in this review responded to a fluid challenge. The pooled correlation coefficient between baseline CVP and change in stroke index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.28). The pooled area under the ROC curve was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.61). The pooled correlation between DeltaCVP and change in stroke index/cardiac index was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.015 to 0.21). Baseline CVP was 8.7 ± 2.32 mm Hg [mean ± SD] in the responders as compared to 9.7 ± 2.2 mm Hg in nonresponders (not significant).

Conclusions

This systematic review demonstrated a very poor relationship between CVP and blood volume as well as the inability of CVP/DeltaCVP to predict the hemodynamic response to a fluid challenge. CVP should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid management.

### Should we measure the central venous pressure to guide fluid management? Ten answers to 10 questions [^1163ZgsA]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: Are the factors that influence CVP too numerous to make it meaningful?

We agree that the CVP is influenced by many factors, but this is also true for other variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output — does that mean we should not measure them? No, rather we need to understand which factors influence these measurements and how, in order to use them optimally.

CVP is an indicator of right ventricular and, to a lesser extent, left ventricular preload. CVP also reflects the limit to venous return and informs about right ventricular function. As such, CVP measurements may be helpful to guide fluid management. However, CVP is also affected by thoracic, pericardial, and abdominal pressures, which makes its interpretation more complicated. Indeed, although the CVP measured in these conditions overestimates the transmural CVP and may thus fail to reflect the true loading conditions of the right ventricle, it does represent the limit to venous return and the back pressure of all extrathoracic organs. In particular, the risk of peripheral edema, ascites, renal, and liver impairment is related to the absolute CVP value.

### Starling curves and central venous pressure [^115HzcCK]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of the Starling curve. The curve demonstrated the relationship between right atrial pressure and cardiac output. Consequently, some clinicians have used central venous pressure (CVP), which is right atrial pressure, to determine the adequacy of circulating blood volume and cardiac preload.

Depictions of Starling curves with CVP on the x axis (abscissa) have invited clinicians to presume that fluid resuscitating patients with low CVP would increase the stroke volume and cardiac output. Indeed, important clinical practice guidelines recommend fluid resuscitation of hypoperfused patients until the CVP rises to abnormal levels. A steady accumulation of investigations, however, has challenged this common practice. Initially, a report demonstrated that CVP does not correlate with gold standard measurements of total blood volume. Subsequently, two systematic reviews revealed that CVP does not predict the response of cardiac output to a fluid bolus in critically ill patients. Similarly, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure also does not predict the response to fluid administration. These challenges may lead some to take a nihilistic attitude toward hemodynamic monitoring and others to question the validity of Starling's law of the heart. In fact, the results of these studies are an expected consequence of circulatory physiology.

This review traces the history of Starling curves to explore their proper role in circulatory physiology. To use CVP and Starling curves correctly, we have to recognize that Starling's original experimental model set CVP as the dependent variable of venous return and cardiac function. The model also excluded the effects of an important factor in critically patients – the pressure adjacent to the heart.

### Does the central venous pressure predict fluid responsiveness? An updated meta-analysis and a plea for some common sense [^116ivv8A]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite a previous meta-analysis that concluded that central venous pressure should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid management, central venous pressure continues to be recommended for this purpose.

Aim

To perform an updated meta-analysis incorporating recent studies that investigated indices predictive of fluid responsiveness. A priori subgroup analysis was planned according to the location where the study was performed (ICU or operating room).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

Study Selection

Clinical trials that reported the correlation coefficient or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between the central venous pressure and change in cardiac performance following an intervention that altered cardiac preload. From 191 articles screened, 43 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. The studies included human adult subjects, and included healthy controls (n = 1) and ICU (n = 22) and operating room (n = 20) patients.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted on study characteristics, patient population, baseline central venous pressure, the correlation coefficient, and/or the AUC between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index and the percentage of fluid responders. Meta-analytic techniques were used to summarize the data.

Data Synthesis

Overall 57% ± 13% of patients were fluid responders. The summary AUC was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.58) with no heterogenicity between studies. The summary AUC was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.52–0.60) for those studies done in the ICU and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.58) for those done in the operating room. The summary correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1–0.25), being 0.28 (95% CI, 0.16–0.40) in the ICU patients, and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02–0.21) in the operating room patients.

Conclusions

There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^112oqctg]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Central venous pressure remains a fundamental yet controversial parameter in haemodynamic monitoring. While evidence suggests that the absolute CVP value alone is a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness, integrating CVP with waveform analysis and trend monitoring provides valuable insights into right heart function, venous congestion and organ perfusion. Emerging evidence suggests there is valuable interplay between CVP and critical physiological variables, such as right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, microcirculatory perfusion and Doppler‐derived venous waveforms, reinforcing the relevance of CVP monitoring in peri‐operative and critical care settings.

As surgical and critically ill patient populations become increasingly complex, the role of CVP should be reconsidered – not as an isolated predictor, but as a component of comprehensive haemodynamic assessment. Understanding the nuances of CVP trends, waveform morphology and its interactions with other haemodynamic markers remains integral to informing accurate clinical decision‐making in critical care medicine. Future research directions may include refining the integration of CVP with advanced monitoring modalities, while minimising reliance on outdated paradigms of volume assessment to optimise patient outcomes.

### Starling curves and central venous pressure [^115Pwwe1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 6
Guyton's combination of two curves to model the circulation. The intersection of the red cardiac performance and blue venous return curves determines cardiac output. Point A is the normal rest situation. Cardiac output is higher when the dashed line is the venous return curve and intercepts the same cardiac performance curve at point B. Image reproduced with permission from.

Guyton's curves allow us to do what Starling initially intended for his curve; to help predict the response of the entire circulation to changing a single variable. The curves of Starling and Sarnoff and Berglund are the results of experiments designed to study the response of the heart. Guyton's model incorporates the findings of these investigators into a holistic framework. Of course, the complexities and compensatory responses of the circulatory system prevent simple prediction of the response in cardiac output. In patients, the individual determinants of cardiac output are deeply interrelated. We simply cannot change just one variable (such as CVP) and predict a response in cardiac output. As we have seen, CVP depends on cardiac output as much as it determines it. Even though Guyton placed right atrial pressure (CVP) on the x axis, it is not an independent variable that determines cardiac output.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^112bkTcx]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Technological advancement meant that by the mid‐20th century, measurement and interrogation of CVP and right heart catheterisation were feasible and widespread. This enabled the clinician to calculate cardiac output and characterise cardiac and pulmonary pathology. Measurement of CVP in clinical medicine and its application to disease states became an area of interest in the 1950s, using cannulation of the internal jugular vein and a water manometer. Preliminary volunteer studies documented a temporary rise in CVP with fluid infusion and a fall with exsanguination. Thereafter, interest in CVP monitoring, particularly as a marker of fluid responsiveness, expanded further, even as contradictory evidence had emerged by the 1970s.

By 1973, pioneering work by Arthur Guyton advanced the clinical understanding of haemodynamics, filling pressures and ultimately CVP. Contrary to received wisdom, Guyton cautioned against relying on CVP as a marker of fluid responsiveness and promoted a model that incorporated physiological forces that contribute to venous return to describe the circulation. This gave physicians a more holistic model on which to interpret changes in the circulation and reduced reliance on the importance of a single variable. Guyton's model depicted CVP as being influenced by both upstream and downstream pressures, with cardiac output represented by the intersection of a cardiac function curve and a venous return curve. The cardiac function curve has similarities with the Starling curve, whereby increasing right atrial pressure leads to increasing cardiac output. In contrast, the venous return curve is defined by the equation:

Therefore, increasing right atrial pressure reduces venous return and cardiac output. Furthermore, infusing fluid will only increase venous return if it leads to an increase in mean systemic filling pressure greater than right atrial pressure, or decreases resistance to venous return through recruitment of collapsed abdominal veins (Fig. 1).

### Central venous pressure: current uses and prospects for an old parameter [^112d5p5B]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CVP as the backpressure of venous return

At equilibrium, venous return (VR) (volume of blood returning to the right atrium per minute) equals cardiac output (CO). According to Guyton's model, VR is proportional to the pressure gradient for VR (Eq. 1) divided by venous resistance:where RAP = CVP.

Pms, a theoretical pressure at the venular level, increases with stressed blood volume (the portion of blood maintaining venous transmural pressure above zero) and decreases with vascular compliance. VR can be increased by raising Pms through fluid infusion (via expansion of total blood volume) or enhancing venous tone (via venoconstrictors or sympathetic stimulation by reducing venular capacitance). The heart functions as a pump that creates a pressure gradient between Pms and CVP, with CO dependent on VR. CVP reflects the heart's pumping efficiency (greater efficiency leads to lower CVP), which cannot significantly raise Pms due to arterial resistance. CVP ranges from 0 to 6 mmHg (rarely exceeding 3–4 mmHg in SBP), while Pms varies between 7 and 10 mmHg. This narrow VR gradient means that even small increases in CVP can significantly reduce VR and CO (Fig. 1).

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^113uTjT5]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

This conflicting evidence culminated in a 1971 editorial concluding: "there is, in fact, ample evidence that changes in blood volume may be reflected in changes of CVP and, that fluid replacement based on CVP measurement may be the best way to treat acute hypovolaemia". Subsequent clinical approaches generally considered CVP an independent variable, leading to a focus on utilising CVP as an indicator of volume status and fluid responsiveness. Contemporary evidence suggests CVP reflects poorly the adequacy of cardiac preload – consistent with the observations of Ryan and Howland – and is a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients who are critically ill. A 2013 meta‐analysis including 43 studies and 1802 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients in the intensive care unit and patients undergoing major surgery) obtained a summary correlation coefficient between CVP and the change in stroke volume or cardiac index in response to a fluid challenge of 0.18 (95%CI 0.10–0.25), concluding CVP is unable to predict fluid responsiveness in the assessed cohorts. This builds on a 2008 meta‐analysis by the same group, who analysed CVP and fluid therapy (then including 24 studies involving 803 patients) which also concluded that CVP correlated poorly with measured blood volume, and has limited accuracy when guiding fluid therapy decisions, particularly in dynamic settings (pooled correlation coefficient 0.16, 95%CI 0.03–0.28). Similarly, a 2016 systematic review of 51 studies, and re‐analysis of over 1000 patient datasets, concluded that CVP value in isolation is a poor predictor (both negative and positive) of fluid responsiveness at values 0–20 mmHg. It was postulated that the poor predictive value of CVP and fluid responsiveness is explained by the complex interactions between venous return, right ventricular systolic and diastolic function, pulmonary vascular tone and intrathoracic pressure. Therefore, given the wide variability of cardiac volume and myocardial contractile performance between individuals, isolated CVP measurement cannot predict individual response to fluid administration reliably. Reliance on CVP for fluid responsiveness assessment is now discouraged. Moreover, current evidence suggests CVP values in isolation do not provide an accurate reflection of total blood volume status and should not be used as a single resuscitation target.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^1136xGxV]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central venous pressure (CVP) is an often controversial physiological parameter in critical care medicine. Central venous pressure measurement has been integrated into clinical practice for > 70 years, from preliminary studies in animal models, to promotion as a marker of volume status and a resuscitation target, and subsequently contributing to advanced haemodynamic monitoring to guide treatment options for patients who are critically ill.

The ongoing utility of CVP measurement is still subject to debate. Current evidence suggests CVP does not predict volume responsiveness across a range of patient cohorts, leading some commentators to move away from monitoring the parameter altogether. However, the clinical utility of targeting specific CVP values, both in isolation and as part of a trend, remains uncertain in different surgical and non‐surgical populations, as does the mechanism by which these targets may influence clinical outcomes.

A comprehensive review of this topic was performed by Eskesen et al. who re‐examined datasets from over 1000 patients, concluding that predictive values of "all specific CVP values assessed" were low for fluid responsiveness, with the exception of very high or very low values. Building further upon this, our review focuses both on fluid responsiveness and subsequent new developments, including non‐invasive measurement techniques utilising ultrasonography, and the role of CVP as a critical determinant of organ perfusion.

We address the historical background of CVP monitoring; principles of measurement; physiological underpinnings; how the parameter is influenced in certain pathophysiological states; and examine the evidence behind its use in clinical medicine, including new and emerging areas.

### Echocardiography as a guide for fluid management [^111G55d8]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The patient following initial resuscitation

Venous return, central venous pressure, and cardiac output are tightly coregulated as described by Patterson and Starling, Sarnoff and colleagues, and Guyton and Coleman. Highly predictable under normal circumstances, the ability to increase cardiac output through augmentations in venous return and central venous pressure changes dramatically in the patient who develops shock refractory to intravenous fluids. In 2016, standardized protocols dictate that following the recognition of nonhemorrhagic shock the patient will rapidly receive at least 20 ml/kg fluid. Fifty percent of patients do not achieve adequate perfusion with modest volume expansion and thus require vasopressors to maintain circulatory tone. In these patients, intravenous volume expansion during the first 6–12 hours following admission increases dramatically to 50–70 ml/kg. Norepinephrine, the vasopressor of choice in most circumstances, will not only increase arterial blood pressure through increased systemic vascular resistance but has a significant effect upon capacitance vessels, both arterial and venous, resulting in effective fluid loading to the right heart. It is evident that infusion of an entire blood volume of new fluid into the circulation, along with recruitment of circulatory capacitance, results in an extreme change to venous return, central venous pressure, and cardiac output.

In addition to the direct influence of the cardiovascular system, cardiopulmonary interactions play a crucial role in establishing the equilibrium of venous return, central venous pressure, and cardiac output. This is because 70–90% of patients with shock require mechanical ventilation. In the early phase of resuscitation during which patients are sedated to facilitate investigations and treatment, mean airway pressures of up to 24 cmH 2 O/18 mmHg have significant but unpredictable effects. These high thoracic pressures cause a decline in venous return and/or a functional unloading of the left ventricle through pressurization of the heart and thoracic aorta.

### Starling curves and central venous pressure [^113HmSZY]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical use of central venous pressure and Starling's law

As we have seen, the Starling curves that describe the Law of the Heart do not justify intentionally raising CVP with fluid resuscitation to abnormal values to increase cardiac output. However, the fact that an isolated measurement of CVP does not predict the response to a fluid bolus does not mitigate its importance as a hemodynamic variable. An understanding of Starling curves provides a rationale for using CVP as part of the evaluation of hemodynamic instability. First, an elevated CVP may signify that there is an impediment to venous return. The clinician should search for elevated juxta-cardiac pressure. These causes include tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and excessive positive pressure ventilation. Importantly, high CVP can be a sign of unrecognized auto-positive end-expiratory pressure due to dynamic hyperinflation, which may lead to shock and death. When high juxta-cardiac pressures impede venous return, clinicians should consider fluids and venoconstrictors to restore the gradient for venous return.

### Central venous pressure: current uses and prospects for an old parameter [^114cnDut]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Potential applications for CVP in hemodynamic management

Given its physiological basis and reasoning by a so-called gray zone approach, extreme CVP values may help define preload limits (approximately 1/3 patients receiving MV). Very low CVP values may indicate low cardiac preload, whereas high values suggest that fluid administration could be harmful. However, this has not been demonstrated in clinical settings, as absolute CVP values do not discriminate between FR and non-responders, and changes in CVP during passive leg raising (PLR) or heart–lung interactions are unreliable for this purpose. However, Lakhal et al. suggested that an increase in CVP of more than 2 mmHg during PLR may enhance the predictive value of pulse pressure variation observed during the same maneuver.

As a downstream pressure for organs, CVP plays a key role in venous return and high CVP is associated to worse outcomes. This raises the question of whether specific CVP thresholds should prompt interventions to reduce it, aiming for the lowest feasible CVP while maintaining adequate CO. Feasibility has been explored in specific settings. In ARDS patients, a restrictive strategy guided by CVP after stabilization was linked to shorter MV duration. In clinical practice, the decision to continue fluid administration in a patient showing signs of congestion despite preload dependency warrants early re-evaluation to avoid potential harm.

Finally, CVP may assess venous congestion in the setting of RV failure, a condition often marked by preload unresponsiveness and independently associated with mortality when combined with RVD (see Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
When is central venous pressure helpful? CVP central venous pressure, EGDT early goal directed therapy, PLR passive leg raising, FR fluid responsiveness, MPP mean perfusion pressure, MAP mean arterial pressure, RV right ventricular, CO cardiac output

Despite the justified abandonment of CVP to predict FR, it remains a valuable bedside tool. We should now aim to better define the scope of its interpretation. It is high time to move beyond the CVP value and consider its dynamic variations as a mean of monitoring the complex interplay between VR, RV and lungs.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^116S1wAa]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Early concepts in central venous pressure measurement

The first reported CVP measurement occurred in 1733, using glass tubing to access the jugular vein of an injured horse. Experiments in canines – showing a closed circulation and the relationship between arterial, capillary and venous pressure – were first described by Bayliss and Starling in 1894. Further canine experiments lead to the development of the Frank‐Starling 'law of the heart', wherein ex vivo heart preparations showed a "direct connection between venous pressure, diastolic filling and output" until the heart began to fail. Starling's own experiments did not generally treat preload as an independent variable; however, reproductions of the classic Frank‐Starling curve usually placed preload on the x‐axis, with subsequent physiology texts inferring that CVP was equivalent to ventricular preload and implying that CVP could be used as a marker of intravascular filling and volume responsiveness. Further canine studies in the 1920s described the transient elevation and subsequent fall of CVP in response to fluid bolus administration. The first human central venous catheterisation was performed in 1905 via the antecubital fossa by Bliechröder but this was not formally reported until 1929 after self‐catheterisation was performed by Forssmann.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^113SUQmS]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central venous pressure has been a key component of haemodynamic monitoring for several decades, but its clinical utility is still debated. While central venous pressure has been used traditionally to assess intravascular volume status and fluid responsiveness, mounting evidence suggests that its absolute value alone is an unreliable predictor of such states. This narrative review explores the historical development and physiological foundations of central venous pressure, its measurement techniques and the available evidence regarding central venous pressure monitoring in various clinical scenarios.

Methods

We conducted a literature search to identify relevant articles. The abstracts of identified articles were assessed for relevance, and their references were screened for further relevant publications.

Results

We identified 229 articles, with 72 undergoing full text extraction and data synthesis. Preliminary work in central venous pressure monitoring began in canines, before early human studies and the development of Guytonian principles of haemodynamics. Physiologically, central venous pressure reflects intraluminal pressure of the superior vena cava, with measurement affected significantly by transducer position, catheter position and intrathoracic pressures. In right ventricular dysfunction, the central venous pressure waveform loses its x-descent, as the y-descent becomes exaggerated. Central venous pressure in isolation is considered a poor predictor of volume responsiveness; however, elevated central venous pressure is linked with impaired tissue perfusion and poor clinical outcomes, including acute kidney injury and higher risk of mortality in certain patient cohorts.

Discussion

Although reliance on central venous pressure as a singular guide for fluid resuscitation is discouraged, it remains a valuable tool when interpreted in conjunction with waveform analysis and trend monitoring, offering insights into right heart function, venous congestion and organ perfusion. As patient cohorts grow increasingly complex, a nuanced understanding of central venous pressure waveforms and trends is essential for optimising management strategies in peri-operative and critical care settings.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^114MPbyz]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Physiological underpinnings of

Central venous pressure refers to the pressure measured within any central intrathoracic vein and is generally taken to mean the superior vena cava. The term is used interchangeably with right atrial pressure; in the supine position there is little pressure difference between the intrathoracic central veins and the right atrium. Central venous pressure is a fundamental physiological variable with several key determinants and is generated by the interaction of: upstream pressure, which in turn depends on blood volume and vascular capacitance; downstream pressure, specifically the resistance to right atrial outflow caused by pressure transmitted from the right heart, which in turn depends on right ventricular diastolic compliance and the pressures within the pulmonary vasculature; and the lateral pressures, specifically intrathoracic pressures and intrapericardial pressures, which are most influenced by mechanical ventilation.

The relationship between total blood volume and mean systemic filling pressure is not linear. Furthermore, 70% of blood is contained in the venous system and, of that, 25% is 'stressed' at baseline (i.e. held in veins with a transmural pressure above zero). The remaining 75% of venous volume is unstressed (i.e. held in veins with a transmural pressure of near zero). The stressed portion contributes to mean systemic filling pressure, which in turn drives venous return. Volume can be redistributed between 'unstressed' and 'stressed' states with venoconstriction.

### Starling curves and central venous pressure [^112dCum6]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The preceding paragraphs enumerate examples of diagnostic considerations when CVP elevation occurs in the setting of hypoperfusion. Similarly, normal CVP evidences against the presence of right ventricular pressure overload or elevated juxta-cardiac pressure. Clinicians should also consider using CVP measurement because it can be obtained non-invasively. Ultrasound measurement of the inferior vena cava reliably predicts CVP during spontaneous (negative pressure) ventilation. To understand CVP, we must recognize its relation to venous return and the Law of the Heart. An isolated measurement of CVP, like any other single hemodynamic variable, cannot describe the state of the circulation. However, when history and physical examination are insufficient, clinicians can integrate CVP into hemodynamic assessment along with other monitoring such as functional hemodynamics and echocardiography.

The small sample size and absence of statistical analysis in Starling's 1914 article would probably not pass peer review today. However, the subsequent century of research has validated the curve. Despite enduring confusion over its axes and its relationship to CVP, the Starling curve deserves its prominent place in our understanding of circulatory physiology.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^112aUQd5]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Central venous pressure has been used traditionally as a surrogate of right atrial pressure, and therefore a marker of cardiac preload but its use to guide fluid therapy is controversial. The 1960s saw increased interest in CVP monitoring and the emergence of case reports and case series, which supported the use of CVP as a marker of peri‐operative fluid resuscitation. Conversely, a 1966 study investigated a population of over 100 patients undergoing major cancer resection, concluding that CVP was not a useful measure of volume status, nor as a blood loss indicator, unless haemorrhage was rapid. The authors instead observed that CVP served as an indicator of myocardial competence and right ventricular diastolic filling pressures, concluding that CVP "had little correlation with blood loss and was instead useful for judging the heart's ability to tolerate rapid fluid replacement".

Sarnoff and Berglund's work revealed another limitation to using CVP as a determinant of stroke volume. They decreased myocardial compliance by increasing ventricular afterload and inducing coronary ischemia. These interventions increased right atrial pressure without increasing the stroke volume. The investigators summarized their extensive experiments by stating that for each animal there is a family of curves that describe the relationship between atrial pressure and cardiac work and output. They never intended to imply that right atrial pressure is an independent variable which controls cardiac output.

In the 1960s Braunwald and colleagues evaluated the Starling law in human patients. This group sewed metallic markers into ventricles and measured ventricular volume by cineradiography. Braunwald used the large beat-to-beat variation in filling during atrial fibrillation to show that stroke volume varies as a function of ventricular end-diastolic volume. Similarly, he showed that right ventricular systolic excursion varied with ventricular filling during valsalva maneuvers (Figure 5). This curve demonstrates that filling and stretch of the ventricle increases the stroke volume. This experiment shows how stroke volume varies with right atrial pressure. Deep inspiration lowers intra-thoracic pressure, thereby lowering right atrial pressure. Reduced right atrial pressure increases ventricular filling and augments stroke volume.

Figure 5

All of the preceding experiments confirmed that the heart has the intrinsic ability to accommodate changes in preload; increasing diastolic volume and stretch increase the force of contraction. Elevated cardiac pressure only increases the force of contraction and stroke volume if the experimental conditions permit the filling pressure to be an accurate proxy for end-diastolic volume. Cardiac tamponade, positive pressure ventilation, and increased ventricular afterload all increase atrial pressure without increasing the stroke volume. Much of the confusion about the relationship between CVP and Starling curves arose from its graphic depiction. Since CVP is often depicted on the x -axis, some clinicians incorrectly assume that it is an independent variable. However, CVP is only a surrogate for the return of blood to the heart under a set of defined circumstances that are not consistently present in clinical situations.

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^115Z25rd]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Some argue that instead of the heart merely being permissive and just allowing venous recoil, flow through the circulation occurs because the volume pumped out by the heart creates an increase in arterial pressure that drives the flow through the system and even determines the right atrial pressure. However, this type of reasoning ignores a number of issues. Flow occurs from areas of high pressure to areas of lower pressure. The flow back to the heart occurs from the upstream veins and venules. The pressure in this region is determined by the volume these vessels contain and the compliance of their walls. As already noted this region contains the bulk of circulating volume and the heart has little volume that it can add to the veins and venules and cannot significantly increase the pressure in these vessels. Thus, the pressure in this region remains relatively constant and flow occurs by lowering the downstream right atrial pressure through the actions of the right heart rather than by increasing the upstream pressure. If the heart rate were limited to one beat per minute, the pressure in the system would equilibrate in all regions before the next beat. The arterial pulse pressure is created by the single stroke volume ejected by the heart and the resistance to its drainage from the arterial compartment and the volume remaining in the aorta at the end of diastole. Widely different stroke volumes can be observed with the same arterial pressure, depending upon the arterial resistance. For example, in sepsis the cardiac output is high and blood pressure is low. During exercise cardiac output can increase more than fivefold with little change in mean arterial pressure.

### The meaning of blood pressure [^1113Jfbe]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The relationship of blood flow to metabolic need for the whole body is dominated by tissues that can greatly increase their oxygen needs, which are skeletal and cardiac muscle. In these tissues, as is the case for the whole body, there is a linear relationship between blood flow and oxygen consumption, indicating that the primary regulator of blood flow is metabolic activity. This strong metabolic coupling can override neural-mediated vasoconstriction. Metabolic activity likely plays an important role in the brain, too; however, the limited space in the skull means that increased volume and pressure must be controlled, likely by the myogenic process.

The two dominantly controlled cardiovascular variables, systemic arterial blood pressure and cardiac output relative to metabolic need, can be in conflict. A fall in arterial pressure with a normal cardiac output requires an increase in systemic vascular resistance to restore arterial pressure, but the rise in arterial resistance increases the load on the left ventricle, which could lead to a decrease in cardiac output. The hypotension would be fixed, but tissue perfusion would not. If the increase in vasoconstriction also increases venous resistance, cardiac output would fall even more. If the fall in arterial pressure occurs because of a decrease in cardiac output, an increase in arterial resistance in all vascular beds will restore blood pressure, but not regional organ blood flows. The hope when a pure vasoconstrictor drug is used is that local metabolic activity will override the constricting effect of the drug in critical vascular beds such as the brain and heart so that these regions will receive a greater proportion of the available flow. How much this occurs likely depends upon the ability of these regions to modify the generalized vasoconstriction through their local signals, and likely also is affected by the receptor density for the vasoconstricting drug. Very high doses may just constrict all regions non-discriminately. The clinically important point is that if tissue perfusion is low, a treatment must increase cardiac output without a change in arterial pressure and not overwhelm regional mechanisms that match flow to tissue needs. This type of strategy requires some measure of blood flow or indirect measures of tissue perfusion such as lactate and central venous saturation as well as clinical indicators such as wakefulness, skin temperature and color, and urine output when the kidneys are working.

### Hemodynamic monitoring [^113xnpca]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hemodynamic assessment is a key component of the evaluation of the critically ill patients and has both diagnostic and prognostic utility. This review outlines a general approach to assessment of hemodynamics and perfusion, and then discusses various hemodynamic parameters: heart rate, BP, intravascular (central venous and pulmonary artery) pressures, cardiac output, and myocardial performance, within the context not only of how they are best measured but also how they should be used in a clinical context. Hemodynamics are best assessed using a combination of not only different hemodynamic parameters but also those with the inclusion of clinical indices of perfusion. The benefits of these techniques, as with all medical testing and interventions, must be weighed against any potential risks. Although what to measure and how to measure it is important, what is most important is how to use the information. Evaluating the response to therapeutic interventions is frequently the most useful way to employ hemodynamic monitoring techniques. For the practitioner, learning how to select from a robust set of hemodynamic tools and how to tailor their use to individual clinical settings will allow for optimal patient care.

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^116Mbhqr]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Volume infusions are one of the commonest clinical interventions in critically ill patients yet the relationship of volume to cardiac output is not well understood. Blood volume has a stressed and unstressed component but only the stressed component determines flow. It is usually about 30% of total volume. Stressed volume is relatively constant under steady state conditions. It creates an elastic recoil pressure that is an important factor in the generation of blood flow. The heart creates circulatory flow by lowering the right atrial pressure and allowing the recoil pressure in veins and venules to drain blood back to the heart. The heart then puts the volume back into the systemic circulation so that stroke return equals stroke volume. The heart cannot pump out more volume than comes back. Changes in cardiac output without changes in stressed volume occur because of changes in arterial and venous resistances which redistribute blood volume and change pressure gradients throughout the vasculature. Stressed volume also can be increased by decreasing vascular capacitance, which means recruiting unstressed volume into stressed volume. This is the equivalent of an auto-transfusion. It is worth noting that during exercise in normal young males, cardiac output can increase five-fold with only small changes in stressed blood volume. The mechanical characteristics of the cardiac chambers and the circulation thus ultimately determine the relationship between volume and cardiac output and are the subject of this review.

### Central venous pressure and impaired renal function in children and young adults with cardiovascular disease [^113Eu9pW]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Among a cohort of children with a variety of cardiovascular disorders and mostly normal systolic ventricular function, higher CVP correlates with lower baseline eGFR and is independently associated with increased risk of WRF. Our data suggest that CVP, more so than cardiac index, is the main driver of renal function in children, although the effects of arterial blood pressure remain uncertain. Although static intracardiac hemodynamics likely make up a small proportion of all factors influencing baseline renal function, these data highlight the fundamental relationship between venous pressure and renal function and add to our understanding of the cardiorenal axis in children. More analysis of the longitudinal impact of CVP on renal function is warranted, and these observations highlight the need for further research into risk factors for WRF in children including those with heart failure and single ventricle physiology.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Despite widespread focus on cardiac output as a driver of renal dysfunction and injury, CVP is more consistently and significantly associated with renal function in children with cardiovascular disease.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further investigation is needed to define the relationship between CVP and renal function in additional subpopulations of pediatric patients, and ultimately to explore the implications for management and renal outcomes particularly in the intensive care unit setting where continuous invasive pressure monitoring is available.

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^1165pRtq]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Implications of the physiology for clinical interventions

Volume therapy

The existence of unstressed volume and the ability to adjust stressed volume by changes in capacitance introduces a role for volume infusions that is not simply to increase cardiac output but rather to ensure reserves. Patients who have had volume losses and whose MSFP is being supported by a reduction in vascular capacitance by recruitment of their unstressed reserves no longer can use this mechanism to rapidly adjust stressed volume as needed. Volume infusion could potentially restore these reserves without producing much change in cardiac output, although there might be some decrease in heart rate because of a decrease in sympathetic activity. However, the response to the next stress would be very different. This argues for infusion of some volume before major surgical interventions and in initial trauma management in subjects who might have reduced volume reserves based on their "volume history". Note that this would likely not produce much change in any measureable hemodynamic values, including ventilation-induced variations in arterial pressure or stroke volume.

### Early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock: current evidence and future directions [^111A5xTi]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Alternatives to central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation

One of the key challenges of treating shock is the measurement of intravascular volume and oxygen delivery during fluid bolus therapy. This is of particular importance in patients with sepsis, who are at high risk of fluid overload. Previous studies have estimated that only 50% of hemodynamically unstable patients are fluid-responsive, highlighting the need for accurate measurement of volume status. Physical examination and chest radiography are simple methods of assessing volume but are statistically insensitive and unreliable. Static measurements of CVP and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure can be used but also have low sensitivity and specificity for predicting fluid responsiveness. This is likely due to the nonlinear relationship between volume and pressure, which results from variable compliance of the cardiovascular system. The use of ScvO 2 as an indirect marker of cardiac output and tissue oxygenation is also controversial. Previous studies have shown that ScvO 2 does not always approximate mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2), a more accurate marker of total body oxygen consumption.

This has prompted the development of alternative methods of monitoring fluid responsiveness in the ICU. Dynamic indices such as variation in stroke volume, pulse pressure, and the diameter of inferior vena cava (IVC) offer the advantage of real-time assessment of hemodynamic status. However, measurement of stroke volume and pulse pressure variation is typically reserved for patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation. The IVC diameter can be measured in spontaneously breathing patients by ultrasound but provides only an indirect assessment of CVP. Other techniques such as the passive leg-raise maneuver and mini-fluid challenge have thus been proposed. The mini-fluid challenge requires a bolus of 100 to 500 mL of crystalloids infused over 10 to 30 minutes, whereas the passive leg-raise acts as a 'self' fluid challenge that increases cardiac preload. In these techniques, an ultrasound cardiac output monitor is used to estimate a patient's fluid responsiveness from position on the Frank-Starling curve. A patient is considered fluid-responsive if cardiac output increases by at least 10% to 15% after the fluid challenge (Fig. 3).

### Breaking under pressure: cardiorenal syndrome and elevated central venous pressures in children with heart disease [^112so6s6]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The term "cardiorenal syndrome" (CRS) delineates the intricate relationship between poor cardiac performance and kidney dysfunction, which can be associated with a wide range of congenital and acquired heart diseases including orthotopic heart transplantation.CRS is caused primarily by compromised renal perfusion, derangements in the neurohormonal axis, and venous congestion, but it is also associated with systemic inflammation and the use of nephrotoxic agents. Understanding the specific pathophysiological drivers is an important step in efforts to prevent or mitigate CRS, which is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Poor right ventricular compliance and venous congestion are emerging as strong contributors to CRS and may present a modifiable risk factor for future interventions. Central venous pressure (CVP) is used as a clinically relevant surrogate for venous congestion, which is often considered an independent variable or in the context of a composite renal perfusion pressure. While higher CVP has been associated with adult cardiac patients with chronic renal dysfunctionand acute kidney injury in children, its role in the progression of CRS in children with chronic cardiac disease has not been explored.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Olsen et alinvestigate the important relationship between CVP and kidney function in pediatric patients with cardiovascular disease undergoing routine cardiac catheterization In order to reduce potential confounding, they focused on a narrow subgroup composed exclusively of those with biventricular physiology without any intracardiac shunts. After controlling for cardiac index, arterial-venous oxygen difference, and left and right ventricular function, an elevated CVP was found to be an independent risk factor for a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and worsening renal function over time. This inverse relationship was demonstrated for CVP above 6 mm Hg in a linear fashion and remained consistent across numerous statistical approaches. In contrast to the traditional conceptual framework of organ injury, no relationship was found between eGFR or worsening kidney function, and adequate systemic cardiac output (surrogate for oxygen delivery). Similarly, medication use was not associated with either outcome.

### Starling curves and central venous pressure [^116oDLam]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Original presentation and reproduction of the Starling curve. (a) Original presentation of the Starling curve. The y axis is right atrial pressure (mmH 2 O). The x axis is cardiac output (cm 3 /minute). Image reproduced with permission from. (b) Reproduction in Guyton and colleagues' textbook on circulatory physiology. Image reproduced with permission from.

Starling's graph of cardiac output and right atrial pressure is somewhat confusing to the modern reader. Neither one of these two variables was independent in his experiment. The actual independent variable of his experiments was the amount he opened the valve that resisted flow into the right atrium. Using the modern custom, the absence of resistance to blood return (the amount of valve opening) would appear on the x axis. The dependent variables cardiac output and right atrial pressure would appear on separate y axes (Figure 3). This graph demonstrates the intrinsic ability of mammalian hearts to respond to changes in the rate of returning blood flow. Once the rate of blood return exceeds the limit of the heart's capacity to respond, right atrial pressure rises rapidly. Beyond the limit of accommodation, cardiac output plateaus or falls. The Starling curve does not imply that increasing right atrial pressure increases cardiac output. In some experiments, Starling increased resistance to outflow from the aorta. The increased load raised right atrial pressure without increasing cardiac output.

Figure 3
Alternative presentation of the Starling curve. Alternative presentation of the Starling curve with the actual independent variable (opening of the venous return valve) on the x axis. The original raw data from the experiments is unavailable.

Apparently, Starling never shared the enthusiasm for his curve. He did not mention it in his famous Linacre lecture on the heart, which integrated his extensive experiments into a cohesive framework. Nor did he show the curve in his textbook of medical physiology. For Starling, the curve was just part of the basis for the more important insight: The Law of the Heart. Simply stated, myocardial work varies with the initial fiber length of the myocyte. The dominant role of thermodynamics in the study of physiology in that era explains Starling's emphasis on myocardial work and heat generation.

### Elevated central venous pressure is associated with increased mortality and acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: a meta-analysis [^113joPyS]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to investigate the association between elevated CVP and the risk of mortality and AKI in critically ill adult patients. The two principal findings are summarized: elevated CVP is associated with increased risk of mortality and AKI in critically ill adult patients; per 1 mmHg increase in CVP increases the odds of AKI in critically ill adult patients. Further analyses restricted to patients with sepsis showed consistent results.

Possible mechanisms for findings

CVP is a pressure recorded from the superior vena cava or the right atrium, which represents the pressure index of cardiac preload and is equal to the end-diastolic pressure of the right ventricle in the absence of tricuspid stenosis. It is determined by the interaction between cardiac function and venous return. The CVP is a complex interplay influenced by right ventricular function, right ventricular afterload, right ventricular compliance, venous tone, volume status, abdominal pressure, intrathoracic pressure (mean airway pressure), and many other factors. According to Guyton's venous reflux theory, cardiac out equals venous return and venous reflux is dependent on mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) and CVP gradient (i.e. MCFP-CVP). Contrary to the misleading assertion that high CVP represents an increase in cardiac output, excessive fluid administration which just leading to an increase of CVP but does not increase cardiac output when the venous return curve intersects this area of the cardiac function curve. This is mainly because fluid loading only increases right atrial pressure/CVP and tissue edema, but does not significantly increase end-diastolic volume and stroke volume on this condition. When CVP increased or MCFP decreased, venous reflux decreased; on the contrary, venous reflux increased if CVP decreased or MCFP increased. Therefore, lower CVP is needed to ensure venous reflux and cardiac output if MCFP in the flat part of the Starling curve.

Traditionally, renal injury is considered to be caused by reduced renal perfusion due to decreased cardiac output or vascular volume. Renal perfusion pressure, defined as mean arterial pressure minus renal venous pressure, is a potential risk factor for AKI progression in critically ill patients. A high CVP is transmitted backwards increasing renal venous pressure, which reduces renal perfusion pressure and increases renal venous congestion. These two factors undependably have profound effects on renal perfusion and renal function and further leading to AKI.

### Bench-to-bedside review: an approach to hemodynamic monitoring – guyton at the bedside [^117F336j]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Hemodynamic monitoring is used to identify deviations from hemodynamic goals and to assess responses to therapy. To accomplish these goals one must understand how the circulation is regulated. In this review I begin with an historical review of the work of Arthur Guyton and his conceptual understanding of the circulation and then present an approach by which Guyton's concepts can be applied at the bedside. Guyton argued that cardiac output and central venous pressure are determined by the interaction of two functions: cardiac function, which is determined by cardiac performance; and a return function, which is determined by the return of blood to the heart. This means that changes in cardiac output are dependent upon changes of one of these two functions or of both. I start with an approach based on the approximation that blood pressure is determined by the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance and that cardiac output is determined by cardiac function and venous return. A fall in blood pressure with no change in or a rise in cardiac output indicates that a decrease in vascular resistance is the dominant factor. If the fall in blood pressure is due to a fall in cardiac output then the role of a change in the return function and cardiac function can be separated by the patterns of changes in central venous pressure and cardiac output. Measurement of cardiac output is a central component to this approach but until recently it was not easy to obtain and was estimated from surrogates. However, there are now a number of non-invasive devices that can give measures of cardiac output and permit the use of physiological principles to more rapidly appreciate the primary pathophysiology behind hemodynamic abnormalities and to provide directed therapy.

Volume replacement

Fluid challenge

Volume replacement treatment requires assessment of the patient's intravascular volume status (cardiac preload) and the likelihood of responsiveness (that is, increase the stroke volume) to a fluid challenge test. In fact, data suggest that about 50% of the critically ill patients positively respond to challenge tests. Multiple tools have been suggested as indicators for fluid administration, most of them as predictors of response and as targets. Clinical signs, such as thirst, skin turgor, blood pressure, urine output, and so forth, are unreliable indexes of intravascular volume status. Similarly, cardiac filling pressures (central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) that have been traditionally used to guide fluid management are poor predictors. CVP has been used for over 40 years to guide fluid management, as an indicator of intravascular volume (values < 8 cmH 2 O indicate hemodynamic impairment), even though this relationship has not been proven. Other techniques, based on echocardiography, such as left ventricular end-diastolic area, or based on thermodilution, such as global end-diastolic volume index, gave unsatisfying results.

CVP has been used for decades as an indirect measure of left ventricle preload as it well approximates the right atrial pressure, the major determinant of right ventricle filling. Moreover, changes in CVP in response to fluid challenge tests have been used to predict volume responsiveness (target 8 to 12 cmH 2 O). However, there is increasing evidence that - due to a series of variables, such as venous tone, intrathoracic pressures, ventricular compliances and geometry variations, occurring in critically ill patients - the relationship between CVP and right ventricular end-diastolic volume is poor and that CVP (absolute or changes) does not correlate with volume responsiveness. Similar problems were encountered when referring to the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure.

During the past decades a number of dynamic tests have been used to dynamically monitor the changes in stroke volume after a maneuver that modifies venous return. These methods have been found more reliable and less invasive than static ones.

### Venous return and mean systemic filling pressure: physiology and clinical applications [^11157zJf]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

How can the physiology of venous return change practice?

Volume expansion and the importance of central venous pressure

As has been shown in critically ill patients, fluid administration has the exact opposite effect of hypovolaemia, as it increases stressed blood volume and Pmsf. Contrary to what one might expect from the decrease in sympathetic tone, RVr remains unchanged.

However, patients with and without preload responsiveness behave differently. Our group has shown that a fluid bolus increases Pmsf, to a similar extent whatever the degree of preload responsiveness. In the case of preload responsiveness, as the Frank–Starling curve is steep, volume expansion increases Pmsf more than it increases RAP (Fig. 5). The (Pmsf–RAP) gradient increases. As RVr is unchanged, venous return and cardiac output increase. In the case of preload unresponsiveness, volume expansion increases Pmsf to the same extent. However, the increase in cardiac preload is not transformed into an increase in stroke volume. The end-diastolic ventricular pressure increases, leading to a substantial increase in RAP. Then, RAP and Pmsf increase to a similar extent and the gradient of venous return remains unchanged (Fig. 5). These results were confirmed by three other studies using methods other than heart–lung interactions.

Fig. 5
Effects of volume expansion on venous return and its determinants depending on the degree of preload responsiveness. Volume expansion increases the stressed blood volume and, then, increases mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf). The equilibrium point is shifted to the upper right. A In the case of preload responsiveness (PR), Pmsf increases to a larger extent than right atrial pressure (RAP), inducing an increase in the (Pmsf–RAP) gradient. Venous return and cardiac output (CO) increase. B In the case of preload non-responsiveness (PNR), RAP increases to a similar extent as Pmsf, the (Pmsf–RAP) gradient remains unchanged and CO does not increase significantly

Understanding these physiological effects of fluid helps to interpret CVP during fluid infusion. It is often thought that CVP should increase during fluid administration. However, we have seen that on the contrary, in preload responders, CVP should not increase so much, in order to allow the venous return gradient to increase. The same mistake has been made regarding passive leg raising (PLR). It is physiologically wrong that PLR is not efficient enough if CVP does not increase, as has been suggested.

### Central venous pressure and impaired renal function in children and young adults with cardiovascular disease [^117RBWrt]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal dysfunction is a common comorbidity and risk factor for adverse outcomes including death and cardiac transplantation in both adults and children with heart disease. Despite its important prognostic value, the pathophysiology, prevention, and management of the cardiorenal syndrome remain incompletely understood, especially in children. Renal dysfunction with coexisting cardiovascular disease is often attributed to a deficiency in antegrade perfusion, or "prerenal" failure. Traditional teaching assumes that reduced cardiac output and subsequent neurohormonal activation lead to increased serum creatinine and declining renal performance. However, this explanation ignores the contribution of venous congestion to renal function. In adults with cardiac disease, increased central venous pressure (CVP) is independently associated with impaired renal function and adverse outcomesand appears to be the main hemodynamic driver of worsening renal function (WRF) over time. Proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon include compression of the distal tubules by distended venules effectively causing an obstructive uropathy, as well as the sympathetic activation and angiotensin cascade initiated by increased renal capsular interstitial pressure. Unlike in adults, in children, the relationship between CVP and renal function has not been well described. We have previously shown that in patients who have undergone the Fontan palliation for single ventricle physiology, higher CVP is associated with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Similarly, in a cohort of very low birth weight infants without cardiac disease, higher CVP was associated with increased serum creatinine and diminished urine output. Across a broad group of children with cardiovascular disease and biventricular physiology, though, the relationship between CVP and renal function has not been established. Furthermore, the prognostic value of venous congestion for predicting WRF in children has never been examined. Thus, we sought to test the hypothesis that, in children with a spectrum of cardiovascular disease, CVP correlates with eGFR and predicts WRF.

### Relationship of central venous pressure to body fluid volume status and its prognostic implication in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^115aXphv]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although central venous pressure (CVP) is a surrogate measure of preload in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), it is a multifactorial index influenced not only by fluid volume status, but also by cardiac pump function and other factors. We aimed to elucidate the individual pathophysiological factors of CVP elevation in patients with ADHF by assessing the relationship between CVP and extracellular fluid volume status (EVS).

Methods and Results

We quantified EVS in 100 patients with ADHF with the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis. CVP was also measured at the same time point. Subjects were categorized into tertiles according to their CVP-EVS ratios, and patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared among these tertiles. The upper-tertile group had a higher incidence of impaired right ventricular pump function, whereas the lower-tertile group had higher incidences of severe inflammation, hypoalbuminemia, and renal dysfunction. Patients in both the upper and lower tertiles had a significantly higher cardiac event rate than those in the middle tertile.

Conclusions

The combined assessment of CVP and EVS provides insight into both the total volume status and distribution of body fluid in ADHF patients, and it may have applications in guiding decongestive therapy and improving prognostic predictions.

### Continuous central venous oxygen saturation assisted intraoperative hemodynamic management during major abdominal surgery: a randomized, controlled trial [^111hAY3b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Advanced haemodynamic monitoring, using cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV) to guide intraoperative fluid therapy has resulted in improved outcomes in several studies. Despite the increasing evidence, advanced haemodynamic monitoring has not become routine practice and, in high risk patients, arterial and central venous pressure monitoring remain the most common tools applied in more than 80% of cases in Europe and in the United States. One of the reasons may be that accurate measurement of cardiac output, SVV and PPV require advanced instrumentation.

Another important factor for haemodynamic stability is the balance between oxygen delivery (DO 2) and consumption (VO 2). Unfortunately, detailed haemodynamic evaluation, including DO 2 /VO 2 balance, for every high risk patient in the operating theatre is not feasible. The most often used bedside parameter to assess the relationship between oxygen supply and consumption is the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2). Continuous monitoring of the ScvO 2 is also possible with a device based on fiber-optic technology via a standard central venous catheter. Values measured by this approach have shown good correlation with laboratory values. ScvO 2 reflects important changes in the DO 2 /VO 2 relationship, has been found to be useful during high-risk surgery, and low ScvO 2 is associated with increased postoperative complications. Despite these theoretical advantages, ScvO 2 is only used in 12–30% of high risk surgical patients. In clinical routine, MAP and CVP are the most frequently applied monitoring tools (75–95%) during high risk surgery, despite convincing evidence that neither can predict fluid responsiveness.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare the effects of ScvO 2 assisted intraoperative haemodynamic support to the routinely used MAP-CVP approach on postoperative complications in high risk surgical patients.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^114P6LZz]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite being non‐specific for right ventricular dysfunction or volume status, monitoring of CVP trends may be useful in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or left‐sided heart failure, in which the development of acute right ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with high morbidity and poorer overall prognosis. The relationship between CVP and right ventricular dysfunction is complex, as elevated pressures can trigger a compensatory increase in afterload, worsening right ventricular filling. Nevertheless, CVP provides critical insights into the haemodynamic burdens placed on the right heart and can be useful to monitor the progression of right ventricular diastolic dysfunction over time (Fig. 4).

Anaesthetists and intensivists are called upon increasingly to care for patients at risk of right heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension. It is estimated to affect 1% of the global population, with increased prevalence in those aged > 65 y. Most cases are secondary to left heart disease or lung disease (World Health Organization group 2 disease). These patients have a peri‐operative mortality of 15–50% when undergoing emergency surgery. The 2022 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines recommend CVP be monitored during general anaesthesia where significant fluid shifts are expected. Importantly, CVC insertion and monitoring is within the core skill set of all anaesthetists, whereas peri‐operative echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheterisation may not be. In such cases, the absolute value, trends and waveform are all of importance. A CVP rising progressively combined with a falling mean arterial pressure may indicate a failing right ventricle, requiring consideration of inotropic and/or vasoactive support, careful volume management and inhaled pulmonary vasodilators. Changes in the CVP waveform also alert the anaesthetist to worsening right ventricular function.

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^116ar2fy]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Limits of cardiac and return functions

Venous return becomes limited when the pressure inside the great veins is less than the pressure outside their walls because the floppy walls of veins collapse and produce what is called a vascular waterfall or a flow limitation (Fig. 5). This occurs at atmospheric pressure when breathing spontaneously. When venous collapse occurs, further lowering right atrial pressure does not increase venous return. This means that the best the heart can do to increase cardiac output is lower right atrial pressure to zero (Fig. 5). Maximum venous return and cardiac output are defined by the MSFP, which is determined by stressed volume in the veins and venules and the compliance of these structures and by the resistance to venous return. Maximum flow would occur, albeit for an instant, if the heart were suddenly taken out of the circulation, indicating that the heart gets in the way of the return of blood by creating a downstream pressure greater than zero. In patients mechanically ventilated with positive end-expiratory pressure, flow limitation occurs at a positive value and not zero. When venous return is limited, cardiac output can only be increased by increasing MSFP by a volume infusion, by decreasing capacitance and recruiting unstressed into stressed volume without a change in total volume (Fig. 6), or by decreasing the resistance to venous return.

Fig. 5
Limit of the return function. When the pressure inside the great veins is less than the surrounding pressure (which is zero when breathing at atmospheric pressure), the vessels collapse and there is flow limitation. Lowering right atrial pressure (Pra) further does not increase flow. Maximum venous return (VRmax) is then dependent upon MSFP and venous resistance (Rv). The heart cannot create a flow higher than this value

Fig. 6
Change in cardiac output and venous return with an increase in capacitance. An increase in capacitance is the same as lowering the opening on the side of a tub for it allows more volume to flow out, which is the equivalent of more volume being stressed. Graphically it results in a leftward shift of the volume–pressure relationship of the vasculature (upper left). This shifts the venous return curve to the right and increases cardiac output through the Starling mechanism (lower left). This effect is identical to giving volume to expand stressed volume.

### Should we measure the central venous pressure to guide fluid management? Ten answers to 10 questions [^114SQcv6]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: Can a given CVP value determine whether a patient is fluid responsive?

According to the Frank-Starling relationship, stroke volume increases with CVP until a plateau is reached (Fig. 1). It may thus sound attractive to try to reach a CVP value that is close to the plateau. Unfortunately, this approach has limited value, because there is wide inter-patient variability in the slopes. Accordingly, it is very difficult to predict the response to fluids based on a single CVP value. In a trial investigating 150 fluid challenges performed in 96 septic patients being treated with mechanical ventilation, Osman et al. observed that baseline CVP was similar in responders and nonresponders so that the predictive value of CVP was low.

Fig. 1
Frank-Starling relationship in individual patients. At low central venous pressure (CVP) values, most patients respond to fluids. At high CVP values, most patients do not respond to fluids. Between the two dotted lines, the response to fluids cannot be predicted from the CVP

The classical statistical approach to evaluating the predictive value of a test is often limited as it considers the risk of error independent of the clinical situation. Nevertheless, it is less risky to administer fluids in a nonresponsive patient with a low CVP than one with a high CVP since the risk of edema formation is obviously lower.

The presence of an "extreme" CVP value may be more helpful to guide fluid administration than intermediate values. In a recent systematic review by Eskesen et al. including 1148 patients from 51 studies that evaluated the response to a fluid bolus and reported CVP, the overall predictive value of CVP was poor. However, approximatively two thirds of the patients with a CVP less than 8 mmHg but only one third of patients with CVP values greater than 12 mmHg responded to fluids. In another study that included 556 patients (460 of whom were from eight studies published by the authors of the review, and interestingly three of these studies were not included in the other systematic review), the authors used the gray zone approach to determine CVP values between which no decisions on fluid responsiveness could be taken. A positive response to fluids was observed when CVP values were less than 6 mmHg but was unlikely when values were greater than 15 mmHg.

These data suggest that extreme CVP values can help to guide the response to fluids whereas intermediate values cannot (Fig. 1). It may thus be wise to refrain from administering fluids when the CVP is markedly elevated.

### New generation continuous cardiac output monitoring from carbon dioxide elimination [^111MPcBT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The need for better cardiac output monitoring options

Over the last 25 years, progress in technologies for perioperative measurement of cardiac output (CO) has been largely driven by the potential for advanced hemodynamic monitoring to deliver improvements in patient outcomes in major surgery. Much of this interest among clinicians and researchers relates to "goal directed" intravenous fluid administration, informed by our understanding of the relationship between circulatory volume status and stroke volume based on the Starling curve. This is manifested clinically as "fluid responsiveness", where cardiac output can be increased by greater ventricular preload to a maximal point representing "optimal" volume status. The potential clinical implications of this were articulated by Bellamy, who drew a theoretical U-shaped curve relating optimal fluid resuscitation and tissue perfusion to minimizing complication rates in surgical patients. Recent large trial data have supported, but not yet confirmed, this in high risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. In addition to fluid and volume titration, cardiac output measurement provides other important benefits such as improved diagnostic capability to help manage hypotension in the anesthetized patient and assist appropriate combination of fluid and vasopressor administration by calculation of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from measurement of both systemic perfusion pressure (the difference between mean arterial pressure MAP and central venous pressure CVP) and blood flow (Eq. 1).

Invasive cardiac output measurement from right heart thermodilution using the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) became widespread practice in cardiac surgery forty years ago and remains routine in many centers worldwide. However the overall risk-benefit of the PAC has been difficult to demonstrate, and its invasiveness prevented its adoption in routine practice outside of the most challenging and high risk surgical populations. Nevertheless, the desire to generalize the potential benefits of advanced hemodynamic monitoring to a wider population has driven an explosive growth in the range of new less invasive alternatives. Several different physiological and bioengineering principles have been exploited to achieve this, including pulse pressure waveform interpretation, Doppler measurement of blood flow velocities in the great vessels, and thoracic electrical bioimpedance and velocimetry and related technologies. Testing and validation of these devices in the clinical environment has generally used thermodilution as the reference standard, and has usually been conducted in the setting of elective cardiac surgery. Interpretation and generalization of the findings of these validation studies is often made difficult by the narrow test population, as well as the imperfect precision of cardiac output measurement by thermodilution under real world clinical conditions.

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^1171VcEr]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

A second mechanism that can increase the proportion of vascular volume in the pulmonary compartments is an increase in the proportion of the lung in West zones 1 and 2. Under these conditions alveolar pressure becomes the downstream pressure for pulmonary flow instead of left atrial pressure. When this happens, pulmonary venous pressure rises one-to-one with an increase in alveolar pressure and provides a considerable load for the right ventricle. The increased pressure is also downstream of pulmonary capillaries and will increase pulmonary capillary filtration.

Another factor that is not often taken into account when considering the distribution of volume and maintenance of normal pressure gradients for venous return is the size of the heart. Typical limits of diastolic volumes of normal ventricles are in the range of 120 to 140 ml, which between the two ventricles can account for as much as 20% of stressed volume. In someone who has very dilated ventricles this could be an even higher proportion of total blood volume, although presumably most of it is unstressed. Excess accumulation of the volume in the heart is prevented by the characteristics of the passive filling curves of the ventricles, which become very steep at a value appropriate for a normal stroke volume. If the capacity of the ventricles is too large for the volume reserves of the body, accumulation of volume in the ventricles could take up a significant proportion of systemic venous volume, which would decrease MSFP and limit cardiac output.

### Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure fail to predict ventricular filling volume, cardiac performance, or the response to volume infusion in normal subjects [^113UtweC]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure have been considered to be reliable measures of left and right ventricular preload in patients requiring invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Studies in recent years have questioned the correlation between these estimates of ventricular filling pressures and ventricular end-diastolic volumes/cardiac performance variables in specific patient groups, but clinicians have continued to consider the relationship valid in the broader context. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between pressure estimates of ventricular preload (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, central venous pressure) and end-diastolic ventricular volumes/cardiac performance in healthy volunteers.

Design

Prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded interventional study.

Setting

Cardiac catheterization and echocardiography laboratories.

Subjects

Normal healthy volunteers (n = 12 group 1, n = 32 group 2).

Interventions

Pulmonary catheterization and radionuclide cineangiography (group 1) and volumetric echocardiography (group 2) during 3 L of normal saline infusion over 3 hrs.

Measurements and Main Results

In group 1, the initial pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure did not correlate significantly with initial end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes or cardiac performance (cardiac index and stroke volume index). Changes in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure following saline infusion also did not correlate with changes in end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes or cardiac performance. In contrast, initial end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes and changes in these ventricular volume indexes in response to 3 L of normal saline loading correlated well with initial stroke volume index and changes in stroke volume index, respectively. The relationship between left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and stroke volume index was confirmed in group 2 subjects using mathematically independent techniques to measure these variables. In addition, initial central venous pressure, right ventricular end-diastolic volume index, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index failed to correlate significantly with changes in cardiac performance in response to saline infusion in group 1 subjects.

Conclusions

Normal healthy volunteers demonstrate a lack of correlation between initial central venous pressure/pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and both end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes and stroke volume index. Similar results are found with respect to changes in these variables following volume infusion. In contrast, initial end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes and changes in end-diastolic ventricular volume indexes in response to saline loading correlate strongly with initial and postsaline loading changes in cardiac performance as measured by stroke volume index. These data suggest that the lack of correlation of these variables in specific patient groups described in other studies represents a more universal phenomenon that includes normal subjects. Neither central venous pressure nor pulmonary artery occlusion pressure appears to be a useful predictor of ventricular preload with respect to optimizing cardiac performance.

### Venous return and mean systemic filling pressure: physiology and clinical applications [^116TZcmS]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Venous return is the flow of blood from the systemic venous network towards the right heart. At steady state, venous return equals cardiac output, as the venous and arterial systems operate in series. However, unlike the arterial one, the venous network is a capacitive system with a high compliance. It includes a part of unstressed blood, which is a reservoir that can be recruited via sympathetic endogenous or exogenous stimulation. Guyton's model describes the three determinants of venous return: the mean systemic filling pressure, the right atrial pressure and the resistance to venous return. Recently, new methods have been developed to explore such determinants at the bedside. In this narrative review, after a reminder about Guyton's model and current methods used to investigate it, we emphasize how Guyton's physiology helps understand the effects on cardiac output of common treatments used in critically ill patients.

### Obesity, venous capacitance, and venous compliance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1151TEko]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Circulating blood volume is functionally divided between the unstressed volume, which fills the vascular space, and stressed blood volume (SBV), which generates vascular wall tension and intravascular pressure. With decreases in venous capacitance, blood functionally shifts to the SBV, increasing central venous pressure and pulmonary venous pressures. Obesity is associated with both elevated venous pressure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). To explore the mechanisms underlying this association, we evaluated relationships between blood volume distribution, venous compliance, and body mass in patients with and without HFpEF.

Methods and Results

Subjects with HFpEF (n = 62) and non-cardiac dyspnoea (NCD) (n = 79) underwent invasive haemodynamic exercise testing with echocardiography. SBV was estimated (eSBV) from measured haemodynamic variables fit to a comprehensive cardiovascular model. Compared to NCD, patients with HFpEF displayed a leftward-shifted central venous pressure-dimension relationship, indicating reduced venous compliance. eSBV was 81% higher at rest and 69% higher during exercise in HFpEF than NCD (both P < 0.0001), indicating reduced venous capacitance. Despite greater augmented eSBV with exercise, the increase in cardiac output was reduced in HFpEF, suggesting operation on the plateau of the Starling curve. Exercise eSBV was directly correlated with higher body mass index (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001) and inversely correlated with right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling (r = -0.57, all P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Patients with HFpEF display reductions in systemic venous compliance and increased eSBV related to reduced venous capacitance, abnormalities in right ventricular-pulmonary artery interaction, and increased body fat. These data provide new evidence supporting an important role of venous dysfunction in obesity-related HFpEF and suggest that therapies that improve venous function may hold promise to improve clinical status in this cohort.

### Recommendations for hemodynamic monitoring for critically ill children-expert consensus statement issued by the cardiovascular dynamics section of the European society of paediatric and neonatal intensive care (ESPNIC) [^114NnWk4]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Central venous pressure (CVP)

The committee shared a strong common opinion regarding CVP. CVP should be measured as accurately as possible and be evaluated only as part of multi-modal hemodynamic monitoring to assess the intravascular volume and cardiac function. Isolated CVP measurement is of limited value but trends of CVP, both the value and the wave morphology, or change in CVP in response to fluid or vasoactive therapy may provide useful information about the overall hemodynamic status and cardiovascular physiology in critically ill children. Specifically, a rise or high levels of CVP should be avoided. The committee agreed that CVP is not of great value in the initial treatment of critically ill children, but it can deliver important additional information in children with shock refractory to initial hemodynamic treatment; however, the use of CVP requires a good understanding of its limitations and pathophysiology of underlying disease process. For example, CVP should not be used as a sole parameter to guide fluid therapy.

Central venous oxygen saturation measurement

Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) approximates but does not equal mixed oxygen saturation (SmvO2). The normal ranges for ScvO2 and SmvO2 are 70–80% and 60–70%, respectively, in the setting of a normal aortic saturation. Trends between ScvO2 and SmvO2 are often interchangeable, although SmvO2 values are generally around 7–10% lower than ScvO2. A low ScvO 2 typically indicates a mismatch between oxygen supply and utilization. Conversely, a normal, or high ScvO 2 value, does not necessarily signify supply-demand adequacy, as tissue dysoxia (which may occur in sepsis) may cause an artificial elevation (or normalization) of ScvO 2. Lastly, ScvO2 in isolation cannot be considered a surrogate of cardiac index/cardiac output. However, there is some evidence that resuscitation in sepsis might be more beneficial when ScvO 2 is incorporated in the treatment strategy.

The committee agreed that ScvO 2 is an important parameter in unstable patients not responding to the first treatment and that its trend is helpful in hemodynamic management. However, we recommend that hemodynamic therapy should not be targeted solely based upon ScvO 2 levels (Table 2).

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^115ZdoKC]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The cardiac function curve, too, has a limit. This occurs because of the limit to cardiac filling due to restraint by the pericardium or, if there is no pericardium, by the cardiac cytoskeleton itself. In pathological situations mediastinal structures can also impose limits on cardiac filling. When cardiac filling is limited, increasing diastolic filling pressure does not increase stroke volume because there is no change in end-diastolic volume and thus no increase in sarcomere length. Under this condition cardiac output can only be increased by an increase in heart rate or cardiac contractility or by a decrease in afterload. When cardiac filling is limited, cardiac output is independent of changes in the venous return function.

Volume of Fluid

The major goals of intraoperative fluid resuscitations are optimizing intravascular volume to increase cardiac output and perfusion pressure in order to improve renal blood flow and glomerular function. Excessive fluid has also been shown to be associated with AKI; however, the cause-and-effect relationship between the two remains unclear. A further complexity is that positive fluid balance can be caused by a combination of increased administration, which is potentially modifiable, and decreased urine output, which could only be addressed through renal replacement therapy. Finally, the definitions of "liberal", "restrictive", and "traditional" fluid administration have evolved and can overlap across trials, requiring careful review of specific interventions when interpreting study results.

The Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial demonstrated that restrictive fluid resuscitation (goal, net zero fluid balance) protocol had a significantly higher rate of AKI when compared to the group receiving liberal fluid resuscitation (goal, reflective of traditional practice). This contrasts with the results from a randomized trial showing that restrictive fluid resuscitation (in combination with pre-emptive norepinephrine infusion) reduced postoperative complications (which included both renal failure and transient creatinine increase) and hospitalization after radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. In light of this clinical evidence, providers need to recognize that both hypovolemia and hypervolemia may be associated with AKI and adopt personalized management guided by physiologic endpoints. Assessment of euvolemia can be guided by judicious fluid challenges with frequent assessment of fluid responsiveness, hemodynamic homeostasis, and clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Intraoperative positional changes can function like a passive leg raise maneuvers, potentially revealing fluid responsiveness. Furthermore, assessment should prioritize dynamic markers (stroke volume, pulse pressure variation) rather static metrics (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) — which have been shown to be an unreliable predictor of fluid responsiveness.

Venous Congestion and Management of Central Venous Pressure

A variety of factors in the perioperative environment, including (1) positive pressure ventilation, (2) intravenous fluids, (3) transfusion, and (4) cardiopulmonary bypass, impact venous congestion and central venous pressure. While optimal volume status remains a complex topic, venous congestion has been associated with cardiac surgery–associated AKI in patients from the Statin AKI Cardiac Surgery trialand the Aortic To RAdial Pressure (ATRAP) Gradient Study. Furthermore, venous congestion was found to more accurately predict AKI than arterial hypotension in the latter population, although prospective studies are necessary to assess whether treatment strategies to alleviate venous congestion alter the development of postoperative AKI.

### Monitoring cardiac function in intensive care [^115NJcVT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Systolic cardiac function results from the interaction of four interdependent factors: heart rate, preload, contractility, and afterload. Heart rate can be quantified easily at the bedside, while preload estimation has traditionally relied on invasive pressure measurements, both central venous and pulmonary artery wedge. These have significant clinical limitations; however, adult literature has highlighted the superiority of several novel preload measures. Measurement of contractility and afterload is difficult; thus in clinical practice the bedside assessment of cardiac function is represented by cardiac output. A variety of techniques are now available for cardiac output measurement in the paediatric patient. This review summarises cardiac function and cardiac output measurement in terms of methodology, interpretation, and their contribution to the concepts of oxygen delivery and consumption in the critically ill child.

Ventricular function curves

Classic ventricular function curves

Starling function curves, or ventricular function curves, relate the input of the heart to output (Fig. 1). Any input and any output can be considered. For the heart we most frequently use right atrial pressure (central venous pressure) or left atrial pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) as clinically measurable inputs to the heart (preload). Cardiac output (blood flow out of the heart in liters per minute) is a common measure of output of the heart. Other inputs and outputs yield different but related ventricular function curves.

Fig. 1
This classic ventricular function curve relates input of the heart (end-diastolic pressure in mmHg) to output of the heart (cardiac output in liters per minute). The ventricular function curve shifts up and to the left when ventricular systolic contractility increases. However, increased diastolic compliance and decreased afterload can also shift the ventricular function curve up and to the left

As the preload of the heart increases, cardiac output increases — sometimes called Starling's law of the heart or the Frank–Starling relationship. This relationship is curvilinear (Fig. 1) so that, at high preload, further increases in preload yield diminishing increases in cardiac output. A specific ventricular function curve applies to a specific ventricular contractile state, diastolic compliance, and afterload. Using cardiac output as pump output, if ventricular contractility increases (at a constant afterload), then the ventricular function curve shifts up and to the left so that, at the same end-diastolic pressure (preload), a greater stroke volume and cardiac output is achieved (Fig. 1, dashed line). Improved ventricular diastolic compliance and decreased afterload (aortic pressure) also results in increased stroke volume (at a constant contractile state) so these changes also shift the ventricular function curve up.

### Right atrial pressure: determinant or result of change in venous return? [^1124aGJk]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

According to the concept of Guyton, cardiac output is largely controlled by venous return, which is determined by the difference between mean systemic venous pressure and right atrial pressure. In the analysis of the venous return curve, other authors have suggested that right atrial pressure is the dependent variable and venous return is the independent variable (right atrial pressure decreased because cardiac output increased). The present report analyzes this historical debate, which has already lasted > 50 years.

### Is venous congestion associated with reduced cerebral oxygenation and worse neurological outcome after cardiac arrest? [^115Dy3Js]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Patients

Forty-eight patients were included in the study. Mean age was 62 ± 13 years, 59% were male, 84% received bystander CPR, and 68% had a shockable rhythm. Cardiac output and filling pressures were continuously monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter in 39 patients and CVP was monitored by a deep vein catheter in the remaining 9 patients. Mean MAP was 77 ± 8 mmHg, mean mixed venous blood oxygen saturation (SVO 2) 67 ± 10%, mean cardiac output 3.7 ± 1.2 L/min, and mean CVP 10 ± 4 mmHg. A summary of the baseline characteristics is provided in Additional file 1.

CVP negatively affects SctO 2

The relationship between CVP and mean SctO 2 was best described by an S-shaped, third-degree polynomial regression curve (SctO₂ = −0.002 × CVP³ + 0.08 × CVP² − 1.07 × CVP + 69.78%, R² = 0.89, n = 1,949,108 data points), with low CVP (< 5 mmHg) being associated with normal SctO 2 values and high CVP (> 20 mmHg) being associated with cerebral desaturation (Fig. 1a). The relationship between simultaneously obtained MAP minus CVP pairs and mean SctO2 was also best described by an S-shaped, third-degree polynomial regression curve (SctO₂ = 0.0002 × (MAP−CVP)³ − 0.0445 × (MAP−CVP)² − 3.0959 × (MAP−CVP) − 5.7926%, R² = 0.91) (Fig. 1b).

### Left ventricular function: time-varying elastance and left ventricular aortic coupling [^113zGd4q]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Modified ventricular function curves

The motivation behind early studies of ventricular function curves was the desire to identify intrinsic ventricular contractile function. Classic Starling function curves shift down with increased afterload without a change in contractility of the heart. Therefore, modifications to ventricular function curves were considered. In some versions "output" was changed to stroke work or stroke work per minute (stroke power). Stroke work incorporates afterload since it is pressure afterload × stroke volume. In some versions "input" was changed to end-diastolic volume. This addressed the issue of non-linear diastolic compliance. Probably the zenith of modifications to ventricular function curves is the concept of preload recruitable stroke work. When stroke work is plotted against end-diastolic volume the relationship is highly linear and fairly insensitive to loading conditions. The slope of this relationship is a measure of ventricular contractility. These modified ventricular function curves are more specific for intrinsic ventricular contractile function but fall short of perfect. Because of different strengths and weaknesses, different variants of ventricular pump function inputs and outputs can be chosen strategically to address specific questions. In a clinical context central venous pressure (right ventricular end-diastolic pressure) and cardiac output are readily measurable and are often most appropriate.

### Is venous congestion associated with reduced cerebral oxygenation and worse neurological outcome after cardiac arrest? [^116UF6dq]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

After cardiac arrest (CA), patients with suboptimal brain oxygenation during their stay in the intensive care unit have a large cerebral penumbra and risk of secondary ischemic damage. Therefore, thorough knowledge of the physiological determinants of cerebral oxygen supply in the post-CA period is paramount for physicians taking care of these patients. We previously showed that mean arterial pressure (MAP), mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, hemoglobin, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2), and carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) are important determinants of cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO 2) measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Current hemodynamic post-CA guidelines focus on targeting an MAP of 65 mmHg, based on the assumption that this would result in optimal cerebral perfusion assuming normal cerebrovascular autoregulation. However, cerebral perfusion pressure equals MAP minus intracranial pressure (ICP). As it has been shown that there is a good correlation between ICP and central venous pressure (CVP), we hypothesized that there would be negative correlation between CVP and cerebral perfusion (venous cerebral congestion). In this way, cerebral oxygenation might be compromised in after CA, with elevated CVP due to right ventricular failure, fluid overload, mechanical positive pressure ventilation, or pulmonary disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between CVP, SctO 2 as assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and outcome after CA in patients under therapeutic hypothermia.

### Congestive renal failure: the pathophysiology and treatment of renal venous hypertension [^113rU3Hi]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Longstanding experimental evidence supports the role of renal venous hypertension in causing kidney dysfunction and "congestive renal failure". A focus has been heart failure, in which the cardiorenal syndrome may partly be due to high venous pressure, rather than traditional mechanisms involving low cardiac output. Analogous diseases are intra-abdominal hypertension and renal vein thrombosis. Proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms include reduced transglomerular pressure, elevated renal interstitial pressure, myogenic and neural reflexes, baroreceptor stimulation, activation of sympathetic nervous and renin angiotensin aldosterone systems, and enhanced proinflammatory pathways. Most clinical trials have addressed the underlying condition rather than venous hypertension per se. Interpreting the effects of therapeutic interventions on renal venous congestion are therefore problematic because of such confounders as changes in left ventricular function, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Nevertheless, there is preliminary evidence from small studies of intense medical therapy or extracorporeal ultrafiltration for heart failure that there can be changes to central venous pressure that correlate inversely with renal function, independently from the cardiac index. Larger more rigorous trials are needed to definitively establish under what circumstances conventional pharmacologic or ultrafiltration goals might best be directed toward central venous pressures rather than left ventricular or cardiac output parameters.

### Elevated central venous pressure is associated with increased mortality and acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: a meta-analysis [^113LUyZJ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Central venous pressure (CVP) is a local hemodynamic parameter determined by the interaction between venous return and cardiac function and used as a surrogate of intravascular volume. Therefore, CVP measurements are often applied for assessing volume status and volume responsiveness to guide fluid resuscitation at the bedside in critically ill patients. However, the validity of CVP in critical care settings has recently been challenged and the use of CVP measurements to direct volume management has been reported unreliable. Based on the rationale provided by the Starling curves and Guyton theory on cardiac function, high CVP may impede venous return to the heart and disturb microcirculatory blood flow which may harm organ function, lead to poor prognosis, and even increase mortality. Moreover, elevated CVP will particularly harm kidney hemodynamic and promote acute kidney injury (AKI) by imposing an increased "afterload" on the kidney. However, the association between CVP and mortality and AKI in critically ill patients remains unclear.

So far, previous studies have evaluated the association of CVP and mortality and AKI in critically ill patients but have shown inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association of elevated CVP and mortality and AKI in critically ill adult patients, hypothesizing that elevated CVP is associated with increased mortality and acute kidney injury in critically ill adult patients.

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^112EcrBP]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Resistance

Resistance accounts for the frictional loss of energy as blood flows through the vasculature and is calculated from the difference between the inflow pressure and the outflow pressure divided by the flow. The circulation can be considered to be divided into a series of compliant regions that go from one to another through a resistance. Under flow conditions, the pressure in each region is determined by the volume and compliance of that region. The right heart is fed by the large compliant venules and small veins. The pressure in this region is called mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) instead of MCFP, for it is only related to the volume in the systemic veins. MSFP must equal MCFP under the condition of no flow. Under normal flow conditions they usually are quite similar because the systemic veins dominate total compliance but, depending upon the relative functions of the right and left ventricles and changes in circuit resistances, MSFP can be either higher or lower than MCFP.

The working cardiac output, venous return, and right atrial pressure are determined by the interaction of the function of the heart, or cardiac function, and the function of venous drainage, i.e. venous return (Fig. 2). Arthur Guyton appreciated that this intersection value can easily be solved graphically by plotting right atrial pressure on the x-axis and flow on the y-axis (Fig. 3). In a series of animal experiments that allowed separation of the heart and circuit, Guyton and colleagues showed that progressively lowering right atrial pressure produces a linear increase in venous return up to a maximum value, which will be discussed later. The slope of this line is minus one over the resistance draining the veins and the x-intercept is MCFP. A plot of cardiac function on the same graph gives the intersection value of the two functions (Fig. 4). Note that the cardiac function curve starts from a negative value on the graph. This is because when the heart is empty its transmural pressure is equal to the surrounding pressure, which is pleural pressure and not atmospheric pressure. During spontaneous breathing pleural pressure is negative at end-expiration and at functional residual capacity.

### Venous function and central venous pressure: a physiologic story [^116Quzxt]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

The veins contain approximately 70% of total blood volume and are 30 times more compliant than arteries; therefore, changes in blood volume within the veins are associated with relatively small changes in venous pressure. The terms venous capacity, compliance, and stressed and unstressed volumes are defined. Decreases in flow into a vein are associated with decreases in intravenous pressure and volume, and vice versa. Changes in resistance in the small arteries and arterioles may affect venous return in opposite directions; this is explained by a two-compartment model: compliant (mainly splanchnic veins) and noncompliant (nonsplanchnic veins). Effects of intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures on venous return and central venous pressure as well as the value of central venous pressure as a diagnostic variable are discussed.

### Perioperative cardiovascular monitoring of high-risk patients: a consensus of 12 [^115nPNqa]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Central venous pressure

A central venous catheter (CVC) is often used for administration of fluids, vasopressors, and inotropes and for measurement of central venous pressure (CVP). Since transmural CVP is the only value related to right ventricular (RV) preload but is not commonly monitored, interpretation of CVP values must take into account intrathoracic pressure changes, which are largely influenced by mechanical ventilation. Thus, changes in CVP with concomitant CO variations give an indication of RV function and potential peripheral venous congestion, the latter of which is an important factor for organ perfusion. In addition, careful checking of the CVP wave may help to diagnose tricuspid regurgitation with a 'v' wave during systole. When the CVP is low (< 6 mm Hg) with a concomitant low CO, there is almost certainly some degree of hypovolemia. Although changes in CVP correlate poorly with changes in CO (as for pulmonary artery occlusion pressure), they can be used to assess the dynamic response to a fluid challenge and to diagnose severe hypovolemia or cardiac dysfunction or both, especially where other monitoring systems are not available.

### Central venous pressure and acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities: a large retrospective cohort study [^116QvfZf]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

A more thorough understanding enables revaluation of the interaction between CVP and AKI. As an indicator of cardiac preload and renal afterload, CVP is determined by the interaction between cardiac function and venous return. Decreased renal function would lead to more liquid retention and further increase the CVP. On the other hand, based on Guyton's theory, cardiac output equals venous return, and venous reflux is dependent on the mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) and CVP gradient. Specifically, extra fluid only increases CVP and tissue edema but does not significantly increase end-diastolic volume or stroke volume. When CVP was increased or MCFP was decreased, venous reflux was decreased; in contrast, venous reflux was increased when CVP was decreased or MCFP was increased. Therefore, lower CVP is necessary to ensure venous reflux and cardiac output when MCFP is in the flat part of the Starling curve. In fact, a healthy individual has a relatively low CVP. According to this theory, it is hypothesized that a high CVP is transmitted backward, increasing renal venous pressure, reducing renal perfusion pressure and increasing renal venous congestion, further leading to AKI.

### Venous return and mean systemic filling pressure: physiology and clinical applications [^111T6fMT]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The heart–lung interactions method

This method was developed in intubated patients by Maas and colleagues, who cleverly took advantage of heart–lung interactions. During an end-inspiratory hold, the intrathoracic pressure increases RAP (estimated through the CVP) and decreases cardiac output (a surrogate of venous return). In contrast, during an end-expiratory hold, RAP decreases and cardiac output increases (Fig. 3). Then, the pairs of CVP and cardiac output values are plotted on a graph (see Additional file 1). The regression line between these points estimates the venous return curve. Pmsf is estimated by the CVP value at intersection of the x-axis, and RVr is estimated as the inverse of the slope.

Fig. 3
Example of a venous return curve obtained by the heart–lung interactions method. In this example, end-expiratory and end-inspiratory holds were performed. The 4 pairs of values of central venous pressure and cardiac output obtained during these holds were plotted on a graph, with cardiac output on the y-axis and central venous pressure on the x-axis. The regression line of these points could be equated to the venous return curve. The mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf) was estimated as the pressure corresponding to the x-intercept of the extrapolated regression line. The resistance to venous return (RVr) was estimated as the inverse of the slope of the regression line

This method, of course, has limitations, even though it provides a qualitative assessment of the venous return curve determinants. It might be affected by the time delay between the arterial pulse pressure measurement and the venous return flow. Any error in the measurement of CVP may also introduce a large error in the estimation of the curve slope and in Pmsf. The method has also been suspected to overestimate Pmsf, and its accuracy may be influenced by the volume status.

The transient stop-flow arm method

This method reproduces the cardiac arrest method at the arm level. After a rapid occlusion through an arm cuff, the arterial and venous pressures measured downstream equilibrate at a pressure level which estimates Pmsf. This method has been validated in humans compared to the heart–lung interactions method. However, it might be limited by the fact that the venous compartment is less compliant in the muscle than in the splanchnic vascular bed, and the method may also be considered as more qualitative than quantitative.

### Central venous pressure and impaired renal function in children and young adults with cardiovascular disease [^115RreKA]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditionally, low cardiac output has been considered the primary hemodynamic driver of renal function and injury. Adult data suggest that central venous pressure (CVP) is a more important factor.

Objectives

The authors hypothesized that in children with cardiovascular disease, higher CVP predicts lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and worsening renal function (WRF).

Methods

We performed a single-center cohort study of patients aged 3 months to 21 years with biventricular circulation undergoing cardiac catheterization. Pearson's correlation and linear and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine associations with eGFR at the time of catheterization and WFR within 180 days after catheterization.

Results

312 patients had median age 7.9 years (IQR: 2.3 to 14.5 years), median eGFR 97 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (IQR: 81–118 mL/min/1.73 m 2), median CVP 7 mm Hg (IQR: 5–9 mm Hg), and median cardiac index 3.7 mL/min/m 2 (IQR: 2.9–4.6 mL/min/m 2). Nearly half (48%) were transplant recipients. In multivariable analysis, CVP was independently associated with eGFR (β = −2.65; 95% CI: −4.02, −1.28; P < 0.001), as was being a transplant recipient (β = −10.20; 95% CI: −17.74, −2.65; P = 0.008), while cardiac index was not. Fifty-one patients (16%) developed WRF. In a proportional hazards model adjusting for cardiac index, only higher CVP (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04–1.17; P = 0.002) and greater contrast volume by weight (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01–1.10; P = 0.021) predicted WRF. CVP ≥ 7 mm Hg likewise predicted WRF (HR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.29–5.12; P = 0.007).

Conclusions

Among children with a spectrum of cardiovascular disease, higher CVP is associated with lower eGFR and development of WRF, independent of cardiac index.

### Venous return and mean systemic filling pressure: physiology and clinical applications [^116rYmfu]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

What generates cardiac output?

One way to figure out cardiovascular system functioning is to think that it is the pressure produced by the left ventricle that generates flow and propels blood from the aorta towards the right atrium. This view is likely inaccurate.

According to Guyton's theory, cardiac output is primarily governed by venous inflow. Systemic blood flow is generated by the pressure difference between the veins and venules on the one hand and the right atrium on the other hand, with the heart emptying the right atrium and keeping the right atrial pressure (RAP) low (Fig. 1). Then, blood flow is created by emptying of the venous system, rather than by ejection into the arterial network.

Fig. 1
The three determinants of venous return. At equilibrium, cardiac output (CO) and venous return (VR) are similar. Venous return is the inflow of the right heart. Its three determinants are the mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf), the right atrial pressure (RAP) and the resistance to venous return (RVr) according to the formula: venous return = (Pmsf–RAP)/RVr. LV: left ventricle, RV: right ventricle

According to this theory, RAP, i.e. the backward pressure of venous flow, impedes venous return. Guyton postulated that there is a forward pressure that drives flow towards the right atrium, which is Pmsf. This pressure results from the elastic recoil potential stored in the walls of the veins.

In this regard, the role of the heart can be viewed as keeping a significant difference between Pmsf and RAP: the more potent the pump, the lower RAP, the larger the difference between Pmsf and RAP, and the higher the venous return. At each contraction, the heart empties the right ventricle, allowing the elastic recoil pressure in veins and venules to drain blood back to the right atrium. The blood volume that has been removed from the veins and venules to refill the right cavities is then added into the arterial network at the other side. The role of the left heart is to eject the blood towards the high-pressure circuit, to ensure distribution in the resistive system.

### Association of physical examination with pulmonary artery catheter parameters in acute lung injury [^111hRswf]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To correlate physical examination findings, central venous pressure, fluid output, and central venous oxygen saturation with pulmonary artery catheter parameters.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Data from the multicenter Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial of the National Institutes of Health Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network.

Patients

Five hundred thirteen patients with acute lung injury randomized to treatment with a pulmonary artery catheter.

Interventions

Correlation of physical examination findings (capillary refill time > 2 secs, knee mottling, or cool extremities), central venous pressure, fluid output, and central venous oxygen saturation with parameters from a pulmonary artery catheter.

Measurements

We determined association of baseline physical examination findings and on-study parameters of central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation with cardiac index < 2.5 L/min/m2 and mixed venous oxygen saturation < 60%. We determined correlation of baseline central venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation and predictive value of a low central venous oxygen saturation for a low mixed venous oxygen saturation.

Measurements and Main Results

Prevalence of cardiac index < 2.5 and mixed venous oxygen saturation < 60% was 8.1% and 15.5%, respectively. Baseline presence of all three physical examination findings had low sensitivity (12% and 8%), high specificity (98% and 99%), low positive predictive value (40% and 56%), but high negative predictive value (93% and 86%) for cardiac index < 2.5 and mixed venous oxygen saturation < 60%, respectively. Central venous oxygen saturation < 70% predicted a mixed venous oxygen saturation < 60% with a sensitivity 84%, specificity 70%, positive predictive value 31%, and negative predictive value of 96%. Low cardiac index correlated with cool extremities, high central venous pressure, and low 24-hr fluid output; and low mixed venous oxygen saturation correlated with knee mottling and high central venous pressure, but these correlations were not found to be clinically useful.

Conclusions

In this subset of patients with acute lung injury, there is a high prior probability that cardiac index and mixed venous oxygen saturation are normal and physical examination findings of ineffective circulation are not useful for predicting low cardiac index or mixed venous oxygen saturation. Central venous oxygen saturation < 70% does not accurately predict mixed venous oxygen saturation < 60%, but a central venous oxygen saturation ≥ 70% may be useful to exclude mixed venous oxygen saturation < 60%.

### Is venous congestion associated with reduced cerebral oxygenation and worse neurological outcome after cardiac arrest? [^113VDd3b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

CVP is more important than MAP as a determinant of SctO 2

Subsequently, all CVP-SctO 2 pairs were stratified according to the simultaneously obtained MAP (60–70 mmHg, 70–80 mmHg, 80–90 mmHg, 90–100 mmHg) (Fig. 2a). Multivariate linear regression revealed that CVP was a more important determinant of SctO 2 than MAP, without important interaction between MAP and CVP (SctO₂ = 0.01 × MAP − 0.20 × CVP + 0.001 × MAP × CVP + 65.55%). Only when MAP was high (90–100 mmHg, 18% of data points), was the negative influence of CVP on SctO 2 less pronounced.

The mean SctO 2 per mmHg CVP is shown after stratification of the data points according to the simultaneously obtained cardiac output (2.5–5 L/min, 5–7.5 L/min, > 7.5 L/min) (b)

Interaction between CVP and cardiac output as determinants of SctO 2

Subsequently, all CVP-SctO 2 pairs were stratified according to the simultaneously obtained cardiac output (2.5–5 L/min, 5–7.5 L/min, > 7.5 L/min) (Fig. 2b). Multivariate linear regression revealed that CVP and cardiac output are independent determinants of SctO 2, with some interaction between both (SctO₂ = 1.86 × CO − 0.09 × CVP − 0.05 × CO × CVP + 60.04%). When cardiac output was high (> 7.5 L/min, 4% of data points) there was no negative correlation between CVP and SctO 2.

### Right atrial pressure in the critically ill: how to measure, what is the value, what are the limitations? [^116EpwZM]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Right atrial pressure (P ra) is determined by the interaction of the function of the heart as a pump, which is called cardiac function, and the factors that determine the return of blood to the heart, which is called return function. Thus, monitoring P ra or its surrogate, central venous pressure (CVP), can give important insights into mechanisms behind changes in hemodynamic status, responses to interventions, and the likelihood of diagnoses. Examination of the components of the P ra tracing, especially during the ventilator cycle, can also give information about right-sided cardiac diastolic function, the status of the tricuspid valve, volume responsiveness, and the cardiac rhythm. Importantly, the pressure difference from the large venous reservoir to the heart is small, and thus great care must be taken with technical factors that affect the measurement.

### Central venous waveform analysis and cardiac output in a porcine model of endotoxemic hypotension and resuscitation [^113HoB3b]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac output (CO) is a valuable proxy for perfusion, and governs volume responsiveness during resuscitation from distributive shock. The underappreciated venous system has nuanced physiology that confers valuable hemodynamic information. In this investigation, deconvolution of the central venous waveform by the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) algorithm is performed to assess its ability to constitute a CO surrogate in a porcine model of endotoxemia-induced distributive hypotension and resuscitation.

Study Design

Ten pigs were anesthetized, catheterized, and intubated. A lipopolysaccharides infusion protocol was used to precipitate low systemic vascular resistance hypotension. Four crystalloid boluses (10 cc/kg) were then given in succession, after which heart rate, mean arterial pressure, thermodilution-derived CO, central venous pressure (CVP), and the central venous waveform were collected, the last undergoing fast Fourier transformation analysis. The amplitude of the fundamental frequency of the central venous waveform's cardiac wave (f0-CVP) was obtained. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, CVP, f0-CVP, and CO were plotted over the course of the boluses to determine whether f0-CVP tracked with CO better than the vital signs, or than CVP itself.

Results

Distributive hypotension to a 25% mean arterial pressure decrement was achieved, with decreased systemic vascular resistance (mean 918 ± 227 [SD] dyne/s/cm-5 vs 685 ± 180 dyne/s/cm-5; p = 0.038). Full hemodynamic parameters characterizing this model were reported. Slopes of linear regression lines of heart rate, mean arterial pressure, CVP, f0-CVP, and CO were -2.8, 1.7, 1.8, 0.40, and 0.35, respectively, demonstrating that f0-CVP values closely track with CO over the 4-bolus range.

Conclusions

Fast Fourier transformation analysis of the central venous waveform may allow real-time assessment of CO during resuscitation from distributive hypotension, possibly offering a venous-based approach to clinical estimation of volume responsiveness.

To further elucidate the factor(s) that account for the difference in hemodynamic response to exercise between normal subjects and patients with HFpEF, model parameters were set to those of the patients with HFpEF during exercise and were then adjusted to those of normal subjects during exercise; parameter values were first varied individually (Figure 5A through 5C) and then sequentially (Figure 5C through 5F). eSBV had the greatest individual impact on CVP; LV EDPVR, eSBV, and systemic vascular resistance had the largest impact on PCWP (in that order), and CO was mainly influenced by the LV EDPVR. As with the other analyses, the cumulative effects of serial changes of parameters were nonlinear. Both CVP and PCWP achieved values of the controls by the combined effects of adjusting eSBV and the LV EDPVR to those of the controls; CO was normalized by adjusting, almost exclusively, the LV EDPVR.

### ISHLT consensus statement: perioperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure undergoing surgery [^117BkENF]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

ISHLT consensus statement — central venous catheter (CVC) and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring notes that central venous catheter (CVC) access provides a secure route for administration of the vasopressors and inotropes that are frequently required and also allows for venous blood sampling to assess oxygen saturation as an index of cardiac output adequacy and CVP monitoring; when an introducer catheter (Cordis®) is used for monitoring, a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) can subsequently be added intraoperatively if needed; although the CVP itself may not be a reliable measure of RV preload in PAH patients perioperatively, it can be useful as an indicator of the coupling between RV function and venous return, and the sudden increase in CVP should trigger an urgent assessment of the cause, as it may signal impending RV decompensation; for most intermediate risk surgical cases, the combination of a CVC and arterial line can provide adequate intra- and postoperative monitoring capabilities.

### Volume responsiveness assessed by passive leg raising and a fluid challenge: a critical review focused on mean systemic filling pressure [^114U4rhK]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

This review applied cardiovascular principles relevant to the physiology of venous return in interpreting studies on the utility of a passive leg-raising manoeuvre to identify patients who do (responders) or do not respond to a subsequent intravenous volume challenge with an increase in cardiac output. Values for cardiac output, mean arterial and central venous pressure, and the calculated cardiovascular variables mean systemic filling pressure analogue, heart efficiency, cardiac power indexed by volume state and volume efficiency, before and after passive leg raising as well as before and after fluid volume challenge, were extracted from published studies. Eleven studies including 572 patients and 52% responders were analysed. Cardiac output increased by 12% in responders during passive leg raising and by 22% following a volume challenge. No statistically significant differences were found between responders and non-responders in cardiac output, mean arterial or central venous pressure before the passive leg-raising manoeuvre or the volume challenge. In contrast, the calculated mean (SD) systemic filling pressure analogue, reflecting the intravascular volume, was significantly lower in responders (14.2 (1.8) mmHg) than non-responders (17.5 (3.4) mmHg; p = 0.007) before the passive leg-raising manoeuvre, as well as before fluid volume challenge (14.6 (2.2) mmHg vs. 17.6 (3.5) mmHg, respectively; p = 0.02). The scalar measure volume efficiency was higher in responders at 0.35 compared with non-responders at 0.10. Non-responders also demonstrated deteriorating heart efficiency of -15% and cardiac power of -7% when given an intravenous fluid volume challenge. The results demonstrate that the calculation of mean systemic filling pressure analogue and derived variables can identify patients likely to respond to a fluid volume challenge and provides scalar results rather than merely a dichotomous outcome of responder or non-responder.

### Cardiac output response to norepinephrine in postoperative cardiac surgery patients: interpretation with venous return and cardiac function curves [^113dzfPK]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We studied the variable effects of norepinephrine infusion on cardiac output in postoperative cardiac surgical patients in whom norepinephrine increased mean arterial pressure. We hypothesized that the directional change in cardiac output would be determined by baseline cardiac function, as quantified by stroke volume variation, and the subsequent changes in mean systemic filling pressure and vasomotor tone.

Design

Intervention study.

Setting

ICU of a university hospital.

Patients

Sixteen mechanically ventilated postoperative cardiac surgery patients.

Interventions

Inspiratory holds were performed at baseline-1, during increased norepinephrine infusion, and baseline-2 conditions.

Measurements and Main Results

We measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume variation and, with use of inspiratory hold maneuvers, mean systemic filling pressure, then calculated resistance for venous return and systemic vascular resistance. Increasing norepinephrine by 0.04 ± 0.02 μg·kg·min increased mean arterial pressure 20 mm Hg in all patients. Cardiac output decreased in ten and increased in six patients. In all patients mean systemic filling pressure, systemic vascular resistance and resistance for venous return increased and stroke volume variation decreased. Resistance for venous return and systemic vascular resistance increased more (p = 0.019 and p = 0.002) in the patients with a cardiac output decrease. Heart rate decreased in the patients with a cardiac output decrease (p = 0.002) and was unchanged in the patients with a cardiac output increase. Baseline stroke volume variation was higher in those in whom cardiac output increased (14.4 ± 4.2% vs. 9.1 ± 2.4%, p = 0.012). Stroke volume variation > 8.7% predicted the increase in cardiac output to norepinephrine (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.900).

Conclusions

The change in cardiac output induced by norepinephrine is determined by the balance of volume recruitment (increase in mean systemic filling pressure), change in resistance for venous return, and baseline heart function. Furthermore, the response of cardiac output on norepinephrine can be predicted by baseline stroke volume variation.

### Breaking under pressure: cardiorenal syndrome and elevated central venous pressures in children with heart disease [^114gNV7m]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Transplant patients accounted for nearly half of the participants and had a lower eGFR than the remaining group. The importance of CVP to kidney injury suffered by transplant patients may differ from that of other pediatric cardiac diseases. These patients are exposed to a multitude of risk factors not experienced by other subgroups, including previous cardiopulmonary bypass, pre-existing kidney injuries from the pretransplant state, and nephrotoxic medications required for graft preservation. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a similar response with comparable trajectory and inflection points, and transplant status dropped from significance when placed in the multivariable model with CVP. This suggests that the CVP-CRS relationship did not differ in transplant recipients; however, consideration for the potential of sampling and selection bias is required.

There are significant challenges to using spot CVP measurements to investigate the role of venous congestion and kidney dysfunction. First, a single CVP measurement may fail to capture the true venous physiology as it is highly load-dependent, which may be significantly altered during catheterization (patients are fasted and on positive pressure ventilation). Second, catheterizations are invasive, and repeat investigations are unwarranted; as such, noninvasive measurements would be required to appreciate the impact of prolonged exposures and provide ongoing surveillance. Renal Doppler have recently been employed to measure vascular resistive indices, which have correlated well with worsening kidney function in postoperative cardiovascular surgical patients. Novel use of bioimpedance vector analysis may also show promise in assessing venous congestion at the bedside. Use of these or similar technologies can be easily implemented at the bedside and should be adopted in future study designs if they can be shown to correlate well with CVP measurements.

In summary, Olsen et alhave raised awareness about the potential deleterious impact of venous congestion and elevated CVP on acute and chronic renal function in pediatric cardiac patients. For children who fall within the restricted study inclusion, particularly following heart transplantation, routine catheterization may identify a high-risk subgroup that may benefit from closer surveillance and developing renal protective management strategies. These findings challenge the prevailing paradigm that renal function is determined primarily by cardiac output and will require validation through larger studies that include those with ventricular dysfunction and account for other sources of nephrotoxicity.

### Increase in central venous pressure during passive leg raising cannot detect preload unresponsiveness [^1163bjWM]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

By analogy with the classical central venous pressure rules to assess a fluid challenge, we hypothesized that an increase in central venous pressure greater than or equal to 5cm H2O (i.e., 4mm Hg) during passive leg raising can predict preload unresponsiveness diagnosed by the absence of increase in velocity-time integral of the left ventricular outflow tract greater than or equal to 10% during the test (negative passive leg raising test).

Design and Settings

Velocity-time integral was measured by transthoracic echocardiography. Central venous pressure and velocity-time integral were measured before and during passive leg raising.

Patients

Critically ill patients for whom the physician decided to test preload responsiveness by passive leg raising were prospectively included.

Measurement and Main Results

Fifty-seven set of measurements were performed in 50 patients. Preload unresponsiveness (negative passive leg raising test) was observed in 32 cases. The changes in central venous pressure during passive leg raising did not differ between positive passive leg raising cases (positive passive leg raising test) and negative passive leg raising test cases (3 ± 2 vs 3 ± 2mm Hg, respectively) and thus did not predict preload unresponsiveness (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.59). An increase in central venous pressure greater than or equal to 4mm Hg during passive leg raising was observed in 10 cases of positive passive leg raising test and in 11 cases of negative passive leg raising test. Taking an increase in central venous pressure greater than or equal to 3 or greater than or equal to 5mm Hg rather than greater than or equal to 4mm Hg during passive leg raising did not better allow one to identify negative passive leg raising test.

Conclusions

Marked increase in central venous pressure during passive leg raising cannot identify negative passive leg raising test cases and thus preload unresponsiveness. Measurements of cardiac output (or its surrogates) during passive leg raising are, thus, mandatory to appropriately interpret this test.

Results of the same analysis performed on data from the HFpEF groups are shown in Figure 4. Changes in CVP and PCWP were almost exclusively attributable to the rise of eSBV. In contrast to normal, the increase in CO was much more dependent on increases of HR, RV R es, and less influenced by eSBV, despite the fact that the increase of eSBV from rest to exercise was 2 times larger than in controls.

### Left ventricular function: time-varying elastance and left ventricular aortic coupling [^111X1Zn7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Interaction of the heart with venous blood flow returning to the heart

The pressure–volume characteristics of the ventricle mean that if more blood returns to the heart (more diastolic filling so a greater V ED), then the ventricle will still eject to the same ESPVR so that stroke volume will increase exactly as much as V ED increased. This gives the heart the basic characteristic that it will eject any amount of blood that flows back to it. This allows regulatory control of cardiac output to move to the peripheral circulation — a necessary feature because tissue hypoxia is best sensed by the peripheral vasculature where oxygen demand is occurring.

The factors governing venous return are illustrated in Fig. 8. When right atrial pressure equals mean systemic pressure there is no driving pressure gradient for blood flow back to the heart; thus, venous return is zero. As right atrial pressure is reduced the impediment to blood flow back to the heart decreases so that venous return rises approximately linearly. The slope of this venous return curve has units that are the inverse of a resistance — termed "resistance to venous return". When right atrial pressure is reduced to approximately zero the central veins collapse at the level of the diaphragm, limiting venous flow.

Fig. 8
Lowering right atrial pressure increases blood flow back to the heart — venous return. This venous return curve can be shifted, primarily by an increase in the x-axis intercept — mean systemic pressure. RVR resistance to venous return

It can be seen that venous return at any right atrial pressure can be increased by increasing mean systemic pressure or by decreasing resistance to venous return. Mean systemic pressure is a vascular compartment pressure that arises from venous blood volume distending the systemic veins. If the volume of the distensible venous compartment is increased, then mean systemic pressure increases. Alternatively, if the capacitance of the venous compartment decreases, say by catecholamine infusion or increased sympathetic tone, then the pressure within the venous compartment can increase without a change in volume.

In steady state the amount of blood returning to the heart must equal the amount of blood leaving the heart so that venous return must equal cardiac output. Indeed, stroke volume must, on average, equal "stroke return". Therefore, as illustrated in Fig. 9, the ventricular function curve and venous return curve can be plotted on the same set of axes. The intersection of the ventricular function curve and venous return curve give the value of steady state cardiac output and the value of steady state right atrial pressure.

### Venous return and mean systemic filling pressure: physiology and clinical applications [^116X359V]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Venous return plays a major role in cardiovascular physiology, and its determinants, Pmsf, RAP and RVr, are major haemodynamic variables. Guyton's model helps describe their interaction. While the determinants of venous return were for a long time examined only in animal studies, innovative methods have recently been developed to estimate them in critically ill patients. These methods have helped us understand the value of CVP in the assessment of the response to fluid. Also, the venous effect of norepinephrine has been clearly demonstrated during septic shock, thus advocating its administration along with fluids in hypotensive patients. Finally, venous return physiology explains the significant increase in cardiac preload during prone positioning.

### Occurrence of low cardiac index during normotensive periods in cardiac surgery: a prospective cohort study using continuous noninvasive cardiac output monitoring [^114wcshw]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuous cardiac output monitoring is not standard practice during cardiac surgery, even though patients are at substantial risk for systemic hypoperfusion. Thus, the frequency of low cardiac output during cardiac surgery is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study at a tertiary medical center from July 2021 to November 2023. Eligible patients were ≥ 18 undergoing isolated coronary bypass (CAB) surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Cardiac output indexed to body surface area (CI) was continuously recorded at 5-second intervals throughout surgery using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved noninvasive monitor from the arterial blood pressure waveform. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were also analyzed. Low CI was defined as < 2 L/min/m 2 and low MAP as < 65 mm Hg. We calculated time with low CI for each patient for the entire surgery, pre-CPB and post-CPB periods, and the proportion of time with low CI and normal MAP. We used Pearson correlation to evaluate the relationship between CI and MAP and paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests to assess the difference in correlations of CI with MAP before and after CPB.

Results

In total, 101 patients were analyzed (age [standard deviation, SD] 64.8 [9.8] years, 25% female). Total intraoperative time (mean [SD]) with low CI was 86.4 (62) minutes, with 61.2 (42) minutes of low CI pre-CPB and 25.2 (31) minutes post-CPB. Total intraoperative time with low CI and normal MAP was 66.5 (56) minutes, representing mean (SD) 69% (23%) of the total time with low CI; 45.8 (38) minutes occurred pre-CPB and 20.6 (27) minutes occurred post-CPB. Overall, the correlation (mean [SD]) between CI and MAP was 0.33 (0.31), and the correlation was significantly higher pre-CPB (0.53 [0.32]) than post-CPB (0.29 [0.28], 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference [0.18–0.34], P < .001); however, there was substantial heterogeneity among participants in correlations of CI with MAP before and after CPB. Secondary analyses that accounted for CVP did not alter the correlation between CI and MAP. Exploratory analyses suggested duration of low CI (C < 2 L/min/m 2) was associated with increased risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.09; 95% CI; 1.01–1.13; p = 0.018).

Conclusions

In a prospective cohort of patients undergoing CAB surgery, low CI was common even when blood pressure was normal. CI and MAP were correlated modestly. Correlation was higher before than after CPB with substantial heterogeneity among individuals. Future studies are needed to examine the independent relation of low CI to postoperative kidney injury and other adverse outcomes related to hypoperfusion.

### The effect of propofol on haemodynamics: cardiac output, venous return, mean systemic filling pressure, and vascular resistances [^116Y6fNH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although arterial hypotension occurs frequently with propofol use in humans, its effects on intravascular volume and vascular capacitance are uncertain. We hypothesized that propofol decreases vascular capacitance and therefore decreases stressed volume.

Methods

Cardiac output (CO) was measured using Modelflow(®) in 17 adult subjects after upper abdominal surgery. Mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) and vascular resistances were calculated using venous return curves constructed by measuring steady-state arterial and venous pressures and CO during inspiratory hold manoeuvres at increasing plateau pressures. Measurements were performed at three incremental levels of targeted blood propofol concentrations.

Results

Mean blood propofol concentrations for the three targeted levels were 3.0, 4.5, and 6.5 µg ml(-1). Mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, MSFP, venous return pressure, Rv, systemic arterial resistance, and resistance of the systemic circulation decreased, stroke volume variation increased, and CO was not significantly different as propofol concentration increased.

Conclusions

An increase in propofol concentration within the therapeutic range causes a decrease in vascular stressed volume without a change in CO. The absence of an effect of propofol on CO can be explained by the balance between the decrease in effective, or stressed, volume (as determined by MSFP), the decrease in resistance for venous return, and slightly improved heart function.

### Correlation of central venous-arterial and mixed venous-arterial carbon dioxide tension gradient with cardiac output during neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position [^112sWZWY]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The study was conducted to evaluate the correlation of central venous-arterial and mixed venous-arterial pCO(2) gradient with cardiac output in patients being operated in the sitting position.

Methods

Fifty-one patients, aged 41–69 years, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II and III, scheduled to undergo elective neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position, were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Simultaneous blood gas samples from arterial, central venous and pulmonary artery catheters were collected at four different time points during supine and sitting position. Cardiac index (CI) determination was accomplished simultaneously, with continuous cardiac output technique. The mixed venous-arterial pCO(2) and central venous-arterial pCO(2) gradients were calculated and related to CI at the specific time points, thus a total of 204 points of comparison were obtained.

Results

Changing from the supine to the sitting position induced a significant deterioration of CI, right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure. The mean delta pCO(2) difference (bias) in the four time points ranged between -0.07 and -0.27. The upper (1.59–1.71 mmHg) and lower limits of agreement (-2.16 to -1.82 mmHg) were quite narrow, suggesting an acceptable overall agreement between the mixed and central venous pCO(2) differences. The coefficient of determination (R(2)) between the venous-arterial pCO(2) and CI for mixed and central venous circulations was 0.830 and 0.760 (P < 0.001 for both), respectively. In contrast, R(2) values between mixed and central venous oxygen saturation values and CI were 0.324 and 0.286, respectively (P < 0.001 for both), illustrating a rather weak relationship.

Conclusion

It seems that venous-arterial pCO(2) values obtained from mixed and central venous circulations can be reliably interchanged in estimating CI in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position. Thus, central venous-arterial pCO(2) gradient could serve as a useful and simple method for estimating cardiac performance, in which further invasive monitoring is not strongly indicated.

### Clinical review: guyton – the role of mean circulatory filling pressure and right atrial pressure in controlling cardiac output [^117JGqfL]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Arthur Guyton's concepts of the determinative role of right heart filling in cardiac output continue to be controversial. This paper reviews his seminal experiments in detail and clarifies the often confusing concepts underpinning his model. One primary criticism of Guyton's model is that the parameters describing venous return had not been measured in a functioning cardiovascular system in humans. Thus, concerns have been expressed in regard to the ability of Guyton's simplistic model, with few parameters, to model the complex human circulation. Further concerns have been raised in regard to the artificial experimental preparations that Guyton used. Recently reported measurements in humans support Guyton's theoretical and animal work.

### Variability in the physiologic response to fluid bolus in pediatric patients following cardiac surgery [^116kA1Pd]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid boluses aiming to improve the cardiac output and oxygen delivery are commonly administered in children with shock. An increased mean arterial pressure in addition to resolution of tachycardia and improved peripheral perfusion are often monitored as clinical surrogates for improvement in cardiac output. The objective of our study is to describe changes in cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, and their relationship to other indices of cardiovascular performance.

Objective

The objective of our study is to describe changes in cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, and their relationship to other indices of cardiovascular performance.

Design, Setting, Patients, and Interventions

We prospectively analyzed hemodynamic data from children in the cardiac ICU who received fluid bolus (10mL/kg of Ringers-Lactate over 30 min) for management of shock and/or hypoperfusion within 12h of cardiac surgery. Cardiac index responders and mean arterial pressure-responders were defined as CI ≥ 10% and mean arterial pressure ≥ 10%, respectively. We evaluated the gradient for venous-return (mean systemic filling pressure-central venous pressure), arterial load properties (systemic vascular resistance index and elastance index) and changes in vasopressor support after fluid bolus.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifty-seven children between 1 month and 16 years (median Risk adjustment after congenital heart surgery Model for Outcome Surveillance in Australia and New Zealand score of 3.8 (interquartile range 3.7–4.6) received fluid bolus. Cardiac index-responsiveness and mean arterial pressure-responsiveness rates were 33% and 56%, respectively. No significant correlation was observed between changes in mean arterial pressure and cardiac index (r = 0.035, p = 0.79). Although the mean systemic filling pressure - central venous pressure and the number of cardiac index-responders after fluid bolus were similar, the arterial load parameters did not change in mean arterial pressure-nonresponders. Forty-three patients (75%) had a change in Vasoactive-Inotrope Score after the fluid bolus, of whom 60% received higher level of vasoactive support.

Conclusions

The mean arterial pressure response to fluid bolus in cardiac ICU patients was unpredictable with a poor relationship between cardiac index-responsiveness and mean arterial pressure-responsiveness. Because arterial hypotension is frequently a trigger for administering fluids and changes in blood pressure are commonly used for tracking changes in cardiac output, we suggest a cautious and individualized approach to repeat fluid bolus based solely on lack of mean arterial pressure response to the initial fluid, since the implications include decreased arterial tone even if the cardiac index increases.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^115fLWoS]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy: Heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) and systolic blood pressure alone are poor indicators of fluid status, and dynamic measures have demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy at predicting fluid responsiveness, including passive leg raising with cardiac output (CO) measurement and stroke volume (SV)–based fluid challenges. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy was associated with reduced mortality (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.83), ICU length of stay (MD -1.16 days; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.36), and duration of mechanical ventilation (-2.98 hours; 95% CI, -5.08 to -0.89), although another meta-analysis found no significant difference in mortality versus standard resuscitative strategies. An RCT in Zambia using protocolized IV fluids guided by jugular venous pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen saturation only led to more fluids in the first 6 hours (median 3.5 L [IQR, 2.7–4.0] versus 2.0 L [IQR, 1.0–2.5]) and higher hospital mortality (48.1% versus 33%) than standard care.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^115f1hUw]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Fluid responsiveness

Only half of the ICU patients with hemodynamic instability are able to "respond" to fluid loading, which is explained by the shape of the Frank–Starling curve. On the initial and steep limb of the curve, the stroke volume is highly dependent on preload: Administering fluid will actually result in a significant increase in stroke volume. In contrast, if the heart is working on the terminal and flat portion of the Frank–Starling curve, it cannot utilize any preload reserve and fluid administration will not significantly increase stroke volume. Accordingly, predictors of volume responsiveness are mandatory to distinguish between patients who can benefit from fluid and those in whom fluid is useless and hence deleterious.
Static markers of cardiac preload

Considering the Frank–Starling relationship, the response to volume infusion is more likely to occur when the ventricular preload is low, rather than when it is high. Unfortunately, none of the measures of cardiac preload enables to accurately predict fluid responsiveness: Neither the central venous pressure (CVP), the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), nor the left ventricular end-diastolic area (LVEDA) can discriminate between responders and non-responders to fluid therapy. Only the right ventricular and the global end-diastolic volume have been proven to be of some benefit compared to barometric preload indicators especially in patients with increased intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal pressures.
2 Dynamic markers of volume responsiveness

The alternative method for predicting volume responsiveness is simply to induce a change in cardiac preload and to observe the resulting effects on stroke volume or cardiac output or any available surrogate, i.e. to perform a "functional assessment" of the cardiac function. This is achieved with intravenous fluid boluses. This method can be criticized because repeated infusions of such amounts could eventually exert adverse effects if there is no preload reserve, especially if pulmonary permeability was increased.

### Clinical review: positive end-expiratory pressure and cardiac output [^112ZFVZT]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with acute lung injury, high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be necessary to maintain or restore oxygenation, despite the fact that 'aggressive' mechanical ventilation can markedly affect cardiac function in a complex and often unpredictable fashion. As heart rate usually does not change with PEEP, the entire fall in cardiac output is a consequence of a reduction in left ventricular stroke volume (SV). PEEP-induced changes in cardiac output are analyzed, therefore, in terms of changes in SV and its determinants (preload, afterload, contractility and ventricular compliance). Mechanical ventilation with PEEP, like any other active or passive ventilatory maneuver, primarily affects cardiac function by changing lung volume and intrathoracic pressure. In order to describe the direct cardiocirculatory consequences of respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation and PEEP, this review will focus on the effects of changes in lung volume, factors controlling venous return, the diastolic interactions between the ventricles and the effects of intrathoracic pressure on cardiac function, specifically left ventricular function. Finally, the hemodynamic consequences of PEEP in patients with heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome are discussed.

### Venous return and mean systemic filling pressure: physiology and clinical applications [^116tSmVu]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

What are the typical patterns of venous return determinants during common clinical situations?

Hypovolaemic shock

During hypovolaemia, the stressed blood volume decreases along with the total blood volume. Pmsf decreases whereas RVr is not modified (Fig. 4 A). The equilibrium point moves to the bottom left, and the line shifts to the left without changing its slope. In the case of preload responsiveness, venous return and cardiac output decrease. In the case of hypotension, this phenomenon is quickly counteracted by the sympathetic stimulation, which recruits the physiological reserve of unstressed blood volume, acting like a "self-volume expansion".

Fig. 4
Effects on venous return and its determinants of typical clinical situations. A Hypovolaemic shock. Hypovolaemia decreases the stressed volume and therefore the mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf). Then, the gradient between Pmsf and right atrial pressure (RAP) decreases, while the resistance to venous return (RVr) is not modified. As a consequence, the equilibrium point is shifted to the bottom left, and cardiac output (CO) and venous return decrease. B Cardiogenic shock. The slope of the Frank–Starling curve decreases. The equilibrium point is shifted to the bottom right, following the new, flattened, Frank–Starling curve. Right atrial pressure (RAP) increases, whereas mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf) and resistance to venous return (RVr) are not modified. The (Pmsf–RAP) gradient decreases, reducing venous return and cardiac output (CO). C Septic shock. Vasodilation increases the venous capacitance, which decreases mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf). Consequently, the gradient between Pmsf and right atrial pressure (RAP) decreases. Resistance to venous return (RVr) may also decrease. As a consequence, venous return and cardiac output (CO) decrease. A "hyperdynamic state", with increased cardiac contractility, may steepen the Frank–Starling curve, while septic myocardial dysfunction may flatten it. Dashed lines and the index "1" indicate the normal state. Solid lines and the index "2" correspond to the pathological state

### Changes in central venous-to-arterial PCOdifference and central venous oxygen saturation as markers to define fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients: a pot-hoc analysis of a multi-center prospective study [^112KBr4e]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Applying the modified Fick method to CO 2 shows that the difference between mixed venous blood CO 2 content (CCO 2) and arterial blood CO 2 content depends on the cardiac output and total CO 2 production. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the primary role of decreased tissue blood flow in the increased PCO 2 gap. A high PCO 2 gap (> 6 mmHg) reflects that blood flow is not sufficiently high to wash out the CO 2 produced by the tissues, and it is a marker of tissue hypoperfusion. Interestingly, persistent high P(v–a)CO 2 levels (> 6 mmHg) were associated with poor outcomes, and it has been suggested that P(v–a)CO 2 might be an interesting target for resuscitation in critically ill patients.

A few studies have investigated the behaviors of P(v–a)CO 2 after VE. In 42 critically ill patients, Pierrakos et al. observed that VE decreased high P(v–a)CO 2 levels independently of pre-infusion CI. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the relationship between baseline P(v–a)CO 2 and FR. We found that baseline P(v–a)CO 2 was a poor predictor of FR. Also, the proportions of fluid responders did not significantly differ among the different baseline P(v–a)CO 2 values (Fig. 2). Interestingly, between 35.3 and 43.6% of patients with high to very high baseline P(v–a)CO 2 values did not respond to VE. On the other hand, 50% of patients with very low baseline P(v–a)CO 2 values still responded to VE by increasing their CI > 15% (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that even extreme baseline P(v–a)CO 2 values cannot be used to predict FR in critically ill patients and the decision of VE should not be based only on P(v–a)CO 2 levels. Different mechanisms can explain this phenomenon.

### Stroke volume variation versus central venous pressure… [^111stJcG]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

The liver is a highly vascular organ with minimal vascular resistance, receiving up to 25% of cardiac output and pooling 20% of the splanchnic blood. Hepatic veins are a common source of venous hemorrhage. The pressure in the hepatic veins is directly correlated with the pressure in the vena cava and reducing cardiac preload results in decreased hepatic vein congestion. Central venous pressure was the static parameter used to indicate the right ventricular end-diastolic volume index and was believed to be correlated with volume status. Despite this, central venous pressure did not reliably predict preload responsiveness due to the curvilinear shape of the ventricular pressure-volume curve, which indicates a poor relationship between ventricular filling pressure and volume. Additionally, the placement of a central venous catheter could lead to serious complications such as arterial cannulation, pneumothorax, and infection.

Arterial waveform analysis is dynamic hemodynamic monitoring based on the interaction between the heart and lungs in patients with mechanical ventilation. Stroke volume variation is one aspect of arterial pressure waveform analysis and is a less invasive alternative technique for guiding preload status and fluid management in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. It is used to assess volume status and enable optimal fluid management under positive pressure ventilation in high-risk surgical patients. Moreover, arterial pressure waveform analysis is superior to central venous pressure monitoring in terms of predicting volume responsiveness. Several studies have shown the benefits of SVV guidance during the intraoperative period in mechanically ventilated patients, including improved hemodynamic stability, decreased serum lactate levels, a lower incidence of postoperative complications, and shortened hospital stays.

The utilization of stroke volume variation for guiding fluid therapy in liver resection has been reported. Central venous pressure monitoring was found to correlate significantly with SVV values during liver resection, demonstrating that a CVP of 3 mmHg correlated with an SVV of 13%, while a CVP of -1 to 1 mmHg corresponded to an SVV of 18–21%. Maintaining a high stroke volume variation of 10–20% as the target value during the restrictive phase has been shown to result in significantly lower amounts of intraoperative blood loss compared to patients maintained with a central venous pressure of less than 5 mmHg. Moreover, previous publications have shown that a high SVV compared to a low SVV reduces blood loss during liver resection.

### Central venous pressure… [^117GZTr8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Central venous pressure determinations, although an extremely valuable tool in assessing the relationship between blood volume, cardiac competence, and vascular tone, 1 often is misleading. This has been demonstrated in a recent study of the hemodynamic status of 20 patients with difficult problems of fluid management, as reported in a recent issue of the Archives of Surgery.
2. A prime reason for misinterpretation of central venous pressure determinations is the failure to realize that a "family" of ventricular function curves exists, one for each circulatory state. Each curve expresses a constant relationship between ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ventricular stroke work. Thus a given increment in venous return in a failing heart will result in a smaller increment in ventricular stroke work than in a normal or supranormal state of myocardial activity.

If the myocardium is compromised, a specific central venous pressure will be associated with a smaller. CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE. JAMA. 1967; 202:
