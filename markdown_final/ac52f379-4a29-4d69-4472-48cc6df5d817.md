## Question

What are the 5 Hs and 5 Ts cardiac resuscitation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the 5 Hs and 5 Ts of cardiac resuscitation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative source for the mnemonic. Then, I should verify the exact items included in the 5 Hs and 5 Ts. Next, I will consider common variations and why they exist. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, accurate list and note any caveats or exceptions that might change practice in special circumstances.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative source. The most current, definitive listing of reversible causes during adult cardiac arrest is in the 2025 American Heart Association Advanced Life Support guidelines, which explicitly enumerate the Hs and Ts as part of intra-arrest management, and this is the reference I should anchor to for accuracy [^978d18db] [^2fb951bd].

> Now, I will extract the 5 Hs. Wait, let me verify each one against the guideline text to avoid misremembering. The 2025 AHA ALS guidance lists hypovolemia, hypoxia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypo-/hyperkalemia, and hypothermia as the five Hs to consider and treat during cardiac arrest, which aligns with longstanding teaching and prior iterations of ACLS algorithms [^978d18db] [^2fb951bd].

> Next, I should confirm the 5 Ts. Hold on, I should verify the exact wording. The same AHA sources list tension pneumothorax, tamponade (cardiac), toxins, thrombosis (pulmonary), and thrombosis (coronary) as the five Ts, which matches the classic mnemonic structure used in resuscitation training and protocols [^978d18db] [^2fb951bd].

> But wait, what if someone mentions a different version with four Hs and four Ts, or includes additional items like trauma or electrolytes broadly. Let me consider variations. Some contemporary summaries and specialty contexts compress the mnemonic to four Hs and four Ts by grouping electrolyte disturbances and sometimes adding trauma as a separate category, yet the AHA ALS guidance continues to teach five Hs and five Ts as the standard set of reversible causes to actively search for and treat during cardiac arrest, so I should preserve that canonical list while acknowledging that practice variations exist in certain settings [^978d18db] [^2fb951bd] [^d83fbe84].

> I should double-check that I'm not omitting anything critical. The AHA's enumeration is consistent across the 2025 ALS updates and remains the reference standard for intra-arrest reversible cause assessment, so the final, concise list is as follows: the 5 Hs are hypovolemia, hypoxia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypo-/hyperkalemia, and hypothermia; the 5 Ts are tension pneumothorax, tamponade (cardiac), toxins, thrombosis (pulmonary), and thrombosis (coronary) [^978d18db] [^2fb951bd].

---

The 5 Hs and 5 Ts are the **reversible causes of cardiac arrest** that must be rapidly identified and treated during resuscitation [^978d18db]. The 5 Hs are **hypovolemia, hypoxia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypo/hyperkalemia, and hypothermia**; the 5 Ts are **tension pneumothorax, tamponade (cardiac), toxins, thrombosis (pulmonary), and thrombosis (coronary)** [^2fb951bd]. These causes are **common and treatable**, and addressing them can restore circulation and improve outcomes [^6c5e5e4a].

## Clinical significance

The 5 Hs and 5 Ts are **essential for rapid diagnosis and treatment** of reversible causes of cardiac arrest [^978d18db]. Early recognition and targeted therapy can restore circulation, improve survival, and reduce neurological injury [^6c5e5e4a]. They are integral to ACLS training and resuscitation protocols worldwide [^1e9b93fb].

The established teaching on advanced life support courses is to consider the reversible causes of IHCA in terms of the Hs and Ts. However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that included 27,102 patients documented the most prevalent causes of IHCA to be hypoxia, acute coronary syndrome, hypovolemia, arrhythmias, infection and heart failure (see Fig. 1). Three of these (arrhythmia, infection and heart failure) are not included among the traditional Hs and Ts.

Reversible causes and adjunctive assessment in LVAD-related emergencies emphasize that a detailed search for reversible causes (5 Hs and 5 Ts) should be undertaken, and caution is advised in evaluating PETCO2 in nonintubated patients or when a supraglottic airway is used to ventilate because these may cause falsely elevated readings. When available, additional evaluation tools such as point-of-care echocardiography and Doppler blood flow can be considered, and assessment of flow in the carotid or femoral arteries via Doppler may represent an alternative method to check for blood flow in patients with MCS.

### Causes of perioperative cardiac arrest: mnemonic, classification, monitoring, and actions [^4f7469fe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Perioperative cardiac arrest (POCA) is a catastrophic complication that requires immediate recognition and correction of the underlying cause to improve patient outcomes. While the hypoxia, hypovolemia, hydrogen ions (acidosis), hypo-/hyperkalemia, and hypothermia (Hs) and toxins, tamponade (cardiac), tension pneumothorax, thrombosis (pulmonary), and thrombosis (coronary) (Ts) mnemonic is a valuable tool for rapid differential diagnosis, it does not cover all possible causes leading to POCA. To address this limitation, we propose using the preload-contractility-afterload-rate and rhythm (PCARR) construct to categorize POCA, which is comprehensive, systemic, and physiologically logical. We provide evidence for each component in the PCARR construct and emphasize that it complements the Hs and Ts mnemonic rather than replacing it. Furthermore, we discuss the significance of utilizing monitored variables such as electrocardiography, pulse oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and blood pressure to identify clues to the underlying cause of POCA. To aid in investigating POCA causes, we suggest the Anesthetic care, Surgery, Echocardiography, Relevant Check and History (A-SERCH) list of actions. We recommend combining the Hs and Ts mnemonic, the PCARR construct, monitoring, and the A-SERCH list of actions in a rational manner to investigate POCA causes. These proposals require real-world testing to assess their feasibility.

Other "Hs" and "Ts" as Reversible Causes

The patient had acutely worsening hypoxia, leading up to and at the time of the cardiac arrest. However, this was likely secondary to another primary pathology, given that he did not have return of spontaneous circulation with bag mask ventilation or ETT intubation. A panel of metabolic tests before the cardiac arrest did not show elevated anion gap or deranged carbon dioxide (Table 1), which would have suggested significant acidosis or intravascular hypovolemia as inciting events. Controlled ventilation, sodium bicarbonate, and administration of IV fluid boluses did not reverse the event. He did not have hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, or hypothermia before the arrest; and inpatient toxin exposure would have been unlikely.

Regarding specific circumstances for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to patients with accidental hypothermia, WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to perform immediate, high-quality CPR in patients with hypothermia and cardiac arrest. Perform delayed or intermittent CPR if immediate and continuous CPR is impossible or unsafe. Do not delay compressions for > 10 minutes, a conservative interval based on the uncontrolled nature of the out-of-hospital hypothermic cardiac arrest. Perform compressions for a minimum of 5 minutes with interruptions between periods of compressions < 5 minutes, if continuous CPR is not possible.

Knowledge gaps and priorities of research — special circumstances of resuscitation remain under-studied. Cardiac arrest and life-threatening states due to special circumstances are vastly under-researched, and the writing group reviewed a large amount of literature but faced a lack of data in many areas; with some exceptions, these cardiac arrests are rare and challenging to study. As a result, the majority of guideline recommendations were based on low-grade evidence (LOE C), and some critical knowledge gaps identified by the writing group are summarized in Table 5.

### CPADS-30: mastering the first 30 seconds of adult cardiac arrest resuscitation [^d719330e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Considerations for clinical implementation and future directions

In summary, CPADS-30 is a simplified mental framework and memory mnemonic designed to assist code leaders during the first 30 s of cardiac resuscitation. CPADS-30 is not intended to be a comprehensive roadmap for cardiac resuscitation. On the contrary, this mnemonic intends to distill down critical early actions of cardiac arrest management into a discreet, digestible schematic that complements the complete ACLS algorithm. Notably, this mnemonic is not intended for use in children, as pediatric cardiac arrest resuscitations have special considerations. We hope that this tool can be utilized by pre-hospital providers and clinicians in all hospital settings. While we expect that CPADS-30 will prove most useful to trainees and early-career providers, we believe that it will bring value to clinicians regardless of level of training. While this tool was developed by consensus discussion from four clinical content experts in cardiac arrest resuscitation, future refinements of this mnemonic would benefit from more objective development methods (i.e. Delphi technique). Future studies will assess whether CPADS-30 can improve important process measures such as time-to-defibrillation or important outcome measures such as ROSC or survival to hospital discharge.

### Part 10: adult and pediatric special circumstances of resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^3e09d71c]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

American Heart Association 2025 — Adults with life-threatening environmental hypothermia (core temperature < 30 °C [86 °F]) — For adults with life-threatening environmental hypothermia with no obvious lethal injury, full resuscitative measures should be performed immediately and continued concurrently with rewarming. It is reasonable to rewarm adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest using ECLS. It is reasonable to use prognostication scores to guide the decision for initiating ECLS rewarming for adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest. It may be reasonable to rewarm adults with environmental hypothermia (core temperature < 28 °C [82.4 °F]) and not in cardiac arrest using ECLS. For adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest, it may be reasonable to defibrillate once and if unsuccessful, defer further defibrillation until the core temperature is ≥ 30 °C (86 °F). It may be reasonable to rewarm adults with life-threatening environmental hypothermia with ECLS at a rate of 1.5–5 °C/hour (2.7–9 °F/hour). It may be reasonable to defer administration of epinephrine until the core temperature is ≥ 30 °C (86 °F) for adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest. If standard CPR is not possible due to environmental conditions, it may be reasonable to perform delayed or intermittent CPR during the resuscitation of adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest to facilitate rapid extraction. It may be reasonable to transport adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest to a center with ECLS capability if it can be reached within 6 hours. It is not recommended to use end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) to predict outcomes for adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest.

### Questions remain about targeted temperature management in cardiac arrest [^7e69d219]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

For decades, targeted temperature management (TTM) has been a promising intervention for mitigating brain damage after cardiac arrest. Early landmark studies of TTM for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) with shockable rhythms showed benefits in mortality and neurologic outcome. 1,2 On the basis of these results, TTM was established as standard practice and was given a class I recommendation in the 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care for use in OHCA with initial shockable rhythms, as well as a class IIb recommendation in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms and for in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs). 3.

### Relationship between time to target temperature and outcome in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest [^9c0994a9]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- In cardiac arrest managed with therapeutic hypothermia after resuscitation, reaching the 34°C target faster retrospectively predicts a poor neurologic outcome.

- A faster decline in body temperature may indicate a more severe ischemic insult with impaired thermoregulation and thus predicts a worse outcome.

- Prospective studies should address whether this finding is simply a marker for a more severe insult or whether controlling the rate of cooling can favorably alter outcome.

### Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation systems of care: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^7a68e582]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association previously recommended implementation of cardiac resuscitation systems of care that consist of interconnected community, emergency medical services, and hospital efforts to measure and improve the process of care and outcome for patients with cardiac arrest. In addition, the American Heart Association proposed a national process to develop and implement evidence-based guidelines for cardiac resuscitation systems of care. Significant experience has been gained with implementing these systems, and new evidence has accumulated. This update describes recent advances in the science of cardiac resuscitation systems and evidence of their effectiveness, as well as recent progress in dissemination and implementation throughout the United States. Emphasis is placed on evidence published since the original recommendations (ie, including and since 2010).

### Temperature control after cardiac arrest [^6221ebaa]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac arrest ranks among the most important causes of mortality worldwide. In the USA, almost 90 individuals per 100,000 population are resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) has been estimated to be between 0.6 and 5 events per 1000 patient admissions. More than two-thirds of patients resuscitated from OHCA, and about one-quarter of those resuscitated from IHCA die of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). Temperature control has been the most widely studied among the strategies for reducing the severity of HIBI. The present review summarizes the experimental and clinical evidence, the most recent recommendations, and future research directions regarding the use of temperature control after cardiac arrest.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^abdbcdd9]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Accidental hypothermia — delayed, intermittent, and prolonged CPR: Immediate, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed for a hypothermic patient in cardiac arrest; if it is impossible or unsafe to perform immediate and continuous CPR, rescuers should perform delayed or intermittent CPR, and compressions will ideally not be delayed for longer than 10 min (Evidence grade: 1C). If CPR cannot be performed continuously, compressions should be performed for a minimum of 5 min, with interruptions between periods of compressions that should not exceed 5 min (Evidence grade: 1C), and with properly performed compressions it takes an estimated 5 min of cerebral oxygenation to overcome the ischemic threshold. Documented cases show full neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest as long as 9 h 48 min in persons who did not have asphyxia before hypothermia and resuscitation with good neurologic status after as long as 6 h 30 min of CPR; case reports include CPR not started for 15 min after a monitored arrest, CPR started 70 min after rescue, and evacuation using 1-min periods of CPR alternating with 1-min periods without CPR.

### Termination of resuscitation rules for in-hospital cardiac arrest… [^1651064b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In this prognostic study, 5 termination of resuscitation rules were developed and validated in 23 952 patients from Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. The best-performing rule included 4 variables and predicted 30-day mortality with a false-positive rate of 0. 6% and a positive rate of 11%. Meaning These termination of resuscitation rules may aid decision-making during resuscitation. Importance There are no validated decision rules for terminating resuscitation during in-hospital cardiac arrest. Decision rules may guide termination and prevent inappropriate early termination of resuscitation. Objective To develop and validate termination of resuscitation rules for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Six variables were considered based on their bedside availability. Prognostic metrics were computed for all possible variable combinations. CIs were obtained using bootstrapping. Rules with a false-positive rate below 1% and a positive rate of more than 10% were considered appropriate. Of 53 864 possible termination rules, 5 were identified as relevant for clinical use. The best performing rule included 4 variables. The rule proposed termination in 110 per 1000 cardiac arrests and predicted 30-day mortality incorrectly in 6 per 1000 cases.

All 5 rules performed similarly across all 3 cohorts. Conclusions and Relevance In this prognostic study, 5 termination of resuscitation rules were developed and validated for in-hospital cardiac arrest. The best performing rule had a low false-positive rate and a reasonable positive rate in all national cohorts. These termination of resuscitation rules may aid decision-making during resuscitation.

### Comparison of different techniques for in microgravity-a simple mathematic estimation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality for space environment [^105da8a7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Since astronauts are selected carefully, are usually young, and are intensively observed before and during training, relevant medical problems are rare. Nevertheless, there is a certain risk for a cardiac arrest in space requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Up to now, there are 5 known techniques to perform CPR in microgravity. The aim of the present study was to analyze different techniques for CPR during microgravity about quality of CPR.

Material and Methods

To identify relevant publications on CPR quality in microgravity, a systematic analysis with defined searching criteria was performed in the PubMed database (http://www.pubmed.com). For analysis, the keywords ("reanimation" or "CPR" or "resuscitation") and ("space" or "microgravity" or "weightlessness") and the specific names of the techniques ("Standard-technique" or "Straddling-manoeuvre" or "Reverse-bear-hug-technique" or "Evetts-Russomano-technique" or "Hand-stand-technique") were used. To compare quality and effectiveness of different techniques, we used the compression product (CP), a mathematical estimation for cardiac output.

Results

Using the predefined keywords for literature search, 4 different publications were identified (parabolic flight or under simulated conditions on earth) dealing with CPR efforts in microgravity and giving specific numbers. No study was performed under real-space conditions. Regarding compression depth, the handstand (HS) technique as well as the reverse bear hug (RBH) technique met parameters of the guidelines for CPR in 1G environments best (HS ratio, 0.91 ± 0.07; RBH ratio, 0.82 ± 0.13). Concerning compression rate, 4 of 5 techniques reached the required compression rate (ratio: HS, 1.08 ± 0.11; Evetts-Russomano [ER], 1.01 ± 0.06; standard side straddle, 1.00 ± 0.03; and straddling maneuver, 1.03 ± 0.12). The RBH method did not meet the required criteria (0.89 ± 0.09). The HS method showed the highest cardiac output (69.3% above the required CP), followed by the ER technique (33.0% above the required CP).

Conclusions

Concerning CPR quality, the HS seems to be most effective to treat a cardiac arrest. In some environmental conditions where this technique cannot be used, the ER technique is a good alternative because CPR quality is only slightly lower.

### Cardiac arrest resuscitation [^d2449b7e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a dynamic disease that tests the multitasking and leadership abilities of emergency physicians. Providers must simultaneously manage the logistics of resuscitation while searching for the cause of cardiac arrest. The astute clinician will also realize that he or she is orchestrating only one portion of a larger series of events, each of which directly affects patient outcomes. Resuscitation science is rapidly evolving, and emergency providers must be familiar with the latest evidence and controversies surrounding resuscitative techniques. This article reviews evidence, discusses controversies, and offers strategies to provide quality cardiac arrest resuscitation.

### Is faster still better in therapeutic hypothermia? [^fc6c9205]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The rapid institution of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest has become an accepted practice. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Haugk and colleagues present a retrospective analysis of 13 years of experience with therapeutic hypothermia at their center that suggests an association between rate of cooling and less favorable neurological outcomes. The association most likely reflects easier cooling in patients more severely brain injured by their initial cardiac arrest, and should not lead clinicians to abandon or slow their efforts to achieve post-resuscitative cooling.

This 19-year-old adolescent male with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis sustained a PEA arrest requiring ECMO cannulation to regain circulation on postoperative day 3 following uneventful OLTx. In this context, the approach involves identifying reversible causes of cardiac arrest, the so-called four "Hs" and four "Ts" (i.e. hypoxia, hypokalemia/hyperkalemia, hypothermia/hyperthermia, hypovolemia, tension pneumothorax, tamponade, thrombosis, and toxins). In our patient, attention was focused on the following causes.

Acute Pericardial Tamponade

Despite the patient's history of autoimmune disease, he did not have risk factors for pericardial disease, and TTE did not demonstrate a pericardial effusion.

Acute Tension Pneumothorax

Even though the patient's demographics, including male sex and adolescent age, increased his risk for a spontaneous primary pneumothorax, the chest radiograph obtained after cardiorespiratory deterioration (Fig. 1) did not show pneumothorax. Bilateral breath sounds and symmetric chest rise were appreciated following ETT intubation at the beginning of CPR. Repeat chest radiograph during CPR did not show pneumothorax.

Acute Pulmonary Embolism

The patient had multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism, including his postoperative status, immobility, hepatic venous anastomosis with known inferior vena cava-caudate dissection and manipulation, and inflammatory bowel disease. He also had refractory thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 6,000 cells/μL immediately prior to the arrest, which may have been indicative of consumption secondary to thrombosis of the portal vein or other organs. However, his history of portal hypertension and hypersplenism were also plausible explanations for his thrombocytopenia.

Our patient was too unstable for transport to CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation perfusion scanning, and we concluded that acute pulmonary embolism was unlikely. However, there was evidence of RV strain on TTE, but no pulmonary embolus was seen at the bifurcation or proximal aspect of the bilateral branch pulmonary arteries (Fig. 2 A). In addition, abdominal US on the day of his cardiac arrest showed normal and patent vascular anastomoses with no thrombus.

### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: the science behind the hands [^2975799c]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite significant advances in resuscitation science since the initial use of external chest compressions in humans nearly 60 years ago, there continues to be wide variability in rates of successful resuscitation across communities. The American Heart Association (AHA) and European Resuscitation Council emphasise the importance of high-quality chest compressions as the foundation of resuscitation care. We review the physiological basis for the association between chest compression quality and clinical outcomes and the scientific basis for the AHA's key metrics for high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Finally, we highlight that implementation of strategies that promote effective chest compressions can improve outcomes in all patients with cardiac arrest.

### Determinants of heat generation in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest [^6087bd2a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Heat generation is independently associated with neurologic outcome in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest, and shows a strong association with initial illness severity. Markers of better baseline health and reduced ischemic injury were associated with greater heat generation. Our findings demonstrate one potential reason for the inability to translate more rapid cooling to improved clinical outcomes and provide a means to control for this important confounding variable in future clinical trials.

There are approximately 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests annually in the United States, with survival rates of approximately 5% to 10% and 24%, respectively. The critical factors that have an impact on cardiac arrest survival include prompt recognition and activation of prehospital care, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and rapid defibrillation. Advanced life support protocols are continually refined to optimize intracardiac arrest management and improve survival with favorable neurologic outcome. This article focuses on current treatment recommendations for adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest, with emphasis on the latest evidence and controversies regarding intracardiac arrest management.

### Caring for two: management of the critically ill cardiac patient during pregnancy [^808aba9b]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest of the pregnant patient

A 2023 study reported that 13.4/100,000 maternal admissions to hospital result in cardiac arrest, with survivors suffering from significant morbidity. Ninety-five percent of maternal deaths following cardiac arrest worldwide (287,000 cases/year) are found in low- and middle-income countries.

Management of the pregnant patient follows similar principles as a nonpregnant patient. Standard drug dosing and algorithms for shockable and nonshockable rhythms during advanced cardiac life support is recommended. There are 3 unique considerations which differ from recommendations highlighted in the most recent guidelines. First, to mitigate aortocaval compression by the uterus, manual left uterine displacement is recommended during the entire resuscitation period in patients where fundal height is above the umbilicus or if gestational age is > 20 weeks. The cardiopulmonary resuscitation force in this position is superior to the left lateral tilt position (reduced to 80%). Given there are multiple factors for aortocaval compression, including weight and number of fetus(es) and weight of amniotic fluid and relationship of the fetus to the patient's vascular anatomy, the team may consider left uterine displacement in patients < 20 weeks gestational age. Second, an expanded differential diagnosis of the etiology of the cardiac arrest needs to be considered. Beyond the traditional "7 H's and 5 T's" which include hypoxia, hypovolemia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypoglycemia, hypo/hyperkalemia, hypothermia, tension pneumothorax, tamponade, thrombosis (cardiac and pulmonary), and toxins, others should be considered. These can be recalled using the mnemonic A to H, which include Anesthesia complications (accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic), Bleeding (surgical or obstetrical), Cardiovascular (valvular, cardiomyopathy), Drugs, Embolic (pulmonary, amniotic fluid, air), Fever, General H's and T's, and Hypertension ([pre]-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome). Lastly, resuscitative hysterectomy should be considered at 4 minutes if return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is not achieved with fetal delivery at 5 minutes. Resuscitative measures should be ongoing and uninterrupted to minimize fetal neurological sequelae. Multiple meta-analyses have shown that maternal and fetal outcomes are worse as time progresses postcardiac arrest, without a clear benefit if delivery occurs within 5 minutes, suggesting that early delivery is ideal, but no time is too late. Delivery of the fetus could optimize hemodynamics to achieve ROSC and may be needed to treat the etiology of the cardiac arrest. If ROSC is not achieved, VA-ECMO can be used during the postpartum period, if expertise is available (Figure 1). In a recent meta-analysis of 358 patients who received VA-ECMO during the antepartum, peripartum, and postpartum period, cardiac arrest was the indication for cannulation in 57 patients (15%) of cases. In this subset, 50 patients (87.7%) survived. If ROSC is achieved, postarrest care considerations in the comatose patient include avoidance of hypothermia (targeting a temperature of 36–37.5 °C for up to 72 hours, and multimodality neuroprognostication at 48 hours following ROSC. It is important that the critical care teams are educated about these unique considerations for the pregnant patient.

Hemodilution to Hb 3.7 g/dL (Hb crit of the RS-group)

As compensation for hemodilution, cardiac index (CI) increased by 46 to 60% in all groups (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Consistently, stroke volume index (SVI) and heart rate (HR) increased by 24 to 40% and 14 to 18%, respectively. While the increases in SVI were significant in the TS-group, GEL-, and RS-groups, the increase in HR was not significant in any group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 11 to 21% in the GEL-, HS- and RS-groups (non-significant) and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) decreased in all groups by 35 to 46% (P < 0.05 vs. baseline), while mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) increased by 22 to 50% (P < 0.05 vs. baseline in the GEL-, HS and RS-group). Stroke volume variation (SVV) remained unchanged in the RS-group and tended to decrease in the TS- and GEL-groups. In the HS-group, the decrease in SVV was statistically significant. Compared with baseline, ITBV index (ITBVI) increased in all groups (P < 0.05), reflecting increased venous return to the heart. The ITBVI was higher in animals hemodiluted with TS or HS than after fluid replacement with RS (P < 0.05). As a consequence of hemodilution, DO 2 I decreased by 14 to 30% in all groups (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Moreover, the pH-value and base excess (BE) decreased significantly in the GEL-, HS- and RS-groups. As the protocol was terminated at the onset of the critical DO 2, lactate concentration was not yet elevated at this time point (see Table 3). The EVLW index (EVLWI) was significantly increased in the RS-group (P < 0.05 vs. baseline and P < 0.05 vs. GEL-, HS- and TS-groups, see Figure 3). Consistently, arterial oxygen partial pressure (paO 2) was decreased in the RS-group (P < 0.05 vs. baseline and P < 0.05 vs. GEL-, HS- and TS-groups).

The Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest Collaborators suggested that HRQoL could be assessed at 180 days or 1 year or both, and consensus among IHCA Utstein collaborators was that HRQoL measurements are ideally measured at 12 months.

Advanced cardiac life support — CPR performance and reversible causes emphasize high-quality compressions and minimizing pauses during pulseless arrest: The initial actions are "BLS algorithm: Call for help, give CPR
- Give oxygen
- Attach monitor/defibrillator". Perform compressions to "Push hard and fast (100/min)", ensure "full chest recoil", and "Minimize interruptions in chest compressions". Define cycles as "One cycle of CPR: 30 compressions then 2 breaths; 5 cycles approx. 2 min". Establish "IV/IO access", secure the airway, and after an advanced airway is placed, "give 8 to 10 breaths/min without pausing compressions, avoid hyperventilation". A starred note specifies, " NOTE: After an advanced airway is placed, give about 2 min of CPR (instead of 5 cycles)". During CPR, "Secure and search for contributing factors: – Hypovolemia – Hypoxia – Hydrogen ion (acidosis) – Hypo-/hyperkalemia – Hypoglycemia – Hypothermia – Toxins – Tamponade, cardiac – Tension pneumothorax – Thrombosis (coronary or pulmonary) – Trauma".

### Cardiac arrest in special populations [^5b0381e4]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

In certain cardiac arrest situations, modifications to current cardiac resuscitation algorithms may improve patient outcome. These situations are often rare, but when they occur they house the potential for severe time and resource use, and in some cases specialized skill sets. The decision to apply these modifications to standard care for the cardiac arrest patient may be obvious in some cases or may be applied due to suspicion from the presenting medical history, history of present illness, or physical examination. However, with rare exception, general care of any cardiac arrest patient should include continuous high-quality chest compressions and appropriate airway and ventillatory management.

### Therapeutic mild hypothermia improves early outcomes in rabbits subjected to traumatic uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock [^eada3d6d]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Survival benefits of mild hypothermia in animals suffering from uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (HS) may be influenced by trauma severity. We hypothesized that mild hypothermia would improve early outcomes based on our rabbit model of severe traumatic HS.

Materials and Methods

Fifty male New Zealand rabbits weighing between 1.6 and 2.2 kg were randomized into one of the five groups: group 1 (sham), group 2 (37°C/80 mm Hg), group 3 (37°C/40 mm Hg), group 4 (34°C/80 mm Hg), and group 5 (34°C/40 mm Hg). Under urethane anesthesia, animals that suffered fractures and uncontrolled HS received prehospital fluid resuscitation (aggressive or limited) with temperature controlled at normothermia or mild hypothermia, hemostasis, and hospital resuscitation followed by observation.

Results

Mild hypothermia significantly improved cardiac systolic function and decreased lung wet-to-dry weight ratios and total injury score compared with normothermia. Group 5 manifested the best results in lung injury. The decreased base excess and pH and increased lactate levels during HS and limited fluid resuscitation were not exacerbated by mild hypothermia. Electrolytes including potassium and calcium and blood glucose levels as well as coagulation were not significantly influenced after mild hypothermia treatment. Seven-hour survival in the hypothermic groups was higher than that in the normothermic groups, although there was no significant difference in survival between groups 5 and 3.

Conclusions

Therapeutic mild hypothermia improves early outcomes through improving lung and cardiac performance without causing evident homeostasis disturbances in the rabbit model of traumatic uncontrolled HS. Animals may benefit most under the combination treatment with mild hypothermia and limited fluid resuscitation.

2 Clinical content expert assessment

Four clinical content experts in adult cardiac arrest resuscitation independently reviewed the literature for the effectiveness and timing of ACLS interventions in adult cardiac arrest, with a focus on identifying tasks most strongly associated with patient-centered outcomes and those most closely aligned with existing ACLS protocols. Each content expert was asked to generate a list of five critical tasks to be included in the mnemonic. Next, clinical experts met to discuss their lists, and the final ranked list was approved by consensus discussion. We then incorporated our ranked list into a mnemonic using principles of cognitive load theory, including chunking, serial recall, and the primacy effect. The final mnemonic, which aimed to assign five critical tasks in the first 30 s of cardiac arrest resuscitation, was named "CPADS-30". These tasks are described further below.

"In the United States, hypothermia is responsible for ≈1300 deaths annually". "Heat loss occurs through 4 methods: conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation". "Hypothermia occurs when the core body temperature drops below the normal temperature range near 37°C", and individuals may be "'cold' or 'cold stressed' with temperatures of 35°C to 37°C". "Mild hypothermia begins when the core temperature falls below 35°C". Rewarming "may use passive measures… or active measures", and these recommendations "are not applicable to infants < 60 days of age and to cardiac arrest in all age groups". A literature search was performed in 2023.

### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in special circumstances [^6c5e5e4a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation prioritises treatment for cardiac arrests from a primary cardiac cause, which make up the majority of treated cardiac arrests. Early chest compressions and, when indicated, a defibrillation shock from a bystander give the best chance of survival with a good neurological status. Cardiac arrest can also be caused by special circumstances, such as asphyxia, trauma, pulmonary embolism, accidental hypothermia, anaphylaxis, or COVID-19, and during pregnancy or perioperatively. Cardiac arrests in these circumstances represent an increasing proportion of all treated cardiac arrests, often have a preventable cause, and require additional interventions to correct a reversible cause during resuscitation. The evidence for treating these conditions is mostly of low or very low certainty and further studies are needed. Irrespective of the cause, treatments for cardiac arrest are time sensitive and most effective when given early-every minute counts.

Cardiac arrest process elements — core data — include "the date and time of cardiac arrest, event location (the predefined locations and the number of options can be determined locally), whether the event was witnessed, and whether the resuscitation team was called", plus whether monitoring was in place ("electrocardiographic monitoring" or "pulse oximetry"), the "first documented rhythm", defibrillator use, and whether "shocks or chest compressions were given". "The final core item is use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR)", defined as "the application of rapid-deployment venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, usually by peripheral cannulation, to provide circulatory support in patients in whom conventional CPR is unsuccessful in achieving sustained ROSC", with sustained ROSC "deemed to have occurred when chest compressions are not required for 20 consecutive minutes and signs of circulation persist". "Nine supplemental cardiac arrest process elements are included"; "Ideally, the timing of these interventions (eg, drugs, airway) should be documented"; "The duration of resuscitation is strongly associated with worse outcome" producing "resuscitation time bias"; and "The CPR quality element should include an indication of whether data are being used for real-time feedback or for quality assurance review".

Recommendations for pregnant patients in cardiac arrest — core actions (items 1–5): Resuscitative delivery is indicated for a pregnant patient in cardiac arrest when fundal height is at or above the umbilicus and ROSC is not achieved with standard resuscitation (COR 1, LOE B-NR). Preparation for resuscitative delivery for a pregnant patient in cardiac arrest should begin at the recognition of cardiac arrest, with the goal to complete delivery by 5 minutes (COR 1, LOE B-NR). Resuscitative delivery for a pregnant patient with IHCA should be performed at the location of the arrest, without attempts to move the pregnant patient into the operating room (COR 1, LOE C-LD). Manual left lateral uterine displacement should be provided in conjunction with chest compressions for a pregnant patient in cardiac arrest when the fundal height is at or above the umbilicus (COR 1, LOE C-LD). Airway management should be prioritized during the resuscitation of a pregnant patient in cardiac arrest (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

### SCAI clinical expert consensus statement on the classification of cardiogenic shock: this document was endorsed by the American college of cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) in April 2019 [^ad5a8bdf]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). High credibility.

SCAI cardiogenic shock classification — stage definitions A–E organize patients into five stages with explicit clinical thresholds and escalation criteria. Stage A "At risk" for cardiogenic shock (CS) describes a patient who is not experiencing signs or symptoms of CS but is at risk for its development. Stage B "Beginning" (pre-shock/compensated) involves relative hypotension or tachycardia without hypoperfusion, with hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg OR mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg or > 30 mmHg drop from baseline. Stage C "Classic" CS has hypoperfusion requiring initial interventions beyond volume resuscitation and typically presents with mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) ≤ 60 mmHg or systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg. Stage D "Deteriorating" or "Doom" CS is failure to stabilize despite intensive initial efforts; classification requires appropriate treatment/medical stabilization and at least 30 minutes have elapsed without resolution of hypotension or end-organ hypoperfusion, with escalation defined as increasing the number or intensity of intravenous therapies or adding mechanical circulatory support. Stage E "Extremis" CS denotes circulatory collapse, frequently (but not always) in refractory cardiac arrest with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or support by multiple simultaneous acute interventions including ECMO-facilitated CPR (eCPR).

### Personalizing temperature targets after cardiac arrest: our neurologically driven approach [^2d181c51]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia

During CA, cessation of perfusion causes cerebral ischemia and neuronal death, potentiated by reperfusion injury after ROSC. Hyperthermia after CA is associated with higher mortality. Hypothermia mitigates ischemic-hypoxic and reperfusion injuries by reducing cerebral metabolism and excitotoxicity, inhibiting free radicals, and potentially reversing neuronal damage. It is thus plausible that patients with more severe neurological injury may benefit from cooling at lower temperatures. However, questions remain regarding optimal use of TTM-HT, including whether lower temperatures truly benefit critically ill patients, ideal temperature targets, and whether aggressive cooling benefits certain populations or exposes others to unnecessary risk compared to less aggressive cooling.

### Therapeutic hypothermia: past, present, and future [^c98dac8c]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest causes devastating neurologic morbidity and mortality. The preservation of the brain function is the final goal of resuscitation. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been considered as an effective method for reducing ischemic injury of the brain. The therapeutic use of hypothermia has been utilized for millennia, and over the last 50 years has been routinely employed in the operating room. TH gained recognition in the past 6 years as a neuroprotective agent in victims of cardiac arrest after two large, randomized, prospective clinical trials demonstrated its benefits in the postresuscitation setting. Extensive research has been done at the cellular and molecular levels and in animal models. There are a number of proposed applications of TH, including traumatic brain injury, acute encephalitis, stroke, neonatal hypoxemia, and near-drowning, among others. Several devices are being designed with the purpose of decreasing temperature at a fast and steady rate, and trying to avoid potential complications. This article reviews the historical development of TH, and its current indications, methods of induction, and potential future.

### Too cold may not be so cool: spontaneous hypothermia as a marker of poor outcome after cardiac arrest [^69fe08f0]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In a recent issue of Critical Care, den Hartog and colleagues show an association between spontaneous hypothermia, defined by an admission body temperature < 35°C, and poor outcome in patients with coma after cardiac arrest (CA) treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Given that TH alters neurological prognostication, studies aiming to identify early markers of injury severity and outcome are welcome, since they may contribute overall to optimize the management of comatose CA patients. This study provides an important message to clinicians involved in post-resuscitation care and raises important questions that need to be taken into account in future studies.

### Effects of hypertonic saline on myocardial blood flow in a porcine model of prolonged cardiac arrest [^da633265]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of hypertonic saline (HS) on myocardial reperfusion pressure (MPP) and blood flow (MBF), and cardiac index (CI) during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Methods

In 21 domestic swine (16–23 kg) open chest cardiac massage was initiated after 10 min of ventricular fibrillation. With the onset of CPR animals randomly received HS (7.2%; 2 ml/kg per 10 min or 4 ml/kg per 20 min) or normal saline ((NS); 2 ml/kg per 10 min). Haemodynamic variables were monitored continuously, and coloured microspheres were used to measure MBF and CI before cardiac arrest (CA), during CPR and 5, 30 and 120 min after the return of spontaneous circulation.

Results

During CPR HS significantly increased MPP, MBF, and CI in comparison to NS (P < 0.05, resp. MANOVA). Doubling the volume of HS did not improve the haemodynamic effects seen after application of 2 ml/kg per 10 min. HS-infusion significantly increased the survival rate at 120 min, 6/7 and 5/7 animals receiving 2 ml/kg per 10 min or 4 ml/kg per 20 min versus 2/7 after NS-infusion (P < 0.05, chi(2)-test).

Conclusions

HS applied during open chest cardiac massage enhanced MBF and CI, and significantly increased resuscitation success and survival rate. The positive effects of this promising new approach need to be confirmed in clinical studies.

### 2005 AHA guidelines for CPR and emergency cardiac care… [^4f935a05]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The new guidelines are based on the work of eight task forces that addressed specific areas of resuscitation science: basic life support, advanced life support, acute coronary syndromes, life support for children, neonatal life support, stroke, first aid, and education. These groups used an evidence-based approach to classify the recommendations for CPR and emergency cardiac care. The guidelines also present 12 algorithms covering the essential assessments and interventions for cardiac arrest and other life-threatening conditions. compressions and two breaths; on arrival of a defibrillator or AED, check for a shockable rhythm; give one shock, then resume CPR for another five cycles, or if no shock is indicated, continue another five cycles of CPR before rechecking the rhythm.

Health care professionals are to check for a pulse after the initial breaths and continue with one rescue breath every five or six seconds if there is a pulse, but this step is not recommended for lay rescuers. 1ppIV19–34 The new algorithm emphasizes minimizing interruptions to chest compressions to maximize the benefits of compressions: shocks are to be given singly with immediate resumption of CPR rather than as stacked shocks; pulse checks are minimized; and when interventions such as medications or an advanced airway are needed, the emphasis is on minimizing interruptions to CPR. One notable exception is that for an unwitnessed arrest, health care professionals may provide five cycles of CPR before attempting defibrillation; this approach was shown to improve survival rates in two clinical studies.

It is thought that for a heart in prolonged fibrillatory arrest, these initial cycles of CPR may help by providing fresh blood flow to cardiac cells that have depleted their local supplies of oxygen and nutrients, thus increasing the likelihood of a stable rhythm following the defibrillatory shock. The guidelines continue to emphasize that cardiac arrest in children is most often the end result of respiratory arrest. Thus, in contrast to adult CPR recommendations, a lone rescuer for an unresponsive child should begin with five cycles of 30 compressions and two breaths, then activate the emergency medical services system. This approach is thought to optimize the chances for quick resuscitation of children with primary respiratory arrest, before complete cardiopulmonary arrest occurs.

### International consensus on evidence gaps and research opportunities in extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop [^880bded5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

RO rank 3: Share ELSO data variables from these 2 expanded US registries with ELSO through a partnership agreement to enhance the North American contribution to this international registry.
5 Gap: There is a lack of reliable data on the number of people experiencing cardiac arrest who may benefit from ECPR‐facilitated resuscitation.
6 Gap: Defined resuscitation techniques and diagnostic tools are needed to increase the number of identified patients who may benefit from ECPR.

RO rank 4: Evaluate and refine the recommended consensus population of patients with OHCA (Table 2) most likely to benefit.

RO rank 5: Identify and validate innovative tools beyond Utstein characteristics for identifying patients with OHCA without severe neurological injury who may be excellent ECPR candidates.

RO rank 6: Develop and test innovative ways to measure CPR‐driven perfusion to adjust CPR technique and minimize or avoid neurological injury during CPR before ECPR initiation.
7 Gap: Well‐designed clinical efficacy trials in a variety of communities with optimized basic life support and advanced cardiac life support systems to evaluate ECPR‐facilitated systems of care are needed. Whether this should include a large multicenter trial was controversial, with some in favor believing more patient data were desirable, and others suggesting a multicenter trial was unnecessary given the results of the 3 published randomized trials.

RO rank 7: Establish core performance metrics, time intervals, and treatment guidelines for adding ECPR to a system of care for OHCA and IHCA resuscitation.

RO rank 8: Conduct well‐designed efficacy trials across multiple institutions and systems of care where the control arm of OHCA is established and can maintain a regionally optimized survival rate for this community during the trial. Outcomes should include long‐term quality of life, patient‐reported outcomes, cost effectiveness measures, and equity metrics.

RO rank 9: Evaluate existing international training programs and strategies used in published trials of ECPR to test readiness for more generalizable implementation in additional efficacy trials.
8 Gap: Basic and clinical research are needed to examine the development and progression of new ECPR‐related discoveries and address bench‐to‐bedside implementation challenges.
9 Gap: Optimal hardware and software configurations are lacking for prolonged ECPR use when applied early (ie, initially in the prehospital setting).
10 Gap: A knowledge gap on the circulatory and hemostatic physiology and ECPR biology/physics during prolonged CPR exists.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 356 000 people (116/100 000 person‐years) have out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) annually in the United States. American Heart Association (AHA) Statistical Update from 2021 reported an OHCA survival rate of 5% to 10%. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium reported in 2017 survival rates from 4.2% to 19.8% across regions serving over 23 million people where cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) metrics were reported and compliant with guidelines. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium investigators reported that age‐adjusted survival was lower for Black and Hispanic individuals when compared with White individuals. Regional variation in survival is even more apparent in a key clinical subgroup of bystander‐witnessed ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, where survival rates span 12.9% to 53.1%. Cardiac arrest is considered responsible for 3.3 million years of potential life lost annually, and this rate is 2‐fold higher in lower socioeconomic census tracts. Unlike other cardiovascular diseases (eg, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) that have all demonstrated a decrease in death in recent decades, the improvement in outcome after treatment of cardiac arrest with time‐sensitive interventions has remained modest over the past 30 years. This lack of progress is attributable to the known lethality of cardiac arrest, inadequate investment in either optimizing systems of care or in building optimal capacity through training, and inadequate translational research.

Environmental hypothermia cardiac arrest — ECLS/ECMO outcomes and prognostication — A multicenter prospective observational study of 242 adults with severe environmental hypothermia showed improved survival and favorable neurologic outcome for adults in cardiac arrest treated with ECMO compared with conventional rewarming. Multiple retrospective observational studies of adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest rewarmed with ECLS have demonstrated a survival benefit and improved neurological outcome over conventional CPR; the use of ECMO is preferable over CPB; a meta-analysis including 464 adults and children in cardiac arrest due to hypothermia showed a 41% greater probability of survival with ECMO. The Hypothermia Outcome Prediction After ECLS (HOPE) probability score includes age, sex, asphyxia, CPR duration, serum potassium concentration, and temperature. A HOPE score < 0.1 has been validated for predicting mortality of adults in hypothermic cardiac arrest placed on ECLS for rewarming. The HOPE score is superior to serum potassium threshold of ≥ 12 mmol/L alone in adults and children. The International Accidental Hypothermia ECLS (ICE) survival score includes sex, asphyxia, and serum potassium concentration, and a score > 12 has also been validated in predicting survival after hypothermic cardiac arrest in adults and children.

Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus on Science

Because 3 randomized trials – were identified, observational studies were not considered for the updated consensus on science because of the high risk of bias. A summary of the observational studies is provided in the SysRevs.

Key outcomes from the 3 included randomized trials are summarized in Table 4. One trial was stopped early for benefit after 30 patients; 1 trial was stopped early because of slow enrollments after 15 patients; and 1 trial was terminated early because of futility in the primary outcome, although there was an overall signal toward benefit.

Table 4.
Key Outcomes by Treatment Group and Absolute Risk Difference for Patients Treated With an ECPR Strategy Compared With Standard Care

The overall certainty of evidence was rated as low because of inconsistency and imprecision and was considered very low for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) because there were no trials for IHCA. Because of a high degree of heterogeneity between the randomized trials, no meta-analyses were performed.

Prior Treatment Recommendation (2019)

We suggest that ECPR may be considered as a rescue therapy for selected patients with cardiac arrest when conventional CPR is failing in settings in which this can be implemented (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).

2023 Treatment Recommendation

We suggest that ECPR may be considered as a rescue therapy for selected patients with OHCA when conventional CPR is failing to restore spontaneous circulation in settings in which this can be implemented (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence).

### AHA updates guidelines for CPR and emergency… [^4104de26]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In adult CPR, 100 to 120 chest compressions per minute at a depth of at least 2 inches, but no greater than 2. 4 inches, should be provided.
- Health care professionals can perform chest compressions and ventilation in all patients presenting with cardiac arrest. Adults. When providing CPR, 100 to 120 chest compressions per minute at a depth of at least 2 inches, but no greater than 2. 4 inches, should be provided. Pauses in compressions should be as short as possible. A goal of a 60% or greater chest compression fraction may be reasonable in persons with an unprotected airway. When cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm occurs outside of a hospital, emergency medical services personnel can delay use of positive pressure ventilation by performing cycles of 200 continuous compressions combined with passive oxygen insufflation and airway adjuncts.

Although routinely using passive ventilation is not recommended when providing conventional CPR because of questionable effectiveness, this is a reasonable method for emergency medical services personnel who typically provide this combined approach. Health care professionals can perform chest compressions and ventilation in all patients presenting with cardiac arrest. A series of 30 compressions and two breaths is no longer necessary if there is an advanced airway, and, instead, one breath every six seconds should be given while chest compressions are provided continuously. Evaluation of electrocardiography rhythm with artifact-filtering algorithms while performing CPR cannot be recommended; however, it could be useful for research or for emergency medical services personnel who use these algorithms already. Audiovisual feedback may be used to improve CPR performance. Compression depth was affirmed as one-third or more of anterior-posterior diameter; however, evidence is lacking regarding the rate and, therefore, it was not assessed. Instead, the adult rate of 100 to 120 chest compressions per minute is recommended. Ventilation should be included when performing CPR, because 30-day outcomes were found to be worse when only compressions were performed. If the rescuer performing CPR is not willing or able to provide ventilation, then delivering compressions only is appropriate. ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUES AND ANCILLARY DEVICES Since the 2010 guidelines, additional evidence about the effectiveness of alternatives and adjuncts to standard CPR has emerged; however, it should be noted that specialized equipment and training may be needed when alternative techniques are used.

At Hb 3.7 g/dL, EVLWI was significantly higher in the RS-group than in the TS-, GEL-, and HS-groups. ✱ p < 0.05 vs. GEL, # P < 0.05 vs. HS, § P < 0.05 vs. RS, + P < 0.05 vs. baseline. Hb crit, critical haemoglobin concentration, error bars represent standard deviation of mean.

Hemodilution to Hb 3.0 g/dL (Hb crit of the HS-group)

As the limit of anemia tolerance was already met at Hb 3.7 g/dL in the RS-group, hemodilution to 3.0 g/dL could only be performed in the HS-, GEL- and TS-groups.

A slight increase in CI, HR and SVI and a decrease in MAP and SVRI was observed in these groups, and SVV was significantly reduced compared with baseline. The ITBVI did not change further, but remained elevated above the baseline level (P < 0.05). There were no differences between the HS-, GEL and TS-groups in hemodynamic parameters at Hb 3.0 g/dL.

Consistent with progressive hemodilution, DO 2 I further decreased in the remaining HS-, GEL- and TS-groups. In animals hemodiluted with hetastarch, O 2 extraction was significantly increased as reflected by lower partial venous oxygen pressure (pvO 2) (P < 0.05 vs. baseline and vs. GEL-group) and by a higher O 2 extraction ratio (P < 0.05 vs. baseline and vs. GEL- and TS-groups).

Representatives developed the updated IHCA template iteratively by face-to-face meetings, teleconference, and online surveys between 2013 and 2018. Data elements were grouped by hospital factors, patient variables, pre-event factors, cardiac arrest and postresuscitation processes, and outcomes; elements were classed as core or supplemental by a modified Delphi process. Core variables should enable reasonable comparisons between systems and are considered essential for quality improvement programs, and together with core variables, supplementary variables are considered useful for research.

### Early hemodynamic and renal effects of hemorrhagic shock resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, hydroxyethyl starch, and hypertonic saline with or without 6% dextran-70 [^d0c6d4c9]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Considering the renal effects of fluid resuscitation in hemorrhaged patients, the choice of fluid has been a source of controversy. In a model of hemorrhagic shock, we studied the early hemodynamic and renal effects of fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR), 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES), and 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS) with or without 6% dextran-70 (HSD).

Materials and Methods

Forty-eight dogs were anesthetized and submitted to splenectomy. An estimated 40% blood volume was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 40 mm Hg for 30 min. The dogs were divided into four groups: LR, in a 3:1 ratio to removed blood volume; HS, 6 mL kg(-1); HSD, 6 mL kg(-1); and HES in a 1:1 ratio to removed blood volume. Hemodynamics and renal function were studied during shock and 5, 60, and 120 min after fluid replacement.

Results

Shock treatment increased MAP similarly in all groups. At 5 min, cardiac filling pressures and cardiac performance indexes were higher for LR and HES but, after 120 min, there were no differences among groups. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were higher in LR at 60 min but GFR returned to baseline values in all groups at 120 min. Diuresis was higher for LR at 5 min and for LR and HES at 60 min. There were no differences among groups in renal variables 120 min after treatment.

Conclusions

Despite the immediate differences in hemodynamic responses, the low-volume resuscitation fluids, HS and HSD, are equally effective to LR and HES in restoring renal performance 120 min after hemorrhagic shock treatment.

Utstein in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) registry — core event and defibrillation elements define key fields as follows: Event witnessed is a cardiac arrest that is seen or heard by another person or is monitored; resuscitation team called asks whether a hospital-wide resuscitation response was activated and clarifies that local responses (emergency department, operating room, or ICU teams) are excluded; monitored cardiac arrest denotes monitoring already in place when the need for chest compressions and/or defibrillation was first recognized; chest compressions records whether the patient received chest compressions, including open cardiac massage; initial rhythm is the cardiac rhythm present at onset of cardiac arrest if monitored, or when the monitor or defibrillator is attached after onset of chest compressions; AED used asks whether an AED or manual defibrillator in AED/shock advisory mode was applied; defibrillatory shocks delivered asks whether a defibrillation shock was provided for VF or pulseless VT; and ECPR captures whether venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was started during cardiac arrest.

Key messages

- Therapeutic infusion of 2 l of normal saline at 4°C over 30 minutes during resuscitation following cardiac arrest safely and effectively lowers body temperature and can be used as part of ALS after OHCA.

- Inducing mild hypothermia in the field by EMS personnel is reproducible and cost-effective.

Traumatic cardiac arrest — pediatric synopsis and rationale note that unintentional injuries are the most common cause of death among children and adolescents and that the management of traumatic cardiac arrest is often inconsistent; cardiac arrest due to major blunt or penetrating injury in children has a very high mortality rate. Suspect thoracic injury in all thoraco-abdominal trauma because tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, or pericardial tamponade may impair hemodynamics, oxygenation, and ventilation. This topic was last reviewed in the 2020 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC and these recommendations have not been updated for this edition of the Guidelines. Early correction of reversible causes by reducing delays in the delivery of trauma-specific interventions may increase survival following penetrating traumatic cardiac arrest; systematic reviews, multicenter retrospective studies, and single-center retrospective studies recommend emergency thoracotomy for pediatric patients who present pulseless after penetrating thoracic injury; however, there is no evidence to support emergent thoracotomy for infants and children with blunt injury presenting in cardiac arrest.

Regarding specific circumstances for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, resuscitative hysterotomy, ACOG 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing resuscitative hysterotomy even if delivery does not occur within 4–5 minutes of maternal cardiac arrest because maternal and neonatal survival curves have shown 50% injury-free survival rates with perimortem Cesarean delivery as late as 25 minutes after maternal cardiac arrest.

Hypothermia/Cold exposure — airway and medication use in severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest: Manage the airway per standard care in cardiac arrest victims. In the absence of advanced airways, ventilate the patient at the same rate as a normothermic patient. If the patient has an advanced airway, ventilate at half the rate recommended for a normothermic patient to prevent hyperventilation, and if EtCO2 is available, ventilate to maintain normal EtCO2 levels. There is little evidence to guide use of medications in severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest; 2010 AHA updates to advanced cardiac life support recommend use of vasopressors according to standard ACLS protocols while the 2014 Alaska guidelines and the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline advises medications should be withheld until the patient's core temperature is greater than 30°C (86°F). Above 30°C (86°F), intervals between medication provision should be doubled.

### Cardiac arrest in special populations [^02eb02d3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Best practices in cardiac arrest depend on continuous high-quality chest compressions, appropriate ventilatory management, early defibrillation of shockable rhythms, and identification and treatment of reversible causes. Although most patients can be treated according to highly vetted treatment guidelines, some special situations in cardiac arrest arise where additional skills and preparation can improve outcomes. Situations covered in this section involve cardiac arrest in context of electrical injuries, asthma, allergic reactions, pregnancy, trauma, electrolyte imbalances, toxic exposures, hypothermia, drowning, pulmonary embolism, and left ventricular assist devices.
