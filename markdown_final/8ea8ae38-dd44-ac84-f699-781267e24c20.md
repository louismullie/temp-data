## Question

What are the current recommendations for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in surgical procedures?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current recommendations for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in surgical procedures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that govern surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Then, I should verify procedure-specific indications and exclusions. Next, I will examine timing, dosing, redosing, and duration. After that, I need to check special populations and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, actionable summary and highlight evidence gaps and controversies, making sure I anchor each point to high-quality guidelines and meta-analyses.

> Let me first confirm the core principles so I don't jump to conclusions: prophylaxis is indicated when the risk of surgical site infection is clinically meaningful and the consequences of infection are significant, it should be administered before incision to achieve bactericidal tissue levels, the spectrum should be as narrow as possible, and it should be stopped promptly after the procedure to minimize resistance and adverse effects. I should double-check that these align with CDC, WHO, and major society guidance, which they do [^1154nKSp] [^1131mAPf] [^112TscLU].

> Hold on, let's not conflate prophylaxis with treatment; I need to ensure we are not extending prophylaxis beyond 24 hours for most procedures, because that is not supported and may cause harm. The WHO-aligned meta-analysis shows no benefit to continuing prophylaxis after closure when best practices are followed, and CDC explicitly advises against additional doses after incision closure in clean and clean-contaminated cases, with ASCRS confirming no SSI advantage to extending beyond 24 hours in colorectal surgery [^112oRfv6] [^111YJ4Yq] [^113HrrvH].

> Next, I should review procedure-specific indications, and I need to be careful to separate strong from conditional recommendations. Strong indications include colorectal surgery, cesarean delivery, and procedures involving prosthetic material or high-risk cardiac, vascular, and orthopedic implants, where prophylaxis reduces SSI and is standard of care. Conditional or controversial areas include neurosurgery, spine surgery without implants, and some clean extra-abdominal procedures, where benefits exist but evidence quality varies and decisions should be individualized [^111nNCu2] [^116s77Qp] [^112aMrK2] [^114TnAyC].

> Wait, let me verify the timing details because this is a frequent pitfall: for most agents, administer within 60 minutes before incision. For fluoroquinolones and vancomycin, start 120 minutes pre-incision to mitigate infusion reactions. If a tourniquet is used, complete infusion before inflation. And for lengthy cases, redose at 2–4 hour intervals based on the drug's half-life. I should confirm that these intervals are consistent across ACOG, ASCRS, and CDC, which they are [^113vvysg] [^1141MJ4i] [^112b41Fa].

> I will now examine dosing and redosing, and I need to ensure I account for obesity and blood loss. Weight-based dosing is standard, with higher cefazolin doses in obesity, and redosing is recommended when the procedure exceeds two half-lives of the agent or when blood loss exceeds about 1500 mL. I should double-check that these thresholds are supported, and yes, ACOG and ASCRS endorse both weight-based dosing and redosing in long or high-blood-loss cases [^113vvysg] [^1141MJ4i] [^1153hE2N] [^1153hE2N].

> Let me consider duration next, and I should confirm exceptions. The default is to stop within 24 hours; exceptions include cardiac surgery, where some guidelines allow 24–72 hours, and trauma with penetrating abdominal injury, where 24–48 hours may be reasonable if contamination is present. But wait, I should verify that even in cardiac surgery, the benefit of extending beyond 24 hours is debated and evidence is mixed, so I should qualify that recommendation as institution- and risk-dependent rather than universal [^115tiVu9] [^1154nKSp].

> I need to check special populations and risk modifiers. In obesity, increase cefazolin dose to 2–3 grams. In diabetes, infection risk is higher despite prophylaxis, so meticulous technique and optimization matter. In MRSA-colonized patients, add vancomycin to standard prophylaxis. In renal impairment, adjust dosing and timing of renally cleared agents. And in pediatrics, use weight-based dosing with the same timing principles. These adjustments are supported by ACOG, spine guidelines, and stewardship frameworks [^113vvysg] [^114pQSnQ] [^111ZBG1e] [^112TscLU].

> But wait, what if the procedure is low risk or minimally invasive; should I still give antibiotics? I should confirm that prophylaxis is not indicated for clean, low-risk procedures without implants, such as simple hernia repair, most laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or routine dermatologic excisions, where the SSI risk is low and prophylaxis does not meaningfully change outcomes. This aligns with CDC and specialty-specific guidance [^112b41Fa] [^114zViuf].

> Next, I should review stewardship and implementation gaps, because recommendations without execution miss the mark. Real-world data show frequent failures in timing, excessive duration, and unnecessary spectrum, with only about 30% of hospitals fully adopting ≤ 24-hour prophylaxis. Quality improvement bundles that hardwire timing, redosing, and automatic stop orders improve adherence and should be prioritized [^116Wdo4r] [^113pJxt6] [^113xz4mH].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach so it's actionable: for any planned procedure, first confirm whether prophylaxis is indicated based on SSI risk and consequences. If indicated, select a narrow-spectrum agent matched to expected flora, give it 0–60 minutes pre-incision (120 minutes for vancomycin or fluoroquinolones), redose intraoperatively if the case is long or blood loss is high, and stop within 24 hours unless a specific exception applies. Document the indication, agent, timing, and rationale for any deviations to support stewardship and quality metrics [^112b41Fa] [^113vvysg] [^112oRfv6].

> Finally, I should acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps so we don't overstate certainty. Spine surgery without implants has supportive but lower-quality evidence, and some guidelines still suggest prophylaxis. Cardiac surgery duration remains debated. And emerging areas like MRSA decolonization, local vancomycin powder, and procedure-specific pharmacokinetics require ongoing study. I need to ensure these are framed as evolving rather than settled issues [^114TnAyC] [^115tiVu9] [^113Q9o9N].

Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated for **clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty procedures** [^112b41Fa] and for clean procedures with high-risk features (e.g. prosthetic implants, immunocompromise, or high SSI risk) [^115SdJ3U]. They are **not recommended for routine clean procedures without risk factors** [^112b41Fa]. Administer a single pre-incision dose within 60 minutes (120 minutes for vancomycin or fluoroquinolones) [^113vvysg], redose if the procedure exceeds two half-lives or blood loss exceeds 1,500 mL [^1153hE2N], and discontinue within 24 hours; do not continue beyond 24 hours for clean or clean-contaminated cases [^111YJ4Yq] [^112oRfv6]. Select narrow-spectrum agents based on procedure type and local resistance patterns, and avoid routine use of vancomycin unless MRSA risk is high [^1154nKSp] [^111ZBG1e].

## Indications for prophylactic antibiotics

Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated based on **surgical wound classification** and patient-specific risk factors:

| **Wound classification** | **Indication for prophylactic antibiotics** |
|-|-|
| Clean | Not routinely indicated unless high-risk features are present (e.g. prosthetic implants, immunocompromise, or high SSI risk) [^115SdJ3U] |
| Clean-contaminated | Indicated for procedures involving the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts without significant spillage [^notfound] |
| Contaminated | Indicated for procedures with significant spillage or acute inflammation without pus |
| Dirty | Indicated for procedures involving pus, necrotic tissue, or preoperative infection |

---

Additionally, prophylactic antibiotics are indicated for **clean procedures with high-risk features**, such as:

- Prosthetic implants (e.g. joint replacements, pacemakers, vascular grafts) [^115SdJ3U]
- Immunocompromised patients
- Procedures with high SSI risk (e.g. cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery with implants) [^115SdJ3U]

---

## Timing of administration

Proper timing is critical to ensure **effective tissue concentrations** at incision [^112b41Fa]. General recommendations include:

- **Administer within 60 minutes** before incision for most antibiotics [^113vvysg].
- **Vancomycin and fluoroquinolones**: administer within 120 minutes before incision due to longer infusion times [^113vvysg].
- **Intraoperative redosing**: if the procedure exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic or blood loss exceeds 1,500 mL [^114Wsuhe].

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

Prolonged prophylaxis is generally not recommended and may increase **antibiotic resistance** and adverse events [^112oRfv6]. Standard recommendations include:

- **Discontinue within 24 hours** for most procedures [^1154nKSp].
- **Cardiac surgery**: some guidelines allow continuation up to 48 hours, though evidence is mixed [^115tiVu9].
- **Orthopedic surgery**: single-dose prophylaxis is generally sufficient, though some surgeons prefer up to 24 hours for complex cases [^notfound].

---

## Choice of antibiotic agents

Antibiotic selection should be based on the **procedure type**, **likely pathogens**, and **local resistance patterns**:

- **First-generation cephalosporins** (e.g. cefazolin) are preferred for most clean and clean-contaminated procedures due to coverage of common skin flora [^115PMSGY].
- **Gram-negative and anaerobic coverage**: indicated for procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. colorectal surgery) [^111nNCu2].
- **MRSA coverage**: vancomycin or teicoplanin should be considered for patients with known MRSA colonization or high local prevalence of MRSA [^111ZBG1e].
- **Allergy considerations**: patients with beta-lactam allergies may receive clindamycin, vancomycin, or aminoglycosides depending on the procedure and risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Obesity**: higher antibiotic doses may be required to achieve adequate tissue concentrations [^113vvysg].
- **Pediatric patients**: weight-based dosing is essential, and antibiotic selection should consider age-specific pathogens and safety profiles [^notfound].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: programs should monitor and optimize prophylactic antibiotic use to minimize resistance and adverse events [^114j1vD6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Indications**: Clean-contaminated, contaminated, dirty procedures, and clean procedures with high-risk features [^112b41Fa].
- **Timing**: Within 60 minutes before incision (120 minutes for vancomycin or fluoroquinolones) [^113vvysg].
- **Duration**: Discontinue within 24 hours for most procedures; up to 48 hours for cardiac surgery in select cases [^115tiVu9].
- **Agent selection**: Based on procedure type, likely pathogens, and local resistance patterns; prefer narrow-spectrum agents [^1154nKSp].
- **Special considerations**: Adjust dosing for obesity, pediatric patients, and antibiotic allergies [^113vvysg].

---

Prophylactic antibiotics are essential for **preventing surgical site infections** when used appropriately. Adherence to guidelines regarding indications, timing, duration, and agent selection is crucial to optimize outcomes and minimize antibiotic resistance [^1131mAPf].

Although clinical guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis across a wide array of surgical procedures have been proposed by multidisciplinary groups of physicians and pharmacists, clinicians often deviate from recommendations. This is particularly true when recommendations are based on weak data or expert opinion. The goal of this review is to highlight certain common but controversial topics in perioperative prophylaxis and to focus on the data that does exist for the recommendations being made.

North American Spine Society (NASS) antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery — this evidence-based clinical guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions on prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery using the highest quality clinical literature available as of June 2011, with goals to assist in delivering optimum, efficacious treatment to prevent surgical infection. It was developed as an educational tool to assist spine surgeons in preventing surgical site infections and is an update to the 2007 version, addressing the efficacy and appropriate protocol for antibiotic prophylaxis and discussing redosing, discontinuation, wound drains, and special considerations related to comorbidities. Recommendations are based on evidence related to open procedures, and no evidence was reviewed related to efficacy and protocol for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in percutaneous procedures. This guideline does not represent a "standard of care", nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol, and treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and doctor's professional judgment. The patient population encompasses adults (18 years or older) undergoing spine surgery.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^117SDtTZ]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Guideline development process — NASS work groups defined clinical questions, executed a protocolized literature search, and applied multi-reviewer evidence grading to derive recommendations. Trained guideline participants were asked to submit a list of clinical questions that the guideline should address, the literature search was implemented by a medical/research librarian with search strategies documented in the technical report, and NASS maintains a search history in Endnote. Following these protocols ensures that recommendations are based on a thorough review of relevant literature, a uniform, comprehensive search strategy, and the current best research evidence available. For study selection, if Level I, II and or III literature is available to answer specific questions, the work group was not required to review Level IV or V studies. Evidence analysis used dual independent review — at least two work group members reviewed each article and assigned NASS levels of evidence — discrepancies were addressed by two or more reviewers, and the consensus level (the level upon which two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement) was then assigned to the article. Expert consensus has been incorporated only where Level I-IV evidence is insufficient, and all consensus-based recommendations indicate that Level I-IV evidence is insufficient and that the recommendation is based only on expert consensus.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for colorectal surgery [^111nNCu2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Research shows that administration of prophylactic antibiotics before colorectal surgery prevents postoperative surgical wound infection. The best antibiotic choice, timing of administration and route of administration remain undetermined.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical wound infection in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Specifically to determine:1. whether antimicrobial prophylaxis reduces the risk of surgical wound infection;2. the target spectrum of bacteria (aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, or both);3. the best timing and duration of antibiotic administration;4. the most effective route of antibiotic administration (intravenous, oral or both);5. whether any antibiotic is clearly more effective than the currently recommended gold standard specified in published guidelines;6. whether antibiotics should be given before or after surgery.

Search Methods

For the original review published in 2009 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid). For the update of this review we rewrote the search strategies and extended the search to cover from 1954 for MEDLINE and 1974 for EMBASE up to 7 January 2013. We searched CENTRAL on the same date (Issue 12, 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotic use in elective and emergency colorectal surgery, with surgical wound infection as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted and reviewed by one review author and checked by another only for the single, dichotomous outcome of surgical wound infection. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.

Main Results

This updated review includes 260 trials and 68 different antibiotics, including 24 cephalosporins and 43,451 participants. Many studies had multiple variables that separated the two study groups; these could not be compared to other studies that tested one antibiotic and had a single variable separating the two groups. We did not consider the risk of bias arising from attrition and lack of blinding of outcome assessors to affect the results for surgical wound infection. Meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically significant difference in postoperative surgical wound infection when prophylactic antibiotics were compared to placebo/no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.41, high quality evidence). This translates to a reduction in risk from 39% to 13% with prophylactic antibiotics. The slightly higher risk of wound infection with short-term compared with long-term duration antibiotic did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30). Similarly risk of would infection was slightly higher with single-dose antibiotics when compared with multiple dose antibiotics, but the results are compatible with benefit and harm (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.10). Additional aerobic coverage and additional anaerobic coverage both showed statistically significant improvements in surgical wound infection rates (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.68 and RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71, respectively), as did combined oral and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis when compared to intravenous alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.74), or oral alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76). Comparison of an antibiotic with anaerobic specificity to one with aerobic specificity showed no significant advantage for either one (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.36). Two small studies compared giving antibiotics before or after surgery and no significant difference in this timing was found (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.15). Established gold-standard regimens recommended in major guidelines were no less effective than any other antibiotic choice.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has found high quality evidence that antibiotics covering aerobic and anaerobic bacteria delivered orally or intravenously (or both) prior to elective colorectal surgery reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Our review shows that antibiotics delivered within this framework can reduce the risk of postoperative surgical wound infection by as much as 75%. It is not known whether oral antibiotics would still have these effects when the colon is not empty. This aspect of antibiotic dosing has not been tested. Further research is required to establish the optimal timing and duration of dosing, and the frequency of longer-term adverse effects such as Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis.

Conclusion

Identifying the appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis for urgent/emergent operations and for critically ill or high-risk patients can be a complicated and nuanced decision. In most instances, the evidence suggests that prophylactic antibiotics can be limited to a single, preoperative dose. A consensus summary for the management of surgical prophylaxis for the selected surgical subgroups is provided in table 1. It is important for the surgical intensivists to be familiar with this evidence so they may advocate for the appropriate care for their patients.

Question 11. Which are the principles of antibiotic prophylaxis?

Statement 11.1. Prolonging antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery is generally not associated with better clinical results.

Statement 11.2. There is no universally recognized intervention for improving the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery. These interventions must be tailored to the type of surgeon and team to which they are addressed.

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) has been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to reduce the risk of SSIs across different types of surgical procedures.

Given the evidence, systemic PAP is considered to be a key component of perioperative infection prevention bundles. Although compliance with appropriate timing and spectrum of PAP has improved as a result of quality improvement initiatives, there remain significant deficiencies in compliance with other aspects of PAP such as duration of postoperative antibiotics. Given that approximately 15% of all antibiotics in hospitals are prescribed for surgical prophylaxis, perioperative antibiotic prescribing patterns can be a major driver of some emerging infections (such as C. difficile) and selection of antibiotic resistance, increasing healthcare costs.

Although appropriate PAP plays a pivotal role in reducing the rate of SSIs, other factors that impact SSI rates should not be ignored. PAP should never substitute for good medical practices, such as those of IPC. Perioperative SSI prevention strategies should include attention to basic IPC strategies, surgical technique, hospital and operating room environments, instrument sterilization processes, and perioperative optimization of patient risk factors.

The key elements of appropriate surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis prescribing include the correct antimicrobial indication, drug dose, route, the timing of administration, and duration.

Joint guidelines for PAP in surgery were revised and updated in 2013 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Surgical Infection Society, and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. These guidelines focus on the effective and safe use of AP. Therapeutic serum and tissue concentrations of antimicrobial agents should be present during the period of potential contamination. Additional antibiotic doses may need to be administered intraoperatively for prolonged procedures or for agents with short half-lives. In order to be safe, PAP should have no or few adverse effects and should have the narrowest spectrum of activity necessary to prevent postoperative infections.

### Surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^114d1ywH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of prophylactic measures, including perioperative antibiotics, for the prevention of surgical site infections is a standard of care across surgical specialties. Unfortunately, the routine guidelines used for routine procedures do not always account for many of the factors encountered with urgent/emergent operations and critically ill or high-risk patients. This clinical consensus document created by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Critical Care Committee is one of a three-part series and reviews surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical intensive care unit. The purpose of this clinical consensus document is to provide practical recommendations, based on expert opinion, to assist intensive care providers with decision-making for surgical prophylaxis. We specifically evaluate the current state of periprocedural antibiotic management of external ventricular drains, orthopedic operations (closed and open fractures, silver dressings, local, antimicrobial adjuncts, spine surgery, subfascial drains), abdominal operations (bowel injury and open abdomen), and bedside procedures (thoracostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, tracheostomy).

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgical-site infections… [^1154nKSp]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Nosocomial infections develop in 2 to 5 percent of patients undergoing clean extra-abdominal surgeries and after approximately 20 percent of intra-abdominal procedures. Patients who develop surgical-site infections have mortality rates double those of other surgical patients. Surgical-site infections also may lead to admission to intensive care units, extended hospital stays and readmission after discharge, and substantially increased health care costs. The National Surgical Infection Prevention Project aims to reduce mortality and morbidity from surgical-site infections by promoting appropriate use of prophylactic antimicrobials in surgical practice. National experts have developed performance measures to monitor the appropriate initiation, selection, and discontinuation of prophylactic antimicrobials in surgery.

The project monitors Medicare patients undergoing procedures for which antimicrobials are clearly indicated, such as open-chest and vascular surgery, abdominal and colorectal procedures, hip and knee arthroplasty, and vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy. The project's initial recommendations recently have been revised by an expert panel. After reviewing the timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis, the panel recommends that the agent be administered as near as possible to the time of incision. The infusion of the first dose should begin 60 minutes or less before the incision, with the exception of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin; with these agents, the infusion should be initiated 120 minutes before incision to minimize antibiotic-associated reactions. Administration at the time of anesthesia induction appears to result in safe and adequate drug levels in tissues.

If a tourniquet is required, the antimicrobial infusion should be completed before the tourniquet is inflated. Studies have not shown added benefit from multidose prophylaxis or prophylaxis given after wound closure. In addition, because prolonged use of antimicrobials may contribute to bacterial resistance, the guidelines recommend that prophylaxis end within 24 hours of surgery. The only exception may be in cardiothoracic surgery, where experts variously recommend administration up to 24 or 72 hours after surgery. Control of hyperglycemia reduces rates of surgical-site infection, and new evidence supports supplemental oxygenation and aggressive fluid resuscitation. The choice of antimicrobial agent is based on drug effectiveness and patient-related factors, particularly potential adverse effects. Drug allergies may be poorly documented.

The patient's medical history should identify true allergy or severe adverse drug reaction to avoid denying a patient the agent of choice because of false evidence of adverse reaction. Skin testing may be necessary to establish allergic status. Whenever possible, a single antimicrobial agent is recommended, with the choice based on the type of surgery. The use of vancomycin has not been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of methicillin-resistant. Staphylococcus aureus. Nasal mupirocin can reduce nasal carriage of S. aureus but has not been shown to reduce rates of surgery-related infection. Postoperative antibiotic use for more than 24 hours and discharge to a long-term care facility are the only factors associated with development of MRSA infection at the surgical site. Vancomycin is indicated, however, for surgical prophylaxis in patients already colonized with MRSA.

### Surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^116aafNX]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is estimated that approximately half of surgical site infections (SSIs) are preventable through routine measures. Perioperative antibiotics are a major component of this routine care, but the inappropriate utilization of antibiotics can lead to harm and increase antibiotic resistance. Consequently, antibiotic stewardship focused on identifying the appropriate antibiotics and duration of treatment is an essential component to critical care management. In this clinical consensus document, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Critical Care Committee aims to provide practical guidance to the surgical intensivist on the best practices for surgical and procedural antibiotic prophylaxis. These recommendations are summarized in table 1.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical procedures… [^115SdJ3U]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in surgery is widespread and often inappropriate. The lack of well-designed clinical studies partially explains the present confusion regarding the subject. We reviewed the literature in English on antibiotic prophylaxis through June 1982. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of wound infection after colorectal surgery, vaginal hysterectomy, and laryngeal and oropharyngeal resection for carcinoma, and in high-risk patients undergoing gastroduodenal or biliary surgery. In clean operations such as cardiac surgery, vascular procedures, and orthopedic surgery with placement of prostheses, the high morbidity associated with an infection justifies the use of antibiotics even though the risk of infection is small. There are conflicting data on the usefulness of prophylaxis in abdominal hysterectomy, cesarean section, noncardiac thoracic procedures, and urologic surgery.

The effectiveness of prophylaxis in neurosurgery cannot be evaluated at the present time. Guglielmo BJ, Hohn DC, Koo PJ, Hunt TK, Sweet RL, Conte JE. Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Surgical Procedures: A Critical Analysis of the Literature. Arch Surg. 1983; 118: 943–955.

Background principles state that "The goal of antibiotic prophylaxis is to prevent infection, not to cure or treat disease", that prophylaxis "must be administered before the potential exposure, and usually for a short duration (less than 24 hours)", and that delaying administration "by even a few hours reduces or eliminates the benefit of prophylaxis". Agent selection guidance specifies that "the agent of choice should have a low incidence of adverse effects and be long acting, inexpensive, and narrowly focused on the likely bacterial pathogens, which are usually endogenous flora".

### Is it time to recast the principles of antimicrobial prophylaxis? [^115PMSGY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The principles of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis were established more than 40 years ago. This concept has been applied to many areas of surgery and numerous prospective randomized trials have repeatedly demonstrated that surgical site infections (SSIs) are reduced when the right antibiotics are administered appropriately. This practice has been incorporated into standardized guidelines for perioperative use through the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) and serves as a major process measurement for appropriateness of practice. First and second generation cephalosporins have been the major drug class recommended and used for prophylaxis for decades and there has been little change in these recommendations over time.

Recent reports have demonstrated a lack of correlation between the use of guideline-directed perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis, that is, administration of the right drug at the right time for the right duration and its primary outcome measure, prevention of SSI. This begs the question: could we have been wrong about the benefits of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis?

There are a number of potential explanations for these observations. This principle has been so widely accepted that some propose that all patients receive antimicrobial prophylaxis regardless of the operation and risk of infection. This concept fails to consider the risk: benefit ratio of even single dose drug use, since there is a small but defined risk of allergic and other adverse reactions associated with most antibiotics. Overuse blurs the advantage of prophylaxis, as many who wouldn't benefit would still receive prophylaxis and supports the concept of unrelated attribution. This is exemplified as "if you want to show the benefit of a drug, give it to those who don't need it; it works every time". Although it is recognized that perioperative prophylaxis is not the only preventive measure for SSI, failure to apply other measures such as appropriate skin cleansing, scrubbing of operating room personnel, use of aseptic technique, mechanical bowel preparation, and avoidance of undo contamination subjects patients to complications and can negate the beneficial effects of prophylaxis. In addition, the increasing prevalence of minimally invasive surgical procedures, which are associated with a lower risk of SSI than open operations for the same conditions, may also be impacting these observations.

In January 2003, leadership of the Medicare National Surgical Infection Prevention Project hosted the Surgical Infection Prevention Guideline Writers Workgroup (SIPGWW) meeting. The objectives were to review areas of agreement among the most-recently published guidelines for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis, to address inconsistencies, and to discuss issues not currently addressed. The participants included authors from most of the groups that have published North American guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis, as well as authors from several specialty colleges. Nominal group process was used to draft a consensus paper that was widely circulated for comment. The consensus positions of SIPGWW include that infusion of the first antimicrobial dose should begin within 60 min before surgical incision and that prophylactic antimicrobials should be discontinued within 24 h after the end of surgery. This advisory statement provides an overview of other issues related to antimicrobial prophylaxis, including specific suggestions regarding antimicrobial selection.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^111abbju]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Face and scalp

The evidence for prophylactic antibiotic use for traumatic injuries of the face is heterogeneous and of fairly low quality, and there are no sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials on this topic. As a result, there is tremendous variability in practice patterns among treating surgeons, and many providers continue antibiotic prophylaxis longer than proposed, which leads to overuse of antibiotics in this patient population.

The Surgical Infection Society (SIS) recently published a guideline for prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with traumatic facial fractures. The authors of the SIS guidelines defined prophylactic antibiotics as antibiotics administered for more than 24 hours. This was further broken down into preoperative antibiotics (administered more than 1 hour before surgery or 2 hours if receiving vancomycin or quinolones), perioperative antibiotics (administered within 1 hour of surgery, but no more than 24 hours after surgery), and postoperative antibiotics (continued beyond 24 hours after surgery). We use these definitions for the recommendations outlined in this clinical consensus document.

Prophylactic antibiotics can decrease the risk of wound infection and have been routinely employed in orthopaedic surgery for decades. Despite their widespread use, questions still surround the selection of antibiotics for prophylaxis, timing and duration of administration. The health economic costs associated with wound infections are significant, and the judicious but appropriate use of antibiotics can reduce this risk.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is the use of antibiotics in the perioperative period to prevent surgical site infections from local flora. Specific guidelines and criteria exist to prevent these infections while also practicing antimicrobial stewardship. Most dentoalveolar procedures do not require antibiotic prophylaxis. For nondentoalveolar procedures, the decision to provide antibiotic prophylaxis is based on involvement of the respiratory, oral, or pharyngeal mucosa. Special considerations exist for patients at high risk for infective endocarditis, patients with head and neck cancer, and temporomandibular joint replacement procedures. This article discusses indications for antibiotic prophylaxis during oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^1131mAPf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1. How can you implement global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs)?

Statement 1.1. Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as AMR action plans. All healthcare workers should adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice.

Statement 1.2. A safer surgical care requires a range of precautions aimed at reducing the risk of SSIs before, during and after surgery.

Statement 1.3. To support local implementation of guidelines for the prevention of SSIs, 5 steps of a multimodal strategy, including system change, training and education, evaluation and feedback, communications for awareness raising and institutional safety climate and culture are suggested.

Improving behavior in infection prevention and control (IPC) practices remains a challenge. Despite progress in preventive knowledge, SSIs remain the most common HAI among surgical patients and one of the most frequent adverse events in hospitals. They represent a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and not direct costs worldwide. It is obviously important to improve patient safety by reducing the occurrence of SSIs. Preventing SSIs is a global priority, also because bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, making SSI prevention even more important nowadays. On the other hand, SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery.

Both WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for the prevention of SSI are evidence-based including systematic reviews presenting additional information in support of actions to improve practice. The first-ever global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs were published on November 3, 2016, then were updated in some parts and published in a new edition in December 2018. The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the preoperative period and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, appropriate way for surgical teams to clean their hands, guidance on when to use prophylactic antibiotics, which disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.

### Appropriateness of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis practices in Australia [^116Wdo4r]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the current surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis prescribing practices in Australia, and what factors are associated with their appropriateness?

Findings

This quality improvement study of 9351 surgical episodes found high rates of inappropriate procedural and postprocedural antimicrobial use across various hospital, patient, and surgical factors. The most common reason for inappropriate procedural use was incorrect timing, while duration greater than 24 hours was the most common reason for inappropriate postprocedural use.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the identified hospital, patient, and surgical factors should be considered as targets for development of tailored interventions to ensure appropriateness of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis prescriptions.

### Review of the current antibiotic guidelines used in dermatologic surgery [^114zViuf]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics have been used as a prophylaxis for dermatologic procedures. We will review the various procedures that specific antibiotics with dosages are used for, depending on the procedure, diagnosis, and circumstance of the patient. We will examine the current and updated guidelines used in dermatologic surgery and the overlapping guidelines across other fields. Physicians must consider the side effects of antibiotics and the resistance that may occur as a result before using the class or level of prophylaxis. Initial evaluation for alcohol, chlorhexidine, or iodine should be measured as well. Updated guidelines aim to address the contraindications of antibiotics, yet further research is needed to avoid antibiotic resistance and to explore alternative methods of antibiotic application, such as intranasal and intravenous.

### Broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in tumor and infected orthopedic surgery (BAPTIST) [^112xFJ3r]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is evidence-based in orthopedic surgery. While its duration ranges from a single dose to three doses throughout the world, the choice of the prophylactic agents is undisputed. Worldwide, the surgeons use 1st or 2nd-generation cephalosporins. However, there are particular clinical situation with a high risk of antibiotic-resistant surgical site infections; independently of the duration of adminis-tered prophylaxis. These resistant SSI's occur in contaminated wounds, or during surgery under current therapeutic antibiotics, and base on "selection" by antibiotics used for therapy or for prophylaxis. The perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is evidence-based for the majority of orthopedic surgeries.

While the debate of its duration and timing may continue, no clinicians doubt on the efficiency of the recommended prophylactic agents; that are mostly 1st or 2nd-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav or other exceptional agents in cases of -allergy. Additionally, orthopedic surgeons operating selected patient populations experience a high risk of prophylactic-resistant pathogens, or pathogens resistant to current therapeutic antibiotics regimens. At least 10% of all new intraoperative tissue samples, during iterative surgical debridement, yield pathogens unknown to the clinicians.

This is due to selection by prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics, which only kill the previously detected pathogens, but left over newly introduced contaminants, remnant parts of partially-diagnosed polymicrobial infections; ultimately leading to a new SSIs occurring during therapy for the first infection at the orthopedic site. This selection is unpredictable involving both Gram-positive skin pathogens as well as resistant Gram-negative rods. From a microbiological point of view, only a maximal Gram-negative coverage, alongside with a large Gram-negative coverage, would cover these selections. The literature is in-existing how to prevent these selections. Most clinicians just continue with the standard prophylactic recommendation, or the current thera-peutic antibiotic regimen. Theoretically, clinicians cannot exclude that these selected patient populations eventually might profit from a broad-spectrum prophylaxis.

The BAPTIST trials only concern the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in selected situations of orthopedic surgery: tumor surgery, debridement for postoperative dehiscent wounds, debridement under antibiotics, open fractures, skin colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria, plus, as a control; spine surgery in selected multimorbid patients. The investigators alternately randomize the standard prophylaxis to the additional broad-spectrum single-shot of vancomycin 1g IV & single-shot of gentamicin 5 mg/kg intravenously; before an eventual intraoperative sampling. End-of-Treatment and/or Test-of-Cure occur latest at the 6-week's surgical control visit. The rest of the hospital stay, treatment, the use of negative-pressure vacuum therapy, other interventions, local antibiotic therapies; therapies or procedure are at the discretion of the treating clinicians.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: updated guidelines [^1171KR8M]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery is poorly understood, and data on its use are lacking. Prophylaxis is indicated for the prevention of endocarditis and prosthesis infection, as well as surgical site infection.

Objective

We review essential considerations for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery and provide clear guidelines for practical implementation.

Methods

Guidelines were developed after review of the literature and consultation with infectious disease specialists and subspecialists in the areas of cardiac, orthopedic, and neurosurgical infectious disease at Mayo Clinic.

Results

Three factors affect the decision to use prophylactic antibiotics in dermatologic surgery: (1) the underlying indication for prophylaxis (patient risk stratification), (2) the condition of the skin, and (3) the specific procedure planned. Thorough preoperative evaluation and surgical planning are critical in identifying and optimizing patient and environmental risk factors that may increase the risk of infection. Appropriate antibiotic selections with site-specific consideration and appropriate timing of antibiotic administration are key factors in providing effective prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Low rates of infection associated with dermatologic surgical procedures warrant selective use of antibiotic prophylaxis. The proposed guidelines reflect current standards of practice.

### Collaborative antimicrobial stewardship for surgeons [^112QvniP]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship efforts that include surgeons rely on healthy and open communications between surgeons, infectious diseases specialists, and pharmacists. These efforts most frequently are related to surgical prophylaxis, the management of surgical infections, and surgical critical care. Policy should be based on best evidence and timely interactions to develop consensus on how to develop appropriate guidelines and protocols. Flexibility on all sides leads to increasingly strong relationships over time.

### Evidence-based medicine: systemic perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of surgical-site infections in plastic and reconstructive surgery [^113V8bEY]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

After nearly a decade of new data, the Evidence-Based Consensus Conference Statement from the American Association of Plastic Surgeons was updated for prophylactic systemic antibiotics to prevent surgical-site infections (SSI). Pharmacotherapeutic concepts using antimicrobial stewardship were applied for clinical interpretation and management to optimize patient outcomes and minimize resistance.

Methods

PRISMA, Cochrane, and GRADE certainty of evidence guidelines were implemented for the structure and synthesis of the review. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically and independently searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The authors included patients who had plastic and reconstructive surgery and were treated with prophylactic systemic antibiotics administered perioperatively (preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively). Comparisons were made between active interventions and nonactive interventions (placebo) at different prespecified durations to determine the development of an SSI. Meta-analyses were performed.

Results

The authors included 138 RCTs that met eligibility criteria. RCTs consisted of 18 breast, 10 cosmetic, 21 hand/peripheral nerve, 61 pediatric/craniofacial, and 41 reconstructive studies. The authors examined bacterial data extracted from studies for patients who did or did not take prophylactic systemic antibiotics for prevention of SSI. Clinical recommendations were provided using level I evidence.

Conclusions

Surgeons have long been overprescribing systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Evidence supports antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent SSI for specific indications and durations. Prolonged antibiotic use has not been linked to reductions in SSIs, and misuse may increase the bacterial diversity of infections. Greater efforts should focus on transitioning from practice-based to pharmacotherapeutic evidence-based medicine.

Burn injury

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of burn injury?

Recommendations: Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended for burn patients.

Discussion: Burn injury results in a massive inflammatory response as well as the loss of physical barriers (skin and airway mucosa) to infection. Bacterial translocation from the gut contributes to the risk of sepsis. These risks have led to a continued interest in the use of prophylactic antibiotics for burn patients in the ICU; however, the practice remains controversial. In 2010, Avni et al published a meta-analysis demonstrating reduced all-cause mortality based on five studies. There was a reduced rate of pneumonia based on four studies, but no overall effect on bacteremia. The included studies spanned approximately 40 years and were of relatively low quality. Perhaps more important was the significant increase in resistant organisms after prophylactic antibiotics. Subsequent meta-analyses in 2013, 2017, 2020 and one of pediatric patients in 2019 failed to show a benefit to systemic prophylaxis for the prevention of mortality. In each of these studies there was significant variation in the type of prophylaxis used as well as the overall severity of the burns. While there is some evidence for the reduction of mortality in severely burned patients requiring mechanical ventilation with prophylactic antibiotics, no difference was found in patients not mechanically ventilated, and the effects on antibiotic resistance remain unknown. Many consensus statements also agree that routine systemic prophylaxis should not be used in burn patients.

### Prophylactic and empiric use of antibiotics in dermatologic surgery: a review of the literature and practical considerations [^114rxW9d]. Dermatologic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although the risk of postoperative infection and bacteremia from dermatologic procedures remains low, many dermatologic surgeons continue to prescribe antibiotics, pre- and postoperatively. This practice can lead to unwanted morbidity and mortality and significantly increases associated healthcare costs and, even more ominously, increases bacterial resistance in the community.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive overview of antibiotic usage in dermatologic surgery and use evidence-based medicine to provide recommendations for antibiotic usage tailored to microbial pathogens.

Materials and Methods

A literature review was conducted to provide the most current overview of the guidelines for antibiotic use against surgical site infections, infective endocarditis, and hematogenous joint infection. In addition, recommendations for antibiotic use with implantable materials, such as fillers, and for special populations, such as organ transplant recipients, are provided.

Results and Conclusion

We focused on the most common bacterial pathogens related to surgical sites and effective antibiotics for each. In doing so, we seek to limit the unwarranted use of antibiotics in dermatologic surgery.

### Improving intraoperative administration of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis: a quality improvement report [^113xz4mH]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Measurement

The appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis was determined by the 'Clinical Practice Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Surgery' which have been developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. Adherence to these national guidelines was assessed in a preintervention and postintervention cohort of patients. The guidelines make recommendations on the choice of prophylactic antibiotics for various surgical procedures, the appropriate dose and the frequency of re-dosing. Any divergence from the guidelines in the prescription of one of the drugs led to a final assessment of the prophylactic course as discordant with the guidelines.

The study population included adult patients who had a surgical procedure at our institution with involvement of an anaesthesia provider during the surgery. There was no specific exclusion criterion. The preintervention group included patients who underwent surgery between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014, and the postintervention group included patients who underwent surgery between 1 August 2015 and 31 July 2017. Although approximately 35 000 surgical procedures are performed annually at our institution, and since we had already published our findings indicating inappropriate administration practices for a cohort of patients that had developed SSIs, we chose to analyse the same cohort (in a different time frame) to assess the impact of our interventions. A waiver of informed consent was granted.

### Delphi prioritization and development of global surgery guidelines for the prevention of surgical-site infection [^116YVfar]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

SSI is the commonest postoperative complication in abdominal surgery 12, 13, 14. Initiatives to reduce it should be prioritized worldwide, but the need is greatest in LMICs, where up to one‐quarter of patients develop an SSI after gastrointestinal surgery 13. Antimicrobial resistance is significantly more common in LMICs than HICs 13, 15. The current guideline offers a potential pathway to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the high healthcare costs incurred by SSI 16, in particular by providing clear guidance regarding the selection, timing and route of administration of prophylactic antibiotics. This guideline implements research findings which may reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure at a population level, for example by reducing the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis 17, 18. This will support antibiotic stewardship initiatives aimed at curbing antimicrobial resistance.

The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist has been disseminated widely, and has been demonstrated to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality 19, 20, 21. Some health systems have embedded an SSI bundle in local versions of the checklist to ensure that all patients receive key interventions to reduce infection risk. Surgical colleges and associations should work with healthcare providers to produce local Surgical Safety Checklists that incorporate this guideline's key recommendations. Given that the checklist is used in only half of emergency abdominal procedures in middle‐income countries and a third of procedures in low‐income countries 22, implementation of these guidelines should be performed alongside broader initiatives to increase uptake of the checklist 23. There remain significant evidence gaps in the prevention of SSI, highlighted by the four research recommendations made in this guideline. In order to inform policy in LMICs, it is essential that future trials incorporate health economic evaluation 24.

Prophylactic antibiotic duration for clean and clean-contaminated cases — prophylactic parenteral antibiotics should be limited to the initial 24 hours postoperatively (Strength of recommendation: strong based on moderate-quality evidence). Supporting evidence shows no SSI difference between 24 hours and > 24 hours of SAP in colorectal surgery (RR 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93–1.29) and no difference for single versus multiple doses (OR 1.21; 95% CI, 0.82–1.8). In a large colectomy cohort, overall SSI prevalence was 5.2% with prophylaxis durations of < 24 hours (51.6%), 24 to 48 hours (28.5%), and > 48 hours (19.9%), with no difference in SSI rate related to duration.

### Are systemic antibiotics indicated in aesthetic breast surgery? A systematic review of the literature [^114dkqfc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The use of systemic prophylactic antibiotics to reduce surgical-site infection in aesthetic breast surgery remains controversial. The aim of this review is to weigh the available evidence with respect to reducing surgical-site infection.

Methods

Two literature searches were performed to analyze the available data for studies involving either reduction or augmentation mammaplasty and the results of different antibiotics regimens. Outcome measures included surgical-site infection and capsular contracture.

Results

A total of 2971 patients (5891 breasts) were included. A meta-analysis of surgical-site infection incidence after aesthetic breast surgery revealed a significant reduction in infections overall with antibiotic prophylaxis compared with controls (p = 0.02). This was most significant with a single preoperative antibiotic dose (p = 0.02). In cases of reduction mammaplasty, when antibiotics are administered as a single preoperative dose, the risk of developing surgical-site infection is halved. With augmentation mammaplasty, there was no effect on infection rates with any antibiotic regimen. Data concerning the incidence of capsular contracture were insufficient for meta-analysis.

Conclusions

For cases of reduction mammaplasty, the authors recommend a single intravenous perioperative dose of antibiotic with action against Staphylococcus species. For augmentation mammaplasty, there is no evidence to refute current guidelines, based on recommendations obtained from other forms of implant surgery.

### Antibiotic prescription practices for surgical prophylaxis in India: an observational study [^111eBYkk]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics following surgeries have been shown to reduce surgical site infections, and their administration is common practice. Despite clear guidelines regarding this being set forth by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), adherence to them is yet to translate to common practice in many parts of the world. A retrospective chart review of 409 patients who underwent elective surgeries over a period of 7 months at three different hospitals in India was performed. In-hospital antibiotic prescriptions of these patients were examined for any apparent inappropriateness (use of antibiotics with coverage broader than the target microbes and use of antibiotics with overlapping spectrum of target microbes). Four hundred ninety-five (48.9%) of the 1,012 patient intensive care unit (ICU) days had apparent inappropriateness in the choice of their prophylactic antibiotics and only 3.2% of the antibiotic units used were in accordance with the present IDSA guidelines. Injudicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries such as India. This poses the risk of emergence of resistant microorganisms in these areas and their potential spread across the borders. There is an acute need for diligent antibiotic stewardship programs in these areas to curb such practices.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: advisory statement 2008 [^114Z4yTG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic prophylaxis is an important component of dermatologic surgery, and recommendations in this area should reflect the updated 2007 guidelines of the American Heart Association, the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines, and recent prospective studies on surgical site infection.

Objective

To provide an update on the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery for the prevention of infective endocarditis, hematogenous total joint infection, and surgical site infection.

Methods

A literature review was performed, expert consensus was obtained, and updated recommendations were created, consistent with the most current authoritative guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

Results

For patients with high-risk cardiac conditions, and a defined group of patients with prosthetic joints at high risk for hematogenous total joint infection, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended when the surgical site is infected or when the procedure involves breach of the oral mucosa. For the prevention of surgical site infections, antibiotics may be indicated for procedures on the lower extremities or groin, for wedge excisions of the lip and ear, skin flaps on the nose, skin grafts, and for patients with extensive inflammatory skin disease.

Limitations

These recommendations are not based on multiple, large-scale, prospective trials.

Conclusions

There is a strong shift away from administration of prophylactic antibiotics in many dermatologic surgery settings, based on updated authoritative guidelines. These recommendations provide guidance to comply with the most current guidelines, modified to address dermatology-specific considerations. Managing physicians may utilize these guidelines while individualizing their approach based on all clinical considerations.

### Knowledge, awareness, and attitude towards infection prevention and management among surgeons: identifying the surgeon champion [^111iuoWZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In 2017, a global declaration for appropriate use of antimicrobials across the surgical pathway was shared by over 230 experts from 83 different countries. Within this declaration, the authors highlighted the effects of antibiotic exposure, misuse, and overuse on antibiotic resistance and outlined the fundamental principles of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy in surgery.

In that declaration, efforts to prevent healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were not specifically highlighted. HAIs including surgical site infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection are the most common nosocomial infections. Healthcare-associated infections continue to be of significant importance in surgical patients.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and indirect costs globally. However, knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of infection prevention and control measures vary significantly among surgeons. Most significantly, a gap seems to exist between best evidence and clinical practice with regard to SSIs prevention.

The World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and a combined effort by the American College of Surgeons/Surgical Infection Society have recently published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. Despite clear evidence and guidelines to direct SSIs prevention strategies, compliance is unacceptably poor.

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) is a cornerstone of SSIs prevention. The use of PAP contributes considerably to the total amount of antibiotics used in hospitals worldwide. PAP has been shown to be an effective measure for the prevention of SSIs, but its use should be limited to specific, well-accepted indications to avoid cost, toxicity, and antimicrobial resistance, and should never substitute for the good medical practice of infection prevention and control. Guidelines stress the importance of cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis immediately after surgery and refrain from the extension of prophylaxis outside the operating theater. High rates of inappropriate use of prophylactic antibiotics in surgery continue to be reported in the literature. In Appendix 1, seven strategies for correct antibiotic prophylaxis are illustrated.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^112uHZBe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) is the primary organization responsible for brain injury-related guidelines; however, they have not yet published guidelines related to the management of penetrating brain injury (including antibiotic prophylaxis). A Penetrating Brain Injury Expert Workgroup consisting of a collaboration between the BTF along with military and civilian experts has convened and guidelines to address this issue are expected to be published in the near future. Thus, current recommendations are considerations based on military consensus and retrospective civilian studies. Antibiotic use for external ventricular drainage (EVD), ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts and their associated infection risk are discussed in the other articles in this series, Fever and Infections in Surgical Intensive Care and Surgical and Procedural Antibiotic Prophylaxis in the Surgical ICU by Nohra et al and Farrell et al, respectively.

Penetrating spine injury

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of penetrating spine injury?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics, no longer than 48 hours, are recommended for low-velocity gunshot wounds (GSW) to the spine (table 2).

Discussion: There has long been clinical concern regarding GSWs to the spine, especially those with gastrointestinal involvement, and the potential to develop spinal or paraspinal infections. As a result, much of the spine literature has advocated prolonged courses of 'prophylactic' antibiotics lasting up to 14 days to prevent infection with the greatest concern involving transcolonic injuries. As no prospective studies exist, these recommendations are based on clinical judgment, older retrospective studies and case series that are underpowered and use varying antibiotic courses lasting up to 6 weeks. The incidence of infection without antibiotic use after penetrating injury is not known which further hampers the interpretation of any available information regarding the necessity or duration of antibiotic use. Additionally, there is very little information regarding stab wounds to the spine and the necessity of antimicrobial prophylaxis.

### Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis and risk for postoperative antibiotic-resistant infections [^112LwM6j]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic-resistant infections have high rates of morbidity and mortality, and exposure to antibiotics is the crucial risk factor for development of antibiotic resistance. If surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) increases risk for antibiotic-resistant infections, prophylaxis may cause net harm, even if it decreases overall infection rates.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included adults who underwent elective surgical procedures and developed infections within 30 postoperative days. Procedures from multiple disciplines were included if SAP was considered discretionary by current guidelines. Postoperative antibiotic-resistant infections were defined as positive culture results from any site within 30 postoperative days, showing intermediate or nonsusceptibility across 1 or more antibiotic classes. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis included use of antibiotics within any class and at any dose from 1 hour before first incision until the end of the operation.

Results

Among 689 adults with postoperative infections, 338 (49%) had postoperative resistant infections. Use of SAP was not associated with postoperative antibiotic-resistant infections (odds ratio [OR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.46). This result remained robust when the SAP definition was extended to antibiotics given within 4 hours before first incision (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.40) and when the follow-up window was narrowed to 14 days (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.34). Previous antibiotic-resistant infections were associated with risk for postoperative antibiotic-resistant infections (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.83).

Conclusions

Use of SAP was not associated with risk for postoperative antibiotic-resistant infections in a large cohort of patients with postoperative infections. This provides important reassurance regarding use of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Effect of postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of surgical site infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112oRfv6]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Antibiotic prophylaxis is frequently continued for 1 day or more after surgery to prevent surgical site infection. Continuing antibiotic prophylaxis after an operation might have no advantage compared with its immediate discontinuation, and it unnecessarily exposes patients to risks associated with antibiotic use. In 2016, WHO recommended discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery. We aimed to update the evidence that formed the basis for that recommendation.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and WHO regional medical databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis that were published from Jan 1, 1990, to July 24, 2018. RCTs comparing the effect of postoperative continuation versus discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of surgical site infection in patients undergoing any surgical procedure with an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis were eligible. The primary outcome was the effect of postoperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis continuation versus its immediate discontinuation on the occurrence of surgical site infection, with a prespecified subgroup analysis for studies that did and did not adhere to current best practice standards for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. We calculated summary relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs using a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird). We evaluated heterogeneity with the χ² test, I², and τ², and visually assesed publication bias with a contour-enhanced funnel plot. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017060829.

Findings

We identified 83 relevant RCTs, of which 52 RCTs with 19273 participants were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled RR of surgical site infection with postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis versus its immediate discontinuation was 0.89 (95% CI 0.79–1.00), with low heterogeneity in effect size between studies (τ² = 0.001, χ² p = 0.46, I² = 0.7%). Our prespecified subgroup analysis showed a significant association between the effect estimate and adherence to best practice standards of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: the RR of surgical site infection was reduced with continued antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery compared with its immediate discontinuation in trials that did not meet best practice standards (0.79 [95% CI 0.67–0.94]) but not in trials that did (1.04 [0.85–1.27]; p = 0.048). Whether studies adhered to best practice standards explained all variance in the pooled estimate from the primary meta-analysis.

Interpretation

Overall, we identified no conclusive evidence for a benefit of postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis over its discontinuation. When best practice standards were followed, postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis did not yield any additional benefit in reducing the incidence of surgical site infection. These findings support WHO recommendations against this practice.

### Adherence to guidelines for the administration of intraoperative antibiotics in a nationwide US sample [^111jG19D]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are currently the leading cause of health care–related infections and unplanned hospital readmissions among surgical patients. Surgical site infections affect about 125 000 surgical cases annually, accounting for nearly 1 million excess hospital days and approximately $1.6 billion in annual incremental health care costs. Reduction of SSIs continues to be a major priority area in health care improvement because these events take a substantial toll on public health and health care resources. It is estimated that half of SSIs are preventable, and efforts directed at the prevention of SSIs have been declared a priority objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services. However, over the past several years, SSI rates have remained stagnant despite the introduction of specific measures and surveillance programs geared toward SSI reduction.

The etiology of SSIs is multifactorial, and although not all risk factors are modifiable, the inappropriate administration of perioperative antibiotics has the potential to contribute to the problem. Importantly, antibiotic management represents a potentially modifiable risk factor. The critical role of appropriate perioperative antibiotics in preventing SSIs has been well established, and has been among the key initiatives of the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP). The SCIP guidelines primarily focus on timing of antibiotics prior to surgery and antibiotic choice for a subset of selected surgical procedures. Whereas the SCIP antibiotic metrics have been a major focus of quality improvement efforts, little information has been reported regarding adherence to additional recommendations contained in the more extensive guidelines endorsed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. The salient features of these guidelines for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis include choice of antibiotics tailored to type of surgery, weight-based antibiotic dose adjustment, completion of antibiotic administration prior to skin incision, and intraoperative redosing at specific intervals. The primary objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of guideline adherent practices for antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery among centers participating in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) consortium, a large research and quality improvement consortium based at the University of Michigan.

### Surgical procedure… [^111gGzpE]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Selection and Administration of Antibiotics An appropriate prophylactic antibiotic should be effective against microorganisms anticipated to cause infection; achieve adequate local tissue levels; cause minimal side effects; be relatively inexpensive, and not be likely to select virulent organisms. The microbial context of the wound and the hospital environment may influence the choice of antibiotic, but coverage should primarily target those organisms known to cause postoperative infection. Neurosurgical Procedures Studies evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in neurosurgical procedures have shown variable results. The supportive data have recently been reviewed. 18, 20 Nonetheless, prophylaxis is currently recommended for craniotomy and shunt procedures. Coverage targets S. aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Various regimens have been assessed, ranging from combinations of cefazolin and gentamicin to single-agent therapy with cefazolin, vancomycin, piperacillin and cloxacillin. No particular regimen has been clearly demonstrated to be superior. Until further data are available, therapy with cefazolin is considered appropriate. 21, 22 In general, the strength of the recommendation is proportionate to the likelihood of encountering high numbers of microorganisms during the procedure. Pulmonary resection in cases of partial or complete obstruction of an airway is a procedure in which prophylaxis is clearly warranted. Likewise, prophylaxis is strongly recommended for procedures entailing entry into the esophagus. Although the range of microorganisms encountered in thoracic procedures is extensive, most are sensitive to cefazolin, which is the recommended agent. Cardiac Procedures Prophylaxis against S. aureus and S.

epidermidis is indicated for patients undergoing cardiac procedures. Although the risk of infection is low, the morbidity of mediastinitis or a sternal wound infection is great. Numerous studies have evaluated antibiotic regimens based on penicillin, first-generation cephalosporins, second-generation cephalosporins or vancomycin. 23, 24 Although prophylaxis is efficacious, clear superiority of a particular regimen has not been demonstrated. In certain cases, results were institution-dependent, with exceptionally high rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus or S. epidermidis. Such exceptions notwithstanding, cefazolin is an appropriate agent. Of particular relevance, cardiopulmonary bypass reduces the elimination of drugs, so additional intraoperative doses typically are not necessary. 4 Therefore, previous use of antacids, histamine blockers or a proton pump inhibitor qualifies the patient for prophylaxis.

Prophylaxis is also indicated for procedures treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Stasis also leads to an increase in bacterial counts, so prophylaxis is warranted in procedures to correct obstruction. In addition, the intrinsic risk of infection in patients with morbid obesity and advanced malignancy is sufficiently high to warrant prophylaxis in these cases. Although the local flora is altered in these patients, cefazolin provides adequate prophylaxis and is the recommended agent. 26, 27 Therefore, additional prophylaxis is recommended. Options include either intraluminal prophylaxis directed at aerobic and anaerobic bacteria or the parenteral administration of similarly active antibiotics immediately before the operation. 28 In general, the addition of intraluminal antibiotics reduces the risk of infection to approximately 9 percent or less, similar to the risk associated with parenteral administration alone.

### Conundrums in the surgical intensive care unit: fevers and antibiotic prophylaxis [^112K65zs]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The Critical Care Committee of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma has produced a series of Clinical Consensus Guidelines, the latest three of which focus on surgical infections and their treatment. The committee authors thoughtfully provide guiding commentary, especially in areas where strong evidence in the literature is lacking; that is, the unique space that these consensus guidelines fill. These latest guidelines cover the evaluation of fever and antibiotic prophylaxis after injury and peri-procedurally.

The authors eloquently provided a broad sweeping discussion on fever evaluation, including both infectious and non-infectious pathogenesis, which interestingly are a 50/50 split in occurrence in the surgical intensive care unit. The tension in the article — similar to that of caring for critically ill patients — lies in appropriately recognizing and treating sepsis, where we know that early antibiotics are essential in improving outcomes, and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use, in a world of growing antibiotic resistance primarily driven by overuse. Table 3 of the Norha et al article provides an excellent overview and quick reference that every surgical intensivist should have committed to memory or readily available for reference.

The consensus on post-injury antibiotic prophylaxis is underscored by the importance of targeted prophylaxis in trauma patients and balancing infection prevention with judicious antibiotic use. This practical guide categorizes recommendations by injury type and severity, further stratified by level of evidence. This consensus document is invaluable for trauma providers, streamlining antibiotic choices and ultimately optimizing patient care and minimizing the emergence of antibiotic resistance and should be incorporated into the practice management guidelines of each institution.

Lastly, the consensus on peri-procedural antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical intensive care unit is most notable for recommending a single pre-procedural dose of antibiotics for most procedures. For promptly treated traumatic bowel injuries, antibiotics should not be continued beyond 24 hours. Cefazolin is appropriate in most cases, but consideration should be given to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative/anaerobic coverage based on the surgical indication. As above, antibiotic stewardship is paramount to limiting unnecessary exposure and resistance in our highly susceptible surgical and trauma intensive care unit population.

### Surgical site infections [^112Mgd7V]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in postsurgical care. Risk for surgical site infection is multifactorial and includes a host of microbial, patient-related, and procedure-related factors. Prevention of surgical infection relies on optimization of patient factors and use of a variety of evidence-based pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures. At the forefront of these measures is antimicrobial prophylaxis, which has been shown to be effective at reducing risk of surgical site infection. As guidelines for prevention of surgical site infection become increasingly complex and nuanced, surgical infection outcomes are increasing tied to quality outcome and performances measures.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with a history of total joint replacement [^117BsDPy]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

As the population ages and people remain active into the 7th and 8th decades of life, the frequency of total joint replacement is increasing. Following joint replacement surgery, patients inevitably require various invasive procedures as part of their routine health maintenance, including, but not limited to, dental care, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, and cardiac catheterization. There is scant evidence to support the use of periprocedural prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of late total joint infection. The guidelines for the usage of periprocedural antibiotics have changed as knowledge of the pathophysiology of joint infection has evolved. We review the current recommendations from subspecialty academic organizations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing routine urologic, gastrointestinal, dental, and cardiac procedures after total joint replacement.

Open abdomen

Question: is prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis required in the setting of an open abdomen?

Recommendation

In patients who are managed with an open abdomen, no specific antimicrobial prophylaxis is required beyond that for standard laparotomy. More extensive antibiotic courses should be directed toward the underlying reason for the laparotomy and procedures performed.

Discussion

After the sentinel article "Damage control': an approach for improved survival in exsanguinating penetrating abdominal injury', the open abdomen for trauma and emergency general surgery patients has become increasingly more common. Limited data suggest that no additional antimicrobial coverage is required and may even be associated with worse infectious outcomes for patients with an open abdomen. Sava et al recently reviewed management of the open abdomen and agreed that there is no role for routine antibiotic administration for open abdomen after trauma. Therefore, the choice and duration of antibiotics should be directed at the underlying cause of the laparotomy. For example, as discussed in the Traumatic bowel injury section of this document, antibiotics for isolated bowel injury can be limited to 24 hours in most populations. If the laparotomy was performed for an intra-abdominal infection, prophylactic antibiotics are inadequate and the type and duration should be directed by the appropriate guidelines once source control has been achieved specific to the established intra-abdominal infection.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in breast cancer surgery (PAUS trial): randomised clinical double-blind parallel-group multicentre superiority trial [^113xwxym]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A postoperative wound infection is not only a significant complication for an individual patient, but also leads to human, financial, and resource costs to health services. An infection after breast cancer surgery may also cause delays in the initiation of adjuvant therapy, with potential effects on survival. Although wound infection rates after breast cancer surgery are higher than expected (0 to 29 per cent), when compared to other clean surgeries (1 to 2 per cent), there still remains controversy regarding the value of prophylactic antibiotics. The majority of postoperative wound infections occur in the first 30 days following surgery (98 per cent).

The Association of Breast Surgery and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) currently recommends that antibiotics should be 'considered' in breast cancer surgery. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that local protocols should apply. In clinical practice there is currently no consensus about prophylactic antibiotics in breast cancer surgery, and there have been no new trials published in the last 15 years. Moreover, there are no current recommendations about what specific antibiotic should be used for prophylaxis in breast cancer surgery.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery carries a risk of adverse events, including Clostridium difficile infection, and it increases the prevalence of multiresistant organisms. Over the last 15 years, global antibiotic overuse has accelerated antimicrobial resistance. This has led to a growing number of common infections becoming harder to treat. The UK Department of Health antimicrobial resistance strategy (2013 to 2018) encourages evidence-based antibiotic use. It is therefore very important to avoid prophylactic antibiotics in surgery unless they have a proven benefit. The present study set out to clarify whether, in patients undergoing primary breast cancer surgery, a single dose of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid would reduce wound infection at 30 days after surgery, and to identify risk factors for postoperative infection.

### Does duration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis matter in cardiac surgery? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tiVu9]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to compare the efficacy of short-term (< 24 hours) versus longer-term antibiotic prophylaxis (≥ 24 hours) in open heart surgery.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis for adults undergoing cardiac surgery is unknown and guideline recommendations are inconsistent.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL for parallel-group randomized trials comparing any antibiotic prophylaxis administered for < 24 hours to any antibiotic prophylaxis for ≥ 24 hours in adult patients undergoing open heart surgery. Reference lists of selected articles, clinical practice guidelines, review articles, and congress abstracts were searched. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by 2 reviewers.

Results

Of the 1338 citations identified by our search strategy, 12 studies involving 7893 patients were selected. Compared with short-term antibiotic prophylaxis, longer-term antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of sternal surgical site infection (SSI) by 38% (risk ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.69, P = 0.002) and deep sternal SSI by 68% (risk ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.12–2.53, P = 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in mortality, infections overall and adverse events. Eleven of the trials were at high risk for bias due to limitations in study design.

Conclusions

Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ≥ 24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to shorter regimens. The findings however are limited by the heterogeneity of antibiotic regimens used and the risk of bias in the published studies.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^114bA594]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

E. Comparing the prevalence of rare events — When infections are uncommon, comparing prevalence between two groups requires large sample sizes, and the two prevalences are considered significantly different when the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap; in an example with p₁ = 2% and p₂ = 6%, the worked calculation gives n = 342.5, while the text states n needs to be larger than 343, effectively 350 in round numbers, characterizing this as prohibitively large and noting it would require deliberately exposing 0.06 × 343 = 21 patients to infection.

### Perioperative antibiotic use of dermatologic surgeons in 2012 [^115jwf6D]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery have been established, but there is variability in perioperative antibiotic use of dermatologists. Authoritative guidelines have shifted away from routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis because there is no conclusive evidence that antibiotic use reduces risk of infective endocarditis or prosthetic joint infection.

Objective

To determine current practices of perioperative antibiotic use of Mohs-trained surgeons and to compare patterns of use with updated administration guidelines.

Methods and Materials

A survey was sent to American College of Mohs Surgery members in 2012. The main outcome measures were survey responses relating to demographic characteristics, experience with postoperative infection, familiarity with antibiotic guidelines, perioperative antibiotic practices, attitudes regarding antibiotic use, and antibiotic selection.

Results

Most survey respondents are familiar with the Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Dermatologic Surgery Advisory Statement 2008, but respondents give antibiotics for more indications than are recommended. Although not recommended, a high percentage reported giving antibiotics to patients at high risk of infective endocarditis or joint infection even when surgery does not breach oral mucosa or involve infected skin.

Conclusion

Dermatologic surgeons overuse perioperative antibiotics for prevention of surgical site infection, infective endocarditis, and prosthetic joint infection based on current recommendations.
