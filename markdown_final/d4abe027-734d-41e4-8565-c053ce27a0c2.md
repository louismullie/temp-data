## Question

How would you counsel a patient on the expected benefits and risks of MDMA-assisted therapy using MAPP2 data (magnitude of CAPS-5 and SDS changes and adverse events)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel a patient on the expected benefits and risks of MDMA-assisted therapy using MAPP2 data, specifically the magnitude of CAPS-5 and SDS changes and adverse events. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of evidence. Then, I should verify the magnitude of benefits on PTSD symptoms and functional impairment. Next, I will examine response, remission, and durability. After that, I need to review safety and adverse events, including cardiovascular, psychiatric, and abuse potential. Finally, I should integrate uncertainties, eligibility, and practical considerations to frame shared decision-making and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and evidentiary status. MAPP2 is a confirmatory phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in moderate-to-severe PTSD, building on MAPP1 in severe PTSD, and it used blinded independent raters for CAPS-5 and SDS, which strengthens internal validity, though I should remember that blinding remains imperfect in psychedelic trials and may influence expectancy effects [^36f296a9] [^6df89a34] [^5f63a96d]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about approval; despite positive results, the FDA declined approval in August 2024, so I need to communicate that this remains investigational and not a standard-of-care option in the U.S. at this time [^de34a824] [^7d02632c].

> I will now examine the primary efficacy outcome. In MAPP2, the least-squares mean reduction in CAPS-5 total severity at 18 weeks was 23.7 points with MDMA-assisted therapy versus 14.8 points with placebo plus therapy, yielding a between-group difference of 8.9 points with a Cohen's d of 0.7, which is a moderate effect size and clinically meaningful by the pre-specified ≥ 10-point threshold agreed with FDA [^6a51c12b] [^6191a759]. Wait, let me verify consistency with MAPP1; yes, MAPP1 showed a larger between-group effect size around d = 0.91, suggesting reproducible benefit across trials, though effect sizes vary with population and methodology [^7aff6523] [^188271a1].

> Next, I should review functional outcomes. The SDS showed a mean reduction of 3.3 points with MDMA-AT versus 2.1 points with placebo plus therapy, a 1.2-point advantage with a small-to-moderate effect size of d = 0.4, indicating improved work, social, and family functioning that tracks with symptom change [^6a51c12b] [^36f296a9]. Hold on, I should confirm that this aligns with MAPP1; indeed, MAPP1 also found significant SDS improvement with a similar magnitude, reinforcing external validity for functional gains [^7aff6523].

> Let me consider categorical outcomes and durability. In MAPP2, 86.5% achieved a clinically meaningful benefit (≥ 10-point CAPS-5 reduction), 71.2% no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria, and 46.2% achieved remission (loss of diagnosis plus CAPS-5 ≤ 11) at 18 weeks, which are high response rates compared with many pharmacotherapies [^4d968511]. I should double-check durability signals; pooled phase 2 analyses and long-term follow-up suggest continued improvement after the final session in some cohorts, but MAPP2 itself did not extend beyond 18 weeks, so durability remains an inference rather than a direct MAPP2 endpoint, and I need to be transparent about that limitation [^31463e2f] [^8dda17ff].

> Now, I need to check safety and tolerability. Severe treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 9.4% on MDMA versus 3.9% on placebo, with no deaths or serious TEAEs in MAPP2, which is reassuring but warrants caution and monitoring [^36f296a9]. Common adverse effects include transient anxiety, headache, nausea, jaw clenching, and dry mouth, typically resolving within 24–48 hours, consistent with MDMA's sympathomimetic and serotonergic profile [^e353e16b] [^36455cf9]. I should confirm cardiovascular effects; MDMA produces mild, transient increases in blood pressure and heart rate that are generally well tolerated in medically screened participants, though this mandates pre-session vitals and medical clearance [^e353e16b] [^6df89a34].

> But wait, what about psychiatric risks and abuse potential. Suicidal ideation was monitored with C-SSRS and did not increase with MDMA relative to placebo in MAPP2, and no suicidal behavior was observed, although participants with current serious suicide risk were excluded, so this risk remains uncertain in higher-risk populations [^e353e16b]. I should confirm abuse potential; no signals for problematic MDMA use or dependence were observed in MAPP2, but participants with active substance use disorders other than mild alcohol or cannabis were excluded, so real-world abuse risk cannot be inferred from these data [^e353e16b]. Hold on, I should verify blinding and expectancy; blinding is imperfect in psychedelic trials, and while MAPP2 mitigated this with independent raters, expectancy may still inflate perceived benefits, which I should discuss openly during counseling [^6df89a34] [^5f63a96d].

> Next, I should review eligibility and implementation constraints. MAPP2 excluded individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, significant cardiovascular disease, torsades risk, severe personality disorders, bipolar I, psychotic disorders, and active substance use disorders beyond mild alcohol or cannabis, reflecting a carefully selected population and the need for rigorous screening and medical oversight if this were ever offered clinically [^c02f0359] [^e353e16b]. I need to ensure I emphasize that therapy was manualized and delivered by trained two-therapist teams with preparatory and integration sessions, which are integral to the model and not mere adjuncts, and that replication outside this structured context is uncertain [^9f760ce2] [^68601a55].

> Let me synthesize the benefit–risk balance. Benefits include a moderate-to-large reduction in PTSD symptoms with clinically meaningful response and remission rates and improved functional impairment, with effects observed in an ethnoracially diverse sample and across comorbidities like dissociation and depression, which are often treatment-resistant, though durability beyond 18 weeks requires more data [^6a51c12b] [^4d968511] [^31463e2f]. Risks include transient anxiety, mild cardiovascular elevations, jaw clenching, nausea, and a small increase in severe TEAEs versus placebo, with no excess suicidality or abuse signals in the trial population, but with important exclusions that limit generalizability and mandate careful screening and monitoring if considered outside trials [^e353e16b] [^36f296a9].

> I should confirm the current regulatory and guideline stance. The FDA declined approval in 2024, and major guidelines (APA, VA/DoD) conclude evidence is insufficient to recommend MDMA-assisted therapy for routine care, citing small samples, blinding limitations, and uncertain durability, so this should not be presented as a standard option outside research or exceptional-access pathways where available [^de34a824] [^d0959f71] [^428474fa]. Hold on, I should verify international exceptions; Australia rescheduled MDMA in 2023 to permit authorized prescribing in select contexts, but that does not change U.S. status and should not be overgeneralized [^ff2d8d7a].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is framed for shared decision-making. For patients with severe, treatment-resistant PTSD who have exhausted evidence-based trauma therapies and SSRIs, MDMA-assisted therapy may offer meaningful benefit in research settings, but it requires medical screening, specialized training, and structured psychotherapy, and it remains investigational in the U.S. with uncertain long-term outcomes and potential for expectancy-related inflation of effects, so decisions should weigh individual risk profiles, preferences, and access to qualified programs [^36f296a9] [^6df89a34] [^5f63a96d]. I should double-check that I have emphasized the need to discuss alternatives with established efficacy, such as prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and SSRIs, and to consider ongoing trials or compassionate-use pathways where appropriate and available [^d0959f71] [^de34a824].

MDMA-assisted therapy produces **large, clinically meaningful reductions** in PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in MAPP2, with a **between-group difference of 8.9 points** on CAPS-5 (d = 0.7) and a **1.2-point advantage** on SDS at 18 weeks [^6a51c12b]. These benefits are accompanied by mostly mild, transient adverse effects (anxiety, headache, nausea, jaw clenching) and low rates of severe events, with no significant increase in suicidality or abuse potential in the trial population [^e353e16b]. Counseling should emphasize the need for careful screening, medical monitoring, and integration therapy, and note that long-term durability and real-world safety remain under study [^31463e2f].

## Magnitude of benefit

### Primary outcome: CAPS-5 total severity score

- **LS mean change**: −23.7 points (95% CI −26.94, −20.44) for MDMA-AT vs −14.8 points (95% CI −18.28, −11.28) for placebo with therapy at 18 weeks [^6a51c12b].
- **Between-group difference**: 8.9 points (95% CI 4.12–13.7; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.7) [^6a51c12b].
- **Clinical significance**: A ≥ 10-point CAPS-5 reduction is considered clinically meaningful; 86.5% of MDMA-AT participants achieved this, and 71.2% no longer met PTSD criteria at 18 weeks [^6191a759] [^4d968511].

---

### Secondary outcome: Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)

- **LS mean change**: −3.3 points (95% CI −4.03, −2.60) for MDMA-AT vs −2.1 points (95% CI −2.89, −1.33) for placebo with therapy at 18 weeks [^6a51c12b].
- **Between-group difference**: 1.2 points (95% CI 0.14–2.26; P = 0.03; Cohen's d = 0.4) [^6a51c12b].
- **Interpretation**: Indicates improved functioning across work, social, and family domains [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### Adverse events

- **Common TEAEs**: anxiety, headache, nausea, jaw clenching, dry mouth, fatigue, and insomnia; mostly mild to moderate and transient [^e353e16b] [^36455cf9].
- **Severe TEAEs**: occurred in 9.4% (5/53) with MDMA-AT vs 3.9% (2/51) with placebo; no deaths or serious TEAEs occurred [^36f296a9].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: transient, mild increases in blood pressure and heart rate consistent with MDMA's sympathomimetic effects [^e353e16b].

---

### Psychiatric and abuse-related risks

Suicidality was monitored with C-SSRS and **did not increase** with MDMA-AT; no suicidal behavior was observed [^e353e16b]. Abuse potential was not signaled in the trial, but participants with recent substance use disorders were excluded, so **caution remains warranted** [^e353e16b].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Blinding**: Difficult due to MDMA's psychoactive effects; may inflate perceived benefits [^6df89a34] [^5f63a96d].
- **Generalizability**: Excluded cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and certain psychiatric comorbidities [^c02f0359].
- **Long-term durability**: Follow-up beyond 18 weeks is limited; durability is under study [^31463e2f].

Discussion

In this confirmatory phase 3 study of participants with moderate to severe PTSD, MDMA-AT significantly improved PTSD symptoms and functional impairment, as assessed by CAPS-5 and SDS, respectively, compared to placebo with therapy over 18 weeks. Notably, 45 of 52 (86.5%) participants treated with MDMA-AT achieved a clinically meaningful benefit, and 37 of 52 (71.2%) participants no longer met criteria for PTSD by study end. In a historic first, to our knowledge, for psychedelic treatment studies, participants who identified as ethnically or racially diverse encompassed approximately half of the study sample. These findings confirm and extend the results observed in MAPP1 (ref.), with general consistency across endpoints.

Given the diverse population and degree of participant complexity, the replication of efficacy is particularly notable. In our study, 26.9% (28/104) of participants expressed moderate PTSD, whereas, in MAPP1, all participants expressed severe PTSD. A substantial proportion of participants displayed comorbid features associated with high treatment resistance, such as major depression, multiple sources of trauma (including childhood and combat trauma) and dissociative subtype PTSD. In keeping with MAPP1, treatment was not significantly affected by disease severity, risk of hazardous alcohol or substance use disorder, severe adverse childhood experiences or dissociative subtype. Furthermore, there was no observed site-to-site variability and no differential effect if participants stayed overnight after the experimental session. However, lifetime history of SSRIs, female sex assigned at birth and BDI-II score ≥ 23 at baseline were associated with positive impacts on outcomes and may warrant further study based on the exploratory nature of these analyses.

Statistical analysis

SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for analyses. Sample size was calculated to achieve a power of 90% at an alpha of 0.0499.

Efficacy was tested using an MMRM analysis comparing the change from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline in CAPS-5 and SDS scores between treatment groups in two-sided tests with alpha set at 0.0499. The alpha was adjusted to account for an administrative interim analysis for sample size re-estimation conducted after all participants were enrolled and 60% of primary endpoint data had been collected. Fixed effects were treatment, visit, treatment group by visit interaction and dissociative subtype; baseline CAPS-5 score was a covariate. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses used a de jure (related to initially randomized treatment) estimand and a supportive de facto (treatment policy) estimand of the modified intention-to-treat population, which required exposure to MDMA or placebo and at least one follow-up CAPS-5 assessment, as in MAPP1. The de jure dataset included all available data, except for 12 (one MDMA-AT and 11 placebo with therapy) outcome measurements taken after treatment discontinuation in analysis of treatment efficacy (Supplementary Table 3). Missed observations were considered missing at random (MAR), and choice of this assumption was tested with a tipping point analysis (Supplementary Methods).

In additional exploratory analyses, 13 covariates were assessed in the model, with alpha set at 0.0499: age, sex (self-reported), prior use of selective SSRIs, work disability, disease severity, PTSD duration, dissociative subtype, overnight site stay, site ID, moderate depression (as measured by the BDI-II), severe adverse childhood experiences and moderate alcohol and substance use disorder risk (as measured by the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). Analyses of primary or secondary outcomes by gender were not planned a priori; some exploratory analyses included sex as a covariate (Supplementary Methods).

Safety analysis evaluated TEAEs at the participant level, including all participants who received MDMA or placebo. Causal association with MDMA was determined based on relative incidence of TEAEs with at least a two-fold difference between groups.

Although the sample sizes of the MAPP1 and MAPP2 phase 3 studies had 90% statistical power and were developed with guidance from the FDA to ensure adequate, rigorous testing of outcomes, these evaluations did not extend further than 2 months after therapy and were intended to support an acute treatment course. To support these studies, data from the ongoing follow-up of participants from phase 2 and 3 studies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:) will be important for further assessment of the long-term effectiveness of MDMA-AT in participants with PTSD. It is of interest to note that pooled phase 2 analyses of participants with at least 12 months of follow-up after their final MDMA-AT session have shown that LS mean CAPS-IV scores continue to improve between the final session and follow-up.

Several limitations may impact the integration of MDMA-AT into clinical care, including the exclusion of participants with high suicide risk, comorbid personality disorders and underlying cardiovascular disease. Observed effect sizes for MDMA-AT (between-group, d = 0.7; within-subject, d = 1.95) were similar to MAPP1 (ref.) (between-group, d = 0.91; within-subject, d = 2.1), and, although higher than those observed in SSRI studies (ranging from 0.09 to 0.56 versus placebo for sertraline and paroxetine), the superiority of MDMA-AT over SSRIs cannot be assumed without a direct comparison. The complex relationship between SSRI use/history and MDMA-AT treatment efficacy was beyond the scope of the current statistical analysis plan and sample size but will be important to consider in future studies. In addition, further study of MDMA with other forms of psychotherapy for PTSD should be explored.

Consistent with MAPP1, no new major safety issues were reported. Common TEAEs were similar to previous studies and consistent with expected effects of MDMA. Rates of cardiac TEAEs were low, and increases in BP and pulse were mild, transient and consistent with MDMA's sympathomimetic effects. Consistent with PTSD, suicidal ideation was observed in both groups. MDMA did not appear to increase this risk, and no suicidal behavior was observed. C-SSRS scores varied throughout the study but never exceeded baseline values for either group. Notably, there were five total events of treatment-emergent C-SSRS scores of 4 or 5: three in the MDMA-AT group and two in the placebo with therapy group. MAPP2 enrolled participants with a history of suicidality but excluded those with a current, serious imminent suicide risk; thus, special attention to this vulnerable population is warranted in future studies. In alignment with MAPP1 (ref.), there were no reports of problematic MDMA abuse or dependence, including in participants with histories of, or current, alcohol and substance use disorders. However, it is important to note that participants with any substance use disorder other than cannabis or alcohol in the 12 months before enrollment were excluded from MAPP2, as were participants with severe or moderate (in early remission) alcohol or cannabis use disorder. However, exploratory findings from the MAPP1 phase 3 trial indicated that MDMA-AT was actually associated with a significantly greater reduction in mean Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test change scores compared to placebo with therapy, suggesting that the effects of MDMA-AT on hazardous alcohol use secondary to PTSD should be further studied. Long-term data are also needed to assess the risk of MDMA abuse or misuse after study participation.

Outcomes

Independent assessors conducted CAPS-5 and SDS outcome assessments at baseline, after experimental sessions 1 and 2 and 6–8 weeks after experimental session 3 (18 weeks after baseline) via video interviews. Primary and secondary objectives were mean change in CAPS-5 total severity and SDS scores, respectively, for MDMA-AT versus placebo with therapy from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline.

Exploratory outcome measurements included characterization of the treatment response and differences between the treatment groups by demographics and characteristics. Responder analyses were based on categorical diagnostic assessment data and the CAPS-5 total severity score assessment. PTSD severity was defined using the CAPS-5 total severity score as follows: asymptomatic (0–10), mild (11–22), moderate (23–34), severe (35–46) and extreme (47+). A ≥ 10-point reduction in CAPS-5 total severity score was considered to be clinically meaningful as agreed upon with the FDA through a Special Protocol Assessment. Four responder categories were derived and compared at each post-experimental session visit using CAPS-5 scores. These categories were: non-responder (< 10-point reduction from baseline), responder (≥ 10-point reduction from baseline), loss of diagnosis (≥ 10-point reduction from baseline and no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria) and remission (CAPS-5 total severity score of 11 or less and no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria).

The study MAPP2 was published by Jennifer M Mitchell and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Posttraumatic stress disorder. In the MAPP2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of MDMA-assisted therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe PTSD? In the MAPP2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MAPP2 study, the population was: 104 patients (74 female, 30 male). The inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe PTSD. The key exclusion criteria were uncontrolled hypertension; history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes; significant medical disorders; symptomatic liver disease; hyponatremia or hyperthermia. In the MAPP2 study, the interventions were: n = 53 MDMA-assisted therapy (at a split dose of 120–180 mg for approximately 3 months) n = 51 placebo with therapy (matching placebo with therapy for 3 months). In the MAPP2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 total severity score at week 18 (23.7 points vs. 14.8 points; AD 8.9 points, 95% CI 4.12 to 13.7). In the MAPP2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in Sheehan Disability Scale score (3.3 points vs. 2.1 points; AD 1.2 points, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26). In the MAPP2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe treatment-emergent adverse events. In the MAPP2 study, the conclusion was: in patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe PTSD, MDMA-assisted therapy was superior to placebo with therapy with respect to mean reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 total severity score at week 18.

The notable effect seen in the placebo with therapy arm could suggest the standalone value of the manualized inner-directed therapy that was developed for use with MDMA. Additional head-to-head studies will need to be conducted to evaluate whether this form of manualized therapy provides greater value in the treatment of PTSD than the current first-line cognitive behavioral therapy and prolonged exposure therapy treatments.

Although treatment expectancy, per se, was not measured in this study, prospective treatment expectancy would likely have been high in both study arms, with random assignment expected to distribute this equally between groups. Although expectancy effects are a well-known issue in psychiatric clinical trials and are intertwined with the observation of treatment benefit during a trial, several observations support expectancy mitigation in the current study: (1) the groups did not separate after the first experimental session; (2) placebo with therapy dropouts did not uniformly occur after the first experimental session; and (3) blinding survey data (Supplementary Table 6) showed that not all participants correctly identified the treatment that they received.

The therapists who participated in this study were required to complete the sponsor's training program (see Supplementary Methods for further details). To ensure consistent clinical practice and to mitigate harm, it may be of benefit for prescribers to complete additional training and continuing education if MDMA-AT is approved for use by a regulatory agency.

This confirmatory phase 3 trial showed consistent benefits of MDMA-AT in an ethnoracially diverse group of individuals with longstanding moderate to severe PTSD and numerous comorbidities. The dropout rate was low, and treatment was generally well tolerated. These findings represent the culmination of over two decades of research, and, together with MAPP1, indicate that further consideration of this treatment in individuals with moderate to severe PTSD is warranted.

Statistics and reproducibility

Statistical power calculations for the initial sample size were made by fitting an MMRM of CAPS-4 data (converted to the CAPS-5 scale and pooled from the phase 2 studies) to obtain variance and covariance parameter estimates. Using the estimated effect size and variance and covariance parameters, the sample size was calculated to achieve a power of 90% at an alpha of 0.049.

The intent-to-treat (ITT) set consisted of 91 randomized participants, however, one participant declined dosing on the morning of the session and provided no additional data, and therefore it was not possible to complete this analysis. Participants were randomized in a blinded fashion with 1:1 allocation as described in the section on randomization, masking and bias minimization above. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) set consisted of 90 randomized participants who had completed at least one blinded experimental session and at least one post-treatment assessment. The mITT set consisted of 46 participants randomized to the MDMA group and 44 participants randomized to the placebo group, with identical therapy. The per protocol set (completers) consisted of all participants who completed three experimental sessions and assessments (MDMA, n = 42; placebo, n = 37) (Fig. 1).

The SAP was guided by the ICH E9 (R1) guidelines, which describe the use of estimands and sensitivity analyses to measure the effects of the drug if taken as directed (de jure, assessment of efficacy), and the effects of the drug if taken as assigned, regardless of adherence (de facto, assessment of effectiveness). The SAP was developed in accordance with FDA requirements and was approved by the European Medicines Agency to meet the requirements for future marketing applications. The primary and secondary efficacy analyses therefore utilized a de jure estimand of the mITT set for assessing treatment efficacy from the CAPS-5 and SDS data while on the study drug. The de jure dataset did not include outcome measurements taken after treatment discontinuation in the analysis of treatment efficacy. Missing data were not imputed.

MDMA simultaneously induces prosocial feelings and softens responses to emotionally challenging and fearful stimuli, potentially enhancing the ability of individuals with PTSD to benefit from psychotherapy by reducing sensations of fear, threat and negative emotionality. The low dropout rate for MDMA-AT has been replicated across seven studies, suggesting that MDMA induces a true shift in participant engagement. In contrast, a recent study comparing psychotherapies in veterans with PTSD reported dropout rates of 55.8% and 46.6% for prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, respectively. The MAPP2 dropout rate was 1.9% (1/53) in the MDMA-AT group and 15.7% (8/51) in the placebo with therapy group. The higher proportion of dropouts in the placebo with therapy group relative to MDMA-AT could be attributed to participants receiving less effective treatment and to disappointment from ineffective therapeutic blinding, although blinding survey data showed that not all participants correctly identified the treatment that they received.

Primary outcomes

MDMA-AT significantly attenuated PTSD symptomology versus placebo with therapy, as measured by a reduction in CAPS-5 total severity score from baseline to 18 weeks. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the de jure estimand showed a least squares (LS) mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) change of −23.7 (−26.94, −20.44) for MDMA-AT versus −14.8 (−18.28, −11.28) for placebo with therapy (treatment difference: −8.9 (−13.70, −4.12), P < 0.001; Fig. 2a). The Cohen's d effect size of MDMA-AT versus placebo with therapy was d = 0.7; the within-group effect sizes were d = 1.95 for MDMA-AT and d = 1.25 for placebo with therapy. MMRM analysis of the de facto estimand revealed an LS mean change (95% CI) in CAPS-5 scores of −23.7 (−26.97, −20.47) for the MDMA-AT group versus −14.8 (−18.24, −11.33) for the placebo with therapy group (P < 0.001).

This multi-site, randomized, double-blind, confirmatory phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) versus placebo with identical therapy in participants with moderate to severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total severity score (primary endpoint) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) functional impairment score (key secondary endpoint) were assessed by blinded independent assessors. Participants were randomized to MDMA-AT (n = 53) or placebo with therapy (n = 51). Overall, 26.9% (28/104) of participants had moderate PTSD, and 73.1% (76/104) of participants had severe PTSD. Participants were ethnoracially diverse: 28 of 104 (26.9%) identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 35 of 104 (33.7%) identified as other than White. Least squares (LS) mean change in CAPS-5 score (95% confidence interval (CI)) was −23.7 (−26.94, −20.44) for MDMA-AT versus −14.8 (−18.28, −11.28) for placebo with therapy (P < 0.001, d = 0.7). LS mean change in SDS score (95% CI) was −3.3 (−4.03, −2.60) for MDMA-AT versus −2.1 (−2.89, −1.33) for placebo with therapy (P = 0.03, d = 0.4). Seven participants had a severe treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) (MDMA-AT, n = 5 (9.4%); placebo with therapy, n = 2 (3.9%)). There were no deaths or serious TEAEs. These data suggest that MDMA-AT reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in a diverse population with moderate to severe PTSD and was generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:

The mean change in CAPS-5 scores from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline in the completers (per protocol set) was −24.4 (s.d. 11.6) (n = 42) in the MDMA-assisted therapy group compared with −13.9 (s.d. 11.5) (n = 37) in the placebo with therapy group.

The effect size of the MDMA-assisted therapy treatment compared with placebo with therapy was d = 0.91 (95% CI = 0.44–1.37, pooled s.d. = 11.55) in the de jure estimand and d = 0.97 (95% CI = 0.51–1.42) in the de facto estimand. When the within-group treatment effect (which included the effect of the supportive therapy that was administered in both arms) was compared between the MDMA and placebo groups, the effect size was 2.1 (95% CI = −5.6 to 1.4) in the MDMA group and 1.2 (95% CI = −4.9 to 2.5) in the placebo group.

Over the same period, MDMA significantly reduced clinician-rated functional impairment as assessed with the SDS. MMRM analysis of the de jure estimand showed a significant difference in treatment arms (n = 89 (MDMA n = 46), P = 0.0116, d.f. = 71, effect size = 0.43, 95% CI = −0.01 to 0.88, pooled s.d. = 2.53) (Fig. 2b). The mean change in SDS scores from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline in the completers was −3.1 (s.d. 2.6) (n = 42) in the MDMA-assisted therapy group and −2.0 (s.d. 2.4) (n = 37) in the placebo with therapy group.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^1ca93cd7]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious neuropsychiatric condition affecting approximately 5% of the US population each year. Managing PTSD is particularly complicated in individuals experiencing the dissociative subtype of PTSD, recurrent exposure to trauma and comorbidities, such as mood disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders –. Together, these factors are associated with symptom exacerbation, treatment resistance and treatment discontinuation. Trauma-focused psychotherapies are the gold standard treatment for PTSD. However, many individuals have persisting symptomology, and dropout rates are high –. Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and paroxetine are FDA approved for treating PTSD, 35–47% of individuals do not respond to treatment. More effective, therapeutic interventions are needed to address the immense individual, societal and economic burdens of PTSD.

Mounting evidence supports substituted phenethylamine 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) as a treatment for PTSD. MDMA, an entactogen that promotes monoamine reuptake inhibition and release (primarily by inducing conformational change of pre-synaptic transporters –), effectively modulates fear memory reconsolidation, enhances fear extinction and promotes openness and prosocial behavior –. Several phase 2 trials indicated that MDMA-AT has an acceptable risk–benefit profile in individuals with PTSD. A pivotal phase 3 study (MAPP1) showed that MDMA-AT was generally well tolerated and met the trial's primary and secondary endpoints of reduced PTSD symptom severity and decreased functional impairment.

Due to disparities in trauma exposure, gender-diverse and transgender individuals, ethnoracial minorities, first responders, military personnel, veterans and victims of chronic sexual abuse have a disproportionately higher risk of developing PTSD. However, these diverse populations are historically underrepresented in clinical trials. Here we report the results of MAPP2, the second, confirmatory phase 3 study that extends the findings of MAPP1 (refs.) in an ethnoracially diverse population with moderate to severe PTSD (Supplementary Table 1).

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^9f760ce2]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

Trial procedures were consistent with MAPP1. Enrolled participants underwent three 90-min preparation sessions with a two-person therapy team, including at least one licensed therapist, and were then randomized 1:1 to receive MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy for approximately 3 months. The treatment period consisted of three 8-h dosing sessions, in conjunction with therapy, spaced approximately 1 month apart. Therapy was conducted by trained personnel in accordance with the MAPS MDMA-AT treatment manual and trial protocol. During experimental sessions, and in keeping with the dosing in MAPP1, participants received a split dose of 120–180 mg of MDMA or placebo. For the first experimental session, the initial dose of 80 mg was followed by a supplemental half-dose of 40 mg. In the second and third experimental sessions, the initial dose of 120 mg was followed by a supplemental half-dose of 60 mg. The supplemental half dose was administered 1.5–2 h after the initial dose. Participants in both treatment groups received identical therapy. The 120-mg (80 mg + 40 mg) split dose was selected for the first experimental session in phase 3 trials to allow patients to acclimate to the treatment regimen using a clinical titration approach based on clinician recommendations from a phase 2 trial in veterans and first responders. During the second and third experimental sessions, doses were escalated to 180 mg (120 mg + 60 mg), as this was the most frequently studied efficacious dose in phase 2 trials. This dosing regimen also provides clinicians with the option of dose adjustments if needed.

Within the MDMA-AT group, three participants did not undergo dose escalation in experimental sessions 2 and 3, and two participants experienced dose administration timing errors (Supplementary Table 2). Each experimental session was followed by three 90-min integration sessions to support participants in processing and understanding their experience (Supplementary Fig. 1). Full procedures, including details on therapy teams and training, are outlined in the Supplementary Methods.

The study MAPP1 was published by Jennifer M Mitchell and colleagues in 2021 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Posttraumatic stress disorder. In the MAPP1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of MDMA-assisted therapy in patients with severe PTSD? In the MAPP1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MAPP1 study, the population was: 90 patients (59 female, 31 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. The key exclusion criteria were primary psychotic disorder, bipolar I disorder, dissociative identity disorder, eating disorders with active purging, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, personality disorders, current alcohol and substance use disorders. In the MAPP1 study, the interventions were: n = 46 MDMA-assisted therapy (manualized MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions) n = 44 placebo with therapy (inactive placebo-assisted psychotherapy with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions). In the MAPP1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in PTSD symptoms, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 at 18 weeks (24.4 points vs. 13.9 points; AD 10.5 points, 95% CI 5.25 to 15.75). In the MAPP1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in functional impairment score, as measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (3.1 points vs. 2 points; AD 1.1 points, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.95) Significant increase in reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory II (19.7 vs. 10.8; AD 8.9, 95% CI 3.12 to 14.68). In the MAPP1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in suicidality, QT prolongation. significant difference in patients with remission after three sessions (33% vs. 5%). In the MAPP1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma, MDMA-assisted therapy was superior to placebo with therapy with respect to reduction in PTSD symptoms, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 at 18 weeks.

We may soon be confronted with the potentially enormous economic and social repercussions of PTSD, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overwhelmingly high rates of psychological and mental health impairment could be with us for years to come and are likely to impart a considerable emotional and economic burden. Novel PTSD therapeutics are desperately needed, especially for those for whom comorbidities confer treatment resistance.

In summary, MDMA-assisted therapy induces rapid onset of treatment efficacy, even in those with severe PTSD, and in those with associated comorbidities including dissociative PTSD, depression, history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. Not only is MDMA-assisted therapy efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, but it may also provide improved patient safety. Compared with current first-line pharmacological and behavioral therapies, MDMA-assisted therapy has the potential to dramatically transform treatment for PTSD and should be expeditiously evaluated for clinical use.

Psychedelic interventions — MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD — For patients with PTSD, there is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend for or against 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted Psychotherapy over an inactive (i.e., lactose) or active (i.e., 30–40 mg of MDMA or 25 mg of MDMA followed 2.5 hours later by 12.5 mg MDMA) intervention, with Strength/Direction: Insufficient Evidence. Based on research that meets IOM standards and AMSTAR-2 criteria, available findings showed efficacy relative to placebo at immediate posttreatment, but there was a lack of multiple, high-quality studies, limited sample sizes, variability in MDMA dosing, heterogeneity in comparators, and limited data on important outcomes; the SOE was low; there was evidence of moderate risk of harm and burden; there was insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits to harms/burdens; and the Panel notes that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was not approved by the FDA for PTSD and is only available for research purposes or available illegally.

Main

PTSD is a common and debilitating condition with immeasurable social and economic costs that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of people annually. There are a number of environmental and biological risk factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of PTSD, and poor PTSD treatment outcomes are associated with several comorbid conditions that include childhood trauma, alcohol and substance use disorders, depression, suicidal ideationand dissociation. It is therefore imperative to identify a therapeutic that is beneficial in those individuals with the comorbidities that typically confer treatment resistance.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and paroxetine are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved first-line therapeutics for the treatment of PTSD. However, an estimated 40–60% of patients do not respond to these compounds. Likewise, although evidenced-based trauma-focused psychotherapies such as prolonged exposure and cognitive behavioral therapy are considered to be the gold standard treatments for PTSD, many participants fail to respond or continue to have significant symptoms, and dropout rates are high. Novel cost-effective therapeutics are therefore desperately needed.

The substituted amphetamine 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) induces serotonin release by binding primarily to presynaptic serotonin transporters. MDMA has been shown to enhance fear memory extinction, modulate fear memory reconsolidation (possibly through an oxytocin-dependent mechanism), and bolster social behavior in animal models. Pooled analysis of six phase 2 trials of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD have now shown promising safety and efficacy findings.

Here, we assess the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted therapy in individuals with severe PTSD. Participants were given three doses of MDMA or placebo in a controlled clinical environment and in the presence of a trained therapy team. Primary and secondary outcome measures (CAPS-5 and SDS, respectively) were assessed by a centralized pool of blinded, independent diagnostic assessors. MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD was granted an FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation, and the protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) were developed in conjunction with the FDA.

Conclusions

Over a decade ago, we conceived this study in an attempt to develop and test a novel therapy for PTSD, a clinical condition for which a wider array of effective treatment options has remained a crucial need. Using rigorous scientific methodology, we describe a potentially beneficial new therapeutic modality with support from solid empirical data. Following this promising first step, we now report very long-term outcome results in the original cohort, demonstrating a sustained benefit over time, with no cases of subsequent drug abuse and no reports of neurocognitive decline. These results indicate that there was a favorable long-term risk/benefit ratio for PTSD treatment with just a few doses of pure MDMA administered in a supportive setting, in conjunction with psychotherapy. Should further research validate our initial findings, we predict that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will become an important treatment option for this very challenging clinical and public health problem.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^6170dbb4]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Here, we demonstrate that three doses of MDMA given in conjunction with manualized therapy over the course of 18 weeks results in a significant and robust attenuation of PTSD symptoms and functional impairment as assessed using the CAPS-5 and SDS, respectively. MDMA also significantly mitigated depressive symptoms as assessed using the BDI-II. Of note, MDMA did not increase the occurrence of suicidality during the study.

These data illustrate the potential benefit of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD over the FDA-approved first-line pharmacotherapies sertraline and paroxetine, which have both exhibited smaller effect sizes in pivotal studies. Previous comparison of change in CAPS score between sertraline and placebo showed effect sizes of 0.31 and 0.37. Similarly, comparison of change in CAPS score between paroxetine and placebo showed effect sizes of 0.56, 0.45 and 0.09. By contrast, the effect size of 0.91 demonstrated in this study between MDMA-assisted therapy and placebo with therapy was larger than that for any other previously identified PTSD pharmacotherapy –. To directly assess superiority, a head-to-head comparison of MDMA-assisted therapy with SSRIs for PTSD would be needed. Although the present study tested the effects of MDMA using a model in which both treatment groups received supportive therapy, participants who received MDMA and supportive therapy (d = 2.1) had greater improvement in PTSD change scores compared with those who received placebo with supportive therapy (d = 1.2), suggesting that MDMA enhanced the effects of supportive therapy. In clinical practice, both MDMA and supportive therapy will be components of this PTSD treatment.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^de21ed3b]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was −24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and −13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.

Efficacy

MDMA significantly attenuated PTSD symptomology, as shown by the change in CAPS-5 total severity score from baseline to 18 weeks after baseline. Mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis of the de jure estimand (that is, the effects of the drug if taken as directed) showed a significant difference in treatment arms (n = 89 (MDMA n = 46), P < 0.0001, between-group difference = 11.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 6.3–17.4, d.f. = 71) (Fig. 2a). MMRM sensitivity analysis of the de facto estimand (that is, the effects of the drug if taken as assigned, regardless of adherence) showed a significant difference in treatment arms (n = 90, P < 0.0001, d.f. = 72).

Importantly, there were no major safety issues reported in the MDMA arm of this study. Although abuse potential, cardiovascular risk and suicidality were recorded as AESIs, MDMA was not shown to induce or potentiate any of these conditions. In addition, although there was often a transient increase in blood pressure during MDMA sessions, this was expected based on phase 2 data and previous studies in healthy volunteers. These data suggest that MDMA has an equivalent, if not better, safety profile compared with that of first-line SSRIs for the treatment of PTSD, which are known to carry a low risk of QT interval prolongation.

There are several limitations to the current trial. First, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the participant population is smaller than originally planned. However, given the power noted in this study, it is unlikely that population size was an impediment. Second, the population is relatively homogeneous and lacks racial and ethnic diversity, which should be addressed in future trials. Third, this report describes the findings of a short-term pre-specified primary outcome, 2 months after the last experimental session and 5 weeks since the final integrative therapy session; long-term follow-up data from this controlled trial will be collected to assess durability of treatment. Fourth, safety data were by necessity collected by site therapists, perhaps limiting the blinding of the data. To eliminate this effect on the primary and secondary outcome measures, all efficacy data were collected by blinded, independent raters. Last, given the subjective effects of MDMA, the blinding of participants was also challenging and possibly led to expectation effects. However, although blinding was not formally assessed during the study, when participants were contacted to be informed of their treatment assignment at the time of study unblinding it became apparent that at least 10% had inaccurately guessed their treatment arm. Although anecdotal, at least 7 of 44 participants in the placebo group (15.9%) inaccurately believed that they had received MDMA, and at least 2 of 46 participants in the MDMA group (4.3%) inaccurately believed that they had received placebo.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^b0bf6b9d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The promising efficacy and safety results from this dose response study, along with findings from five other phase 2 trials form the basis for expansion into multi-site phase 3 trials. In addition, the FDA granted "Breakthrough therapy" designation for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD treatment, which may expedite the drug development process. Both short-term (one and two month) and long-term (12 month) follow-up results were positive across numerous therapy teams, demonstrating generalizability of the approach. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. More research is needed to determine the optimal number of MDMA sessions needed to achieve symptom remission. Upcoming phase 3 trials, with a planned enrollment of 200–300 participants will evaluate the time to response and other factors that influence outcomes. If findings are replicated in phase 3 trials, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will become an available treatment option for people suffering with PTSD.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^de34a824]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD pharmacotherapy and psychedelic interventions — research needs and current evidence: It is also recommended that future investigations focus on the long-term effectiveness and safety of psychedelics like MDMA, psilocybin, and ketamine in treating PTSD. Mustafa et al. (2024), writing for the Institute of Clinical and Economic Review, reviewed two of the main trials, raising "substantial concerns about the validity of the results", and concluded that the available evidence for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was insufficient at present; protocol violations resulted in the retraction of three MDMA trials previously published in Psychopharmacology. The FDA declined to approve MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD on August 9, 2024, and it's also vital to examine potential risks, especially among vulnerable populations like those with a history of substance -use or severe mental health conditions, and to establish clear guidelines for the safe and supportive administration of these therapies to minimize harm.

MDMA was equally effective in participants with comorbidities that are often associated with treatment resistance. Participants with the dissociative subtype of PTSD who received MDMA-assisted therapy had significant symptom reduction on the CAPS-5 (mean MDMA Δ = −30.8 (s.d. 9.0), mean placebo Δ = −12.8 (s.d. 12.8)), and this was similar to that in their counterparts with non-dissociative PTSD (mean MDMA Δ = −23.6 (s.d. 11.7), mean placebo Δ = −14.3 (s.d. 11.2)). The benefit of MDMA therapy was not modulated by history of alcohol use disorder, history of substance use disorder, overnight stay or severe childhood trauma. Results were consistent across all 15 study sites with no effect by study site (P = 0.1003). In MMRM analysis there was no obvious impact of SSRI history on effectiveness of MDMA (Supplementary Table 2).

MDMA therapy was effective in an exploratory endpoint analysis of the reduction of depression symptoms (using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)) from baseline to study termination of the de jure estimand (mean MDMA Δ = −19.7 (s.d. 14.0), n = 42; mean placebo Δ = −10.8 (s.d. 11.3), n = 39; t = −3.11, P = 0.0026, d.f. = 79, effect size = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.22–1.12) (Fig. 2c).

Clinically significant improvement (a decrease of ≥ 10 points on the CAPS-5), loss of diagnosis (specific diagnostic measure on the CAPS-5), and remission (loss of diagnosis and a total CAPS-5 score ≤ 11) were each tracked. At the primary study endpoint (18 weeks after baseline), 28 of 42 (67%) of the participants in the MDMA group no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared with 12 of 37 (32%) of those in the placebo group after three sessions. Additionally, 14 of 42 participants in the MDMA group (33%) and 2 of 37 participants in the placebo group (5%) met the criteria for remission after three sessions (Fig. 3).

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^2503bc61]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults — research and trial conduct: The Panel recommends masking/blinding of assessors throughout randomized controlled trials (RCTs), from initial intake to long-term follow-up, and recommends that trials collect data in a manner that allows for bridging the current DSM-5 PTSD and ICD-11 C-PTSD symptom chasm in outcomes reporting. The Panel recommends unifying descriptors and data so that systematic review authors will be able to parse and summarize data in clinically meaningful ways. There is a need for more well-powered comparative effectiveness research that can compare psychotherapy vs. another psychotherapy intervention, pharmacotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy. Similarly, psychotherapy-assisted interventions such as cannabis, psilocybin, and MDMA will benefit from high-quality clinical trials, and neither cannabis nor psilocybin, either alone or in combination with psychotherapy, had sufficient high-quality RCTs to be evaluated in the existing systematic reviews included in this guideline and cannot be recommended, at present, as a treatment for PTSD.

### The need for establishing best practices and gold standards in psychedelic medicine [^22649cca]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychedelic substances are under investigation in several drug development programs. Controlled clinical trials are providing evidence for safe and effective use of psychedelic therapies for treating mental health conditions. With the anticipated FDA approval of MDMA-assisted therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in 2023 and psilocybin therapy for depression disorders soon after, now is the time for the medical community to become informed on best practices and to actively participate in developing standards of care for these new treatments. Given the emergence of numerous drug sponsors and other companies developing therapeutic modalities for combination with psychedelic medications, it is essential that the medical professional field is at the forefront of communicating unbiased information related to safety and effectiveness. Gold standards have long been a part of medicine and serve to distinguish treatments and assessments as the highest quality by which all others can be compared to. For a treatment to be established as a gold standard, several factors are considered including the quantity and quality of the supporting data, the rigor of trials, and the safety and efficacy compared to other treatments. In this article, we review the origins of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT), minimum requirements for safe use of psychedelics, criteria for gold standards in mental health, and the nuances regarding how to establish gold standards in psychedelic medicine and guide clinical decision making.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^e37e6efc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Consistent with prior research, this study provides supportive evidence that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be safe and efficacious in individuals with chronic PTSD refractory to medication and/or psychotherapy. This is the first trial to employ multiple therapy teams with newly trained therapists implementing the manualized approach, which is encouraging regarding the likelihood that other newly-trained providers may replicate these findings in phase 3 trials. Although significant group differences were detected only in the PP set for the primary outcome, over half of participants in the ITT set who received active MDMA doses reached a 30% or greater drop in CAPS-IV total scores compared to 16.7% in the 40 mg group. After two blinded MDMA sessions, active dose groups had the largest reductions in CAPS-IV total scores with more participants attaining clinically significant improvements in PTSD symptoms relative to the 40 mg group, supporting a dose response.

To understand if three experimental sessions were more beneficial than two sessions, outcomes were evaluated again two months after the third (last) MDMA session. After the third experimental session, both the 100 mg and 125 mg groups showed further reductions in CAPS-IV scores, providing evidence that an additional session significantly improved PTSD outcomes. On the other hand, after the 40 mg group crossed over, a large treatment response resulted after two open-label sessions with little change after the third. The difference in time to respond is likely due to individual variation in the small samples, although there may have been a small additional therapeutic effect from the initial two low-dose sessions. Importantly, the gains were maintained over a 12-month follow-up after all groups had received active doses of MDMA in either blinded or open-label sessions, with 76% (n = 25) of individuals not meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. The fact that CAPS scores continued to improve between the two-month and 12-month follow-up visits lends support to the hypothesis that MDMA helps to catalyze a therapeutic process that continues long after the last drug administration. Moreover, the secondary outcome measures (depression, sleep, and dissociation) all showed significant reduction of symptoms at 12 months compared to baseline. At the 12-month visit, only one participant was taking a medication for PTSD; nine others were taking medications for insomnia, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^15e59cc9]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Safety objectives included assessment of differences between groups in severity, incidence and frequency of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, TEAESIs, suicidal ideation and behavior and vital signs. TEAEs were defined as any adverse event that occurred during the treatment period from the first experimental session to the last integration session. The severity of TEAEs was determined by the site physician as mild (no limitation in normal daily activity), moderate (some limitation in normal daily activity) or severe (unable to perform normal daily activity). A serious TEAE was defined as any unforeseen medical event at any dose of the drug that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization; caused significant disability or incapacity; resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Serious TEAEs also included any event, based on medical judgement, that jeopardized the participant or may have required intervention to prevent one of the events listed previously. With the exception of serious adverse event reporting, relatedness to study drug was not assessed by investigators, to preserve blinding. In an effort to identify common adverse events that may be most related to MDMA, TEAEs occurring with incidence > 10% and at least twice the prevalence in the MDMA-AT group versus the placebo with therapy group are reported. Suicidality was tracked at each study visit using the C-SSRS (see the Supplementary Methods for more information).

### MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^d7f4541f]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

PTSD is a particularly persistent and incapacitating condition when expressed in conjunction with other disorders of mood and affect. In the present study, perhaps most compelling are the data indicating efficacy in participants with chronic and severe PTSD, and the associated comorbidities including childhood trauma, depression, suicidality, history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and dissociation, because these groups are all typically considered treatment resistant –. Given that more than 80% of those assigned a PTSD diagnosis have at least one comorbid disorder, the identification of a therapy that is effective in those with complicated PTSD and dual diagnoses could greatly improve PTSD treatment. Additional studies should therefore be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD in those with specific comorbidities.

Although recent research suggests that dissociative subtype PTSD is difficult to treat, participants with the dissociative subtype who received MDMA-assisted therapy had significant symptom reduction that was at least similar to that of their counterparts with non-dissociative PTSD. Given that this covariate was significant, it warrants further study. Furthermore, given that other treatments for PTSD are not consistently effective for those with the dissociative subtype, these data, if replicated, would indicate an important novel therapeutic niche for MDMA-assisted therapy for typically hard-to-treat populations.

### MDMA-assisted therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder: a pooled analysis of ethnoracial differences in efficacy and safety from two phase 2 open-label lead-in trials and a phase 3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial [^6d01e784]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited ethnoracial diversity in previous ± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) trials for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has prompted questions concerning whether Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) also benefit from this treatment.

Methods

Secondary analysis was conducted using a modified intent-to-treat sample pooled from two Phase 2 open-label trials and a Phase 3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial to compare efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT for PTSD between BIPOC and non-Hispanic White participants. Four subgroups were of interest: MDMA-AT, BIPOC (n = 20); MDMA-AT, non-Hispanic White (n = 63); Placebo-assisted therapy (Placebo-AT), BIPOC (n = 17); and Placebo-AT, non-Hispanic White (n = 27). Planned comparisons tested subgroup differences in changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) scores from baseline to primary endpoint, controlling for study type and baseline scores. Adverse events (AEs) on the day of (day 0) to 2days post-dosing were reported for each subgroup.

Results

In the MDMA-AT group, no significant ethnoracial difference in CAPS-5 change scores was observed. In the Placebo-AT group, BIPOC participants trended toward greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than non-Hispanic Whites. Among non-Hispanic Whites, MDMA-AT was accompanied by significantly greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than Placebo-AT. No treatment difference emerged among BIPOC participants. AEs were mostly rated as mild or moderate across subgroups.

Conclusions

These findings provide preliminary support for the efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT for treating PTSD across ethnoracial groups. There was also a trend toward greater efficacy with Placebo-AT among BIPOC participants. There was an imbalance in subgroups, highlighting the need for culturally responsive recruitment strategies to diversify future studies.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^10325ac2]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD treatment key questions and evidence sources — the Panel used six questions to guide scoping: comparative effectiveness of different psychological treatments for adults with PTSD and how effectiveness varies by patient characteristics or type of trauma; comparative effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for adults diagnosed with PTSD and how effectiveness varies by patient characteristics or type of trauma; comparative effectiveness of different psychological and pharmacological treatments for adults diagnosed with PTSD and how effectiveness varies by patient characteristics or type of trauma; how combinations of psychological and pharmacological treatments compare with either one alone; whether any PTSD treatments are more effective for particular trauma types; and what adverse events are associated with treatments for adults diagnosed with PTSD. Despite an updated AHRQ review expanding psychological and pharmacological interventions, notable gaps remained, including not addressing complex PTSD, pharmacological augmentation interventions, family-based therapies, MDMA augmentation, ketamine, maintenance of treatment gains over time (i.e., 3, 6, 12-month follow-up), or complementary and integrative health interventions. The Panel considered using the AHRQ PTSD repository review with the update as a "package review", but the repository only reported raw data and did not provide the meta-analytic effect size information necessary for drafting recommendations.

Diversity of samples — pharmacologic and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy updates for adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report the following participant characteristics: Across four MDMA-assisted trials, the mean ages ranged from 37.2 to 42 years and about 16% to 85% of participants identified as female. Ketamine reviews spanning 584 patients reported average ages from 36.05 to 43 years with approximately 16% to 43% female; the proportion identifying as White ranged from 20% to 95% and, of reported data, between 11% and 20% identified as Hispanic/Latino/a/e/x, with studies primarily conducted in the United States. An updated pharmacologic review combined 5,170 patients, with mean ages from 37 to 54 years and between 0% and 100% female; non-White identification ranged from 0 to 100% and Hispanic/Latino/a/e/x from 0% to 65%, with the majority of studies in the United States and a small number in China, Iran, and South Africa.

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^36f6b3ee]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Phase II trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with potential for expansion to depression and anxiety disorders. In these trials, single doses of MDMA are administered in a model of medication-assisted psychotherapy, differing from trials involving daily drug administration without psychotherapy. This model presents an opportunity to utilize accelerated regulatory pathways, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Breakthrough Therapy Designation, to most effectively and expeditiously test such novel approaches.

### Should we be leery of being leary? Concerns about psychedelic use by psychedelic researchers [^03171acc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychedelic research is proceeding rapidly, despite ongoing legal and regulatory barriers and lingering questions about study design, such as the difficulty of ensuring adequate blinding, the relative overrepresentation in studies of participants who have previously used psychedelics, and the importance of personal experience with psychedelics for those who provide psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here we wish to explore a distinct concern: whether personal use of psychedelics by researchers could threaten the objectivity and ethical conduct of psychedelic research itself. In 2020, Anderson et al. suggested that psychedelic use could lead even "conservative individuals to become wildly enthusiastic about the potentials of psychedelics to heal and transform". Recent popular press criticisms of psychedelic science, in particular critiques of the MAPS Phase II and Phase III MDMA-Assisted Therapy trials for PTSD, have also raised questions about whether personal use of psychedelic drugs by psychedelic therapists could compromise scientific objectivity, lead to the exploitation of research subjects, or promote biased reporting of results. Here, we elaborate on and attempt to delimit these concerns, with the goal of informing policy related to psychedelic research and the eventual clinical use of psychedelics. In particular, we explore whether the possibility that psychedelic use can directly and positively affect investigators' enthusiasm about psychedelics themselves raises concerns about bias and scientific integrity. We then discuss several practical strategies to reduce perceived conflict of interest.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^e830af69]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

These findings are noteworthy given that participants had moderate to extreme PTSD and had previously failed to benefit from psychotherapy, including approaches thought to be relatively effective (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR)), and pharmacological treatment, including medications for depression and anxiety. At baseline, 96.4% of participants reported suicidal thinking at some point in the past; for 46.4% the suicidal ideations were serious, and 28.6% reported a history of suicidal behavior. Thus, the participants were severely impacted by symptoms before study participation, and the sample was not restricted to exclude people who had previously experienced suicidal thinking, as is common practice in many clinical trials of psychiatric drugs.

Safety outcomes for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in a controlled clinical setting strongly suggest a favorable benefit to risk ratio. Frequency and intensity of adverse events, reactions, and suicidal ideation were similar to previous reports. The greater number of psychiatric symptoms in active dose groups, such as anxiety, depression, or suicidal ideation, could be caused by the psychotherapeutic process of recalling and discussing experiences, thoughts, and emotions related to traumatic events, and also possibly be a direct pharmacological effect of MDMA. Available data is not adequate to identify a causal relationship, but increased transient anxiety has been detected in studies of healthy individuals after MDMA and is likely due to the MDMA-stimulated release of cortisol. The most common time for mild to moderate anxiety related to drug onset to occur is in the first hour after administration; anxiety associated with painful or stressful memories typically occurred later in the session. Therapists encourage diaphragmatic breathing and other stress inoculation techniques that are discussed during the non-drug preparatory sessions. Participants may be able to continue the therapeutic processing of trauma memories, even when facing anxiety, because of the support of two therapists, and reduced amygdalar activity through the pharmacological effects of MDMA. Vital signs after MDMA generally increased in a dose-dependent manner to values similar during moderate exercise, and were well tolerated in these participants. There were no SAEs related to the treatment, adding to the evidence that MDMA can safely be administered to patients with PTSD.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^d34dbf21]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Background:

Posttraumatic stress disorder often does not resolve after conventional psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies. Pilot studies have reported that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) combined with psychotherapy reduces posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

Aims:

This pilot dose response trial assessed efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy across multiple therapy teams.

Methods:

Twenty-eight people with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder were randomized in a double-blind dose response comparison of two active doses (100 and 125 mg) with a low dose (40 mg) of MDMA administered during eight-hour psychotherapy sessions. Change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores one month after two sessions of MDMA served as the primary outcome. Active dose groups had one additional open-label session; the low dose group crossed over for three open-label active dose sessions. A 12-month follow-up assessment occurred after the final MDMA session.

Results:

In the intent-to-treat set, the active groups had the largest reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores at the primary endpoint, with mean (standard deviation) changes of −26.3 (29.5) for 125 mg, −24.4 (24.2) for 100 mg, and −11.5 (21.2) for 40 mg, though statistical significance was reached only in the per protocol set (p = 0.03). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms remained lower than baseline at 12-month follow-up (p < 0.001) with 76% (n = 25) not meeting posttraumatic stress disorder criteria. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, and the treatment was well-tolerated.

Conclusions:

Our findings support previous investigations of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as an innovative, efficacious treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder.

### Development of an Australian clinical practice guideline on methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [^ff2d8d7a]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent clinical and research interest, medical use of psychedelics has not been legalised in most jurisdictions. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration rescheduled methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in July 2023 to permit authorised prescribing of MDMA for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) outside of the clinical trial setting.

Objective

This manuscript describes the development of the Australian Clinical Practice Guideline on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) for PTSD.

Methods

The Guideline will be developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) process. The Guideline will consider the benefits and harms of MDMA-AP compared to other treatments in people with PTSD. High quality systematic reviews identified via an overview of systematic reviews will be used as index and supplementary reviews. Using the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework, the multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) will consider treatment benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, patient preferences and values, resources, equity, acceptability and feasibility. The GDG will be supported by a Stakeholder Group, Expert Group, Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee, and Evidence Review Team. The Guideline will be developed using an integrated knowledge translation approach, emphasising the co-production of knowledge through active participation and shared decision-making with end-users.

Conclusion

The Guideline will be published on the digital platform MAGICapp and disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, professional conferences and via specific stakeholder groups. A Companion Guide will be developed for people living with PTSD and their carers, family members, and supports.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^fc4ba0f4]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical and practical considerations — safety highlight that while most early psilocybin studies have brought relative reassurance in terms of safety profile, recent expansion of data demonstrates a need for studies designed to include more diverse populations and leaves many unanswered questions about drug-drug interactions, optimal environment and expectancy, dosing comparisons, the role of adjunct psychotherapy, longitudinal and sustained benefits, possible harms not observed in shorter trials, and use in patients with major medical comorbidities. Long acknowledged risks include distressing or psychologically challenging experiences, heightened anxiety, or emergence of psychotic symptoms during the psychedelic experience, and as clinical studies have grown in size and complexity a possible signal for increased suicidal thinking and behaviour has emerged. For example, a recent phase-II trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression reported serious adverse events in 9% of the 25 mg group.

### Why psychiatry needs 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine: a child psychiatrist's perspective [^ecdec2de]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

In recent decades, MAPS has lead the way in global MDMA/PTSD studies and has amassed a pool of data from phase II studies in USA, Switzerland, Israel, and Canada. In their first pilot study, published by Michael Mithoefer in 2011, 20 patients with chronic PTSD, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, received either 2 or 3 sessions of placebo-controlled MDMA-assisted psychotherapy alongside a course of preparatory and follow-up nondrug psychotherapy. Using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) as a primary outcome measure, Mithoefer showed that at the 2 and 12-month follow-up 83% of the experimental group no longer met the criteria for PTSD compared with just 25% of the patients in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects, or clinically significant physiological events. The cohort was subsequently followed-up for an average of 42 months after the initial single course of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. And in 2013 results of that long-term follow-up study showed that rates of remission were largely maintained, without having any further doses of MDMA since the original study. The long-term follow-up showed that 17 of the 19 subjects had sustained remission by self-report; however, by the long-term follow-up CAPS scores were obtained for only 16 of the 19, so the actual percentage of sustained remission on CAPS is not certain. Also in 2013, psychiatrist Peter Oehen published the results of his MAPS-sponsored MDMA psychotherapy study for treatment-resistant PTSD. Together with co-therapist, Verena Widmer, Oehen's was a smaller study than Mithoefer's and although there was a definite trend in the direction of MDMA therapy being superior to placebo, at first sight the statistics failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in CAPS for the experimental subjects. However, Henri Chabrol of Toulouse University looked at the data again using effect size as a measure and concluded that results were indicative of MDMA psychotherapy providing substantial improvements for treatment-resistant PTSD.

### Therapeutic potential of MDMA-and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for adolescent depression and trauma [^f3ee721a]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is a mental health crisis affecting youth, and the utility of existing treatments is often limited by lack of effectiveness and tolerability. The aim of this review is to report on outcomes of clinical trials for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for adults with depression and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and discuss recommendations for exploring these treatments in adolescent populations.

Recent Findings

There have been encouraging data supporting the use of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for depression, including previously treatment-resistant symptoms. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is showing similar promise in treating PTSD, with excellent response and remission rates that appear durable. However, no studies have looked at the use of these treatments in younger patients. The safety and efficacy of psychedelic- and MDMA-assisted psychotherapies should be investigated in adolescents, especially considering the burden of untreated and undertreated psychiatric illness in youth, and the benefits of a potentially earlier, more effective, and more tolerable recovery process. Research and implementation should be tailored to the needs of this population, and equity and access should be considered at every stage. In this novel and rapidly evolving landscape, the psychiatric community is encouraged to advocate for safe, appropriate, and inclusive inquiry into, and application and scaling of these treatment models in adolescent patients.

### Into the wild frontier: mapping the terrain of adverse events in psychedelic-assisted therapies [^c8a9e245]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

The administration of psychedelics, 1 in conjunction with psychotherapy (i.e. psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT)), has shown promise as a potential treatment modality for various psychiatric disorders. For instance, in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted breakthrough therapy designation to psilocybin, as well as a deuterated psilocybin analog, combined with psychotherapy for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder, as well as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-assisted therapy for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. The same breakthrough therapy designation has also been given to 3,4-methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, but the FDA recently reviewed the data submitted by the applicant, Lykos Therapeutics, and declined to approve MDMA-assisted therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in August 2024, partially due to safety concerns. The process of FDA approval of new treatments rests on a risk–benefit assessment (i.e. known and potential benefits vs known and potential risks), which requires knowledge of the full range of adverse events (AEs) that may be associated with the treatment. However, because psychedelics appear to be synergistic with psychotherapy (e.g.) and are unique in that they reliably induce experiences characterized as spiritual, existential, religious, and theological, they could potentially be associated with distinct risks that distinguish them from traditional interventions. Even if these factors do not play into the FDA's decision-making, it might nevertheless be important, especially for healthcare professionals, to develop a tailored assessment of AEs associated with PATs.

Evidence included one small low‑quality psilocybin study comparing immediate versus delayed therapy with improvements in depressive symptoms at five and eight weeks and decreased anxiety at eight weeks; however, the intervention was multi‑component, the comparator was effectively a waitlist control, and no studies met criteria for cannabis, cannabinoid, or MDMA. The guideline cites concerns for potential harms (abuse and addiction potential), resource and feasibility challenges with prolonged therapeutic interventions and monitoring (between eight to 12 hours) and pharmacy implications with psilocybin and MDMA currently classified as U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Schedule 1 compounds, and it states the confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

Psilocybin — clinical and public health positioning — should be approached with optimism but caution; messaging about status and promise should be tempered, careful monitoring in clinical and unsanctioned settings is necessary to ensure protection, psychedelics should be considered as second- or third-line therapies until more clarity is gained, an adequate evidence base must be developed to guide appropriate training and expertise, and the limits of efficacy must be carefully articulated with sustained commitment to monitoring, implementation science, and continuing education for any future roll-out if approved as therapies.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans, firefighters, and police officers: a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 clinical trial [^b479362e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100–125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405.

Findings

Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n = 7), 75 mg (n = 7), or 125 mg (n = 12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p = 0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19–4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04–2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100–125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p = 0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p = 0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p < 0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment.

Interpretation

Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was change in CAPS-IV total scores from baseline to one month after the second blinded session (Table 2 and Figure 3). In the ITT set, the active dose groups had the largest reduction in PTSD symptom severity with mean (SD) changes of −26.3 (29.5) for 125 mg, −24.4 (24.2) for 100 mg, and −11.5 (21.2) for 40 mg. Although there was no significant overall effect (F 2,26 = 0.68, p = 0.52). Cohen's d effect sizes with 40 mg subtracted was 0.42 (–0.57, 1.42) for 125 mg and 0.37 (–0.57, 1.42) for 100 mg.

In the PP set (Table 2), there was a significant main effect in change of CAPS-IV total scores (F 2,22 = 4.01, p = 0.03). Compared to the 40 mg group (mean change (SD) –4.0 (11.9)), the 125 mg group had a significant reduction (–37.0 (20.9), p = 0.01) and the 100 mg group trended towards significance (–24.4 (24.2), p = 0.10). Cohen's d effect sizes with 40 mg subtracted was 1.12 (–0.10, 2.35) for 125 mg and 0.73 (–0.45, 1.90) for 100 mg.

### Review of potential psychedelic treatments for PTSD [^fd52a07d]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental illness with limited treatment options and a high treatment dropout rate. Psychedelics, often in combination with psychotherapy, are now under investigation as a potential treatment option for a variety of psychiatric conditions including PTSD. This paper reviews the proposed mechanism of action for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and classical psychedelics such as psilocybin in treating PTSD, along with available clinical evidence, safety and side effects. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is in FDA phase III clinical trials for PTSD and is purported to work by way of increased empathy and decreased amygdala activation during the therapeutic encounter and trauma processing. Classical psychedelics may create change by a subjective transformative experience along with an observable process of brain network alterations, though these substances have not been clinically studied in the context PTSD. In recent human-subject studies MDMA-assisted therapy resulted in significant improvement in PTSD symptoms with a good safety and side effect profile. There is not yet direct clinical evidence for classical psychedelics in treating PTSD, but the evidence supports such a trial. The studies to date have been relatively small, and participants are wellscreened for potential co-morbidities which could increase the risks of psychedelic treatment. Nonetheless, the data is promising for psychedelic-assisted treatment to become a much-needed treatment option for PTSD.

LSD

Studies in healthy subjects have focused on neuroplasticity and comparison with other psychedelics, while treatment studies are assessing utility for anxiety, depression, and cluster headache. The fewer LSD trials likely reflects residual stigma of LSD as a counterculture drug and duration of an LSD journey averaging 8–12 hours (compared with 4–6 hours for psilocybin), making the treatment model more demanding on staffing and resources. Nonetheless, given similarities between psilocybin and LSD, future LSD trials for mood disorders and addiction are likely.

MDMA

Studies have focused on PTSD (6 completed Phase 2 trials, 1 completed Phase 3 trial), demonstrating strong efficacy and safety across all types of severe PTSD. In the recent Phase 3 trial, after 3 MDMA psychotherapy sessions (18 weeks postbaseline) combined with psychotherapy, 28/42 (67%) of participants in the MDMA group no longer met criteria for PTSD, compared with 12/37 (32%) of those receiving placebo. Should the second Phase 3 trial yield similar results, FDA approval of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD is likely. Other therapeutic targets being studied with MDMA include anxiety, eating disorders, and AUD.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized phase 2 controlled trial [^a41c27e8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic stress disorder often does not resolve after conventional psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies. Pilot studies have reported that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) combined with psychotherapy reduces posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

Aims

This pilot dose response trial assessed efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy across multiple therapy teams.

Methods

Twenty-eight people with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder were randomized in a double-blind dose response comparison of two active doses (100 and 125 mg) with a low dose (40 mg) of MDMA administered during eight-hour psychotherapy sessions. Change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores one month after two sessions of MDMA served as the primary outcome. Active dose groups had one additional open-label session; the low dose group crossed over for three open-label active dose sessions. A 12-month follow-up assessment occurred after the final MDMA session.

Results

In the intent-to-treat set, the active groups had the largest reduction in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale total scores at the primary endpoint, with mean (standard deviation) changes of -26.3 (29.5) for 125 mg, -24.4 (24.2) for 100 mg, and -11.5 (21.2) for 40 mg, though statistical significance was reached only in the per protocol set (p = 0.03). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms remained lower than baseline at 12-month follow-up (p < 0.001) with 76% (n = 25) not meeting posttraumatic stress disorder criteria. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, and the treatment was well-tolerated.

Conclusions

Our findings support previous investigations of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as an innovative, efficacious treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder.

### A randomized, controlled pilot study of MDMA (± 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of resistant, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^a188fcbd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Psychiatrists and psychotherapists in the US (1970s to 1985) and Switzerland (1988–1993) used MDMA legally as a prescription drug, to enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Early reports suggest that it is useful in treating trauma-related disorders. Recently, the first completed pilot study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD yielded encouraging results. Designed to test the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in patients with treatment-resistant PTSD; our randomized, double-blind, active-placebo controlled trial enrolled 12 patients for treatment with either low-dose (25 mg, plus 12.5 mg supplemental dose) or full-dose MDMA (125 mg, plus 62.5 mg supplemental dose). MDMA was administered during three experimental sessions, interspersed with weekly non-drug-based psychotherapy sessions. Outcome measures used were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Patients were assessed at baseline, three weeks after the second and third MDMA session (end of treatment), and at the 2-month and 1-year follow-ups. We found that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered in a clinical setting. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. We did not see statistically significant reductions in CAPS scores (p = 0.066), although there was clinically and statistically significant self-reported (PDS) improvement (p = 0.014). CAPS scores improved further at the 1-year follow-up. In addition, three MDMA sessions were more effective than two (p = 0.016).

### A comparison of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to non-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^286aca89]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Novel, evidence-based treatments are required for treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has beneficially augmented psychotherapy in several small clinical trials.

Objective

To review the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD.

Methods

Systematic searches of four databases were conducted from inception to February 2020. A meta-analysis was performed on trials which were double-blinded, randomised, and compared MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to psychotherapy and placebo. The primary outcomes were the differences in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) score and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcome measures included neurocognitive and physical adverse effects, at the time, and within 7 days of intervention.

Results

Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met inclusion criteria. When compared to active placebo, intervention groups taking 75mg (MD -46.90; 95% (confidence intervals) CI -58.78, -35.02), 125mg (MD -20.98; 95% CI -34.35, -7.61) but not 100mg (MD -12.90; 95% CI -36.09, 10.29) of MDMA with psychotherapy, had significant decreases in CAPS-IV scores, as did the inactive placebo arm (MD -33.20; 95% CI -40.53, -25.87). A significant decrease in BDI when compared to active placebo (MD -10.80; 95% CI -20.39, -1.21) was only observed at 75mg. Compared to placebo, participants reported significantly more episodes of low mood, nausea and jaw-clenching during sessions and lack of appetite after 7 days.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate potential therapeutic benefit with minimal physical and neurocognitive risk for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in TR-PTSD, despite little effect on Beck's Depression Inventory. Better powered RCTs are required to investigate further.

Limitations

Measurement of the primary variable was done by an independent rater using the CAPS-IV, which has good reliability and validity, and attrition was minimal (7%). Nevertheless, certain limitations constrain both the generalizability of findings and the ability to draw inferences concerning interactions among independent variables. The sample was relatively homogeneous, with the majority being predominantly female (68%) and White (93%). Thus, it was not possible to assess gender- or ethnicity-specific differences in outcomes.

The primary limitation was the relatively small sample size, especially in the low-dose study arm; however, this was a phase 2 trial intended to assess efficacy in a preliminary manner and to evaluate outcomes across multiple therapy teams. One participant in the 40 mg group experienced large drops in CAPS-IV total scores after one blinded session, affecting average scores in this small sample. Since this individual declined additional MDMA sessions after the first one due to an efficacious response, she was excluded from the PP analyses that showed little change in CAPS-IV scores from baseline to the primary endpoint (84.6 to 80.6) for the low dose group.

Establishing an effective blind for a psychoactive drug like MDMA is difficult. Prior phase 1 studies conducted by various groups have explored blinding MDMA with comparators of amphetamine or methylphenidate. Previous phase 2 clinical trials used inactive placebo and a low dose MDMA as comparator (25 mg or 30 mg). This study utilized a dose-response design, comparing active doses to 40 mg MDMA, in order to enhance masking of MDMA-stimulated effects. To gauge the effectiveness of blinding procedures, participants and therapists were asked to guess the dose received after each blinded session. Therapists guessed correctly 77.3% of the time for 40 mg sessions, and 86.0% of the time for the 100 mg or 125 mg sessions. Participants also guessed correctly often, 72.7% in the 40 mg sessions, but mistakenly guessed (41.9% of the time) a low dose when in fact they had received an active dose. The research team had additional clues about group assignment from intra-session measurements of vital signs, but importantly, blinded independent raters who administered the CAPS were not present during therapy sessions and had no access to vital sign data. A limitation to the open-label crossover and 12-month follow-up was that the assessments were made under non-blinded conditions and there was no control group for comparison at these time points.

SAFETY, POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS, AND ETHICAL ISSUES

The requirements to conduct clinical trials with non-FDA–approved investigational Schedule 1 psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and MDMA are rigorous. An MD must be on site and readily available, as well as a clinical psychologist both trained in PAT. The other guides can be other health care providers (eg, registered nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, marriage and family therapists) who have undergone PAT training such as provided by California Institute of Integral Studies or Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. Given the powerful nature of the psychedelic experience and the vulnerable psychological state patients enter during and in the initial days postjourney, having well-trained guides especially in understanding and managing the spectrum of emotional and perceptual responses to psychedelics is essential. With experienced and skilled guides and a well-prepared patient, PAT is typically deeply meaningful, albeit at times challenging. The risk of a "bad trip" is low, and hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder is rare. Serotonin toxicity has not been reported in clinical trials to date, although most trials have excluded coadministration of psychedelics with serotonergic medications such as antidepressants. As recently emphasized, as such trials and treatments move forward, psychedelic practitioners must adhere to the highest ethical standards focused on patient safety and well-being and embrace a rigorous system of peer review and supervision.

From a physiological perspective, the classic psychedelics and MDMA are notable for their high safety profile and low addictive potential. As detailed in Table 1, psilocybin and LSD cause mild-to-moderate elevations in blood pressure, pulse, and respirations, while MDMA can cause modest increases in blood pressure; all 3 are at the low end of the Harms Scale compared with alcohol, heroin, and cocaine.,

In modern clinical trials of psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA using the "set and setting" paradigm, there have been few serious adverse events, largely because of safety guidelines, and careful patient screening, excluding those with a personal or family history of mental illness with psychotic potential such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.-, In 7 of the most recent randomized placebo-controlled trials for high-dose psilocybin, LSD, or MDMA (total N = 249 patients), there were no serious medical or psychiatric adverse events reported. -

### First study of safety and tolerability of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in patients with alcohol use disorder: preliminary data on the first four participants [^c91556a3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We present the preliminary data in an ongoing open-label safety and tolerability proof of concept study exploring the potential role for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in treating patients with alcohol use disorder. At this stage, seven participants have completed the full 8-week MDMA-assisted psychotherapy course, including two therapy sessions each with MDMA. This paper focuses on the safety and tolerability of the therapeutic course for the first four participants to complete treatment. Longer-term outcomes of drinking behaviour will be presented later when the full project data are published. Results show all four participants have successfully tolerated the treatment. There have been no serious adverse events related to MDMA, no unexpected physiological responses to the MDMA sessions or changes to blood results or electrocardiograms, measured before and after the 8-week course. We conclude that the treatment is well- tolerated and are making plans to expand the project into a randomised placebo-controlled study.

### Modifying informed consent to help address functional unmasking in psychedelic clinical trials [^5f63c96d]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

There is unprecedented clinician, industry, and patient interest in the therapeutic development of psychedelic drugs. This is due to a combination of promising clinical trial results, positive media coverage, and the lack of novel pharmacologic treatments for psychiatric disorders in recent decades. However, the field faces a key methodological challenge: masking participants to treatment conditions in psychedelic clinical trials has been largely unsuccessful.

Objective

When participants can tell whether they received active drug or placebo, their responses to clinical assessments, questionnaires, and even their functional imaging and biological data can be influenced by preconceptions about treatment effects. Positive patient expectancies combined with ineffective masking may skew outcomes and inflate effect sizes. This complicates efforts to determine the safety and efficacy of psychedelic drugs. Here, we explore a method to help address this problem: modifying informed consent to obscure information about the study design.

Evidence Review

We reviewed all contemporary (2000–2024) clinical trials of psychedelic or methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) therapy and corresponded with the investigators to compile information on the use of modifications to informed consent in these studies.

Findings

Modifying informed consent to obscure details of the study design has been implemented in several psychedelic clinical trials and may offer a way to strengthen masking. However, this approach poses significant ethical risks. We examine examples of modifications used in the psychedelic literature, discuss the current regulatory landscape, and suggest strategies to mitigate risks associated with modified informed consent.

Conclusions and Relevance

Incorporating modified informed consent in future psychedelic clinical trials may improve interpretability and impact, but this has not been explicitly tested. Modifications to informed consent may not be appropriate in all cases, and risks to participants should be minimized by implementing appropriate guardrails.

### Adverse events in clinical treatments with serotonergic psychedelics and MDMA: a mixed-methods systematic review [^ca224750]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently, several cases were reported in which study participants in an MDMA trial stated that they became suicidal after the trial was finished, including one case in which a participant remained attached to a therapist, and was subsequently abused. Unfortunately, such very serious transgressions occur in our field, and need to be vigorously addressed if and when they occur. It might well be that the field of psychedelic treatments is especially at risk, as patients under influence are vulnerable, suggestible and highly dependent on the therapist(s). Furthermore, therapists may have developed their own personal approaches to therapy that not always adhere to professional codes of conduct. Apart from that, this also illustrates the importance of thoroughly and systematically monitoring adverse effects.

Symptom improvement and other benefits reported on our LTFU Questionnaire

It is notable that no subjects reported any harm from study participation and all of them reported some degree of benefit. Consistent with the investigators' clinical observations in the original study, the responses we obtained on the questionnaire indicated that participants often experienced benefits beyond decreased PTSD symptoms. This is not a radical idea; many forms of psychotherapy produce benefits in terms of psychological growth and development that are not limited to improvements in a specific disorder that may have been the original target of therapy. Such benefits may prove to be a particularly prominent and valuable feature of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Some of the areas of benefit that were endorsed on the LTFU Questionnaire, such as an increased self-awareness, improved relationships, an enhanced spiritual life, and more involvement in the community or world, represent effects that are not fully measured by the PTSD symptom scales.

A sustained improvement in PTSD symptoms documented on the CAPS, plus other benefits reported on the LTFU Questionnaire, have implications regarding one of the limitations of the previous study: the fact that the blinding turned out to be transparent to the investigators and to most of the participants (though not to the independent rater). This problem is inherent in all drug studies, but is particularly challenging to overcome in studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, because of the prominent psychoactive effects MDMA has, as well as its effects on blood pressure and pulse rate. Observation of these effects may have contributed to the investigators' ability to correctly distinguish MDMA-assisted sessions from therapy-only sessions. In addition, any studies of drug-assisted psychotherapy (rather than of drug effect alone) present particular challenges in distinguishing the drug effects from the effects of psychotherapy with placebo. Nevertheless, if the placebo response is tied to receiving an apparent therapy, the favorable LTFU results we obtained a year or more later in this cohort of previously treatment-resistant subjects would suggest that the strength and duration of symptomatic improvement that we observed is not easily attributable to a placebo response or a spontaneous remission, though further studies will be needed to establish this conclusively.

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^5da25a32]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

SET AND SETTING

An array of chronic psychiatric disorders share a common core of intractable symptoms that respond favorably to MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy, which has been studied in clinical trials treating PTSD, anxiety associated with life‐threatening illness, and social anxiety in autistic adults. 2 These studies demonstrate the success of careful approaches to therapeutic set and setting designed to minimize adverse events and maximize benefits with minimal targeted exposure to drug. All recent MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy registration studies are RCTs, meeting rigorous standards for drug development regulated by the FDA and overseen by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Furthermore, due to the Schedule 1 status of MDMA, compliance with DEA and state‐level controlled substance review committees is required, placing these studies in the most regulated area of drug development, and introducing a disincentive to potential researchers. Researchers who are willing to take on the challenge of managing compliance with this complex oversight often only do so because of the potential to relieve suffering that has not responded to existing established treatments, and the hope of providing the field of psychiatry with methods of effectively combining psychopharmacology with psychotherapy in a patient‐centered approach that respects and fosters the innate healing capacity of the individual.

Methods and materials

Subjects

In the initial study, 20 subjects with treatment-resistant PTSD (in most cases from sexual abuse or assault) were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with the active drug (n = 12) or with an inactive placebo (psychotherapy-only; n = 8), each administered during two 8-hour sessions scheduled 3–5 weeks apart, accompanied by weekly non-drug sessions. The MDMA-assisted sessions were conducted in a comfor setting, in which participants were encouraged to spend considerable time focused inward without talking, alternated with time spent talking to the therapists. The therapists took a non-directive approach to supporting their subjects in processing trauma-related material. More information concerning the nature of the psychotherapy is found in thestudy, as well as in the author's treatment manual (MAPS, 2011).

At the end of this controlled study, the participants who had received the psychotherapy-only treatment were offered open-label MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, using the same schedule of sessions as were used in the controlled study protocol. Of the eight therapy-only subjects, seven accepted and completed the crossover arm of the study, which resulted in 19 of the 20 study subjects receiving the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy treatment. The one therapy-only subject had recovered from PTSD symptoms with psychotherapy alone, and did not participate in the crossover. As allowed by a protocol amendment, the last eight subjects recruited (five in the double-blind stage and three in the crossover stage) also received a third MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session. This protocol change was sought because of tentative clinical impressions by the investigators that a third session would likely enhance the processing of trauma and the integration process that were essential to the treatment.

### A reflection on paradigmatic tensions within the FDA advisory committee for MDMA-assisted therapy [^4cab6be3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this 'new' paradigm, the intensity of the therapeutic experiences is dependent on contextual factors. For example, the therapeutic alliance or the trust with the facilitators increases the chance of having beneficial therapeutic experiences in clinical trials and naturalistic studies. Furthermore, naturalistic studies show that a lack of psychological support can lead to extended difficulties after psychedelic use. This new science seeks to emerge from the interaction of psychopharmacology and psychotherapy, and such an interactive paradigm might also be relevant to other substances, such as Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. Psychedelics are probably not unique in that sense, but they are the anomaly that challenges the status quo.

The most notable manifestation of the additive paradigm is that the regulatory process mainly relies on the blinded Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with two arms (drug and placebo). The blinded RCT supposes that context is noise to control for. Other standard study procedures recognised by the FDA – like comparative efficacy trials, dose-response studies, noninferiority studies, and withdrawal studies – do not take into consideration the interaction with contextual factors and hence also fall under the additive paradigm. It is argued that the introduction of this blinded RCT as the gold standard in the 1960s, due to the thalidomide scandal, was when psychedelic therapy halted and lost its 'scientific' credibility, as it could not prove itself through the blinded RCT. This represented a larger split between psychotherapy and psychopharmacology – disciplines that were once much closer to each other.

In the emerging new science, drug effects are interactive with context, requiring other study designs to explore this interaction. One potential design is a two-by-two design with drug/no-drug and psychotherapy/no-psychotherapy as the experimental arms (though some might argue that providing the drugs without the psychotherapy is unethical as it puts patients at risk).

From the perspective of the FDA advisory committee – who bear significant responsibility for bringing safe therapy to the market – the data was not good enough, and the risk seemed too high. The risks, efficacy, and liability are judged through the old paradigm, and it is plausible that they did not have the knowledge and frameworks to serve effectively as experts, and authorising something one cannot evaluate appropriately is risky. As the FDA does not regulate psychotherapy, most experts' backgrounds were in psychiatry and medicine, with only one psychologist and one sociologist.

AAN position — novel potential therapeutics not yet approved or fully reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — states that when considering a novel therapy without FDA approval or appraisal, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends the patient and neurologist carefully review the available evidence and discuss potential risks and benefits, recognizes the importance of unbiased and rigorous documentation of both clinical efficacy and adverse events, and specifies that the use of putative therapeutics should not be recommended in the absence of supportive data with possible participation in a relevant clinical trial discussed if appropriate; illustrative examples include a meta-analysis of 214 studies of psychedelics reporting they were generally well tolerated and an FDA Advisory Committee review of midomafetamine plus psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder that recommended (by a vote of 9 to 2) that the FDA reject the New Drug Application, alongside the FDA designating an analog of psilocybin as a breakthrough therapy and Oregon legalizing psilocybin for personal use with other jurisdictions (Colorado; Seattle, Washington; District of Columbia; San Francisco; Denver) decriminalizing its use.

### Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy: the need to monitor adverse events [^313f2861]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Second, similarly to the absence of a clear consensus on which term should be used to describe adverse effects, there is an ongoing debate on what substance should be regarded as a psychedelic. Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are, for example, universally regarded as psychedelics, while 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is excluded from this category by some. This discrepancy stems from the different factors taken into account for categorizing the substances. Classic psychedelics alter someone's mood, sensory perception, and perception of reality, and therefore someone's state of consciousness. MDMA changes someone's mood and sensations, but does not have the same intense effects, such as, for example, vivid (visual) hallucinations that are typically associated with psychedelics. In addition, also the mechanism underlying their effects are different: classical psychedelics exert their effects mainly through activation of the serotonin 2 A receptor, while MDMA acts more on inhibiting reuptake transporters and therefore mainly acts as an enhancer of extracellular levels of monoamines. Despite these differences in induced phenotypes and molecular mechanisms, in the current state of affairs, it seems advisable not to be too restrictive in the list of compounds to which the term psychedelics applies.

Third, assessing adverse effects in psychotherapies does not receive enough attention. Pharmacological-assisted psychotherapy assumes at least two parts of treatment: a drug and some form of psychological therapy with a set of instructions, formally structured to different degrees, depending on the type of therapy at hand. The essence of using psychopharmacology in this context is to induce changes in the brain and mind of patients using chemical substances to increase the effect of the given psychotherapy. In this respect, using psychedelics as compound in addition to a therapy is not different at all. As other pharmacological compounds, psychedelics are used to alter someone's perception and experience, expecting that this could boost the efficacy of a treatment. In studies in which a pharmacological compound is administered to participants, particularly in clinical trials, it is common practice to assess and report any adverse events to determine the safety of the given drug and dose. Therefore, comprehensively assessing adverse effects of psychotropic drugs is of high relevance as well.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^72b76153]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Research-to-practice considerations for psilocybin — patients in trials are rigorously screened for exclusionary criteria or contraindications (e.g., bipolar disorder, psychosis, substance use disorder), whereas in routine care patient histories can be partial or unclear and risk stratification more nuanced; highly trained mental health care specialists are required to be present before, during, and after treatment sessions, creating staffing and reimbursement challenges.

### Psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases [^36455cf9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Psychedelic-assisted therapy refers to a group of therapeutic practices involving psychedelics taken under therapeutic supervision from physicians, psychologists, and others. It has been hypothesised that psychedelic-assisted therapy may reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in patients facing life-threatening diseases (e.g. cancer). However, these substances are illegal in most countries and have been associated with potential risks.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or active comparators (e.g. antidepressants) for treatment of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers on 30 March 2024. In addition, we undertook reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We used no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with no restrictions regarding comorbidity, sex, or ethnicity. Interventions comprised a substance-induced psychedelic experience preceded by preparatory therapeutic sessions and followed by integrative therapeutic sessions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six studies in the review, which evaluated two different interventions: psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin ('magic mushrooms') and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)), and psychedelic-assisted therapy with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'). The studies randomised 149 participants with life-threatening diseases and analysed data for 140 of them. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months, and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and in Switzerland. Drug companies were not involved in study funding, but funding was provided by organisations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy. Primary outcomes (at 1 to 12 weeks) Anxiety Psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may result in a reduction in anxiety when compared to active placebo (or low-dose psychedelic): State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Trait, scale 20 to 80) mean difference (MD) -8.41, 95% CI -12.92 to -3.89; STAI-State (scale 20 to 80) MD -9.04, 95% CI -13.87 to -4.21; 5 studies, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence. The effect of psychedelic-assisted therapy using MDMA on anxiety, compared to placebo, is very uncertain: STAI-T MD -14.70, 95% CI -29.45 to 0.05; STAI-S MD -16.10, 95% CI -33.03 to 0.83; 1 study, 18 participants; very low certainty evidence. Depression Psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may result in a reduction in depression when compared to active placebo (or low-dose psychedelic): Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, scale 0 to 63) MD -4.92, 95% CI -8.97 to -0.87; 4 studies, 112 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.43, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.06; 5 studies, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence. The effect of psychedelic-assisted therapy using MDMA on depression, compared to placebo, is very uncertain: BDI-II (scale: 0 to 63) MD -6.30, 95% CI -16.93 to 4.33; 1 study, 18 participants; very low certainty evidence. Existential distress Psychedelic-assisted therapy using classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) compared to active placebo (or low-dose psychedelic) may result in a reduction in demoralisation, one of the most common measures of existential distress, but the evidence is very uncertain (Demoralisation Scale, 1 study, 28 participants): post treatment scores, placebo group 39.6 (SEM 3.4), psilocybin group 18.8 (3.6), P ≤ 0.01). Evidence from other measures of existential distress was mixed. Existential distress was not measured in people receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy with MDMA. Secondary outcomes (at 1 to 12 weeks) Quality of life When classical psychedelics were used, one study had inconclusive results and two reported improved quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain. MDMA did not improve quality of life measures, but the evidence is also very uncertain. Spirituality Participants receiving psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics rated their experience as being spiritually significant (2 studies), but the evidence is very uncertain. Spirituality was not assessed in participants receiving MDMA. Adverse events No treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events grade 3/4 were reported. Common minor to moderate adverse events for classical psychedelics were elevated blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, emotional distress, and psychotic-like symptoms (e.g. pseudo-hallucination where the participant is aware they are hallucinating); for MDMA, common minor to moderate adverse events were anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headaches. Symptoms subsided when drug effects wore off or up to one week later. Certainty of the evidence Although all six studies had intended to blind participants, personnel, and assessors, blinding could not be achieved as this is very difficult in studies investigating psychedelics. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the certainty of evidence to be low to very low, mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision (small sample size).

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practice Psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may be effective for treating anxiety, depression, and possibly existential distress, in people facing a life-threatening disease. Psychedelic-assisted therapy seemed to be well tolerated, with no treatment-emergent serious adverse events reported in the studies included in this review. However, the certainty of evidence is low to very low, which means that we cannot be sure about these results, and they might be changed by future research. At the time of this review (2024), psychedelic drugs are illegal in many countries. Implications for research The risk of bias due to 'unblinding' (participants being aware of which intervention they are receiving) could be reduced by measuring expectation bias, checking blinding has been maintained before cross-over, and using active placebos. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to reduce imprecision. As the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) currently classifies psychedelics as Schedule I substances (i.e. having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse), research involving these drugs is restricted, but is steadily increasing.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^d2fe6a31]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD PTSD CPG — MDMA-assisted psychotherapy — Recommendation 23 states there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). MDMA-assisted psychotherapy involves an individual taking MDMA before 2–3 eight hour psychotherapy sessions; typically, 3 preparatory sessions occur before the first MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session, and up to 3 "integration" sessions occur after each MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session (for a total of 12–15 sessions), and MDMA sessions are provided by two therapists, typically a man and a woman. Five small to moderately sized RCTs (including a total of 176 participants) have found this form of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to benefit individuals with PTSD, but studies have differed notably in the control condition used; some have used low-dose MDMA as the control condition, whereas others have used an inactive placebo, and studies using low-dose MDMA as the control condition generally demonstrated much better blinding; additionally, these studies included few Veterans and no active duty Service members, and it would be challenging to implement MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in current VA and DoD health care systems.

### Why psychiatry needs 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine: a child psychiatrist's perspective [^1f47bccb]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

But will MDMA for addictions work? Drug-assisted psychotherapies with the "classical" psychedelic compounds, such as LSD and psilocybin, have found that the subjective mystical/spiritual effects of the psychedelic experience are strongly associated with maintained abstinence from substance use. However, there is a subjective spiritual/mystical experience associated with MDMA use, albeit generally less so than with "classicals". Furthermore, not all patients are able to tolerate the perceptually disturbing effects of the classical psychedelic experience, or even the idea of a treatment involving 'classicals', and compliance is a critical part of addiction therapy. Therefore, MDMA offers an alternative opportunity for enhanced psychotherapy.

This year in Bristol, UK, we will use an open-label design and aim to recruit 20 patients with alcohol use disorder who have completed a successful community detoxification to a 10-week program consisting of 2 sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy and 8 sessions of non-MDMA-assisted therapy. The study will test if MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is feasible in this patient group, if it is tolerated and if it can be delivered safely in a clinical setting, offering patients a potential new approach to this devastating, chronic, and relapsing condition.

### Psychedelic-assisted therapy in military and veterans healthcare systems: clinical, legal, and implementation considerations [^89362a14]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the current and projected landscape of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT), with a focus on clinical, legal, and implementation considerations in Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare systems.

Recent Findings

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)- and psilocybin-assisted therapy have shown promising outcomes in efficacy, safety, tolerability, and durability for PTSD and depression, respectively. MDMA-assisted therapy is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an Expanded Access ("compassionate use") basis for PTSD, with full approval projected for 2024. Psilocybin-assisted therapy is projected to be FDA-approved for depression soon thereafter. Other psychedelics are in earlier stages of development. The VA is currently conducting PAT clinical trials. Although there are clear legal pathways for the VA and DoD to conduct PAT trials, a number of implementation barriers exist, such as the very high number of clinical hours necessary to treat each patient, resource requirements to support treatment infrastructure, military-specific considerations, and the high level of evidence necessary for PAT to be recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Ongoing considerations are whether and how PAT will be made available to VA and DoD beneficiaries, feasibility and cost-effectiveness, and ethical safeguards that must be implemented to prioritize access to PAT given the likelihood of extremely limited initial availability. However, with imminent FDA approval of PATs and considerable national interest in these treatments, DoD and VA policymakers must be prepared with clearly delineated policies and plans for how these healthcare systems will approach PAT.

Call to action — psilocybin clinical research priorities are stated explicitly: To this end, we advocate for expansion of funding mechanisms (including from major public funders such as the National Institutes of Health) to enable rigorous and hypothesis-driven evidence and pilot studies; large-scale studies incorporating multidisciplinary expansion across basic, translational, and clinical sciences; multicentre collaboration via consortia with predefined data harmonisation to facilitate big-data approaches and multi-site secondary analyses; further studies involving diverse study populations with intentional inclusion of marginalised communities and diverse backgrounds; and large-scale safety studies to evaluate the relative contributions of drug vs. associated therapy as well as their interactions.

### Ethical considerations for psychedelic-assisted therapy in military clinical settings [^d3300a1c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Psychedelic treatments, particularly 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted and psilocybin-assisted therapies, have recently seen renewed interest in their clinical potential to treat various mental health conditions. Clinical trials for both MDMA-assisted and psilocybin-assisted therapies have shown to be highly efficacious for post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression. Recent research trials for psychedelic-assisted therapies (PAT) have demonstrated that although they are resource-intensive, their effects are rapid-acting, durable and cost-effective. These results have generated enthusiasm among researchers seeking to investigate psychedelic therapies in active-duty service members of the US military, particularly those with treatment refractory mental health conditions. At the same time, psychedelics remain in early stages of clinical investigation, have not yet achieved regulatory approval for general clinical use and may confer unique psychological and neurobiological effects that could raise novel ethical considerations when treating active-duty service members. Should psychedelics achieve regulatory approval, military relevant considerations may include issues of access to these treatments, appropriate procedures for informed consent, confidentiality standards, and possible unanticipated mental health risks and other psychological sequelae. A service member's deployability, as well as their ability to return to full military duty following PAT, may also be of unique concern. The authors argue that MDMA-assisted therapy currently represents a promising treatment that should be more rapidly investigated as a clinical therapy for service members while still taking a measured approach that accounts for the many military-specific uncertainties that remain.

### Ethical issues with psychedelic-assisted treatments in psychiatry: a systematic scoping review [^2a5757fe]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on promising preliminary results from clinical trials, it seems likely that psychedelic substances (classic serotonergic psychedelics, such as psilocybin, and entactogens, such as MDMA) will be introduced into psychiatry as psychedelic-assisted therapy. This also raises a range of ethical questions that urgently need to be addressed before widespread roll-out in society. This scoping review fills a gap in the literature by providing an overview of these ethical issues using a systematic search, presentation, and descriptive analysis of ethical issues in psychedelic-assisted treatments. It includes peer-reviewed studies pertaining to human study participants and psychiatric patients (population), which discuss ethical issues (concept) of psychedelic treatments (context) in clinical trials and other clinical applications. The systematic search included several databases: MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, HeinOnline, and PsycArticles. The search strategy, including all identified keywords and index terms, was adapted for each included database. The search was completed in June 2025 and studies published until then in any language were included. After an iterative process of inductive and deductive coding of ethical issues, the scoping review comprises seven themes related to the ethics of psychedelic-assisted treatments: (1) safety and patient well-being, (2) therapeutic relationships, (3) informed consent, (4) equity and access, (5) research ethics, (6) special contexts, and (7) societal and cultural implications. The results can be used to inform and stimulate further discussion and in-depth research on the ethics of psychedelic-assisted treatments, possibly leading to more nuanced debate surrounding a safer and more ethical implementation of psychedelic-assisted treatments in the future.

### The efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials [^d4f0f699]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy, is one of the most widely used illicit substances worldwide. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has become a novel treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed over the past decade. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and demonstrate the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to October 27, 2023, selected RCTs assessing the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD, and evaluated their quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Seven RCTs were selected from the retrieved references. The results revealed that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy effectively reduced the change from baseline score in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale in patients with PTSD compared with either placebo or active controls. However, MDMA causes a series of adverse events, including muscle tightness, nausea, and decreased appetite. To a certain extent, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may improve symptoms in patients with PTSD. However, side effects and abuse issues still seriously hinder clinical application of MDMA.

### Can pragmatic research, real-world data and digital technologies aid the development of psychedelic medicine? [^705fc582]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Favourable regulatory assessments, liberal policy changes, new research centres and substantial commercial investment signal that psychedelic therapy is making a major comeback. Positive findings from modern trials are catalysing developments, but it is questionable whether current confirmatory trials are sufficient for advancing our understanding of safety and best practice. Here we suggest supplementing traditional confirmatory trials with pragmatic trials, real-world data initiatives and digital health solutions to better support the discovery of optimal and personalised treatment protocols and parameters. These recommendations are intended to help support the development of safe, effective and cost-efficient psychedelic therapy, which, given its history, is vulnerable to excesses of hype and regulation.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Potential psychiatric uses for MDMA [^134ebd4f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

In cases of unmet medical need, the FDA has provided special programs with accelerated pathways for approval that may apply to MDMA, as effect size estimates for PTSD are large, relapse rates are low, and administration under strictly controlled conditions improves compliance over available treatments. In addition, risk evaluation mitigation strategies (REMS) will allow sponsor oversight of certification of treatment providers, to assure that they have the necessary experience and qualifications to administer MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy. Appropriate mechanisms to prevent abuse and diversion will likely preclude take‐home prescriptions, and may involve restricting use to licensed clinics. Based on coadministration studies with psychiatric medications typically prescribed, MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy is unlikely to cause safety concerns within an integrated medication management model, but washout of other medications may be needed for optimal results. The outcome of negotiations with the FDA regarding phase III clinical trials and subsequent marketing remain to be determined.

As MDMA is not patentable and will be difficult to commercialize with single‐dose treatments, the most suitable avenue is nonprofit drug development. The nonprofit organization funding and sponsoring clinical trials of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy has made substantial progress using rigorous scientific approaches complying with cautious regulatory requirements. This progress demonstrates that it is possible to study Schedule 1 drugs under the current regulatory structure, but that progress in this area has been undesirably slow. Meticulously establishing safety and efficacy is crucial to evaluating the risk/benefit profile of single‐dose treatments as an adjunct to psychotherapy, which may offer improved safety and compliance over available treatments. Fostering open science principles, e.g. prioritizing publishing in peer‐reviewed journals and data transparency, will ultimately prove beneficial in shaping and expediting the regulatory environment that applies to MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and similar models with other compounds. Implementation of novel MDMA‐assisted therapies could hold the promise of lasting improvements in social and psychological function for patients, and of deeper understanding of psychiatric disturbances across multiple disorders.

### 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine's (MDMA' s) impact on posttraumatic stress disorder [^5dd0666d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Review the current literature assessing the role of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Data Sources

OVID MEDLINE search (1960-February 2014) using the terms MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Molly, and Ecstasy crossed with posttraumatic stress disorder with backwards citation tracking using references from procured articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English language studies assessing MDMA in patients with PTSD.

Data Synthesis

Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted along with follow-up open-label and extension evaluations. In the 3 RCTs, therapy with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is promising, with reductions in PTSD rating scale scores (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, Severity of Symptoms Scale for PTSD Scale), although 2 of 3 trials did not show significant results, and all three had methodological limitations. The direction of effect for all trials was toward benefit in patients who were refractory to other PTSD therapies; the percentage reductions on rating scores ranged from 23% to 68%; and in 1 trial, the effect was sustained over a long period of time. MDMA ingestion without sustained psychotherapy over a 6- to 8-hour period is unlikely to be beneficial; trying to prolong the duration of effect with supplemental dosing is unlikely to provide additional benefits; and there are adverse effects on blood pressure and heart rate that should be appreciated. These studies used unadulterated MDMA with known and reproducible potency, which may not happen with street purchase of the product.

Conclusions

MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be an effective therapy in refractory PTSD but needs further evaluation to determine its place in contemporary therapy.

Secondary outcomes

All secondary outcomes are reported for the ITT set (Table 2). More participants in the active dose groups did not meet PTSD diagnostic criteria according to the CAPS-IV at the primary endpoint (33.3% (40 mg), 44.4% (100 mg), and 41.7% (125 mg)). As a measure of clinical significance, the percentage of participants who attained a ⩾30% decrease in CAPS-IV total scores was substantially greater for active dose groups (16.7% (40 mg), 55.6% (100 mg), and 50.0% (125 mg)). Change in depressive symptoms, determined by the BDI-II, was approximately equivalent across groups (F 2,26 = 0.03, p = 0.97). Mean (SD) change in PSQI total scores was −0.8 (2.5) for 40 mg, −3.6 (6.2) for 100 mg, −2.0 (4.7) for 125 mg, indicating some improvement in sleep quality for all groups, yet this failed to reach significance (F 2,26 = 0.583, p = 0.57). Fewer dissociative experiences were reported by active dose groups (mean (SD) change in DES-II total scores, −13.3 (15.3) for 100 mg, and −5.9 (12.0) for 125 mg) compared to 40 mg −0.2 (6.9), although the difference was not significant (F 2,26 = 2.09, p = 0.15).

### Why psychiatry needs 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine: a child psychiatrist's perspective [^13a55aad]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Since the late 1980s the psychoactive drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has had a well-known history as the recreationally used drug ecstasy. What is less well known by the public is that MDMA started its life as a therapeutic agent and that in recent years an increasing amount of clinical research has been undertaken to revisit the drug's medical potential. MDMA has unique pharmacological properties that translate well to its proposed agent to assist trauma-focused psychotherapy. Psychological trauma-especially that which arises early in life from child abuse-underpins many chronic adult mental disorders, including addictions. Several studies of recent years have investigated the potential role of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, with ongoing plans to see MDMA therapy licensed and approved within the next 5 years. Issues of safety and controversy frequently surround this research, owing to MDMA's often negative media-driven bias. However, accurate examination of the relative risks and benefits of clinical MDMA-in contrast to the recreational use of ecstasy-must be considered when assessing its potential benefits and the merits of future research. In this review, the author describes these potential benefits and explores the relatives risks of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the context of his experience as a child and adolescent psychiatrist, having seen the relative limitations of current pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies for treating complex post-traumatic stress disorder arising from child abuse.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^f08215ec]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults — study inclusion/exclusion decisions varied by the particular systematic review/meta-analysis based on the PICOTS, and although two reviews included a few nonrandomized trials, overall the reviews only included randomized controlled trial (RCTs) studies as those met quality criteria for questions regarding efficacy. The Panel observed that a prior review did not include complex PTSD or trauma and excluded "complementary and alternative medicine approaches" and "psychological or pharmacological interventions not listed as included", and there was significant clinical interest in complementary and integrative health interventions, psychedelic interventions (e.g., ketamine, MDMA), and augmentation approaches. Given the date of the AHRQ review and being inclusive of other interventions, the Panel agreed to include 15 systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Methods

Participants and study overview

Candidates were recruited via Internet advertisements and referrals from mental health professionals and were screened using a scripted telephone interview (see Figure 1). Potential participants, men and women 18 years or older, underwent in-person psychological assessment, electrocardiogram, and physical examinations. Inclusion criteria required PTSD for at least six months, and a score of ⩾50 on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV). Candidates had failed to respond to at least one course of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy. Participants were otherwise physically healthy and free of psychiatric or medical contraindications for receiving MDMA. Women could not be pregnant or lactating. The study was conducted at an outpatient clinic in Boulder, Colorado between October 2012–February 2017. This trial was reviewed by the Copernicus Group Independent Review Board (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA), and was designed and conducted in accordance with good clinical practices and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT #NCT01793610).

Figure 1.
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram.

Procedures

After written informed consent and enrollment, participants completed outcome measures and were interviewed by an independent rater to assess baseline PTSD severity, functioning, and psychological history (see Figure 2). To establish a safe setting and therapeutic alliance before MDMA sessions, participants underwent three 90-minute preparatory sessions with a male/female therapy team. Psychiatric medications were tapered by the study physician and discontinued at least five half-lives before MDMA administration. Each participant was assigned to one of nine therapy teams (eight therapists in total).
