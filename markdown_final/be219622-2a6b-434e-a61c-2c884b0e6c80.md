## Question

Is amiodarone appropriate for treating sinus tachycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amiodarone is appropriate for treating sinus tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what sinus tachycardia is and differentiate physiologic sinus tachycardia from inappropriate sinus tachycardia and other SVTs. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and major toxicities of amiodarone. Next, I will review guideline-directed management for sinus tachycardia and see where amiodarone, if anywhere, fits. Finally, I will synthesize risk-benefit and provide a clear recommendation with safer alternatives, cross-checking key sources along the way [^1148gwhd] [^111Yq1ia] [^114KeoD1].

> Let me first confirm definitions because jumping ahead could misclassify the rhythm. Sinus tachycardia is either physiologic or secondary to a treatable condition, in which case therapy targets the underlying cause rather than the heart rate itself, or it is inappropriate sinus tachycardia, a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by resting HR > 100 bpm and distressing symptoms in the absence of physiologic triggers, often related to autonomic dysfunction, with generally benign long-term prognosis despite significant symptom burden [^114KeoD1] [^112459Bv] [^111Yq1ia].

> Next, I should review amiodarone's labeled use, because off-label use in a benign condition with a toxic agent would be a red flag. Amiodarone is indicated for documented, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, specifically ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia in adults, and it carries a boxed warning to reserve use for such life-threatening arrhythmias given substantial and potentially life-threatening toxicity, with contraindications including sick sinus syndrome and significant bradycardia without pacing support [^1148gwhd] [^113Qeczr] [^112Rmfdh].

> Hold on, I should verify the toxicity burden, because that heavily informs risk-benefit in a non–life-threatening rhythm like sinus tachycardia. Amiodarone is associated with serious pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis reported in up to 17% with approximately 10% fatality in some series, hepatic injury that can be fatal, and proarrhythmia including exacerbation of arrhythmias and torsades, alongside thyroid dysfunction, bradycardia and sinus arrest, optic neuropathy and visual loss, neuropathy, photosensitivity and skin discoloration, with adverse reactions occurring in most patients at maintenance doses and prompting discontinuation in a substantial minority [^113Qeczr] [^113LZuW7] [^117LW65H] [^113fHQnJ].

> Now, I need to check guideline-directed therapy for sinus tachycardia specifically, not to conflate it with other SVTs. For physiologic or secondary sinus tachycardia, the treatment is to identify and correct the underlying driver; rate-lowering drugs are generally not the therapy of choice unless the clinician determines there is noncompensatory tachycardia requiring short-term control, for which a short-acting beta-blocker like esmolol is labeled and appropriate when intervention is necessary, while IST management prioritizes lifestyle measures and first-line beta-blockade despite limited efficacy and increasingly uses ivabradine, which consistently reduces heart rate and symptoms in randomized and pooled prospective data, with invasive sinus node modification reserved for refractory cases due to modest efficacy and risk [^114KeoD1] [^112rndtV] [^111Yq1ia] [^116X3u4t] [^117R5VHc].

> Wait, let me verify whether amiodarone has any endorsed role in sinus-node mediated tachycardias, because it does appear in SVT algorithms for other mechanisms. In acute management of certain non–sinus-node SVTs such as focal atrial tachycardia, AVNRT, or refractory antidromic AVRT, guidelines allow consideration of IV amiodarone when first-line measures fail or are contraindicated, but these involve reentrant or focal atrial mechanisms distinct from sinus tachycardia and do not translate to IST or physiologic sinus tachycardia management [^113i1feu] [^115aBUqq] [^115Sf4TH].

> I should synthesize the risk-benefit now, and let me correct an initial instinct I had that amiodarone's broad antiarrhythmic efficacy might make it a catch-all for symptomatic tachycardias; that's not appropriate here. There is a clear indication mismatch because amiodarone is reserved for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, while sinus tachycardia, including IST, is generally benign in long-term prognosis, so the toxicity profile is disproportionate to the clinical problem, and importantly, amiodarone can itself cause bradyarrhythmias and worsen arrhythmias, is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome, and there are safer, targeted alternatives like ivabradine and short-acting beta-blockers when needed, with no major guideline endorsing amiodarone for sinus tachycardia [^1148gwhd] [^113Qeczr] [^113LZuW7] [^117LW65H] [^116X3u4t] [^111Yq1ia].

> But wait, what if the clinician is facing severe symptoms and is considering any option; I should double-check whether any authoritative review suggests amiodarone for IST or physiologic ST. Contemporary reviews and clinical guidance emphasize treating secondary causes, using beta-blockers judiciously, and favoring ivabradine for IST, without recommending amiodarone for sinus tachycardia, and SVT guidelines addressing non–sinus-node arrhythmias do not extend those recommendations to sinus tachycardia syndromes [^114KeoD1] [^111Yq1ia] [^11696cDx].

> Finalizing the recommendation, I need to ensure the plan is practical. Amiodarone is not appropriate for sinus tachycardia given absence of indication, lack of supportive guideline endorsement, and substantial toxicity; manage physiologic or secondary sinus tachycardia by correcting the precipitant and use short-acting beta-blockade only if the clinician determines noncompensatory tachycardia warrants brief rate control, while for IST consider lifestyle measures, trial of beta-blocker, and ivabradine for symptom and rate reduction, reserving ablation for refractory cases and avoiding amiodarone because the risk-benefit is unfavorable in this benign condition [^113Qeczr] [^114KeoD1] [^112rndtV] [^116X3u4t] [^111Yq1ia].

No, amiodarone is **not indicated for sinus tachycardia**. Because of its significant toxicity profile, it is reserved for **life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias** and select refractory supraventricular tachycardias [^1148gwhd] [^113Qeczr]. Sinus tachycardia is best managed by **addressing underlying causes**, with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers used when needed [^112459Bv] [^111Yq1ia]. Amiodarone should be considered only in rare, refractory cases when other therapies have failed or are contraindicated, and then with close monitoring for serious adverse effects [^113Qeczr] [^113LZuW7].

---

## Indications for amiodarone

Amiodarone is **primarily indicated** for the following arrhythmias:

- **Ventricular fibrillation (VF)**: Life-threatening, recurrent, refractory [^1148gwhd].

- **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)**: Life-threatening, recurrent, refractory, hemodynamically unstable [^1148gwhd].

- **Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)**: Off-label use for rhythm control in refractory cases [^117Y97dE].

- **Atrial fibrillation (AF)**: Off-label use for rate control and pharmacological cardioversion in selected patients [^117Y97dE].

## Sinus tachycardia: definition and management

Sinus tachycardia is characterized by a sinus rhythm with a **heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute**. There are two main types: **appropriate sinus tachycardia**, secondary to identifiable causes such as fever, anemia, hyperthyroidism, hypovolemia, or anxiety [^112459Bv]; and **inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)**, a persistently elevated heart rate without identifiable secondary causes, often associated with autonomic dysfunction [^112459Bv]. Management primarily involves **identifying and treating underlying causes**, with pharmacological options — such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers — considered for symptomatic patients or those with IST [^112459Bv].

---

## Amiodarone in sinus tachycardia: clinical evidence

There is **limited clinical evidence** supporting amiodarone for sinus tachycardia. While it prolongs the cardiac action potential and refractory period — making it effective for ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias — its use in sinus tachycardia is not well documented or supported by clinical guidelines. A study by Ortiz et al. (2017) compared intravenous procainamide and amiodarone for acute treatment of wide QRS tachycardia but **did not address sinus tachycardia** [^113ZjmEG]. Similarly, other studies have focused on amiodarone's efficacy in ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation rather than sinus tachycardia [^112Xa29A] [^1178XVrt].

## Risks and contraindications of amiodarone

Amiodarone is associated with **significant risks and contraindications**, including:

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^113Qeczr].

- **Hepatic toxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, and hepatic failure [^113Qeczr].

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism due to iodine content [^113Qeczr].

- **Cardiac toxicity**: Bradycardia, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and exacerbation of arrhythmias [^113Qeczr].

- **Ocular toxicity**: Corneal microdeposits, optic neuropathy, and visual impairment [^113Qeczr].

- **Dermatological reactions**: Photosensitivity, blue-gray skin discoloration [^113Qeczr].

- **Neurological effects**: Peripheral neuropathy, tremors, ataxia [^113Qeczr].

The following are **contraindications**:

- **Cardiogenic shock**.

- **Severe sinus-node dysfunction**.

- **Second- or third-degree AV block**: Without a functioning pacemaker [^112Rmfdh].

- **Bradycardia**: Leading to syncope without a functioning pacemaker [^112Rmfdh].

- **Hypersensitivity**: To amiodarone or iodine [^112Rmfdh].

Given these risks, amiodarone is typically **reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias** or refractory cases in which other treatments have failed.

---

## Alternative treatments for sinus tachycardia

For sinus tachycardia, alternative **pharmacological treatments** include:

- **Beta-blockers**: First-line therapy for symptomatic sinus tachycardia or IST [^112459Bv].

- **Calcium channel blockers**: Verapamil or diltiazem for rate control in symptomatic patients [^112459Bv].

- **Ivabradine**: Selective sinus node inhibitor effective in reducing heart rate and symptoms in IST [^116X3u4t].

Non-pharmacological interventions include lifestyle modifications, catheter ablation, or **surgical sinus node modification** for refractory cases [^112459Bv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **do not support the routine use** of amiodarone for sinus tachycardia. It is reserved for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or refractory supraventricular arrhythmias, and for sinus tachycardia is considered only in rare, refractory cases when other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.

---

Amiodarone is **not indicated for sinus tachycardia** given its significant toxicity and lack of supporting clinical evidence; it should be considered only in rare, refractory cases when other treatments have failed or are contraindicated. Alternative treatments — such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ivabradine — are preferred for managing sinus tachycardia.

- **Warning: Pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac toxicity**: Pacerone is intended for use only in patients with indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Pacerone can cause pulmonary toxicity, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, which has resulted in clinically manifest disease in up to 17% of some patient series. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal approximately 10% of the time. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when initiating Pacerone therapy. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Pacerone can cause hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce the dose if the increase exceeds three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue Pacerone if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pacerone can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^111Yq1ia]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a syndrome in which the sinus heart rate is inexplicably faster than expected, and associated symptoms are present. The heart rate at rest, even when supine, can exceed 100 beats per minute; minimal activity accelerates the rate rapidly and substantially. Patients with IST may require restrictions from physical activity.

The mechanisms responsible for IST are incompletely understood. It is important to distinguish IST from appropriate sinus tachycardia and from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with which overlap may occur. Because the long-term outcome seems to be benign, treatment may be unnecessary or as simple as physical training. However, for patients with intolerable symptoms, therapeutic measures are warranted.

Even at high doses, β-adrenergic blockers, the first-line therapy, are often ineffective; the same is true for most other medical therapies. In rare instances, catheter- or surgically-based right atrial or sinus node modification may be helpful, but even this is fraught with limited efficacy and potential complications. Overtreatment, in an attempt to reduce symptoms, can be difficult to avoid but is discouraged.

### Pacerone [^113LZuW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Worsened arrhythmia**: Pacerone can exacerbate the presenting arrhythmia in about 2% to 5% of patients or cause new ventricular fibrillation, incessant ventricular tachycardia, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QTc prolongation (Torsade de Pointes [TdP]). Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride, as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP. Give special attention to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or receiving drugs affecting electrolyte levels, such as diuretics, laxatives, systemic corticosteroids, or amphotericin B.

- **Visual impairment and loss of vision**: Cases of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment and sometimes permanent blindness, have been reported in patients treated with amiodarone and may occur at any time during therapy. If symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision, consider discontinuing Pacerone and promptly refer for ophthalmic examination. Regular ophthalmic examination, including funduscopy and slit-lamp examination, is recommended during administration of Pacerone [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- **Corneal microdeposits**: Corneal microdeposits appear in the majority of adults treated with amiodarone hydrochloride. They are usually discernible only by slit-lamp examination.

### Pacerone [^1148gwhd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Pacerone is indicated for the treatment of documented, life-threatening ventricular fibrillation and life-threatening hemodynamically unstable tachycardia in adults who have not responded to adequate doses of other available antiarrhythmics or when alternative agents cannot be tolerated.

- **Indications and usage**: Pacerone is an antiarrhythmic indicated for:
	- Ventricular fibrillation.
	- Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: Etiology, pathophysiology, and management: JACC review topic of the week [^112459Bv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a clinical syndrome predominantly affecting young patients, characterized by distressing symptoms. While palpitations are the most common symptom, IST can also manifest as anxiety, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope. The pathogenesis of IST remains poorly understood and is considered multifactorial, with autonomic dysfunction as the primary abnormality. IST is typically diagnosed through exclusion.

Management of IST is clinically challenging. The overall efficacy of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy may be limited. However, recent advances in catheter and surgical sinus node sparing ablation techniques have shown improvement in patient outcomes. Additionally, there has been an increased emphasis on developing multimodality team-based interventions to further enhance outcomes for patients with IST.

This review examines the mechanistic basis of IST, explores approaches to diagnosis, and outlines contemporary therapeutic strategies.

### Cabins, castles, and constant hearts: Rhythm control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113aq1gB]. European Heart Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Effectiveness and safety of antiarrhythmic drug therapy

On average, antiarrhythmic drugs double the proportion of patients who maintain sinus rhythm. Amiodarone is more effective than other antiarrhythmic drugs in maintaining sinus rhythm, and catheter ablation is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs. The long-term complication rates of antiarrhythmic drug therapy are comparable to complications in patients treated with AF ablation. Although amiodarone has been associated with adverse outcomes in non-randomized analyses of patients at very high risk, the safety of antiarrhythmic drug therapy found in recent randomized trials in patients with AF attenuates historical safety concerns, particularly in patients with heart failure.

Unlike earlier trials of antiarrhythmic drugs compared to placebo or rate control therapy, antiarrhythmic drug therapy with dronedarone was associated with reduced cardiovascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular deaths compared to placebo. The same substance, dronedarone, used as a rate-controlling agent, was associated with higher rates of heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients with permanent AF in the PALLAS trial. Patients included in PALLAS were not considered suitable for rhythm control therapy, did not receive interventions to restore sinus rhythm (e.g. cardioversion, AF ablation), and had severe heart failure. Hence, they were deprived of any potential to benefit from sinus rhythm. Patients treated with dronedarone in ATHENA, in contrast, received that therapy to restore sinus rhythm. Taken together, these data ma

### Comparing intravenous amiodarone or lidocaine, or both, outcomes for inpatients with pulseless ventricular arrhythmias [^116kECFr]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare survival rates of patients experiencing in-hospital cardiac arrest due to pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. These patients were treated with either lidocaine, amiodarone, or a combination of both.

- **Design**: The study was a multicenter retrospective medical record review.

- **Setting**: It was conducted across three academic medical centers in the United States.

- **Patients**: The patient group consisted of hospitalized adults who received treatments for pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation between August 1, 2000, and July 31, 2002.

- **Measurements and main results**: Data were collected following the Utstein style. Analysis was conducted using chi-square tests to evaluate survival at 24 hours and at discharge. Out of 605 medical records, 194 met the inclusion criteria: 79 for lidocaine, 74 for amiodarone, and 41 for the combination. The study found no significant difference in the proportion of patients alive 24 hours after cardiac arrest (p = .39). A Cox regression analysis showed a decreased likelihood of survival for those with an initial rhythm of pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, in comparison to those presenting with bradycardia followed by these rhythms. Additionally, patients receiving amiodarone had worse outcomes compared to those receiving lidocaine. It was noted that only 25% of patients in the amiodarone group received the recommended initial 300-mg intravenous bolus, and amiodarone was administered on average 8 minutes later during the code than lidocaine (p < .001).

### Brevibloc [^112rndtV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Brevibloc injection is a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of certain cardiac conditions.

- **Indications and usage**: Brevibloc is utilized for the control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and for the management of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia. It is also used to address perioperative tachycardia and hypertension.

- **Supraventricular tachycardia or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia**: Brevibloc (esmolol hydrochloride) injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. This applies in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short-term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Additionally, it is suitable for noncompensatory sinus tachycardia situations where the physician determines that the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Brevibloc is intended for short-term use.

- **Intraoperative and postoperative tachycardia and/or hypertension**: Brevibloc injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia, and in the postoperative period. The decision to use Brevibloc should be made by the physician when such specific intervention is deemed necessary.

Use of Brevibloc injection to prevent such events is not recommended.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^117XvvXV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Verapamil Hydrochloride Injection, USP is indicated for the following uses:

- **Indications and usage**: Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [W-P-W] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [L-G-L] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to verapamil hydrochloride administration. Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation is recommended, except when these conditions are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [W-P-W] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [L-G-L] syndromes).

In controlled studies conducted in the United States, about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous administration of verapamil hydrochloride. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. Approximately 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation who present with a faster ventricular rate respond with a decrease in ventricular rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after verapamil hydrochloride administration, and it may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, as the conversion rate after placebo was similar. Slowing of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter lasts 30 to 60 minutes following a single injection.

A small fraction (< 1.0%) of patients treated with verapamil hydrochloride respond with… (incomplete sentence removed).

### Fetal supraventricular tachycardia: A role for amiodarone as second-line therapy [^116cBf4b]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of amiodarone for the prenatal treatment of hydropic fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia. A group of 26 hydropic fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia was studied retrospectively.

Twenty-five fetuses received transplacental treatment. The overall prenatal conversion rate was 60%. Nine fetuses were converted to sinus rhythm using either flecainide (n = 7) or amiodarone (n = 2) as first-line therapy, whilst digoxin alone or in association with sotalol failed to restore sinus rhythm in all cases. After first-line therapy, supraventricular tachycardia persisted in 10 fetuses. Nine fetuses received amiodarone alone or in association with digoxin as second-line therapy, five of whom were converted to sinus rhythm. Among the 11 live neonates treated by amiodarone in utero, 2 (17%) presented an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone at day 3–4. These two infants received thyroid hormone substitution therapy and had a normal outcome.

When first-line therapy fails to restore sinus rhythm in hydropic fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia, amiodarone therapy should be considered as it allows a substantial number of fetuses to be converted prenatally.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride PO (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):

- **Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders**: Use caution, as amiodarone can cause thyroid abnormalities, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

- **Bradycardia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can cause symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest, especially in the presence of electrolyte disorders or concomitant use of antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes.

- **Conduction disorders**: Use caution in patients undergoing surgery, as amiodarone may increase sensitivity to the myocardial depressant and conduction effects of halogenated inhalational anesthetics.

- **Interference with implanted cardiac devices**: Use caution in patients with implanted defibrillators or pacemakers, as chronic use of antiarrhythmic drugs may affect pacing and defibrillation thresholds.

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy.

- **Persistence of adverse effects**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks after discontinuation due to the long half-life of amiodarone.

- **Photosensitivity of skin, skin discoloration**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can induce photosensitization and cause blue-gray discoloration of the skin with long-term use.

- **Visual disturbances**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis.

### Amiodarone as a first-line therapy for postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia [^113qXbVM]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia that is often resistant to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was suggested to be an adequate treatment; however, data regarding its efficacy and safety are limited. This study evaluated the efficacy of amiodarone in the first-line treatment of postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia and assessed factors associated with the failure of amiodarone therapy.

- **Methods**: The study included 40 pediatric cardiosurgical patients with postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia. Intravenous amiodarone in 2-mg/kg boluses and, if necessary, as continuous infusion (10 to 15 µg/kg/min) were used as the first-line therapy. Restoration of sinus rhythm or slowing of junctional ectopic tachycardia to a rate that allowed atrial or atrioventricular sequential pacing was considered as the efficacy of therapy.

- **Results**: Amiodarone was effective in 18 patients (45%). Sinus rhythm was achieved in 7 patients, and heart rate decreased in 11 patients from 180 (range, 173 to 200) to 142 (range, 133–155) beats/min (p < 0.0001), allowing effective pacing with atrioventricular synchrony. Higher arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference (p = 0.007) and lower body temperature (p = 0.02) were associated with the failure of amiodarone therapy.

- **Conclusions**: Amiodarone as the first-line treatment was effective in almost half of the patients with postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia. Higher arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference and lower body temperature were associated with the failure of amiodarone.

Unexpectedly, the baseline value of BRS in patients treated with amiodarone tended to be greater than in those without, because it is well known that amiodarone reduces the sinus rate, which could result in underestimation of the BRS. Our findings appeared to be consistent with the recent report that demonstrated amiodarone could have the potential to improve cardiac autonomic function. The comparison of patients with and without amiodarone is limited in number and may not represent the entire population.

### Sinus tachycardia: a multidisciplinary expert focused review [^114KeoD1]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia (ST) is ubiquitous, but its presence outside of normal physiological triggers in otherwise healthy individuals remains a commonly encountered phenomenon in medical practice. In many cases, ST can be readily explained by a medical condition that precipitates an increase in the sinus rate, but ST at rest without physiological triggers may also represent a spectrum of normal. In other cases, ST may not have an easily explainable cause but may represent serious underlying pathology and can be associated with intolerable symptoms.

- **Classification of ST**: ST can be classified as secondary to a specific, usually treatable, medical condition (e.g. pulmonary embolism, anemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism) or be related to several incompletely defined conditions (e.g. inappropriate ST, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder, or post-COVID syndrome).

- **Evaluation of patients**: While cardiologists and cardiac electrophysiologists often evaluate patients with symptoms associated with persistent or paroxysmal ST, an optimal approach remains uncertain. Due to the many possible conditions associated with ST, and an overlap in medical specialists who see these patients, the inclusion of experts in different fields is essential for a more comprehensive understanding.

This article is unique in that it was composed by international experts in neurology, psychology, autonomic medicine, allergy and immunology, exercise physiology, pulmonology, and critical care medicine.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113kJ4ki]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary endpoint was overall mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 4060 patients (mean [± SD] age, 69.7 ± 9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P = 0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.

- **Conclusions**: Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy.

Circulation (2016). High credibility.

The disease, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, can be associated with a variety of symptoms, including decreased QRS duration, chest pain, lightheadedness, fatigue, and pounding sensations in the chest, neck, or ears. Patients may also experience dyspnea, syncope, palpitations, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Additionally, increased QRS duration, PR depression, diffuse ST elevation, and pre-syncope can also be observed in affected individuals.

### Tikosyn [^115ieQxL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Tikosyn is specifically indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm, which involves delaying the recurrence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFl) in patients who have experienced these conditions for more than one week and have subsequently been converted to normal sinus rhythm. Given the potential for Tikosyn to cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, its use should be reserved for patients who are highly symptomatic from atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

In general, antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter aims to prolong the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm. A recurrence of these conditions is expected in some patients [see Clinical Studies section].

For the conversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter, Tikosyn is indicated for converting atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. However, Tikosyn has not been demonstrated to be effective in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### Selection of drugs in pursuit of rate control strategy [^114hi9uo]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Based on multiple large randomized trials, rate control therapy has been shown to be safe and effective, gaining greater acceptance as a frontline alternative to drugs that maintain sinus rhythm. Adequate rate control can be achieved by atrioventricular nodal blocking agents in both acute and chronic settings. In refractory patients, other methods such as atrioventricular node ablation can be used to control the rate.

### Effect of reducing heart rate on outcomes in patients with reduced ejection fraction [^113s1BUa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Since 1953, sinus tachycardia has been defined as a heart rate (HR) in sinus rhythm of > 100 beats per minute (bpm). However, this number has never been formally evaluated, and no established threshold values exist for special groups, such as those with heart failure (HF) accompanied by a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Herein, we provided evidence that lowering the HR of patients with HFrEF to < 70 bpm with medications such as ivabradine improves outcomes.

Numerous large-scale trials and smaller clinical studies have shown that reducing the HR in patients with HFrEF improves cardiovascular and overall outcomes. Evidence suggests that a HR of < 70 bpm is appropriate for patients with HFrEF. Examination of HF registries indicates that in a large proportion of these patients, the HR exceeds 80 bpm, and no consideration is given to lowering the HR due in large part to lack of physician awareness of the benefits of a lower HR. Evidence indicates that the first-line medication for lowering HR in patients with HFrEF is ivabradine.

In conclusion, the improved prognosis following appropriate HR management in patients with HFrEF suggests that the cut-off value for sinus tachycardia in these patients should be redefined as 75 bpm. Maintaining a HR of < 70 bpm in patients with HFrEF is associated with improved cardiovascular and overall outcomes.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation [^115izmTN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation following a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.

- **Results**: After a mean (± SD) of 2.3 ± 0.6 years, 39 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary end point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end point was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The distribution of the various components of the primary end point was similar in the rate-control.

### Amiodarone versus other pharmacological interventions for prevention of sudden cardiac death [^115pVYF4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of cardiac death. There are two primary strategies to prevent it: managing cardiovascular risk factors and reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) constitute the standard therapy for both primary and secondary prevention; however, they are not widely available in settings with limited resources. The antiarrhythmic amiodarone has been proposed as an alternative to ICDs.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of amiodarone for primary or secondary prevention of SCD compared with placebo, no intervention, or any other antiarrhythmic drugs in participants at high risk (primary prevention) or who have recovered from cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, or VT/VF (secondary prevention).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), and LILACS on 26 March 2015. We reviewed reference lists of included studies and selected reviews on the topic, contacted authors of included studies, screened relevant meetings, and searched in registers for ongoing trials. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the efficacy of amiodarone versus placebo, no intervention, or other antiarrhythmics in adults. For primary prevention, we considered participants at high risk for SCD. For secondary prevention, we considered participants who had recovered from cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular…

### SPL drug information for amiodarone hydrochloride [^1153wCQy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):

- **Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders**: Use caution, as amiodarone can cause thyroid abnormalities, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.
- **Bradycardia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can cause symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest, especially in the presence of electrolytic disorders or concomitant use of antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes.
- **Conduction disorders**: Use caution in patients undergoing surgery, as amiodarone may increase sensitivity to the myocardial depressant and conduction effects of halogenated inhalational anesthetics.
- **Infusion site phlebitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of infusion site phlebitis.
- **Interference with implanted cardiac devices**: Use caution in patients with implanted defibrillators or pacemakers, as chronic use of antiarrhythmic drugs may affect pacing and defibrillation thresholds.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy.
- **Persistence of adverse effects**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks after discontinuation due to the long half-life of amiodarone.
- **Photosensitivity of skin, skin discoloration**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can induce photosensitization and cause blue-gray discoloration of the skin with long-term use.

### Amiodarone and thyroid physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1113fAZY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Although amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic agent, its use is limited by a wide variety of potential toxicities. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive "bench to bedside" overview of the ways amiodarone influences thyroid function. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other clinically relevant studies. The search was limited to English-language reports published between 1950 and 2017. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, hypothyroidism, myxedema, hyperthyroidism, thyroid storm, atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, and electrical storm. Google and Google Scholar, as well as bibliographies of identified articles, were reviewed for additional references. We included 163 germane references in this review. Because amiodarone is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs in the United States, the mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic information provided is relevant for practicing clinicians in a wide range of medical specialties.

### Randomized comparison of intravenous procainamide vs. intravenous amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS tachycardia: the PROCAMIO study [^112ZBMMw]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**

- **Study design and randomization**: Patients were randomly assigned in an open-label fashion to receive either intravenous procainamide (single dose 10 mg/kg over 20 minutes) or intravenous amiodarone (single dose 5 mg/kg over 20 minutes) with a 1:1 ratio. The study period was 40 minutes from infusion initiation (20 minutes for drug administration and 20 minutes following administration). There was an observation period of 24 hours after the end of the study period.

	- The randomization procedure was as follows: since a rapid decision had to be made as to the drug assigned, groups of 10 numbered and closed envelopes were deposited at each center (and were replaced as necessary) so, whenever a candidate appeared, the investigator could open the next envelope containing the assigned therapy. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Both Cardiology and Emergency Departments participated at different centers in order to include a representative patient population. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at each center, and informed consent of the subjects was obtained before enrollment. The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00383799).

### Betapace AF [^116GFKwZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Betapace/Betapace AF is contraindicated in patients with:

- **Sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, and heart block**: Second and third-degree AV block, unless a functioning pacemaker is present.
- **Congenital or acquired long QT syndromes**.
- **Cardiogenic shock or decompensated heart failure**.
- **Electrolyte imbalance**: Serum potassium.

For the treatment of atrial fibrillation/flutter (AFIB/AFL) or ventricular arrhythmias, Betapace AF should not be used in contraindicated conditions such as sinus bradycardia, second or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, and electrolyte imbalance.

### Betapace AF [^116ndV9M]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Betapace/Betapace AF is an antiarrhythmic indicated for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFIB/AFL).

- **Indications and usage**:
	- Betapace/Betapace AF is indicated for the treatment of documented, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).
	- Betapace/Betapace AF is also indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of AFIB/AFL) in patients with highly symptomatic AFIB/AFL who are currently in sinus rhythm.

- **Limitations of use**:
	- Betapace/Betapace AF has not been shown to enhance survival in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
	- Avoid use in patients with minimally symptomatic or easily reversible AFIB/AFL. Since Betapace/Betapace AF can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it should be reserved for patients in whom AFIB/AFL is highly symptomatic. Patients with paroxysmal AFIB that is easily reversed, for example, by a Valsalva maneuver, should usually not receive Betapace/Betapace AF.

### Pacerone [^113fHQnJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

At the usual maintenance dose (400 mg/day) and above, amiodarone hydrochloride causes adverse reactions in about three-fourths of all patients, resulting in discontinuation in 7% to 18%.

In surveys of almost 5,000 patients treated in open U.S. studies and in published reports of treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride, the adverse reactions most frequently requiring discontinuation of amiodarone hydrochloride included pulmonary infiltrates or fibrosis, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and elevation of liver enzymes. Other symptoms causing discontinuations less often included visual disturbances, photosensitivity, blue skin discoloration, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism.

The following side-effect rates are based on a retrospective study of 241 patients treated for 2 to 1,515 days (mean 441.3 days):

- **Thyroid**: common reactions include hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

- **Cardiovascular**: common reactions include congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and SA node dysfunction.

- **Gastrointestinal**:
	- **Very common**: nausea and vomiting.
	- **Common**: constipation, anorexia, and abdominal pain.

- **Dermatologic**: common reactions include solar dermatitis/photosensitivity.

- **Neurologic**: common reactions include malaise and fatigue, tremor/abnormal involuntary movements, lack of coordination, abnormal gait/ataxia, dizziness, and paresthesias.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia-symptom and heart rate reduction with ivabradine: A pooled analysis of prospective studies [^117R5VHc]. Heart Rhythm (2018). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is debilitating despite available treatment. The off-label use of ivabradine for IST prompted this systematic analysis of existing data quality and sample size estimates for adequately powered studies.

- **Objective**: To determine the clinical efficacy of ivabradine in IST from pooled prospective studies.

- **Methods**: The analysis included ivabradine studies for IST participants without structural heart disease and with follow-up of ≥ 2 weeks. Heart rate and symptom reduction with ivabradine were estimated based on results of subjective change in symptoms assessed by various data instruments used in each study. Studies were assessed for quality using validated checklists. Sample sizes were calculated based on the magnitude of symptom reduction encountered after treatment with ivabradine.

- **Results**: Nine studies met the criteria, culminating in 145 patients pooled. Most patients were women (≥ 70%). The studies were small and not adequately powered, yet all reported a decrease in maximum or mean resting heart rate or both, with complete or considerable amelioration of symptoms with ivabradine. Most studies had moderate quality with excellent consistency of study quality and narrow limits of agreement between the quality checklists. Sample size estimates for adequately powered studies with various placebo effects and comparisons with β-blockade are reported.

- **Conclusions**: Ivabradine effectively reduces heart rate and symptoms in IST, but no study was adequately powered to account for the expected placebo effect on symptoms. A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is recommended to confirm these findings.

### Pacerone [^113JkPyZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low and might benefit from a dose increase or whose levels are unusually high and might require dosage reduction to minimize side effects.

Effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

### Amiodarone: Guidelines for use and monitoring [^111SLjpo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen.

When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who are also taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

### Therapy-resistant ventricular tachycardia caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: A case report of electrical storm [^115wY88R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Electrical storm is a challenging diagnosis for the clinician and requires detailed evaluation of the patient. Amiodarone is frequently used for the cessation of ventricular tachycardia attacks. Within the antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone, there are some harmful effects associated with the drug. Thyroid gland toxicity is one of the most important adverse effects of amiodarone and is called amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis may alter arrhythmia and lead to frequent ventricular tachycardia attacks. Herein, we report a case of electrical storm caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: What should we do [^116yVuPg]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

**Rate vs. rhythm control of atrial fibrillation**: Although subgroup data suggest that sinus rhythm is associated with improved outcomes in patients with AF, including all-cause survival, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the superiority of either a rate or rhythm-control strategy. For example, in the AF-CHF trial, there was no difference in cardiovascular death when comparing a rate vs. rhythm-control strategy in patients with HFrEF and NYHA classes II–IV (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86–1.30, P = 0.59), with similar findings for all-cause mortality and worsening heart failure. There are several reasons that rhythm control has failed to improve survival in clinical trials. These include the limited efficacy and adverse effects of available treatments, or delayed intervention such that the cumulative effects of AF are already unable to be reversed. Sinus rhythm can be difficult to achieve and maintain, particularly in patients with heart failure. In the rhythm control arm of AF-CHF, 21% crossed over to rate control, 82% were taking amiodarone, 27% were in AF at 4-year follow-up, and 58% had at least one episode of AF during the trial. On the other hand, in studies of catheter ablation of AF, restoration of sinus rhythm is associated with significant improvement in left ventricular function (11% increase in LVEF on average). While there are no clear differences in cardiovascular outcomes, patients with AF and heart failure who spend a higher proportion of time in sinus rhythm suffer less severe functional impairment (NYHA class III symptoms in 27% vs. 35%, P < 0.0001). Based on these and other data, guidelines reserve rhythm-control therapy for…

### Amiodarone after surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation: Is it really necessary? A prospective randomized controlled trial [^11142CQA]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to address the controversy surrounding prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment after surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), as opposed to catheter ablation where it is well-established. This prospective randomized controlled trial examined whether administering amiodarone after surgical ablation could reduce atrial arrhythmia recurrence within the first three months post-surgery.

Ninety patients were randomized into two groups: those receiving amiodarone (n = 45) and those not receiving it (n = 45). Rhythm status was monitored through clinical follow-up and 72-hour continuous monitoring at six and twelve weeks, following the guidelines of the Heart Rhythm Society. The primary outcome was defined as atrial arrhythmia recurrence, requiring cardioversion, ablation, or crossover from no-amiodarone to amiodarone due to atrial arrhythmia during follow-up. An intention-to-treat approach was employed.

Results showed that the two groups were similar regarding traditional predictors of failure, such as left atrium size (5.0 vs. 5.1 cm, P = 0.734), median AF duration (23 vs. 20 months, P = 0.513), and long-standing persistent AF (44% vs. 33%, P = 0.280). The primary outcome occurred in 52% of the no-amiodarone group (23 of 44) and 19% of the amiodarone group (8 of 43; p = 0.001). Cumulative freedom from the primary outcome was significantly greater in the amiodarone group (81.4% vs. 47.7%, P < .001). Amiodarone was discontinued in 18 patients due to side effects, bradycardia, or noncompliance.

In conclusion, prophylactic amiodarone reduced early atrial arrhythmia recurrence. These results align with findings observed in catheter AF ablation studies.

### Oral class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^112mWQAb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATa) following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common problem. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been used shortly after ablation in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm, particularly Class I and III agents. However, it still needs to be established if the use of Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications, or both, reduce the risk of recurrence of ATa.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of oral Class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs versus control (standard medical therapy without Class I or III antiarrhythmics, or placebo) for maintaining sinus rhythm in people undergoing catheter ablation for AF.

- **Search methods**: We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and two clinical trial registers without restrictions on language or date to 5 August 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We sought published, unpublished, and ongoing parallel-design, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adult participants undergoing ablation for AF, with subsequent comparison of Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use versus control (standard medical therapy or non-Class I and/or III antiarrhythmic use).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and performed meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratios (Peto OR). Our primary outcomes were recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias; adverse events: thromboembolic events; adverse events: myocardial infarction; adverse events: new diagnosis of heart failure; and adverse events: requirement for one.

Another important finding in our study is that a quarter (27%) of patients in the amiodarone group had pre-LVAD atrial arrhythmias (AAs) only, with no documented ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Management of AAs, such as atrial fibrillation, in patients with heart failure (HF) is limited by antiarrhythmic medication options, often necessitating the use of amiodarone. Catheter ablation outcomes are an appealing alternative in these patients to avoid long-term amiodarone use. Over the past few years, multiple studies, including large randomized trials, have demonstrated a significant beneficial effect of rhythm control with catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs, especially in patients with HF.

In the CASTLE-AF (Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation) trial, patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% were randomized to catheter ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs for the management of atrial fibrillation. Patients randomized to catheter ablation had a 38% overall reduction in the primary outcome of death or HF hospitalization. In a subanalysis, this benefit did not meet statistical significance in patients on amiodarone. Similar results of improved overall outcomes with catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with HF have also been shown in the CABANA (Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation) trial. Given these data and our findings of worse long-term outcomes with amiodarone use, early catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with advanced HF being considered for an LVAD implant is recommended.

### New antiarrhythmic drugs for establishing sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: What are our therapies likely to be by 2010 and beyond [^114g5nAL]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is plagued by limitations in the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of currently available agents for the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. This review describes some of the most promising approaches to new therapies that may overcome some of these limitations. The agents reviewed are representative of these new approaches. They have completed their phase III trials and have submitted an application for approval for release by regulatory agencies or have almost completed their phase III trials and appear likely to submit for approval in the not too distant future.

### The 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society comprehensive guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^112RemVt]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning rate control and the use of amiodarone and dronedarone, the CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend initiating amiodarone for rate control only in highly selected patients. This includes those who are critically ill or have significant side effects from, or contraindications to, first-line agents. Initiation should occur after careful consideration of alternative agents and the risks and benefits of amiodarone therapy.

### Amiodarone for pediatric resuscitation: A word of caution [^114iNTY8]. Pediatric Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous administration of amiodarone has recently been recommended for use during pediatric resuscitation of pediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. We present two pediatric patients who received amiodarone for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, although they were ultimately determined to have congenital long QT syndrome. Amiodarone is contraindicated in this setting and may have exacerbated the ventricular arrhythmia.

### Esmolol for intractable ventricular arrhythmias in major amitriptyline toxicity [^112WRvdg]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Prevention of sinus tachycardia in experimental amitriptyline toxicity through sinus node destruction, beta-blockers, direct vagal stimulation, physostigmine, and specific bradycardia agents like zatebradine effectively prevents ventricular tachyarrhythmias and reduces QRS prolongation.

Beta-blockade infusion was selected for our patient to reduce the heart rate because we observed that QRS and QT prolongation increased with the rate. Arrhythmias and triggered automaticity occurred exclusively when the heart rate exceeded 110 and the QRS was prolonged. We hoped to prevent tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmias despite the risks of reduced cardiac contractility.

Any potential reduction in contractility or blood pressure could be offset by careful titration of esmolol to a safe rate, the restoration of a perfusing rhythm, and, in extreme cases, the use of a cardiac support device such as an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In this case, we minimized the dose of esmolol by titrating to a pulse range of less than 100 beats per minute but more than 80 beats per minute. The malignant rhythm reappeared when the pulse rate went over 110 beats per minute at several different times during her course. It was a successful intervention, as premature cessation of the esmolol infusion on two occasions led to tachycardia and recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, followed by fibrillation.

### Is rhythm control superior to rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure [^111WMXCK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

In 1,009 patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, the 2-year mortality rate was 31% in patients treated with rate control (n = 505) versus 29% in patients treated with rhythm control (n = 504). After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics and medications, no significant difference in mortality was found between the two groups.

### Immediate reinitiation of atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion predicts subsequent pharmacologic and electrical conversion to sinus rhythm and amiodarone [^115ARSFk]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Ninety-one percent of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) resisting electrical cardioversion because of immediate reinitiation of AF after the shock maintain long-term sinus rhythm with amiodarone and repeat cardioversion. Thus, immediate reinitiation of AF is an important sign that should guide further treatment in patients with electrical cardioversion-resistant AF.

### Clinical efficacy of ivabradine in patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover evaluation [^116X3u4t]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of ivabradine in the treatment of symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Due to its I(f) blocking properties, ivabradine can selectively attenuate the high discharge rate from sinus node cells, causing inappropriate sinus tachycardia.

Twenty-one patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 10) or ivabradine 5 mg twice daily (n = 11) for 6 weeks. After a washout period, patients crossed over for an additional 6 weeks. Each patient underwent symptom evaluation and heart rate assessment at the start and finish of each phase.

After taking ivabradine, patients reported elimination of more than 70% of symptoms (relative risk: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.34; p < 0.001), with 47% of them experiencing complete elimination. These effects were associated with a significant reduction of heart rate at rest (from 88 ± 11 beats/min to 76 ± 11 beats/min, p = 0.011), on standing (from 108 ± 12 beats/min to 92 ± 11 beats/min, p < 0.0001), during 24 hours (from 88 ± 5 beats/min to 77 ± 9 beats/min, p = 0.001), and during effort (from 176 ± 17 beats/min to 158 ± 16 beats/min, p = 0.001). Ivabradine administration was also associated with a significant increase in exercise performance. No cardiovascular side effects were observed in any patients while taking ivabradine.

In this cohort, ivabradine significantly improved symptoms associated with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and completely eliminated them in approximately half of the patients.

### Deciphering the sinus tachycardias [^116Rsxx4]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice. Primary sinus tachycardia, without an underlying secondary cause, despite often being associated with troublesome symptoms, is often neglected. This neglect leads to multiple consultations and frustration for both the practitioner and the patient. The fact that primary sinus tachycardias are a heterogeneous group of disorders is seldom appreciated. Consequently, a firm diagnosis is rarely reached, and management is haphazard. Furthermore, there may be prognostic implications for prolonged or recurrent sinus tachycardia, making it imperative that this group of arrhythmias receive adequate and appropriate attention.

Normal sinus tachycardia (i.e. secondary), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and sinus node reentry tachycardia constitute this group of arrhythmias. Their definitions, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and optimum management are discussed in this review.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^1176EDwQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Effect of amiodarone on conduction block and inducible arrhythmias with temperature

At 36°C, amiodarone did not prevent conduction block (36-Alone = 6/7, 36-Amio = 5/8). Similarly, the addition of amiodarone did not worsen arrhythmia susceptibility at 36°C (36-Alone = 3/5, 36-Amio = 3/8; one 36-Alone experiment did not undergo PES). At 32°C, CV slowing and worsening of DOR with the addition of amiodarone did not promote transmural conduction block (32-Alone = 0/7, 32-Amio = 0/8) and also did not affect arrhythmia susceptibility (32-Alone = 1/4, 32-Amio = 0/8; three 32-Alone experiments did not undergo PES).

Figure 6A shows an arrhythmia induced by PES at 36°C during ischemia with amiodarone. The top panel shows the ECG and action potentials from three sites. The bottom panel shows activation time (upper) and corresponding repolarization time (lower) maps for each beat during the initiation of VF. Extra endocardial beats were given with subsequent conduction block (site C, upper panel, red block symbol, and S3 activation map, red bar), and reentrant excitation occurs originating from site C (arrows and the first beat of VF). Block and reentry occur at the site of maximal RG on the previous beat (S2 repolarization time map, site C). VF initiation (upper panels and VF map) occurs by a reentrant mechanism.

Figure 6B shows significant conduction slowing with amiodarone at 32°C (isochrones crowding on all activation maps); however, no arrhythmia was induced. This is attributable to the amelioration of RG, preventing conduction block in the presence of TH, so CV slowing did not increase susceptibility to arrhythmias.

### Randomized comparison of intravenous procainamide vs. intravenous amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS tachycardia: The PROCAMIO study [^113ZjmEG]. European Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

The study PROCAMIO was published by Mercedes Ortiz and colleagues in 2017 in the European Heart Journal. This study is relevant to ventricular arrhythmias. The trial question in the PROCAMIO study was: What is the effect of intravenous procainamide versus amiodarone in patients with an acute episode of sustained monomorphic well-tolerated wide QRS tachycardia?

The study was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted with a population of 74 patients. The inclusion criteria included patients with regular wide QRS complex tachycardia requiring medical attention. Key exclusion criteria were treatment with either IV amiodarone or IV procainamide during the previous 24 hours, poor hemodynamic tolerance requiring urgent termination, and VT.

- **Interventions**: The interventions included n = 33 procainamide (IV infusion of a single dose of 10 mg/kg over 20 minutes) and n = 29 amiodarone (IV infusion of a single dose of 5 mg/kg over 20 minutes).

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was a significant decrease in major cardiac adverse events (9% vs. 41%; OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.6).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in tachycardia termination (67% vs. 38%; OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 9.3).
	- Borderline significant decrease in total adverse events (24% vs. 48%; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 1).
	- No significant difference in adverse events (18% vs. 31%; OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.61).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference was observed in total adverse effects in patients with structural heart disease.

### Single beta-blocker or combined amiodarone therapy in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator patients: Insights from the German DEVICE registry [^1123JF2J]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Amiodarone is often used for antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator systems due to its antiarrhythmic potency and the lack of alternatives. However, at the time of writing, robust data on the safety and clinical benefit of amiodarone therapy in these patients are missing.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to assess the periprocedural and postprocedural outcomes of combined therapy with beta-blockers plus amiodarone, compared to treatment with single beta-blockers in the "real-life" cohort of ICD recipients of the German DEVICE registry.

- **Methods**: A total of 4499 patients who underwent ICD implantation, revision, or upgrade in 49 centers participating in the German DEVICE registry were enrolled from March 2007 to February 2014.

- **Results**: Amiodarone had no significant effect on the success of defibrillation testing. Early implantation-associated complications were similar between the groups. However, 1-year overall mortality was significantly higher in the beta-blocker plus amiodarone cohort (adjusted hazard ratio 2.09; P < 0.001). Interestingly, among the surviving patients, amiodarone was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of ICD discharges or syncopal events. Furthermore, the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm or incessant VTs and the number of patients scheduled for intracardiac ablation did not differ among both groups. The rate of rehospitalization was lower in the cohort with only beta-blockers.

### Ataxia caused by amiodarone in older people [^112KuMCR]. Age and Ageing (2008). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is recommended for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with structural heart disease, coronary artery disease, or left ventricular dysfunction. It has well-recognized side effects on the skin, lungs, liver, thyroid, and eyes. Neurological side effects, including ataxia and neuropathy, also occur and may be more prevalent in older patients. These side effects are reversible after cessation of amiodarone. Monitoring of amiodarone therapy should include assessment of the central and peripheral nervous system, especially in older patients.

### A practical guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone: 2007 [^113L8aRS]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. The overuse and underuse of amiodarone are common, while data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Due to adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to derive optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for the use of amiodarone, and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the members of the writing committee.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^115uMmho]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Our data, both ex vivo and in vivo, suggest that despite both promoting and ameliorating individual arrhythmia substrates, the overall effect of amiodarone is not proarrhythmic over the range of temperatures used in therapeutic temperature management (TTM).

- **Clinically and mechanistically**: The effects of amiodarone are divided into chronic use and acute intravenous (IV) administration. Acute administration generally produces more conduction delay and less postrepolarization refractoriness than chronic administration. During conduction, amiodarone affects sodium (I Na) and L‐type calcium channels, causing conduction slowing. During repolarization, amiodarone has mixed effects on potassium currents, including rapid (I Kr), slow (I Ks), transient outward (I To), and ATP-sensitive currents (I K, ATP), which explains the minimal effect on the dispersion of repolarization (DOR) under normal conditions. Acute amiodarone administration also does not affect resting membrane potential.

### Conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter with ibutilide after amiodarone has failed [^111aWExj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether ibutilide can convert atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients where amiodarone has failed.

- **Design and setting**: This was a clinical study conducted in a university hospital intensive care unit (ICU).

- **Patients**: Twenty-six patients were studied who experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter persisting for a maximum of 6 hours. Continuous monitoring of the arrhythmia was implemented. Medical conversion was necessary due to symptomatic or hemodynamic causes.

- **Interventions**: Initially, all patients received amiodarone (150 mg i.v.). If arrhythmia persisted after 2 hours, ibutilide (1 mg) was administered, or 2 mg for patients with a body weight over 70 kg if the treatment was unsuccessful. Prior to ibutilide administration, 1 g magnesium was given, and high normal serum levels of potassium were maintained (4.5–5.0 mmol/l).

Results showed that after administering amiodarone, atrial flutter persisted in 73% and atrial fibrillation in 27% of patients. Following ibutilide administration, the QT interval increased from 327 ± 61 to 387 ± 62 ms, while the QTc interval increased from 456 ± 32 to 461 ± 66 ms. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm was achieved in 22 of 27 cases. Nonsustained torsade de pointes tachycardia was observed in three patients (11%), but no patient exhibited sustained ventricular tachycardia. Patients with proarrhythmic effects were characterized by decreased left ventricular function.

In conclusion, ibutilide led to the conversion to sinus rhythm in 81.5% of ICU patients where amiodarone was unsuccessful. Nonsustained tachycardias were observed in 11%, with no cases of sustained ventricular tachycardia.

### Rapid loading of sotalol or amiodarone for management of recent onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a randomized, digoxin-controlled trial [^1178XVrt]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Amiodarone and sotalol are commonly used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, but the efficacy of these agents administered as high-dose infusions for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation is unknown. The use of these agents in this context would facilitate drug initiation in patients for whom ongoing prophylactic therapy is indicated.

- **Methods**: We assessed the efficacy and safety of rapid high-dose intravenous infusions of amiodarone and sotalol for heart rate control and rapid reversion to sinus rhythm in patients who presented to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Patients (n = 140) were randomized to receive 1.5 mg/kg of sotalol infused over 10 minutes, 10 mg/kg of amiodarone over 30 minutes, or 500 micrograms of digoxin over 20 minutes. Electrical cardioversion was attempted for patients not converting to sinus rhythm within 12 hours.

- **Results**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone resulted in more rapid rate control than digoxin. Each of the three trial strategies resulted in similar rates of pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm (amiodarone, 51%; sotalol, 44%; digoxin, 50%; P = not significant). The overall rates of cardioversion after trial drug infusion and defibrillation were high for all groups (amiodarone, 94%; sotalol, 95%; digoxin, 98%; P = not significant). However, there was a trend toward a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions in the amiodarone group.

- **Conclusion**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone in patients with symptomatic recent-onset atrial fibrillation results in rapid control of ventricular rate.
