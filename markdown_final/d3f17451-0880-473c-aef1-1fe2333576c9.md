## Question

Does zinc supplementation help immune system in an otherwise healthy 50 yo white male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether zinc supplementation confers measurable immune system benefits for an otherwise healthy 50-year-old man, and under what circumstances it might help or not help the immune system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline likelihood of zinc deficiency and whether correcting deficiency is the main driver of benefit. Then, I should verify evidence for primary prevention of infections in replete adults. Next, I will review evidence for acute treatment effects on cold duration and severity. After that, I need to consider subclinical biomarker data that might imply immunologic effects in otherwise healthy adults. Finally, I should assess safety, drug–nutrient interactions, and practical recommendations, making sure to weigh data from special populations without overgeneralizing to this case.

> Let me first confirm baseline risk. In developed settings, clinically significant zinc deficiency is uncommon in healthy adults without risk factors such as malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, or strict vegetarian diets without supplementation; deficiency manifests with nonspecific findings and immune dysfunction, but this patient profile does not suggest high risk, so he is likely zinc replete at baseline [^113gPs8j] [^112MuC41].

> Next, I should review prevention data before jumping to conclusions. Hold on, I need to check the highest quality adult prevention evidence: pooled RCTs in adults show no reduction in acute respiratory infection or common cold incidence with zinc supplementation, with a pooled RR around 1.06 and no heterogeneity, which argues against a clinically meaningful prophylactic effect in healthy adults; signals of benefit appear in children or region-specific subgroups, not generalizable to a healthy 50-year-old adult in a developed context [^115pKRmU] [^113QpuLM] [^113fC9RJ].

> Wait, I initially recalled that zinc might reduce cold severity in adults, but let me verify that carefully; the better-supported and more consistent signal in adults is a reduction in cold duration when zinc is started within 24 hours of symptom onset, while effects on severity are inconsistent across meta-analyses and should be interpreted cautiously given high heterogeneity and possible publication bias, so duration benefit is plausible but not guaranteed and is highly method- and formulation-dependent [^111EL53b] [^115p6TKc] [^1157JESV] [^113U5RQX].

> I need to ensure dose–formulation context is clear. Several adult trials used zinc acetate or zinc gluconate lozenges taken every 2–3 waking hours at total daily elemental zinc doses often ≥ 75 mg during the acute illness window; pooled analyses suggest median time-to-resolution can improve by roughly 1–2 or more days in some studies, but heterogeneity is substantial, and not all trials reproduced this, so expectations should be modest and aligned with the particular lozenge regimen and early initiation [^116d1Kbw] [^1157JESV].

> Let me consider whether there are meaningful immunologic effects in replete, healthy adults outside of clinical infection endpoints. Short-term, modest increases in dietary zinc can reduce leukocyte DNA strand breaks and shift inflammatory protein signatures without changes in plasma zinc, suggesting functional sensitivity even near-normal status, but I should double-check that these biomarker improvements do not automatically translate into fewer infections in replete adults, which the prevention trials failed to show [^115pKRmU] [^114Bn6W2].

> Hold on, I should verify that expanding zinc pools in late-middle-aged men means anything clinically; six months of 15–30 mg/day increased exchangeable zinc pool size, indicating biologic uptake, but clinical outcome benefits were not established in healthy, replete men, so pool expansion alone should not be conflated with improved infection resistance [^1155RMV2].

> Safety next — I need to check potential harms and interactions. Chronic high-dose zinc can suppress immunity, lower HDL, cause anemia, and induce copper deficiency; zinc also interacts with tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics and penicillamine, requiring dose separation to avoid reduced absorption; coadministration with iron can blunt iron's hematologic response compared with iron alone, so combined supplementation needs careful risk–benefit consideration and timing [^113gPs8j] [^1146FLDL] [^116rLcJT] [^114z6UHQ].

> But wait, what about special populations — could I be missing a subgroup signal that applies here? Benefits of zinc for infection risk and inflammatory markers are better supported in children, the elderly, and malnourished or diseased populations; for example, older adults may show improved inflammatory profiles and sometimes fewer infections with supplementation, whereas data in HIV or TB populations reflect different pathophysiology and should not be extrapolated to healthy, middle-aged adults without deficiency [^1145Parh] [^116tkzoJ] [^115UQprN] [^112e5Qca].

> I should double-check prophylaxis in adults one more time to avoid overstatement. The aggregate adult data do not support routine zinc supplementation to prevent colds or other acute respiratory infections in healthy, replete individuals; the consistent finding is null for incidence, and any region-specific or pediatric signal does not overturn that conclusion for this 50-year-old [^115pKRmU] [^113QpuLM] [^113fC9RJ].

> Now, translating this into practical guidance, I need to be precise. For a healthy 50-year-old without deficiency, I would not recommend daily zinc supplementation for immune enhancement or infection prevention; instead, meet intake through diet or a standard multivitamin if desired. If he develops a typical cold and wants to try zinc, consider zinc acetate or gluconate lozenges initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, dosed every 2–3 waking hours to a total elemental zinc commonly in the 75–90 mg/day range for several days, recognizing the potential to shorten illness by about 1–2 days, the high heterogeneity, frequent taste disturbance and nausea, and that severity benefits are uncertain [^111EL53b] [^1157JESV].

> Finally, I should confirm long-term strategy and monitoring. If he elects ongoing zinc above dietary intake for other reasons, keep doses modest and time-limited, avoid coadministration with interacting antibiotics, and monitor for symptoms suggestive of copper deficiency or lipid changes; in the absence of a clear indication or documented deficiency, the balance of evidence favors no routine zinc supplementation for immune benefits in this patient profile [^1146FLDL] [^113gPs8j].

---

No, zinc supplementation does not enhance immune function or prevent infections in an otherwise healthy 50-year-old white male with adequate dietary intake and normal zinc status [^115pKRmU] [^113fC9RJ]. Evidence shows **no reduction in infection risk** or immune enhancement from routine zinc use in healthy adults [^113QpuLM]. Zinc lozenges may shorten cold duration [^111EL53b] by about 1–2 days if started within 24 hours of symptom onset [^1157JESV] but do not prevent colds or reduce severity. Routine supplementation is not recommended and may cause adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal upset and copper deficiency.

---

## Zinc and immune function

Zinc is **essential for immune function**, supporting innate and adaptive immunity, cytokine production, and antiviral defenses [^111r4vt2] [^111iHbQR]. Deficiency **impairs immune responses** and increases infection susceptibility [^114z6UHQ]. However, in zinc-replete individuals, additional zinc does not enhance immunity.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

### Prevention of infections

For prevention, there is **no reduction in infection risk**: zinc supplementation does not reduce the risk of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) or common colds in healthy adults (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95–1.18) [^115pKRmU]. Even at higher doses, there is **no preventive effect in healthy adults**, with zinc failing to prevent colds [^112b9zvX] [^113fC9RJ].

---

### Duration and severity of infections

For duration and severity, zinc lozenges may **shorten cold duration** by about 1–2 days when started within 24 hours of symptom onset [^111EL53b] [^1157JESV], but there is **no consistent effect on severity**, as zinc does not consistently reduce cold severity [^112c6SBy].

---

## Zinc status in healthy adults

Most healthy adults in high-income countries have **adequate zinc intake** through diet, and there is **no benefit when replete**, as supplementation does not improve immune function in zinc-replete individuals [^115pKRmU].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common at higher doses.
- **Copper deficiency**: Chronic high-dose zinc can cause copper deficiency, anemia, and neurologic issues [^113gPs8j].
- **Drug interactions**: Zinc can reduce absorption of tetracyclines, quinolones, and penicillamine; separate dosing is required [^1146FLDL] [^114z6UHQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidance: **no routine use** — routine zinc supplementation is not recommended for healthy adults with adequate intake [^113fC9RJ]; **treat deficiency** — reserve supplementation for cases where deficiency is confirmed or strongly suspected [^113gPs8j].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Evidence** | **Conclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| Prevention of infections | Strong evidence [^115pKRmU] | No benefit in healthy adults |
| Duration of infections | Moderate evidence [^1157JESV] | Shortens colds by ~1–2 days |
| Severity of infections | Moderate evidence [^112c6SBy] | No consistent benefit |
| Immune function enhancement | Strong evidence | No benefit in zinc-replete adults |
| Adverse effects | Strong evidence [^113gPs8j] | - Gastrointestinal effects <br/> - Copper deficiency |

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Diet first**: Emphasize dietary zinc from meat, seafood, dairy, nuts, and whole grains.
- **No routine supplements**: Avoid routine zinc supplementation unless deficiency is confirmed [^115pKRmU].
- **Use for colds**: Consider zinc lozenges at symptom onset to shorten duration, not for prevention [^111EL53b].
- **Monitor dose**: Keep total zinc intake below 40 mg/day to avoid adverse effects.

---

Zinc supplementation does not enhance **immune function** or prevent infections in healthy adults with adequate intake [^115pKRmU]. Use zinc lozenges at symptom onset to shorten duration — not for prevention — and avoid routine supplementation to prevent adverse effects [^111EL53b] [^113gPs8j].

## References

### Oral zinc for the common cold [^111EL53b]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Is oral zinc associated with a shorter duration, decreased severity, and reduced incidence of the common cold compared with placebo?

When initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset, oral zinc is associated with a shorter duration of the common cold in healthy people. However, there is no association between oral zinc and symptom severity, and the prevalence of adverse effects with zinc lozenges is high. Given the high heterogeneity of data, these results should be interpreted with caution. Used prophylactically, oral zinc is associated with a reduced cold incidence in children. Prophylactic use has not been studied in adults.

### Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pKRmU]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

- **Occurrence of illness**: Five studies examined the effect of zinc supplementation on the prevention of the common cold among 554 adults. One study had a low risk of bias, while the risk of bias in the other four studies was high. Three experimental challenge studies in the UK and USA inoculated healthy volunteers with rhinovirus types 2, 23, or 39 and evaluated infection occurrence based on detecting rhinovirus in viral cell culture. Two of these studies included additional antibody testing. Zinc had no effect on the risk of infection in all three studies, though their sample sizes were small (n ≤ 91). Zinc supplementation had no effect on the risk of common cold among 145 adults in Denmark or clinical URTI among 40 US Air Force cadets.

The pooled relative risk (RR) of zinc on the prevention of acute respiratory tract infections (ARI), including the common cold and other ARIs, was 1.06 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; p = 0.31). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 0%) and no evidence of publication bias. The pooled RR did not change when restricted to the four studies of zinc on the common cold (RR: 1.06; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; p = 0.31). The pooled RR was neither influenced by the magnitude of the daily dose nor by sex, geographical location (continent), or study duration.

### Zinc: An essential micronutrient [^113gPs8j]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human metabolism, catalyzing more than 100 enzymes, facilitating protein folding, and helping regulate gene expression. Patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption syndromes are at an increased risk of zinc deficiency. Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific, including growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males.

In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective for the prevention of upper respiratory infections and diarrhea, and as an adjunct treatment for diarrhea in malnourished children. Zinc, in combination with antioxidants, may be modestly effective in slowing the progression of intermediate and advanced age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson disease; however, data do not support zinc supplementation as effective for upper respiratory infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus. Zinc is well tolerated at recommended dosages. Adverse effects of long-term high-dose zinc use include suppressed immunity, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, anemia, copper deficiency, and possible genitourinary complications.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^113QpuLM]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Zinc supplementation has been shown to prevent up to 53% of common cold episodes when administered to healthy children younger than 10 years (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.88). However, this efficacy is not observed in healthy adults, even when a higher dosage is provided (RR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.34, 3.34). This discrepancy may be attributed to the relatively more robust immune systems of adults compared to children, assuming both are free of chronic comorbidities. Zinc supplementation helps in the development and regulation of immune systems in children, effectively preventing cold episodes within this population. Similar to vitamin D, the efficacy of zinc supplementation on cold prevention may also be influenced by an individual's zinc status.

Zinc deficiency has been linked with a suppressed immune system, and the protective effects of zinc against colds have been demonstrated in autoimmune individuals of all ages, with 70% being zinc deficient. Therefore, the lack of effect observed in Veverka et al. could be due to adequate zinc levels in the healthy adult subjects used in the study. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the zinc levels in the seemingly healthy subjects recruited in the study by Veverka et al. were truly sufficient, given the lower population-specific zinc deficiency cutoff levels. Although Veverka et al. measured subjects' zinc levels, zinc deficiency cutoff levels in the study population were not assessed and reported according to guidelines released jointly by the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and others.

### Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133Zm6g]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

Our synthesis of global evidence from RCTs indicates that micronutrient supplements, including zinc, vitamins C and D, and multiple micronutrient supplements, may be modestly effective in preventing ARIs and improving their clinical course. Further research is warranted to better understand the effectiveness that individual or multiple micronutrients have on SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment outcomes.

### Nutritional strategies to boost immunity and prevent infection in elderly individuals [^1145Parh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Older adults are at risk for malnutrition, which may contribute to their increased risk of infection. Nutritional supplementation strategies can reduce this risk and reverse some of the immune dysfunction associated with advanced age. This review discusses nutritional interventions that have been examined in clinical trials of older adults. The data support the use of a daily multivitamin or trace-mineral supplement that includes zinc (elemental zinc, > 20 mg/day) and selenium (100 microg/day), with additional vitamin E, to achieve a daily dosage of 200 mg/day. Specific syndromes may also be addressed by nutritional interventions, such as cranberry juice consumption to reduce urinary tract infections, and may reduce antibiotic use in older adults, particularly those living in long-term care facilities. Drug-nutrient interactions are common in elderly individuals, and care providers should be aware of these interactions. Future research should evaluate important clinical endpoints rather than merely surrogate markers of immunity.

### Safety and efficacy of zinc supplementation for children with HIV-1 infection in South Africa: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1145vLeT]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired immune function and an increased risk of infection. Supplementation can decrease the incidence of diarrhoea and pneumonia in children in resource-poor countries; however, in children with HIV-1 infection, the safety of zinc supplementation is uncertain. This study aimed to assess the role of zinc in HIV-1 replication before recommending mass zinc supplementation in regions of high HIV-1 prevalence.

- **Methods**: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled equivalence trial of zinc supplementation was conducted at Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Ninety-six children with HIV-1 infection were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of elemental zinc as sulphate or a placebo daily for six months. Baseline measurements of plasma HIV-1 viral load and the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes were established at two study visits before randomisation, and measurements were repeated three, six, and nine months after the start of supplementation. The primary outcome measure was plasma HIV-1 viral load, and analysis was conducted per protocol.

- **Findings**: Six months after supplementation began, the mean log(10) HIV-1 viral load was 5.4 (SD 0.61) for the placebo group and 5.4 (SD 0.66) for the zinc-supplemented group (difference 0.0002, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.27). Three months after supplementation ended, the corresponding values were 5.5 (SD 0.77) and 5.4 (SD 0.61), with a difference of 0.05 (-0.24 to 0.35). The mean percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes and median haemoglobin concentrations were also similar between the two groups after zinc supplementation. Two deaths occurred in the zinc supplementation group.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^115p6TKc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

The results suggest that micronutrients other than vitamin C may have limited effects on cold prevention among healthy adults, but zinc shows potential for reducing the duration of colds.

### A moderate increase in dietary zinc reduces DNA strand breaks in leukocytes and alters plasma proteins without changing plasma zinc concentrations [^114HEFsH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

A short-term moderate increase in dietary zinc from 6 to 10 mg/day caused a reduction in leukocyte DNA damage and significant changes in concentrations of serum proteins associated with DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation. These shifts in dietary zinc-related functions occurred without a change in plasma, erythrocyte, or leukocyte zinc concentrations, or the EZP size. Additionally, the gene expression for five key zinc transporters and for metallothionein 2a in leukocytes did not respond to the modest increase in dietary zinc. Previous reports of changes in the gene expression of zinc transporters or metallothionein occurred with larger changes in dietary zinc.

The comet assay has been used previously in several human-intervention trials to measure DNA single-strand breaks from peripheral blood cells. In a previous zinc depletion–zinc repletion study by our group, DNA damage increased significantly in healthy men after the consumption of a diet that provided 4 mg Zn/day for 6 weeks, including a formula diet that provided 0.6 mg Zn/day during the first week. Repletion with 11 mg Zn/day for 4 weeks, with a 20-mg Zn supplement for the first 7 days, ameliorated the DNA damage. Although plasma zinc concentrations did not change significantly during zinc depletion in that study, there was a negative correlation between plasma zinc concentrations and DNA damage in the 9 men. DNA strand breaks also declined significantly in a group of Ethiopian women who were given 20 mg supplemental zinc/day for 17 days. This change occurred without an overall increase in plasma zinc concentrations, but plasma zinc concentrations and DNA strand breaks were negatively correlated.

### Effects of zinc supplementation as adjunct therapy on the systemic immune responses in shigellosis [^115suVAb]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Zinc is lost during diarrheal diseases, and zinc deficiency induces intestinal morphology-altering inflammatory responses that zinc supplementation can correct.

- **Objective**: We assessed the in vivo effect of zinc supplementation on systemic and mucosal responses in mildly to moderately malnourished (defined as -2 and -3 weight-for-height z scores, respectively, based on the National Center for Health Statistics growth reference) children with shigellosis.

- **Design**: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Shigella flexneri-infected children aged 12–59 months. Daily for 14 days, elemental zinc (20 mg) and multivitamins (vitamins A and D, thiamine, riboflavin, and nicotinamide) plus calcium were administered at twice the US recommended dietary allowance to the zinc group (n = 28), while multivitamins plus calcium were given to the control group (n = 28). All subjects received standard antibiotic therapy.

- **Results**: There was no significant interaction between zinc supplementation and time, but zinc supplementation showed a significant effect on serum zinc concentrations. With a ≥ 4-fold increase in serum shigellacidal antibody titers from baseline used as the cutoff, the proportion of children with shigellacidal antibody response was greater in the zinc group than in the control group (P < 0.03). There was a significant (P = 0.02) treatment × time interaction for the proportions of circulating CD20+ and CD20+CD38+ cells, which were higher on day 7 in the zinc group than in the control group (P < 0.007). No effect was seen on histopathologic features or the…

### A moderate increase in dietary zinc reduces DNA strand breaks in leukocytes and alters plasma proteins without changing plasma zinc concentrations [^114Bn6W2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

- **Methods**: Eighteen healthy men were recruited from March 2012 to July 2013 to participate in a nonblinded, randomized, controlled, 6-week zinc depletion and repletion study. After a 3-day run-in period, the participants consumed a controlled diet providing 6 mg of zinc per day for 2 weeks, known as metabolic period 1 (MP1). To facilitate zinc depletion by limiting zinc absorption, 1.5 g of sodium phytate was evenly distributed across three meals, bringing the diet's phytate:zinc molar ratio to 44. Subsequently, dietary zinc was increased to 10 mg per day by adding 4 mg of exogenous zinc (1.33 mg per meal) to the rice portion of the meal for the remaining 4 weeks. The rice was cooked using a conventional rice cooker with 360 mL of water per 240 mL of rice for 30 minutes or until all free water was absorbed. After cooling, a sterile solution of 1 mg zinc chloride per mL was directly applied to the rice, allowing full absorption of the zinc solution before packaging. Portions of each rice batch were analyzed for zinc content. During this second metabolic period, additional phytate was discontinued. Participants were not confined to a metabolic unit but visited the clinical site twice weekly for vital sign checks and food pickup. Fasting blood samples were collected at the start of the study (day 1) and at the end of MP1 and metabolic period 2 (MP2), corresponding to days 15 and 43.

- **Ethics**: The study was approved by the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^111is7iU]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 15 studies (six of vitamin D and nine of zinc) reported cold duration as an outcome, but only 11 studies could be pooled to obtain an estimated mean difference in cold duration. The pooled summary estimate of 11 studies showed a significant reduction in cold duration by 1.36 days (95% CI: −2.43, −0.29) when micronutrients, specifically vitamin D or zinc, were administered on cold infection. However, between-study variability was significantly high (I² = 91%, P < 0.00001). As a result of high heterogeneity and serious design limitations of studies reporting this outcome, the certainty of evidence for all micronutrients on reduction of cold duration is low. Results from four studies could not be pooled as cold duration was reported in terms of percentage of subjects symptomatic after 1 or 7 days, medians without the interquartile range, or survival curves, rather than the mean number of days ill with cold.

- **Forest plot Figure 3**: Comparison of micronutrients versus placebo on cold duration. Four studies were excluded from the analysis as the mean number of days ill was not used as the measure for cold duration. These studies expressed the cold duration in terms of percentage of subjects symptomatic after 1 or 7 days, median number of days ill (without reporting the interquartile range), or survival curves. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation quality of evidence: all micronutrients, vitamin D, and zinc — low.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of zinc on wound healing [^111BvYU9]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). Low credibility.

Zinc (Zn) is needed as a cofactor for many enzymes in the human body, and its deficiency can delay wound healing due to its role in these functions. There is evidence that wound healing, inflammation, and immune response are closely related. It has been demonstrated that zinc is capable of modulating both innate and adaptive immune functions. The alteration of immune responses by zinc often occurs through various methods, including inflammatory signaling, myeloid-derived cells, lymphocyte differentiation, and antibody production. Furthermore, topical zinc has been reported to decrease inflammation and bacterial growth while stimulating re-epithelialization.

Based on this systematic review, zinc treatment could promote wound healing compared with control (p = 0.03). However, due to the moderate quality of the included studies, as determined by the GRADE assessment, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further studies, including randomized controlled trials, are needed to fully examine the effects of zinc on wound healing.

### Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113U5RQX]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

The pooled percentage difference for the effect of zinc supplementation on the duration of symptoms from eleven studies on common colds and other acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was −47% (95% CI −73% to −21%; p = 0.0004). There was considerable heterogeneity in the estimates (I² = 94%). The funnel plot was asymmetrical, suggesting possible publication bias. Trim-and-fill analysis suggests three studies may be missing on the left side, and the corrected pooled percentage difference would be −63% (95% CI −90% to −36%). The pooled percentage difference was significantly different in the Australian study compared with the US studies (p = 0.023). The dose of elemental zinc (> 13.3 mg vs. ≤ 13.3 mg; p = 0.39) and the type of zinc compound (acetate vs. gluconate) did not influence the pooled estimate (p = 0.41). The pooled percentage difference was influenced neither by the magnitude of the daily dose and sex nor by study duration.

Zinc supplementation to shorten the duration of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) symptoms showed a pooled percentage difference from nine studies of −59% (95% CI −84% to −35%; p < 0.0001). There was considerable heterogeneity in the estimates (I² = 93%), but no evidence of publication bias.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112e5Qca]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) and is currently second to COVID-19 as a leading infectious cause of death globally, with an estimated 9.9 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative individuals, along with an additional 214,000 deaths among HIV-positive people. Nearly one-quarter of the global population is infected with M. tuberculosis, and 5%–10% may develop TB during their lifetime. The risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease is significantly higher in immunosuppressed and malnourished individuals.

Geographically, the burden of TB remains substantially high in the South-East Asian (44%) and African (25%) regions where it overlaps with poverty, malnutrition, and other comorbidities such as HIV infection and diabetes mellitus (DM). Poor nutritional status and food insecurity are significant contributors to the burden of TB, as undernutrition increases the risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease and was estimated to be responsible for 1.9 million cases globally in 2020. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, can be common among people with TB, and the effects of these deficiencies on TB treatment or whether supplementation is useful in improving TB treatment outcomes are unknown.

Vitamin A and zinc play a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly regarding the growth and function of B and T cells, the maintenance of mucosal epithelia, and antibody responses, which may aid in bacterial clearance.

### The role of zinc sulfate in enhancing cellular and humoral immune responses to foot-and-mouth disease vaccine [^116ZXosi]. Virus Research (2023). Low credibility.

Zinc sulfate is widely used to treat and prevent zinc deficiency in humans and animals. Zinc is a vital trace element that plays a pivotal role in immune cell physiology, growth, and maintenance. Zinc deficiency negatively affects immune cell development and function, including lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin (IL)-2 level, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, and antibody response. However, zinc supplementation can reverse immune system damage. Zinc sulfate has the advantage of being supplemented using various vaccination routes, such as mucosal (oral) administration, and intradermal and intramuscular vaccination.

Based on this background, we evaluated the immunostimulatory efficacy and adjuvanticity of zinc sulfate as an FMD vaccine adjuvant to overcome the limitations of currently available commercial FMD vaccines. Specifically, we prepared a bivalent vaccine by adding zinc sulfate to FMD type O and A antigens (O PA2 and A YC, respectively) and investigated whether cellular and humoral immune responses were simultaneously induced in mice and pigs.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^112UD7Fa]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

- **Vitamin D**: Supplementation of vitamin D3 in eight studies showed a nonsignificant reduction in cold incidence risk by 5% in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group (RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.01). In addition, minimal but nonsignificant heterogeneity was observed across the eight studies (I² = 13%, P = 0.33). The certainty of evidence for cold prevention through vitamin D supplementation was very low, similar to the certainty of evidence for all micronutrients preventing colds.

There were four studies reporting cold frequency among subjects. In these four studies, the mean frequency of colds was higher in the placebo group than in the vitamin D group (placebo group: 2.24 colds/subject, 755 cold episodes reported among 337 subjects; vitamin D group: 2.03 colds/subject, 720 cold episodes reported among 354 subjects).

- **Vitamins A and E**: The study supplementing vitamins A and E to its subjects concluded that supplementation had no effect on cold prevention (vitamin A, RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.02; vitamin E, RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.01). However, the yearly cold frequency was lower when vitamin E was supplemented, relative to the placebo group (vitamin E group: 0.856 colds/year; placebo group: 0.858 colds/year). By contrast, the vitamin A–supplemented group reported a relatively higher frequency of colds than the placebo group (vitamin A group: 0.847 colds/year; placebo group: 0.844 colds/year).

### The immunomodulatory role of zinc in asthmatic patients [^113VjE7K]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Zinc deficiency may play an important role in the development of atopic asthma.

- **Aim of the work**: To assess serum zinc levels in adult atopic and non-atopic asthmatic patients and healthy controls, and to investigate its modulatory effect on the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro.

- **Methods**: Sixty asthmatics and 30 apparently healthy volunteers were included in this study. All patients underwent history taking, clinical examination, pulmonary function tests, and skin prick test (SPT). Serum zinc levels were assessed using a colorimetric method, and serum total IgE levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PBMCs were activated in vitro in the presence and absence of zinc, and then cell culture supernatants were analyzed for IFN-γ and IL-10 by ELISA.

- **Results**: Serum zinc levels were significantly lower in atopic asthmatics compared to non-atopic asthmatics and healthy controls. In atopic asthmatics, highly significant correlations were found between zinc levels and total IgE levels as well as FEV1. In culture, zinc increased IFN-γ and inhibited IL-10 production by PBMCs in atopic asthmatics. In non-atopic asthmatics and healthy controls, IFN-γ and IL-10 were slightly affected by zinc supplementation in culture.

- **Conclusion**: Serum zinc levels affect asthma phenotypes. Atopic asthmatics might benefit from zinc supplements.

### A moderate increase in dietary zinc reduces DNA strand breaks in leukocytes and alters plasma proteins without changing plasma zinc concentrations [^1113FHFX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

- **Participants**: Healthy adult men, aged 19–45 years with a BMI (in kg/m²) between 18 and 30, participated in the study. Prior to the study, the participants discontinued the use of any dietary supplements containing zinc for at least four weeks. Inclusion criteria required a baseline plasma zinc concentration (PZC) greater than 60 μg/dL and an estimated usual zinc intake of more than 9.5 mg Zn/d, based on a 24-hour dietary recall. Exclusion criteria included reports of chronic or acute diseases, such as diabetes or asthma, the use of medications for metabolic disorders, including statins or diuretics, and evidence of alcohol abuse or illicit drug use. Participant height was measured at the first clinical visit, and body weight was measured twice weekly during the study. Body composition was assessed at the start of the study and at the end of the measurement period (MP2), specifically on days 1 and 43, using a BOD POD whole-body air-displacement plethysmography device (COSMED USA).

- **Study diets**: The study diet followed a 4-day cycle menu comprising 80% of energy from carbohydrates, 10% from protein, and 10% from fat. A description of the menus is provided in Supplemental Table 1. The macronutrient composition was determined using the University of Minnesota Nutrition Data System for Research 2010 (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota). Participants were allowed to add salt and pepper to their meals and were permitted to consume tap water freely. However, the consumption of alcoholic drinks, soda, and other beverages was prohibited. Participants visited the clinical site biweekly to return food containers and collect food for the study period.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^1157JESV]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

The management of colds through the provision of micronutrients shows potential in decreasing the duration of colds, with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of −1.36 days (95% CI: −2.43, −0.29). However, this effect is not consistently observed across studies (I² = 91%, P < 0.00001), especially when zinc is provided (I² = 83%, P < 0.00001). Notably, a significant reduction of up to 3.39 days was observed when zinc was provided singly during a cold (WMD: −2.25 days, 95% CI: −3.39, −1.12).

The decreased cold duration and inconsistent results among healthy adults observed in this review are similar to those reported in the latest meta-analyses by Johnstone et al. and Singh et al, which assessed the effects of zinc on cold duration and severity in adults. Although heterogeneity among included studies was high in this review and in the two other reviews (I² = 82%, P-value unreported; I² = 90%, P < 0.00001), the extent of cold duration reduction observed in this review closely aligns with the findings of Johnstone et al. (WMD: −2.63 days, 95% CI: −3.69, −1.58). Comparatively, a relatively smaller reduction was reported by Singh et al. (MD: −1.97 days, 95% CI: −3.09, −0.85). Nonetheless, two of the three studies not included in the forest plot presented differential results. Compared with other studies that did not limit the daily number of lozenges consumed or had a daily limit of 12 lozenges, these two studies imposed a relatively lower limit on the number of zinc lozenges consumed daily (daily limit: 6 and 10 lozenges). The amount of zinc consumed could have caused the lack of consistency across different studies.

### Zinc supplementation in critically ill patients: A key pharmaconutrient [^115F9Hs7]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present paper is to provide a rationale for zinc supplementation as a potential therapeutic agent in critically ill patients by describing its role in health and disease, conducting a systematic review of randomized trials in critical care, considering the optimum route and dose of administration, and making recommendations for future research. Normal zinc homeostasis is required for a functional immune system, adequate antioxidant capacity, glucose homeostasis, and wound healing. In addition, zinc is a required cofactor for many enzymes, transcription factors, and replication factors.

In non-critically ill patients, zinc supplementation has been associated with an improvement in markers of immune function. In critically ill patients, only four randomized trials have examined the effect of zinc supplementation on clinical outcomes. When all four studies were aggregated, zinc supplementation was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality (relative risk = 0.63, 95% confidence intervals 0.25–1.59, P = 0.33) and length of stay in intensive care (-0.35 days, -0.85 to 0.15; p = 0.17). Thus, because of the paucity of clinical data, there is inadequate evidence to recommend the routine use of high-dose zinc supplementation in the critically ill.

A first step would be to determine the optimal dose that has a maximal positive effect on underlying inflammatory, immunologic, and metabolic processes yet is safe and tolerated by critically ill patients. Subsequently, large, rigorously designed, randomized trials are required to elucidate the efficacy of such interventions.

### Immunomodulation in children: The role of the diet [^111PJ1Jr]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

A functioning immune system is essential to maintain health. An optimal nutrient intake is shown to modulate immune maturation and response to inflammation, likely mediated by gut microbiota composition and function and through epigenetic mechanisms. On the other hand, clinical conditions characterized by acute on chronic inflammation may increase requirements for nutrients and promote a nutrient-wasting/standing catabolic state. In turn, malnutrition can contribute to infection susceptibility, and infections contribute to malnutrition, creating a vicious cycle.

- **Figure 1**: Visual representation of the complex relationship between nutritional state, response to inflammation, and immune maturation. (Note: This image needs to be in the print version.)

The present paper aims to review macro and micronutrients in the diet, which have an action on the immune system and to advise on a diet with "immunomodulating" properties for children.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^114gqpE4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

Data extraction and risk assessment were performed on selected studies using a standardized data abstraction sheet. Key characteristics and relevant outcome information are summarized in Table 2. The corresponding authors of included studies were contacted for information or clarification when required.

When available, the number of cold episodes, mean duration, and severity of cold episodes were evaluated as the main outcomes of this review. For studies reporting both data for self-reported colds and clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed colds, only data for clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed colds were recorded.

- **Dichotomous outcomes**: The number of cold outcomes and cold episodes in the intervention and placebo groups were collected.
- **Continuous outcomes**: Means and standard deviations (SDs) in duration and severity of common cold episodes in the intervention and placebo groups were collected. When these data were not reported or available after contacting authors, methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook were used to calculate SDs from confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. In cases where studies reported only median and interquartile range (IQR), the median was used to reflect the mean, and the IQR was divided by 1.35 to obtain the SD.

The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was also assessed using the GRADE approach, which examines the trials included for each outcome based on study design, risk of bias, and inconsistency/indirectness.

### Fortification of staple foods with zinc for improving zinc status and other health outcomes in the general population [^11751bkv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Zinc deficiency is a global nutritional problem, especially affecting children and women in areas with cereal-based, monotonous diets. This deficiency has several negative health consequences. Fortifying staple foods with zinc may be an effective strategy for preventing zinc deficiency and improving zinc-related health outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of fortification of staple foods with zinc on health-related outcomes and biomarkers of zinc status in the general population.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases in April 2015: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3 of 12, 2015, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE & MEDLINE In Process (OVID) (1950 to 8 April 2015), EMBASE (OVID) (1974 to 8 April 2015), CINAHL (1982 to April 2015), Web of Science (1900 to 9 April 2015), BIOSIS (1969 to 9 April 2015), POPLINE (1970 to April 2015), AGRICOLA, OpenGrey, BiblioMap, and Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI), along with regional databases (April 2015) and theses. We also searched clinical trial registries (17 March 2015) and contacted relevant organizations (May 2014) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials, randomized at either the individual or cluster level. Non-randomized trials were included at the individual level if there was a comparison group. Non-randomized cluster trials and controlled before-after studies were included only if there were at least two intervention groups.

### Modest effects of dietary supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from 445 850 users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app [^112TKHvM]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2021). Low credibility.

A number of micronutrients, including vitamins C and D and zinc, have been shown to play key roles in supporting immune function and in reducing the risk of respiratory infection. These nutrients can be obtained from the diet and are available as dietary supplements, either alone or as part of multivitamin or multinutrient mixtures. There are many other dietary supplements available, including omega-3 fatty acids ('fish oil'), probiotics, and plant isolates like garlic. The use of specific dietary supplements in both prevention and acute treatment of infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been promoted by prominent medical entertainment personalities on television and social media since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The UK supplement market increased by 19.5% in the period leading up to the national 'lockdown' in early March 2020, with a 110% rise in sales of vitamin C and a 93% rise in sales of multivitamin supplements. Likewise, zinc supplement sales increased by 415% over the 7-day period ending 8 March, at the height of COVID-19 concern in the United States.

A biologically plausible role exists for certain vitamins and minerals in immune pathways. For example, vitamin D has been suggested to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission by enhancing antiviral immunity and to reduce mortality by mitigating the cytokine storm linked with severe COVID-19. Moreover, zinc also supports the function of the immune system and may have specific antiviral effects. However, robust evidence to support a role for vitamins and minerals in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 is not available.

### Dietary micronutrients in the wake of Covid-19: An appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare [^111iHbQR]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

Zinc

There is little zinc storage in the body, meaning that inadequate intakes can lead to deficiency, which is associated with compromised immune function. It is critical for the functioning of both innate and adaptive immunity, as well as cytokine production — which is altered during deficiency — contributing to oxidative stress and inflammation. This role in mediating inflammatory response is particularly relevant in the systemic inflammatory response observed in sepsis, an over-reactive host response to infection. Low zinc status has been associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis and fatality from infection. This is complicated by the fact that pathogens require zinc to thrive, while the immune system also requires it to function, meaning status can appear to have a contradictory role in the infection process. Higher status (> 70 mg/dL) can be predictive of favorable pneumonia incidence and treatment course in the institutionalized elderly, which is an important consideration given that they are a high-risk group for deficiency.

Numerous RCTs have demonstrated that supplementation of moderate zinc doses in healthy elderly individuals improves several aspects of immune functioning and may reduce the incidence of infections and even overall mortality. A recent Cochrane Review also found that supplementation reduced the risk of pneumonia by 13% in children under 5. It is worth noting that high zinc intakes can increase copper losses and contribute to deficiency; therefore, supplementation should be combined with a copper component.

### Current dietary zinc intake has a greater effect on fractional zinc absorption than does longer term zinc consumption in healthy adult men [^111b67ZP]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

No studies have examined the independent effects of longer-term dietary zinc intakes on zinc absorption.

- **Objective**: We determined the effects of current zinc intake compared with longer-term zinc intake on fractional zinc absorption (FZA).

- **Design**: We studied nine men whose usual zinc intakes were greater than 11 mg/d. FZA was measured at baseline, during depletion (0.6 mg Zn/d for 1 week and 4 mg Zn/d for 5 weeks), and repletion (11 mg Zn/d for 4 weeks with 20 mg supplemental Zn/d for the first 7 days). During two successive days after each dietary period, subjects consumed either adequate-zinc meals (11 mg Zn/d) with a zinc stable isotope tracer for one day, followed by low-zinc meals (4 mg Zn/d) with zinc tracer, or vice versa. Five days after oral dosing, a zinc tracer was infused intravenously. FZA was measured using a modified double isotope tracer ratio method with urine samples collected on days 5–7 and 10–12 of absorption studies.

- **Results**: Plasma and urinary zinc did not vary by dietary period. Mean FZA was greater from low-zinc meals than from adequate-zinc meals (60.9% ± 13.8% compared with 36.1% ± 8.9%; P < 0.0001), whereas mean total absorbed zinc was greater from adequate-zinc meals than from low-zinc meals (3.60 ± 0.91 compared with 2.48 ± 0.56; P < 0.0001), regardless of the longer-term dietary period.

- **Conclusions**: FZA was inversely related to zinc intake, but there was no detectable effect of longer-term dietary zinc. If longer-term zinc intake does modify FZA, such changes are smaller than those caused by current zinc intake, or they occur only after more significant periods.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^114iFxBL]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Overall, micronutrients show promise in shortening cold duration but may not be as effective in preventing colds among healthy adults. The efficacy of micronutrients in managing cold severity remains inconclusive, and further analysis with standardized scales and measures is required because evidence presents differential effects. Although efforts were made to identify all possible micronutrient supplementation and their potential effects on the prevention and management of colds, no relevant studies on the effects of copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, and vitamins B and K were identified. This result, and the low number of selected studies in our review, highlight the paucity of research focused on micronutrient supplementation for cold prevention and management among healthy adults. The lack of studies also stresses the need for more research focusing on these micronutrients to prevent and manage colds among healthy adults, rather than diseased individuals, children, or elderly patients. Thus, it is important to emphasize that the aforementioned effects on cold and pneumonia prevention only represent those of zinc and vitamins A, E, and D, whereas effects on cold management only represent those of zinc and vitamin D.

- **Prevention of cold and pneumonia**: Although nonsignificant reductions in cold incidence were consistently observed across all micronutrients, the effects mainly reflected those of vitamin D, as most data came from studies providing vitamin D (99.4%) for cold prevention purposes.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^111rLHgW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

To use the GRADE approach for assessing certainty in outcomes, summary statistics, heterogeneity assessment, and publication bias analysis were conducted for each outcome despite the small number of studies. For the number of cold outcomes in the intervention and placebo groups, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI was calculated for each study. For cold duration, mean differences in cold duration between the intervention and placebo groups were pooled using a random effects model, and the result was reported as weighted mean difference and 95% CIs.

The I² statistic and Cochran's Q test were used to evaluate statistical heterogeneity, where heterogeneity was characterized as minimal (< 25%) and significant if P-value < 0.05. When more than two studies reported the same outcome, publication bias for the outcome was assessed with contoured funnel plots. All statistical tests were two-sided and performed using Review Manager 5.3 and STATA (version 13.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX).

### Zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults with insulin resistance [^113su8gp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Insulin resistance is a fundamental aspect of the etiology of type 2 diabetes and has been shown to be associated with atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, hyperuricemia, hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome. The mineral zinc plays a key role in the synthesis and action of insulin, both physiologically and in diabetes mellitus. Zinc seems to stimulate insulin action and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity.

- **Objective**: To assess the effects of zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults with insulin resistance.

- **Search methods**: This review is an update of a previous Cochrane systematic review published in 2007. We searched the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the ICTRP trial register (from inception to March 2015). There were no language restrictions. We conducted citation searches and screened reference lists of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies if they had a randomized or quasi-randomized design and if they investigated zinc supplementation compared with placebo or no intervention in adults with insulin resistance living in the community.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117C8Dr1]. BMJ Global Health (2022). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized data from nine RCTs and showed that zinc and vitamin A supplementation was significantly associated with improved sputum smear conversion and higher serum retinol, zinc, and hemoglobin levels at different durations of follow-up. However, zinc and/or vitamin A supplementation during TB treatment had no effect on a successful TB treatment outcome.

Nutritional supplementation may be provided for people with TB to promote treatment adherence, improve treatment outcomes, or mitigate the financial cost of TB care. It was a cornerstone of TB management in the pre-antibiotic era. Currently, WHO recommends that all individuals living with TB should be evaluated for their nutritional status and provided with adequate counseling based on their nutritional status at the time of TB diagnosis and throughout the course of treatment. In addition, micronutrient supplementation with vitamins such as vitamin A has been found to boost the immune system or be used for the adjunctive treatment of infectious diseases, including TB.

The findings of our systematic review and meta-analysis are consistent with a previous meta-analysis that showed a non-significant effect on TB treatment success after six months of micronutrient supplementation. Similar studies have also demonstrated that multi-micronutrient supplementation does not significantly affect treatment outcomes among adults with pulmonary TB. Various factors may account for this non-significant finding, including a small number of included studies in the analysis.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^112c6SBy]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

Similar to our findings on the impact of zinc administration on cold severity, there still seems to be no consensus on this topic despite efforts to reach a conclusion. The two most recent meta-analyses, which standardized and pooled severity scores across their selected studies, reported contrasting findings between placebo and zinc-administered groups. Johnstone et al. reported significantly less severe symptoms in the zinc-administered group (standardized MD: −0.64, 95% CI: −1.05, −0.24), but Singh et al. reported no difference in severity scores between these two groups (MD: −1.06, 95% CI: −2.36, 0.23). This discrepancy is unexpected, as both meta-analyses used similar statistical methods to process the data from their selected studies and included the same studies in their pooling, with the exception of an additional study in Singh et al. To generate a mean difference. Hence, the conflicting observation could possibly be attributed to that additional study included (as it has a relatively high weight of 26.9% in the overall mean difference generated) or the problems associated with standardization.

However, certain issues need to be addressed before making a decision on whether to provide these micronutrient supplements as a long-term approach to effectively prevent or manage colds among healthy adults. The first issue is the safety of supplementing these micronutrients. Second, more standardized RCTs on the effects of micronutrients in healthy Asian populations are still needed to fully understand the colds' impact.

### Zinc deficiency [^112MuC41]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Zinc plays an essential role in numerous biochemical pathways. Zinc deficiency affects many organ systems, including the integumentary, gastrointestinal, central nervous, immune, skeletal, and reproductive systems. This article aims to discuss zinc metabolism and highlights a few of the diseases associated with zinc deficiency.

- **Recent findings**: Zinc deficiency results in dysfunction of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, increasing susceptibility to infection. Supplementation of zinc has been shown to reduce the incidence of infection as well as cellular damage from increased oxidative stress. Zinc deficiency is also associated with acute and chronic liver disease. Zinc supplementation protects against toxin-induced liver damage and is used as a therapy for hepatic encephalopathy in patients refractory to standard treatment. Furthermore, zinc deficiency has been implicated in diarrheal disease, with supplementation proving effective in both the prophylaxis and treatment of acute diarrhea.

- **Summary**: This article is not intended to review all disease states associated with zinc deficiency. Rather, it introduces the influence of zinc's many roles in the body, with an extensive discussion on zinc deficiency's impact on selected diseases. Zinc supplementation may be beneficial as an adjunct in treating many disease states.

### A moderate increase in dietary zinc reduces DNA strand breaks in leukocytes and alters plasma proteins without changing plasma zinc concentrations [^1144rG9R]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation play causative roles in the development of chronic diseases, including cancers, atherosclerosis, and other degenerative disorders. Our results suggest that subclinical zinc deficiencies may shift cellular metabolic functions in a manner that increases chronic disease risk. Epidemiologic studies have reported associations between zinc and risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, but to our knowledge, this is the first human study to show that a moderate increase in dietary zinc alters underlying cellular changes associated with subsequent disease risk. Further studies are needed to demonstrate that a moderate increase in dietary zinc could positively influence biomarkers associated with these diseases.

At the time of writing, stunting and an increased risk of gastrointestinal or pulmonary infections are the primary functional consequences of zinc deficiency in humans. We suggest, based on this study and others, that DNA damage should be considered a functional indicator of human zinc deficiency.

- **Advantages of comet assay**:
	- The use of comet assay as a functional indicator of zinc nutrition offers several benefits over assessing incidences of stunting and morbidity. First, it can be used in studies of adults as well as children. Second, unlike stunting and increased morbidity, it is very sensitive to small changes in dietary zinc. Third, it requires very little blood, making it feasible to perform analyses from a finger-stick sample drawn in a field setting.

### Zinc deficiency is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^1124Sr4T]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Zinc plays a pivotal role in wound repair, tissue regeneration, and the immune response. Although zinc deficiency is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of low serum zinc levels on disease course is not well understood.

- **Methods**: Patients enrolled in a prospectively collected IBD registry with at least two serum zinc measurements were included in the analysis. Using a logistic regression model, rates of IBD-related surgeries, hospitalizations, and complications were evaluated following a diagnosis of zinc deficiency (serum concentration < 0.66 μg/mL) compared with those with normal zinc concentrations. In patients who were zinc deficient, outcomes were also analyzed between those who had normalization of zinc levels within 12 months and those who remained deficient.

- **Results**: A total of 773 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 223 with ulcerative colitis (UC) were included in the analysis. After adjusting for covariates, zinc deficiency was associated with an increased risk of subsequent hospitalizations, surgeries, and disease-related complications in patients with CD and UC [CD: hospitalizations, odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–2.04; surgeries, 2.05 (CI 1.38–3.05); complications, 1.50 (CI 1.04–2.15); UC: hospitalizations, 2.14 (CI 1.07–4.29); surgeries, 1.64 (CI 0.59–4.52); complications, 1.97 (CI 0.94–4.11)]. Normalization of zinc was associated with improvement in these outcomes in patients with both CD and UC.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with IBD who have serum zinc deficiency are more likely to experience adverse disease-specific outcomes.

### Prophylactic zinc supplementation reduces bacterial load and improves survival in a murine model of sepsis [^114rfi5B]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the potential therapeutic benefits of prophylactic zinc supplementation in a murine model of peritoneal sepsis. Prior research indicated that altered zinc homeostasis is a key characteristic of pediatric sepsis, suggesting that zinc supplementation could be a viable treatment.

- **Design**: The study utilized a murine model of sepsis induced by intraperitoneal fecal-slurry injection.

- **Setting**: The research was conducted in a basic science laboratory.

- **Subjects**: The subjects were C57BL/6 male mice.

- **Interventions**: Mice received an intraperitoneal fecal-slurry injection, with some groups also receiving zinc supplementation (10 mg/kg of intraperitoneal zinc gluconate) for three days before the injection.

- **Measurements and main results**: The study measured survival over three days post-injection, along with markers of inflammation, bacterial load analyses, and immunophenotyping. Mice that received zinc supplementation exhibited a significant survival advantage compared to the control group, which did not receive zinc. This advantage correlated with a reduction in bacterial load and moderate decreases in inflammation and immune activation. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages from the zinc-supplemented group showed a markedly increased capacity for phagocytosis of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus compared to those from control mice.

In conclusion, prophylactic zinc supplementation is beneficial in reducing bacterial load and improving outcomes in a murine model of peritoneal sepsis.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^1152Mewy]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin D: The pooled mean difference, using results from five studies, suggested an estimated decrease in cold duration by 0.14 days. However, the reduction in cold duration did not reach statistical significance (95% CI: −0.48, 0.20), and heterogeneity was not significant between pooled studies (I² = 0%, P > 0.05). However, imprecision and serious risk of bias were detected in pooled studies. Thus, the GRADE certainty of evidence for vitamin D administration for reduction of cold duration is very low.

The study by Murdoch et al, which was not pooled with the other studies as the IQR was not provided, reported no significant difference in median cold duration between the vitamin D and placebo group (12 days in both groups; RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.25, P = 0.76).

### Nutrient supplementation for prevention of viral respiratory tract infections in healthy subjects: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fC9RJ]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

It remains uncertain whether nutrient supplementation for the general population considered healthy could be useful in the prevention of RTIs, such as COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the evidence was evaluated for primary prevention of any viral respiratory tract infection (RTI), such as SARS-CoV-2, through supplementation of nutrients with a recognized role in immune function: multiple micronutrients, vitamin A, folic acid, vitamins B12, C, D, E, beta-carotene, zinc, iron, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The search produced 15,163 records, of which 93 papers (based on 115 studies) met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 199,055 subjects (191,636 children and 7,419 adults) from 37 countries. Sixty-three studies were included in the meta-analyses, which were performed for children and adults separately.

By stratifying the meta-analysis by world regions:

- **Zinc supplementation**: Only studies performed in Asia showed a significant but heterogeneous protective effect on RTIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.7–0.96, I² = 79.1%, p = .000).
- **Vitamin D supplementation in adults**: This significantly decreased the incidence of RTI (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–0.99, p = .272), particularly in North America (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68–0.97), but not in Europe or Oceania.

Supplementation of nutrients in the general population has either no or at most a very limited effect on the prevention of RTIs. Zinc supplementation appears protective for children in Asia, while vitamin D may protect adults in the United States and Canada.

### Micronutrient supplementation in adults with HIV infection [^112pKb43]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Micronutrient deficiencies are common among adults living with HIV disease, particularly in low-income settings where the diet may be low in essential vitamins and minerals. Some micronutrients play critical roles in the maintenance of the immune system, and routine supplementation could therefore be beneficial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2010.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether micronutrient supplements are effective and safe in reducing mortality and HIV-related morbidity of HIV-positive adults (excluding pregnant women).

- **Search methods**: We performed literature searches from January 2010 to November 18, 2016, for new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of micronutrient supplements since the previous review, which included all trials identified from searches prior to 2010. We searched the CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), Embase, and PubMed databases. Additionally, we checked the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of all new included trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared supplements containing either single, dual, or multiple micronutrients with placebo, no treatment, or other supplements. We excluded studies primarily designed to investigate the role of micronutrients for the treatment of HIV-positive participants with metabolic morbidity related to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, morbidity, and disease progression.

### Long-term moderate zinc supplementation increases exchangeable zinc pool masses in late-middle-aged men: the Zenith study [^1155RMV2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005).

Zinc supplementation may be beneficial for health, and assessing exchangeable zinc pools may be a useful approach to evaluate zinc status.

- **Objective**: We evaluated the effects of long-term supplementation with two moderate doses of zinc on the mass of exchangeable zinc pools.

- **Design**: Three groups of healthy, late-middle-aged men (n = 16 per group) participated in a stable-isotope zinc kinetic study after six months of daily supplementation with 0 (placebo), 15, or 30 mg of Zn. At the end of the supplementation period, each subject received an intravenous injection of 0.89 mg of (70)Zn, and the plasma zinc disappearance curve was monitored for the next 10 days. Two approaches were used to determine the characteristics of the exchangeable zinc pools: 1) formal 3-compartmental modeling and 2) a simplified determination of the total mass of the rapidly exchangeable zinc pool (EZP).

- **Results**: In the placebo group, the exchangeable zinc pool masses for the three considered pools were as follows: 2.15, 12.7, and 100.5 mg Zn. The rapidly exchangeable zinc pool mass in the placebo group was 143 mg Zn. Zinc supplementation significantly increased the exchangeable zinc pool masses regardless of the approach used to determine these pools. In addition, these data confirm that exchangeable zinc pool masses correlate positively with total zinc intake, negatively with subject age, and do not correlate with plasma zinc concentrations.

- **Conclusion**: Our data show that long-term supplementation with two moderate doses of zinc is an efficient way to increase exchangeable zinc pool masses in late-middle-aged men.

### Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116d1Kbw]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

The duration of symptoms was a focus of several studies on zinc supplementation. Nine studies examined the effect of zinc supplementation on shortening the duration of the common cold among 1,038 adults. All nine reported significant effects. There was a low risk of bias for one study, with some concern for four studies and high for four studies. These studies were conducted in Australia and the United States. In an experimental challenge study, zinc (13 mg every 2 hours) shortened the duration of symptoms from 3.5 days to 2.5 days relative to placebo among 91 volunteers.

In terms of dosage, most studies administered either 23 mg of zinc or 13 mg every two to three wakeful hours. Among 99 adults in the United States, zinc supplementation significantly reduced the time to resolution of all symptoms (median reduction of 4.4 days compared with 7.6 days in the placebo group; p < 0.001). The zinc group experienced significantly fewer days with most symptoms such as coughing, headache, hoarseness, nasal congestion, and sore throat, but showed no difference in the number of fever days. Among 65 US adults, zinc supplementation was associated with a shorter duration of symptoms. Half of the participants in the zinc group became asymptomatic in 2.7 days compared to 7.5 days in the placebo group. After 7 days, 86% in the zinc group were asymptomatic, compared with only 46% in the placebo group.

Additionally, a few studies provided zinc in the form of nasal gels. For instance, among 213 US adults, the duration of symptoms was 2.3 (± 0.9) days in the zinc group, compared to 9.0 (± 2.5) days in the placebo group. Among 80 US adults with recent onset of symptoms, nasal zinc supplementation reduced the duration of symptoms from 6 days to 4.3 days.

### Interactive effects of iron and zinc on biochemical and functional outcomes in supplementation trials [^116rLcJT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Iron and zinc are essential micronutrients for human health. Deficiencies in these two nutrients remain a global problem, especially among women and children in developing countries. Supplementation with iron and zinc as single micronutrients enhances distinct and unique biochemical and functional outcomes. These micronutrients have the potential to interact when given together; thus, it is important to assess the biochemical and functional evidence from clinical trials before supplementation policies are established.

We reviewed randomized trials that assessed the effects of iron and zinc supplementation on iron and zinc status. Based on this review, zinc supplementation alone does not appear to have a clinically important negative effect on iron status. However, when zinc is given with iron, iron indicators do not improve as greatly as when iron is given alone. In most of the studies, iron supplementation did not affect the biochemical status of zinc, but the data are not clear regarding morbidity outcomes.

Although some trials have shown that joint iron and zinc supplementation has less of an effect on biochemical or functional outcomes than does supplementation with either mineral alone, there is no strong evidence to discourage joint supplementation. Supplementation programs that provide iron and zinc together are an efficient way to provide both micronutrients, provided the benefits of individual supplementation are not lost. Further research is needed before health policies on joint supplementation programs can be established.

### Galzin [^115YKLYQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended adult dose is 50 mg as zinc, taken three times daily (see CLINICAL TRIALS). For children aged 10 years or older and pregnant women, a dose of 25 mg three times a day is also effective. It might be advisable to use this dosage, provided that the patient complies with therapy. The dose can be increased to 50 mg three times daily if monitoring indicates a decrease in control (see PRECAUTIONS: Monitoring Patients).

Patients should take zinc acetate on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two to three hours after meals. For additional information, see PRECAUTIONS.

### Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease [^1146FLDL]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

Zinc supplements can interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics, inhibiting the absorption of both the zinc and the antibiotic. Separating the time of ingestion by taking the antibiotic at least 2 hours before or 4–6 hours after taking the zinc supplement minimizes this interaction. Zinc supplements can also reduce the absorption of penicillamine, an antirheumatic drug. Individuals can minimize this interaction by taking penicillamine at least 2 hours before or after ingestion of the zinc supplement. As far as can reasonably be ascertained, there are no other relevant effects of zinc on drugs.

Since zinc might decrease blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes, it is important to monitor their blood sugar levels closely when starting zinc supplementation. The dose of diabetes medication might need adjustments.

Epidemiological research and observational studies provide indications for zinc depletion in high-risk groups for COVID-19. Various widely used hypotensive drugs and statins can affect zinc balance, worsening zinc homeostasis in already mildly zinc-deficient individuals. As disturbed zinc homeostasis results in compromised immune functions, it is hypothesized to increase susceptibility to COVID-19. Therefore, correcting low zinc status in risk groups could play a pivotal role in preventing and controlling COVID-19 disease. Studies have shown that zinc depletion in hypertension can be corrected by dietary adjustments or zinc supplementation, with the added benefit.

### Zinc supplementation for the promotion of growth and prevention of infections in infants less than six months of age [^1143pzww]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Zinc is a vital micronutrient for humans and is essential for protein synthesis, cell growth, and differentiation. Severe zinc deficiency can lead to slower physical, cognitive, and sexual growth, cause skin disorders, decrease immunity, increase the incidence of acute illnesses in infants and children, and contribute to childhood stunting. By estimation, 17.3% of the world population is at risk of inadequate zinc intake. Such nutritional impairment increases the risk of diarrhoea and pneumonia by 20% and leads to a global loss of more than 16 million disability-adjusted life years in children less than five years of age. Not only does zinc deficiency affect lives, but it also adds to the considerable financial burden on depleted resources in the countries that are most affected. By preventing or curing this deficiency, we can improve childhood mortality, morbidity, and growth.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of zinc supplementation for the promotion of growth, reduction in mortality, and the prevention of infections in infants less than six months of age.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 18 May 2018), Embase (1980 to 18 May 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 18 May 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. An updated search from 1 January 2018 to 29 January 2020 was run.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^1122rcvJ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

The key characteristics of the studies included in this review are presented in Table 2. Across the 22 studies, there were 49,189 subjects with a mean age ranging from 18.5 to 60.7 years. Notably, 45,939 subjects (93.4%) participated in four studies supplementing vitamin A and vitamin E, while 3,250 subjects (6.6%) were involved in 18 studies using vitamin D or zinc as an intervention. All studies employed parallel designs and were conducted in non-Asian countries, such as Finland, the Netherlands, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Denmark, with the exception of one study from Japan.

Intervention durations, dosage, and dosing frequency varied widely among different micronutrients. Specifically, for vitamins A and E, 20 mg of water-soluble β-carotene beadlets and 50 mg dl-α-tocopherol acetate, respectively, were supplemented over 6.1 years. For vitamin D, eight studies supplemented vitamin D3 over periods ranging from 2 to 18 months, with doses from 100 IU daily to 20,000 IU weekly and 100,000 IU monthly. In the case of zinc, 10 studies provided zinc lozenges or capsules containing 5 mg to 42.9 mg of zinc, primarily as zinc gluconate or zinc acetate, over periods from 3 to 100 days or until symptom resolution for cold management, and up to 7 months for cold prevention.

It is interesting to note that the main outcomes reported by studies using vitamins A and E as interventions were cold or pneumonia prevention. In contrast, studies using zinc primarily focused on cold management as an outcome.

### Effects of zinc and vitamin A supplementation on prognostic markers and treatment outcomes of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DfgFQ]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The effectiveness of TB treatment relies on a competent cell-mediated immune system and the appropriate use and duration of antibiotics. Successful chemotherapy causes a rapid return to protective immune responses. This suggests that improving the micronutrient status of adults with pulmonary TB on chemotherapy may lead to faster bacterial clearance and, thus, a faster clinical recovery process by enhancing the immune response.

In some trials, micronutrient supplementation has been linked to improved sputum smear and culture conversion rates, and lower mortality rates compared with a placebo. However, evidence from earlier trials has been contradictory, showing no therapeutic effects of micronutrient supplementation on TB treatment outcomes. The evidence concerning the putative effects of adjunctive zinc and vitamin A supplementation to enhance TB treatment outcomes, and its prognostic markers, including serum zinc, retinol, and haemoglobin levels, as well as sputum smear conversions, has not been well studied, with only a few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) having been carried out.

Moreover, previous reviews have emphasised the effect of multi-micronutrient supplementation on mortality, weight gain, body mass index, and the degree of cavitation on chest radiography. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesised available evidence from RCTs to determine the association between zinc and vitamin A supplementation on TB treatment outcomes among adults with sputum-positive pulmonary TB, as well as prognostic markers, including sputum smear conversion and serum zinc levels.

### Zinc homeostasis and immunity [^111r4vt2]. Trends in Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Zinc is an essential trace element for the immune system, and zinc deficiency compromises the function of primarily T cells but also several other immune cells. Recently, zinc homeostasis has been demonstrated to affect dendritic cells, particularly through the involvement of zinc transport proteins during lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of major histocompatibility complex proteins and co-stimulatory molecules. This adds to our understanding of the immunomodulatory potential of zinc and highlights its significance for immune function.

### Zinc adjunct therapy reduces case fatality in severe childhood pneumonia: A randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial [^112VcVvJ]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The second finding in this study is that zinc supplementation as adjunct therapy for pneumonia did not reduce the time to normalization of the parameters for disease severity. Indeed, the median time for normalization of the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature in the zinc and placebo groups were not significantly different, which is consistent with results of two Indian and one Australian study. However, a Bangladesh study demonstrated a significant difference in time to normalization of respiratory rate (40 to 48 hours in the zinc and placebo groups). Indeed, in a recent study from Nepal, it was shown that zinc adjunct therapy did not accelerate recovery from non-severe pneumonia and called for larger studies, especially of severe pneumonia. Thus, regarding the effect of zinc on normalization of parameters of disease severity in severe pneumonia, the jury is still out.

- **Limitations**: There are a few limitations to our study. The median age at death for children with pneumonia in Uganda is 16 months, with an interquartile range of 8 to 23 months, according to a study by Kallander. Therefore, we enrolled children aged 6 to 59 months into the study, which encompasses this age group. However, one would expect children below the age of six months to have the highest risk of case fatality from pneumonia. So excluding them might have affected our results.

	- We attempted to get blood cultures on most of our patients but did this on only 184/352 (52.3%) of the children. Of these, 45/184 (24.5%) were culture positive.

### Zinc decreases C-reactive protein, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory cytokines in elderly subjects: a potential implication of zinc as an atheroprotective agent [^116tkzoJ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). High credibility.

Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are common risk factors for atherosclerosis. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that can function as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidative agent, and as such, it may have atheroprotective properties.

We hypothesized that zinc down-regulates the production of atherosclerosis-related cytokines/molecules in humans. To examine these effects, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo trial of zinc supplementation in elderly subjects. We recruited 40 healthy elderly subjects (aged 56–83 years) and randomly assigned them to two groups. One group was given an oral dose of 45 mg zinc per day as a gluconate for six months, while the other group received a placebo. Cell culture models were conducted to study the mechanism of zinc as an atheroprotective agent.

After six months of supplementation, the intake of zinc, compared with intake of placebo, increased the concentrations of plasma zinc and decreased the concentrations of plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), secretory phospholipase A2, and malondialdehyde and hydroxyalkenals (MDA+HAE) in elderly subjects. Regression analysis showed that changes in concentrations of plasma zinc were inversely associated with changes in concentrations of plasma hsCRP, MCP-1, VCAM-1, and MDA+HAE after six months of supplementation. In cell culture studies, we showed that zinc decreased the generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, VCAM-1, and MDA+HAE.

### Zinc supplementation enhances the response to interferon therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^116QhJ6p]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2001). Low credibility.

We evaluated the synergistic effect of zinc supplementation on the response to interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with intractable chronic hepatitis C in a pilot study using natural IFN-alpha with or without zinc. No clinical differences were observed between patients treated with IFN alone (n = 40) and IFN with polaprezinc (IFN + Zn, n = 35). All patients were positive for HCV genotype Ib and had more than 10⁵ copies of the virus/mL serum. Ten million units of natural IFN-alpha were administered daily for 4 weeks followed by the same dose every other day for 20 weeks. In the IFN + Zn group, patients received an additional dose of 150 mg/day polaprezinc orally throughout the 24-week IFN course.

No additional side effects of polaprezinc were noted. However, four out of 40 IFN alone treatment and three out of 35 IFN + Zn group withdrew because of side effects. Complete response (CR) was defined as negative HCV RNA in the serum on PCR and normal aminotransferase level 6 months after therapy. Incomplete response (IR) was defined as normal liver enzyme and positive serum HCV RNA. Both were evaluated 6 months after the completion of the treatment. Patients with higher levels of serum HCV (more than 5 × 10⁵ copies/mL) had little response in both treatment groups. Patients with a moderate amount of HCV (10⁵ to 4.99 × 10⁵/mL) showed high response rates in the combination group (CR: 11/27, 40.7%; CR + IR: 15/27, 64.3%), better than IFN alone (CR: 2/15, 18.2%; CR + IR: 2/15, 18.2%). Serum zinc levels were higher in patients with the IFN + Zn group than in the IFN group. Our results indicate that zinc supplementation enhances the response to interferon therapy.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^112b9zvX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

The common cold results in a significant economic and social burden worldwide. While the effect of vitamin C in preventing the common cold among healthy adults has been extensively investigated, the impact of other micronutrients has not. This review aims to assess the effects of providing micronutrients singly through oral means on cold incidence and management — specifically in terms of cold duration and symptom severity — in healthy adults, using systematically searched randomized controlled trials. From four electronic databases, 660 studies were identified and screened, with data extracted from 20 studies involving zinc (10 studies), vitamin D (8 studies), and vitamins A and E (2 studies). The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and certainty in the outcomes was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The review found that micronutrient supplementation, with the exception of vitamin C, may not prevent cold incidence or reduce symptom severity in healthy adults. However, zinc supplementation was observed to potentially reduce cold duration by 2.25 days when zinc is provided singly (95% CI: -3.39, -1.12). This suggests that zinc supplementation could reduce the overall burden caused by the common cold among healthy adults.

### Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease [^114z6UHQ]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

Due to the involvement of zinc in various immune functions, zinc deficiency results in the reduced activity of immune cells, such as impaired phagocytosis, decreased critical neutrophil functions, and weakened natural killer cell function. It also leads to a reduced lymphocyte number and activation, diminished antibody production, and an imbalanced T helper cell cytokine secretion with decreased IFNγ production. IFNs are immunostimulatory cytokines with antiviral activity, and their decrease results in increased thymic atrophy and a consequent risk of infection.

Conversely, an excess of zinc can also impair immune response by inhibiting T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte function, reducing the intracellular pathogen destruction in macrophages, or inducing an overload of regulatory T-cells. This demonstrates that a balanced zinc homeostasis is critical for adequate immune functions.

Furthermore, accurate modulation of the inflammatory response is required for achieving an adequate antiviral immune response. Zinc is crucial in counteracting excessive inflammatory reactions by improving the control of the regulatory transcriptional factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), resulting in a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Zinc signals can increase intracellular levels of zinc finger protein A20, which inhibits activation of NF-κB through a negative feedback loop, also downregulating pro-inflammatory factors. Zinc may limit excessive inflammatory response by modulating regulatory T-cell functions.

Moreover, zinc has proven direct antiviral activity towards a wide variety of viruses, enhancing antiviral immunity.
