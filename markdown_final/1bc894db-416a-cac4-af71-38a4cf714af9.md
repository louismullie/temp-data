## Question

I have severe dust allergy on sympicort and budesonide neb and ventolin neb what next

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next steps should be for managing severe dust mite–allergic asthma that remains uncontrolled despite Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol), budesonide nebulizer, and Ventolin (albuterol) nebulizer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and current treatment step. Then, I should verify inhaler technique and adherence. Next, I will assess for modifiable contributors like allergen exposure and comorbidities. After that, I need to consider optimizing controller therapy, including MART and LAMA add-on. Then, I should evaluate for severe asthma phenotypes and biologic candidacy. Finally, I will address environmental controls, create an action plan, and set a follow-up timeline with clear escalation triggers.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and current treatment step, because I need to ensure we are truly at Step 4–5 and not misclassifying uncontrolled asthma as severe asthma. Severe asthma is defined retrospectively as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA or biologic therapy to maintain control, so I should verify that technique and adherence are optimized before labeling this as severe asthma [^115maK4T] [^114DDMqv].

> Wait, let me verify inhaler technique and adherence before escalating therapy, since poor technique or nonadherence are the most common reasons for apparent treatment failure. I should double-check device mastery for DPI or pMDI, consider switching to a device with better real-world mastery (e.g. Spiromax), and review nebulizer technique and cleaning practices; if technique is suboptimal, I should retrain and reassess control in 2–6 weeks before stepping up [^114bVWEr] [^114MP712].

> I need to check for modifiable contributors next, especially dust mite exposure, because sensitization plus exposure can drive symptoms. Multicomponent dust mite mitigation (encasements plus washing, vacuuming with HEPA, humidity control) is recommended for sensitized patients with symptoms, whereas mattress/pillow covers alone are insufficient; I should tailor interventions to confirmed sensitization and feasibility, and consider that some patients may have irritant responses even with negative testing, so clinical history still guides action [^115v8vcr] [^115ch2C8] [^113Yqdcx].

> Hold on, I should verify comorbidities that mimic or worsen asthma: allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, obesity, GERD, anxiety/depression, smoking/secondhand smoke, and occupational exposures. These should be identified and treated because they can undermine control and confound the assessment of severity; if present, I should address them in parallel rather than sequentially [^114MP712].

> Next, I should review whether the current regimen is truly optimized. Using both budesonide/formoterol and separate budesonide nebulizer is duplicative and may reflect underdosing of the combination inhaler or misaligned reliever strategy. GINA prefers Track 1 with ICS-formoterol as both maintenance and reliever (MART) across Steps 3–5, which reduces exacerbations versus higher-dose ICS or ICS-LABA plus SABA; if already on MART, I should confirm the maintenance dose and that the patient is using the same inhaler for relief up to the daily formoterol maximum (12 puffs/day in adults) [^112PV2iD] [^112kUrdK] [^116F7oDf].

> Let me consider a short-term step-up for dust mite season or viral triggers. Temporarily increasing the maintenance ICS dose for 1–2 weeks during high exposure or infection can be reasonable, but I should avoid chronic high-dose ICS without a plan to de-escalate, given systemic steroid risks; I should also confirm the patient has a written action plan for yellow-zone management and early OCS use when indicated [^112DFj9a] [^113bkNcs].

> If control remains suboptimal after confirming technique, adherence, and addressing exposures, I should add a LAMA. Tiotropium as add-on to medium/high-dose ICS-LABA modestly improves lung function and reduces exacerbations in some patients, with meta-analytic data showing about a 17% reduction in severe exacerbation risk; I can use a separate LAMA inhaler or a triple ICS-LABA-LAMA device in adults, and I should continue ICS-formoterol as the reliever if using formoterol-containing maintenance therapy [^113GFQbA] [^115LqH3C].

> But wait, what if this is severe asthma requiring biologics? I should confirm phenotype and eligibility. Type 2 inflammation is suggested by blood eosinophils ≥ 150/μL, FeNO ≥ 20 ppb, or clinical allergen-driven disease; for allergic asthma with IgE-mediated sensitization, omalizumab is appropriate, and for eosinophilic asthma, anti–IL-5/5R or anti–IL-4/13 agents reduce exacerbations and OCS exposure; I need to check local access, payer criteria, and refer to a severe asthma specialist for evaluation and shared decision-making [^114u1h56] [^113BKFMJ] [^116y4jjw].

> I should double-check the role of allergen immunotherapy here. For adults with house dust mite sensitization and persistent symptoms despite low- to high-dose ICS, sublingual immunotherapy can be considered if FEV1 is > 70% predicted, whereas subcutaneous immunotherapy is generally reserved for well-controlled patients due to systemic reaction risk; given current poor control, I should prioritize optimizing pharmacotherapy and environmental controls before initiating SCIT, and consider SLIT only after stabilization and shared decision-making [^112oAsgt] [^113RSWgD] [^114SnmZn].

> Let me reconsider the reliever strategy one more time. If the patient is using SABA nebulizer frequently, that signals poor control and risk; I should transition to ICS-formoterol as the reliever within a MART regimen to ensure every reliever dose delivers anti-inflammatory therapy, and I should explicitly counsel on the daily formoterol maximum and when to seek urgent care if usage escalates [^112PV2iD] [^112iShCL].

> Next, I should review the written asthma action plan and ensure it includes green, yellow, and red zones, with clear instructions for increasing controller therapy, adding OCS, and seeking urgent care; after any severe exacerbation, I should arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks to reassess control, technique, and adherence, and consider stepping up therapy or referring if Step 4 treatment fails despite good execution [^1157R5if] [^1179T5GD].

> I will now examine the follow-up cadence. Routine visits every 3–6 months are reasonable in persistent asthma, with earlier checks after any change; before stepping up, I should reassess in 2–6 weeks, and if control is sustained for 3 months, I should consider stepping down to the lowest effective dose, starting with OCS withdrawal if applicable, then other add-ons, and finally ICS dose reduction while maintaining an ICS-containing regimen [^114MP712] [^111Ecc9T].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis is correct, technique and adherence are perfect, and exposures and comorbidities are addressed; then optimize to MART if not already, add LAMA if still uncontrolled, and refer for severe asthma evaluation with phenotype assessment and consideration of biologics; parallel to this, implement dust mite mitigation and update the action plan, with close follow-up to verify response and safety [^111hqYHN] [^112CS7sT] [^115v8vcr].

For severe dust mite allergy with poor control on Symbicort, budesonide nebulizer, and Ventolin, the next step is to **add a LAMA (e.g. tiotropium)** [^113GFQbA] to reduce exacerbations and improve lung function [^115LqH3C]. If control remains inadequate, **refer to a specialist** for severe asthma evaluation and consider biologics (omalizumab, dupilumab, or anti–IL-5 agents) based on phenotype [^112CS7sT] [^114u1h56]. Also implement dust mite avoidance (encasements, HEPA, humidity control) [^115v8vcr] and consider allergen immunotherapy if FEV1 > 70% [^112oAsgt] [^113RSWgD]. Reassess adherence and inhaler technique before escalating therapy [^114MP712].

---

## Step 1: confirm diagnosis and assess control

Confirm the diagnosis and **assess control** by verifying asthma and excluding mimics (e.g. COPD, bronchiectasis, VCD) [^notfound]. Use spirometry, FeNO, and symptom control tools (ACQ, ACT) to quantify impairment and risk [^114dBoDX]. Poor control despite high-dose ICS/LABA and nebulized therapy warrants evaluation for severe asthma [^112CS7sT].

---

## Step 2: optimize current therapy and address modifiable factors

Before escalating, **optimize current therapy and address modifiable factors**:

- **Inhaler technique**: Ensure correct use of DPI/pMDI/nebulizer; errors are common and undermine control [^114bVWEr].

- **Adherence**: Address barriers and simplify regimens; nonadherence is a major cause of apparent treatment failure [^114MP712].

- **Comorbidities**: Treat rhinitis, sinus disease, GERD, obesity, anxiety, and smoking exposure [^notfound].

- **Allergen avoidance**: Implement dust mite mitigation (encasements, HEPA, humidity < 50%, hot washing) [^115v8vcr].

---

## Step 3: add-on therapy options

If control remains inadequate after optimization, **add-on therapies** include:

| **Add-on therapy** | **Indication** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| LAMA (tiotropium) | Persistent symptoms despite high-dose ICS/LABA | Reduces exacerbations and improves lung function [^113GFQbA] [^115LqH3C] |
| LTRA (montelukast) | Allergic rhinitis, exercise-induced symptoms | Modest benefit; monitor for neuropsychiatric effects [^notfound] |
| Azithromycin | Frequent exacerbations, non-eosinophilic phenotype | Reduces exacerbations; monitor for resistance and QTc [^115LqH3C] |
| Biologics (omalizumab, dupilumab, anti–IL-5) | Severe allergic or eosinophilic asthma | Reduces exacerbations, OCS use, and improves quality of life [^115LqH3C] [^114u1h56] |

---

## Step 4: specialist referral and severe asthma evaluation

Refer to a specialist for **severe asthma evaluation** if symptoms persist despite Step 4 therapy or if any of the following are present:

- Two or more OCS bursts/year or maintenance OCS [^112JUH55].

- Hospitalization or ICU admission for asthma [^notfound].

- Suspected allergic or eosinophilic phenotype [^114u1h56].

- Need for biologic therapy or advanced interventions [^112CS7sT].

---

## Step 5: allergen immunotherapy

Consider **allergen immunotherapy** for house dust mite sensitization with persistent symptoms despite ICS/LABA, provided FEV1 > 70% predicted [^112oAsgt] [^113RSWgD]. SLIT is preferred for dust mite allergy; SCIT is an option if SLIT is unavailable or declined [^notfound].

---

## Step 6: ongoing monitoring and step-down strategy

Monitor control regularly and **step down** when stable for 3+ months by reducing ICS dose and withdrawing add-ons in reverse order of introduction, while maintaining an ICS-containing regimen [^112qJMtP]. Avoid abrupt stops and monitor for relapse [^111Ecc9T].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis and assess control**: Exclude mimics, quantify impairment/risk [^114MP712].

- **Optimize current therapy**: Fix technique, adherence, comorbidities, and allergen avoidance [^114MP712].

- **Add LAMA**: Tiotropium as first-line add-on if uncontrolled on high-dose ICS/LABA [^113GFQbA].

- **Refer to specialist**: For severe asthma evaluation and biologic consideration [^112CS7sT].

- **Consider immunotherapy**: For dust mite sensitization with FEV1 > 70% [^112oAsgt].

- **Monitor and step down**: Adjust therapy based on control, stepping down when stable [^112qJMtP].

---

The next step is to **add a LAMA** (tiotropium) to the current regimen, then refer for severe asthma evaluation if control remains inadequate. Concurrently, implement dust mite avoidance and consider allergen immunotherapy if eligible [^113GFQbA] [^112CS7sT] [^115v8vcr] [^112oAsgt].

Considerations for starting treatment with low-dose maintenance-and-reliever therapy — by consensus, we suggest starting with Step 3 MART instead of as-needed-only ICS-formoterol (Steps 1–2) when specific clinical features are present. There is no specific evidence to guide this decision, but by consensus, we suggest starting with Step 3 MART (if permitted by local regulators) if the patient has symptoms most days or is waking at night due to asthma more than once a week (to rapidly reduce symptom burden), or if they are currently smoking, have impaired perception of bronchoconstriction (e.g. low initial lung function but few symptoms), a recent severe exacerbation or a history of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation, have severe airway hyperresponsiveness, or are currently exposed to a seasonal allergic trigger.

Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) day-to-day adjustment — using combination budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol as the reliever (with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol) — allows patients to adjust the number of as needed doses of ICS-formoterol from day to day according to symptoms, and this strategy reduces the risk of developing a severe exacerbation requiring OCS within the next 3–4 weeks; as-needed combination budesonide-salbutamol is an anti-inflammatory reliever option studied in Steps 3–5.

### It is time to change the way we manage mild asthma: an update in GINA 2019 [^115N1HwX]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The GINA treatment recommendations for controller treatment are based on evidence generated in several trials. The first of these was the three-way Symbicort Given As Needed in Mild Asthma (SYGMA) 1 trial (Table 2) which included patients deemed to be on GINA Step 2 treatment. The trial results indicated that as-needed budesonide-formoterol combinations provided a similar (non-inferior) effect on annual rate of exacerbation reduction, and eventuated in a lower exposure to ICSs compared to a maintenance ICS regimen – although budesonide-formoterol used as needed was inferior in terms of conferring ongoing asthma control (proportion of weeks with good asthma control). Both as-needed ICS-formoterol and maintenance ICS groups, were, as expected, better performing than terbutaline only group. Another study, the SYGMA 2 trial randomised asthma patients deemed to be requiring GINA Step 2 to treatment with either twice-daily placebo plus as-needed budesonide-formoterol or twice-daily budesonide plus as-needed SABA for 52 weeks. The results of this trial also indicated non-inferiority of the as-needed budesonide-formoterol combination compared to the maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA regimen in reducing the annual severe exacerbation rate in patients with mild asthma. The findings indicated significantly more positive results for the maintenance versus as-needed regimen for asthma symptom control, asthma-related QoL and lung function, however, these differences in outcomes were not deemed as clinically important. Recent updates from the Novel START (Novel Symbicort Turbuhaler Asthma Reliever Therapy) trial support the findings from the SYGMA 1 and 2 trials. The Novel START randomised mild asthma patients to either 1. as-needed salbutamol; 2. twice-daily budesonide plus as-needed salbutamol; or 3. as-needed budesonide-formoterol in an open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial which included 668 patients with mild asthma. Adult patients from 18 to 75 years of age were recruited in this study and the trial duration was 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the annualised rate of asthma exacerbations. The exacerbation rate among patients treated with as-needed budesonide-formoterol was significantly lower compared with patients treated with as-needed SABA and did not differ significantly from patients who received twice-daily maintenance budesonide. However, maintenance treatment with budesonide was superior to as-needed budesonide-formoterol in terms of asthma symptom control, measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5). The results of the PRACTICAL (PeRsonalised Asthma Combination Therapy with an Inhaled Corticosteroid And fast-onset Long acting beta agonist) trial, which is investigating the effectiveness of as-needed budesonide-formoterol in real-world settings (several key differences in trial design compared with Novel START) are also awaited with great interest.

GINA Treatment Tracks for Adults and Adolescents

There are five levels of treatment (Steps 1–5; Figure 3), with two "tracks", depending on the choice of reliever: ICS–formoterol (Track 1, preferred) or SABA (Track 2, alternative). Treatment may be stepped up or down within a track by using the same reliever at each step or may be switched between tracks.

Figure 3.
Personalized management for adults and adolescents to control symptoms and minimize risk. For ICS doses, see Box 3–6 in Reference. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 3-5A). HDM = house dust mite; ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting β 2 -agonist; LAMA = long-acting muscarinic antagonist; LTRA = leukotriene receptor antagonist; OCS = oral corticosteroid; SABA = short-acting β 2 -agonist; SLIT = sublingual immunotherapy.

Within Track 1, the reliever is as-needed, low-dose ICS–formoterol. This means that when a patient at any treatment step has asthma symptoms, they take low-dose ICS–formoterol for symptom relief. In Steps 1–2, this also provides the patient's controller therapy and reduces severe exacerbation risk, without daily maintenance treatment. This is distinguished from maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) in Steps 3–5, where patients take ICS–formoterol both as daily maintenance treatment and, as needed, for symptom relief (Table 1).

Table 1.
Differences between Current Asthma Treatment Regimens Containing an AIR

Track 2, with SABA reliever, is suggested where ICS–formoterol is not available or is not preferred by a patient at low risk of exacerbations (including having no exacerbations in the past year). Before prescribing therapy with SABA reliever, consider if the patient is likely to be poorly adherent with ICS controller therapy, as this increases the risk of exacerbations.

In Figure 3, additional or alternative treatments with less evidence for safety, efficacy, and/or effectiveness are shown as "other controller options".

### Overall asthma control achieved with budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy for patients on different treatment steps [^116wgdfh]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Adjusting medication for uncontrolled asthma involves selecting one of several options from the same or a higher treatment step outlined in asthma guidelines. We examined the relative benefit of introducing budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FORM) maintenance and reliever therapy (Symbicort SMART® Turbuhaler®) in patients previously prescribed treatments from Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Steps 2, 3 or 4.

Methods

This is a post hoc analysis of the results of five large clinical trials (> 12000 patients) comparing BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy with other treatments categorised by treatment step at study entry. Both current clinical asthma control during the last week of treatment and exacerbations during the study were examined.

Results

At each GINA treatment step, the proportion of patients achieving target levels of current clinical control were similar or higher with BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy compared with the same or a higher fixed maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist (ICS/LABA) (plus short-acting β2-agonist [SABA] as reliever), and rates of exacerbations were lower at all treatment steps in BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy versus same maintenance dose ICS/LABA (P < 0.01) and at treatment Step 4 versus higher maintenance dose ICS/LABA (P < 0.001). BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy also achieved significantly higher rates of current clinical control and significantly lower exacerbation rates at most treatment steps compared with a higher maintenance dose ICS + SABA (Steps 2–4 for control and Steps 3 and 4 for exacerbations). With all treatments, the proportion of patients achieving current clinical control was lower with increasing treatment steps.

Conclusions

BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy may be a preferable option for patients on Steps 2 to 4 of asthma guidelines requiring a more effective treatment and, compared with other fixed dose alternatives, is most effective in the higher treatment steps.

### The use of β ₂-agonist therapy before hospital attendance for severe asthma exacerbations: a post-hoc analysis [^115ons9H]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

An exploratory post hoc analysis of data was undertaken from a 24-week multicentre, prospective, open-label, RCT of the SMART versus Standard regimens in asthma patients aged 16 to 65 years. Eligible patients had a physician's diagnosis of asthma, a current prescription for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and at least one asthma exacerbation in the preceding year. Patients who had high baseline reliever use were not excluded, and there was no step-down in maintenance inhaled treatment on entry into the study. Full details of the trial have been published. The Study Protocol is available at, and see the Supplementary Material for further details. All patients provided written informed consent, and the New Zealand Multi-Region Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (MEC/09/11/127).

There were 151 patients randomised to receive 200/6 μg budesonide/formoterol via MDI (Vannair, AstraZeneca NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand; this is the MDI formulation of Symbicort Turbuhaler), two actuations twice daily as maintenance with extra doses for relief of symptoms as per the SMART regimen (SMART group), and 152 patients were randomised to receive 200/6 μg budesonide/formoterol via MDI, two actuations twice daily as maintenance with salbutamol 100 μg via MDI (Ventolin, GlaxoSmithKline NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) for relief of symptoms (Standard group). Five study visits occurred over 24 weeks. At the first visit, all participants had their inhaler technique checked and were provided verbal instructions and written asthma self-management plans corresponding to their randomised regimen. Patients who previously had GP-prescribed prednisone for self-initiation during an exacerbation were able to continue with this practice during the study. Patients who self-initiated prednisone for asthma were advised to also seek medical review. This analysis is restricted to patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma that resulted in an acute presentation to a hospital Emergency Department and/or admission to hospital during the study period.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113GFQbA]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Other Step 4 treatment options for adults and adolescents — Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) may be considered as add-on therapy in a separate inhaler for patients aged ≥ 6 years (tiotropium), or in a combination triple inhaler for patients aged ≥ 18 years if asthma is persistently uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta2 agonist (ICS-LABA). Adding a LAMA to medium or high-dose ICS-LABA modestly improved lung function but with no difference in symptoms; in some studies it modestly reduced exacerbations, and meta-analyses reported a 17% reduction in risk of severe exacerbations with addition of LAMA to medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA, mainly in those with a history of exacerbations in the previous year. For patients with exacerbations despite low-dose ICS-LABA, the ICS dose should be increased to at least medium, or switched to maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, before considering adding a LAMA. One study found the severe exacerbation rate was lower with high-dose fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (ICS-LABA) than with low- to medium-dose fluticasone furoate-vilanterol-umeclidinium (ICS-LABA-LAMA), and for patients prescribed an ICS-LABA-LAMA with a non-formoterol LABA, the appropriate reliever is SABA or ICS-SABA. In Step 4, there is insufficient evidence to support ICS-LAMA over low- or medium-dose ICS-LABA combination; in one analysis, response to adding LAMA to medium-dose ICS was not modified by baseline demographics, body-mass index, FEV1, FEV1 responsiveness, or smoking status. Consider adding sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) for adult patients with sensitization to house dust mite with suboptimally controlled asthma despite low- to high-dose ICS, but only if FEV1 is > 70% predicted.

### Adjustable and fixed dosing with budesonide / formoterol via a single inhaler in asthma patients: the ASSURE study [^116v2r8q]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Patient-guided management of asthma using adjustable dosing of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) was compared with fixed dosing in an open-label, multicentre, randomised study. Patients, uncontrolled on an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or controlled on an ICS and a long-acting beta2-agonist, entered a 4-week run-in period and received budesonide/formoterol (80/4.5 or 160/4.5 microg), 2 inhalations b.i.d. Following randomisation, the fixed-dosing group (n = 764) continued this regimen for a further 12 weeks. The adjustable-dosing group (n = 775) could step down to 1 inhalation b.i.d. if symptoms were controlled, and, at early signs of worsening symptoms, promptly step up to 4 inhalations b.i.d. for ≤ 2 weeks. During run-in, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute symptom-severity grading was maintained in 60% and improved in 31% of patients, clinic peak flow increased from 400 to 4191/min (P < 0.001), and health-related quality of life (overall MiniAQLQ) improved from 4.6 to 5.4 (P < 0.001). Patients effectively used the adjustable-dosing regimen; 79% reduced budesonide/formoterol dosage and, compared with fixed dosing, the number of inhalations were significantly lowered (3.2 vs. 3.8 inhalations/day, P < 0.05). Both regimens were well tolerated. In both groups, symptom control was maintained or improved in 85–86% of patients, and 94% experienced no treatment failures. Consistent with current guidelines, adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler provides effective asthma control at reduced medication doses.

### Bringing asthma care into the twenty-first century [^115iviNR]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Which patients should be referred to asthma specialists?

Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma should be systematically assessed to find out if they have a severe asthma or other reasons explaining their poor response to treatment, such as poor adherence or inappropriate treatment. For patients who do not respond to standard step care management and have poor asthma control despite good adherence and inhalation technique, including management of environmental exposures and co-morbidities, referral to a specialist is clearly essential.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116F7oDf]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

GINA Track 1 AIR and MART dosing specifies eligible inhalers, maximum daily inhalations, and step-wise frequencies by age. For 6–11 years: "Budesonide-formoterol 100/6 DPI [80/4.5] (maximum total 8 inhalations in any day)" with "Step 1–2 AIR-only: no evidence to date", "Step 3 MART: 1 inhalation once daily plus 1 as needed", "Step 4 MART: 1 inhalation twice daily plus 1 as needed", and "Step 5 MART: not recommended". For 12–17 years: "Budesonide-formoterol 200/6 [160/4.5] mcg DPI or pMDI (maximum total 12 inhalations in any day)" with "Step 1–2 (AIR-only): 1 inhalation as needed", "Step 3 MART: 1 inhalation twice (or once) daily plus 1 as needed", and "Step 4 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed" and "Step 5 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed". For adults ≥ 18 years: "Budesonide-formoterol 200/6 [160/4.5] or BDP-formoterol 100/6 mcg, pMDI or DPI (maximum total 12 inhalations in any day†)" with "Step 1–2 (AIR-only): 1 inhalation as needed", "Step 3 MART: 1 inhalation twice (or once) daily plus 1 as needed", "Step 4 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed", and "Step 5 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed". Administration guidance states "patients should take either 1 or 2 inhalations… whenever needed for symptom relief", they "do not need to wait a certain number of hours before taking more reliever doses… but in a single day, they should not take more than the maximum total number of inhalations shown below", and evidence of inhaler options notes "Most evidence for MART, and all evidence for AIR-only, is with budesonide-formoterol DPI, usually 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose)… and 100/6 mcg (80/4.5 mcg) delivered dose for MART in children 6–11 years. Beclometasone dipropionate (BDP)-formoterol 100/6 mcg (84.6/5.0) is also effective for MART in adults". The footnote adds, "GINA suggests that the maximum total dose in any day should be 12 inhalations" for BDP-formoterol and gives delivered doses "84.6/5 mcg for pMDI and 81.9/5 mcg for DPI".

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1176q46G]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Intermittent ICS use — background, scope, and key questions: Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages, and although intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, prior evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond expert consensus; in this update, given the range of options and the number of comparisons embedded in the three key questions for this priority topic, the Expert Panel made five recommendations, with most studies using comparative efficacy designs and with evidence insufficient to support recommendations for all of the comparators; additionally, the Expert Panel did not address the efficacy and safety of types of intermittent ICS treatment not mentioned in the key questions, specifically as-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA in Step 1 (intermittent asthma) or Steps 5 and 6 (severe asthma) treatment.

Individuals ages 12+ years — The terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler. Where formoterol is specified in the steps, it is because the evidence is based on studies specific to formoterol. In individuals ages 12 years and older with persistent allergic asthma in which there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, FeNO measurement is conditionally recommended as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessment. Bronchial thermoplasty was evaluated in Step 6. The outcome was a conditional recommendation against the therapy.

### The potential role of allergen immunotherapy in stepping down asthma treatment [^113kd77B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

For patients whose asthma is controlled and who have a low risk for future exacerbations, current guidelines recommend gradually stepping down pharmacotherapy to identify the lowest dose needed to maintain control. This review article will discuss the benefits and risks of step down in asthma management and the different strategies of achieving step down with particular focus on allergen immunotherapy (AIT). A literature search was conducted to identify studies that assessed the effect of AIT on asthma step down and evaluated this and asthma control as one of the outcomes. Six studies were identified: 2 subcutaneous and 4 sublingual AIT studies. Five studies assessed house dust mite-induced asthma, whereas 1 study focused on birch-induced seasonal asthma. Regarding house dust mite-induced asthma, the AIT studies reviewed suggest that individuals with moderate rather than mild asthma are the patients who are more likely to benefit from the addition of AIT for their asthma condition. The potential value of AIT is likely to be in enabling successful step down of the inhaled corticosteroid dose in Global Initiative for Asthma step 3 or 4. It is important to further explore this effect so that affected individuals can benefit from this treatment.

### Recent evidence for stepping down severe asthma therapies [^116psxWo]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Biologics have proven safe and effective for severe asthma. Their introduction has offered hope for patients and prescribers with a growing list of novel medications and indications. While 'step-up' indications for biologic initiation are well described in guidelines, 'step-down' strategy remains poorly understood and thus guidance is limited. In this opinion article we aim to focus on recent practice changing evidence for stepping-down severe asthma management, tools for the assessment of biologic efficacy, propose a framework for the step-down of biologic and nonbiologic therapies and suggest topics of interest for future research.

Recent Findings

Clinical tools have been developed to aid in assessing biologic response. Some patients experience marked improvement and may enter a period of clinical remission or even complete remission. Following positive response, add-on therapy may safely be approached for taper or withdrawal.

Summary

There is limited consensus but growing evidence for stepping-down therapies in patients who achieve clinical response and/or remission after biologic initiation. Further structured guidance would benefit clinicians who face clinical uncertainty when deciding to step-down therapy in patients with well controlled asthma.

### Advances in asthma in 2016: designing individualized approaches to management [^114Q8vRE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

In this year's Advances in Asthma review, we discuss viral infections in asthmatic patients and potential therapeutic agents, the microbiome, novel genetic associations with asthma, air quality and climate effects on asthma, exposures during development and long-term sequelae of childhood asthma, patient-centered outcomes research, and precision medicine. In addition, we discuss application of biomarkers to precision medicine and new information on asthma medications. New evidence indicates that rhinovirus-triggered asthma exacerbations become more severe as the degree of sensitization to dust mite and mouse increase. The 2 biggest drivers of asthma severity are an allergy pathway starting with allergic sensitization and an environmental tobacco smoke pathway. In addition, allergic sensitization and blood eosinophils can be used to select medications for management of early asthma in young children. These current findings, among others covered in this review, represent significant steps toward addressing rapidly advancing areas of knowledge that have implications for asthma management.

Asthma — single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) with budesonide-formoterol versus higher-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in individuals aged 12 years and older — was evaluated in three large randomized controlled trials (total N = 4662) where SMART used daily budesonide-formoterol 160/9 to 320/9 μg with up to 10 rescue puffs (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol) compared with daily budesonide 320 to 640 μg plus short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), showing a 51% RR reduction in exacerbations in one trial and 35% and 43% in two others, and collectively an RR of 0.6 (range, 0.53–0.68) favoring SMART (high certainty of evidence); validated asthma outcomes were not reported, but individual asthma control measures significantly favored SMART, and overall corticosteroid exposure was lower with SMART (two- to fourfold less for inhaled ICS treatments).

Asthma guideline background and priority topics: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) created the program in 1989, and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) published its first Expert Panel Report (EPR) in 1991, with EPR-2 in 1997, an update in 2002, and EPR-3 in 2007. In 2014, a working group determined that a focused update on "six priority topics was warranted", identifying for systematic review: (1) fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) in diagnosis, medication selection, and monitoring; (2) remediation of indoor allergens (e.g., house-dust mites [HDMs]); (3) adjustable medication dosing; (4) long-acting antimuscarinic agents as add-ons to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs); (5) immunotherapy and asthma management; and (6) bronchial thermoplasty (BT) in adult severe asthma.

Asthma Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic

Most studies have shown that patients with asthma are not at increased risk of acquiring coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or of severe COVID-19. Advise patients to continue taking their prescribed asthma medicines, including inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), alone or in combination with a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA), and biological therapy for severe asthma.

Avoid the use of nebulizers, where possible, because of the risk of viral transmission. Within healthcare facilities, follow local infection control procedures and COVID-19 testing recommendations if spirometry, peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement, or other aerosol-generating procedures (e.g. oxygen therapy, sputum induction, ventilation) are needed.

GINA recommends COVID-19 vaccination for people with asthma, with usual precautions including checking for allergies to vaccine ingredients. Anaphylaxis to foods, insect venom, or medications is not a contraindication. Consider giving the first dose of asthma biologic therapy on a different day from the COVID-19 vaccine.

After 25 years of GINA, we need an overarching strategy. The resounding changes in GINA 2019 should be accompanied by another major change in general strategy of asthma management. The concept of control asthma and step strategy was established in 1997 by GINA; but still there is a great gap between GINA objectives and outcomes. O'Byrne and colleagues proposed a continuum of care approach; where patient-adjusted therapy would comprise both a controller and reliever (usually ICS/fast-acting LABA) in a single inhaler. We use a similar approach in our asthma centre.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Asthma

Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older

The overall safety data in adults and adolescents are based upon 10 active- and placebo-controlled clinical trials in which 3393 patients ages 12 years and older (2052 females and 1341 males) with asthma of varying severity were treated with SYMBICORT 80/4.5 or 160/4.5 taken 2 inhalations once or twice daily for 12 to 52 weeks. In these trials, the patients on SYMBICORT had a mean age of 38 years and were predominantly Caucasian (82%).

The incidence of common adverse events in Table 2 below is based upon pooled data from three 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in which 401 adult and adolescent patients (148 males and 253 females) age 12 years and older were treated with 2 inhalations of SYMBICORT 80/4.5 or SYMBICORT 160/4.5 twice daily. The SYMBICORT group was composed of mostly Caucasian (84%) patients with a mean age of 38 years, and a mean percent predicted FEV1at baseline of 76 and 68 for the 80/4.5 mcg and 160/4.5 mcg treatment groups, respectively. Control arms for comparison included 2 inhalations of budesonide HFA metered dose inhaler (MDI) 80 or 160 mcg, formoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) 4.5 mcg, or placebo (MDI and DPI) twice daily. Table 2 includes all adverse events that occurred at an incidence of > 3% in any one SYMBICORT group and more commonly than in the placebo group with twice-daily dosing. In considering these data, the increased average duration of patient exposure for SYMBICORT patients should be taken into account, as incidences are not adjusted for an imbalance of treatment duration.

### A young child with a history of wheeze [^115a5aec]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Prevention in children with frequent wheezy episodes or a higher probability of asthma

The indication for treatment with ICS (step 2 in GINA; see Fig. 1) is based on the frequency and severity of symptoms, and the probability that the child has asthma. The older the child, the presence of a multiple trigger wheeze and the presence of a positive specific IgE test to house dust mite, cat or dog allergens (or a positive family history for asthma and /or allergy) will increase the chances of a response to regular treatment with an ICS.

Fig. 1
Stepwise approach to pharmacotherapy in children under 5 years. Reproduced with permission from the GINA guidelines.

Treatment with ICS should be started as a carefully monitored diagnostic trial, and the clinical effect evaluated after 4–8 weeks. If the child responds well to a treatment with ICS, it is recommended, in discussion with parents, to reduce and ultimately withdraw the medication to exclude natural resolution of symptoms. If symptoms recur during or after withdrawal, restart treatment and consider on-going treatment. If there is no response to treatment, the ICS should be stopped and alternative diagnoses should be reconsidered.

The use of ICS in children with viral induced episodes of wheeze, without symptoms or triggers in between episodes, is more controversial. The effect on symptoms is at best limited, but a recent meta-analysis has shown that short-term (7–10 days) high dose ICS, starting at the first sign of an URTI, may reduce the risk of severe exacerbations.

A follow-up consultation in general practice is essential when inhalation medication is started in any child irrespective of the indication. During this review, the parents can be informed about the short and long-term prognosis and the action to take during a subsequent episode. Prevention of overtreatment of children with ICS and the (in)correct labelling of wheeze as asthma is as important as overlooking an asthma diagnosis and not treating with ICS. Until an asthma diagnosis is confirmed by a physician, requests for repeat prescriptions of SABA or ICS in preschool children should trigger a review of current status.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114SnmZn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

The Expert Panel conditionally recommends SCIT as an adjunctive treatment for individuals who have demonstrated allergic sensitization and evidence of worsening asthma symptoms after exposure to the relevant antigen or antigens either acutely (eg, allergy to pets) or on a seasonal basis (eg, allergy to grass or ragweed) or a chronic basis (eg, allergy to dust mites). Individuals who place a high value on possible small improvements in quality of life, symptom control, and a reduction in long-term and/or quick-relief medication use and a lower value on the risk of systemic reactions of wide-ranging severity might consider SCIT as adjunct therapy.

For individuals with allergic asthma, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions to implement SCIT:
Clinicians can consider SCIT for adults and children (at a developmental stage at which allergic sensitization can be demonstrated) with allergic asthma, a history compatible with a temporal association of worsening symptoms with exposure to aeroallergens, and testing (as described previously) that confirms this sensitization.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is not well controlled by their current medical therapy and the treating clinician considers allergen exposure to be a significant contributor to this lack of asthma control. However, clinicians should attempt to optimize asthma control before initiating SCIT to reduce the potential for harm.
Clinicians can consider SCIT for individuals whose asthma is well controlled by their current therapy when these individuals and/or their clinicians want to reduce the individuals' medication burden.
In addition to assessing whether an individual with allergic asthma has an appropriate history before considering SCIT, clinicians must formally assess allergic sensitization using either immediate hypersensitivity skin testing or in vitro antigen-specific IgE antibody testing. This evaluation needs to be performed by a trained health care professional skilled in proper testing and result interpretation. The need for these types of specialty evaluations, as with the need for many diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions, may limit access to care, depending on local availability of these tests and the patient's health insurance coverage of testing.
Clinicians should not administer SCIT in individuals with severe asthma. Furthermore, clinicians should not initiate, increase, or administer maintenance SCIT doses while individuals have asthma symptoms. These individuals should achieve optimal asthma control before beginning SCIT to minimize the harms (systemic reactions) associated with SCIT, which tend to intensify as baseline asthma severity increases.
The presence of allergic sensitization is necessary but not sufficient to define the allergic asthma phenotype. A positive test result may not be associated with asthma control over time but might, instead, reflect sensitivity in a different organ (eg, the nose in allergic rhinitis).
Allergen exposure could be the only triggering mechanism for allergic asthma symptoms, or it could be just one triggering factor for an individual, and another factor or factors (eg, respiratory tract infections, irritant exposure, or exercise) might also play a role in triggering allergic asthma symptoms. Because of the heterogeneous nature of allergic asthma, determining the precise efficacy of immunotherapy in reducing the allergic component of an individual's asthma can be difficult.
Clinicians should administer SCIT in their offices and provide direct supervision because of the risk of systemic reactions. Such reactions can include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported.
Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home.
Because clinicians should administer SCIT with direct supervision, personnel with appropriate training should prepare and administer injections for each individual's dosing schedule, from the build-up to the maintenance phase. Equipment and personnel should be available to treat serious anaphylactic reactions.
One of the potential benefits of SCIT is its immunomodulatory effects, which can reduce the allergic inflammatory response in various tissues. Thus, SCIT has the potential to be disease-modifying and to reduce the clinical expression or severity of asthma over time.
Before administering each SCIT injection, clinicians should assess individuals with asthma for worsened asthma symptoms that suggest recent loss of asthma control. Physicians should consider withholding SCIT injections temporarily in patients whose asthma symptoms have worsened until their asthma control is restored.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma who are considering SCIT that this treatment has the potential to reduce asthma symptoms and the severity of disease over time. Individuals need to come to their doctor's office for SCIT because of the associated risk of systemic reactions. Local and systemic reactions of SCIT include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving the skin (urticaria), respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension and arrhythmias). Although rare, deaths after injections have been reported. Individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home. Before initiating immunotherapy, clinicians must review with the individual who has asthma the travel arrangements and time needed to travel to and from the clinic as well as the requirement for at least a 30minute observational period after each injection. These requirements may complicate compliance. Missed appointments due to scheduling problems are a safety and an efficacy concern because they may increase the likelihood of local and systemic reactions. Missed appointments can also complicate the ability to reach a maintenance dosing regimen that maximizes therapeutic benefit. Delayed systemic reactions (those occurring more than 30 minutes after injection) occur in approximately 15% of individuals after injection. The Expert Panel recommends that individuals who have had previous clinically significant reactions to immunotherapy ideally should have injectable epinephrine and carry it on their person to and from the clinic on the day of their injection.

### A comparison of budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy versus conventional best practice in asthma management in Spain [^1112sYEL]. The Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the effectiveness and safety in a real-life setting of budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) Maintenance And Reliever Therapy® (Symbicort SMART®), a simplified management approach with one inhaler, compared with conventional best practice (CBP) with multiple inhalers in patients with persistent asthma.

Design

Open-label randomized controlled parallel-group trial, 6-month treatment.

Participants

A total of 654 adult patients, with persistent asthma receiving treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), either alone or in conjunction with long-acting β(2)-agonist.

Main Outcome Measures

Time to first severe asthma exacerbation and number of severe asthma exacerbations.

Results

No difference between groups was seen in time to first severe exacerbation (p = .2974). Exacerbation rates were low in both groups. A total of 22 patients in the Symbicort SMART group experienced a total of 24 severe asthma exacerbations, and 31 patients in the CBP group experienced a total of 34 severe asthma exacerbations (annual rate 0.16 vs. 0.22, p = .2869). The mean daily dose of ICS expressed in beclomethasone dipropionate equivalent was significantly lower in the Symbicort SMART group (including as-needed use) versus the CBP group (799 μg vs.1184 μg; p < .001). Mean scores in Asthma Control Questionnaire, five-question version, improved significantly in the SMART group compared with the CBP group (p = .0292). Symbicort SMART and CBP were equally well tolerated. The mean drug cost per patient per 6 months was lower for the patients in the SMART group compared with patients receiving CBP (€295.32 vs. €387.98, p < .0001).

Conclusions

A simplified regimen using budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (Symbicort SMART) was at least as effective at improving clinical control compared with CBP with a significantly lower ICS dose and lower drug costs.

14.1 Asthma

Patients with asthma 12 years of age and older

In two clinical studies comparing SYMBICORT with the individual components, improvements in most efficacy end points were greater with SYMBICORT than with the use of either budesonide or formoterol alone. In addition, one clinical study showed similar results between SYMBICORT and the concurrent use of budesonide and formoterol at corresponding doses from separate inhalers.

The safety and efficacy of SYMBICORT were demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled US clinical studies involving 1076 patients 12 years of age and older. Fixed SYMBICORT dosages of 160/9 mcg, and 320/9 mcg twice daily (each dose administered as 2 inhalations of the 80/4.5 and 160/4.5 mcg strengths, respectively) were compared with the monocomponents (budesonide and formoterol) and placebo to provide information about appropriate dosing to cover a range of asthma severity.

Study 1: Clinical Study with SYMBICORT 160/4.5

This 12-week study evaluated 596 patients 12 years of age and older by comparing SYMBICORT 160/4.5, the free combination of budesonide 160 mcg plus formoterol 4.5 mcg in separate inhalers, budesonide 160 mcg, formoterol 4.5 mcg, and placebo; each administered as 2 inhalations twice daily. The study included a 2-week run-in period with budesonide 80 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily. Most patients had moderate to severe asthma and were using moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids prior to study entry. Randomization was stratified by previous inhaled corticosteroid treatment (71.6% on moderate- and 28.4% on high-dose inhaled corticosteroid). Mean percent predicted FEV1at baseline was 68.1% and was similar across treatment groups. The co-primary efficacy end points were 12-hour-average post-dose FEV1at week 2, and pre-dose FEV1averaged over the course of the study. The study also required that patients who satisfied a predefined asthma-worsening criterion be withdrawn. The predefined asthma-worsening criteria were a clinically important decrease in FEV1or PEF, increase in rescue albuterol use, nighttime awakening due to asthma, emergency intervention or hospitalization due to asthma, or requirement for asthma medication not allowed by the protocol. For the criterion of nighttime awakening due to asthma, patients were allowed to remain in the study at the discretion of the investigator if none of the other asthma-worsening criteria were met. The percentage of patients withdrawing due to or meeting predefined criteria for worsening asthma is shown in Table 4.

Severe asthma with good response to Type 2-targeted therapy — step-down priorities and MART: In patients who have had a good asthma response to therapy targeting Type 2 inflammation, the highest priority is to reduce and cease maintenance oral corticosteroids, if used. Some previous randomized controlled trials included a rapid ICS dose reduction in patients on biological therapies in order to induce loss of asthma control, but this is not relevant to clinical practice. A randomized controlled trial in adult patients with a good response to benralizumab found that, with randomization to MART, most could have their maintenance ICS-formoterol dose slowly reduced; however, in patients with severe asthma, maintenance doses of ICS-formoterol should not be stopped, and the study provides support for use of MART in patients taking Step 5 treatment.

Track 2 — the reliever is as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS-SABA: This is an alternative approach if Track 1 is not possible, or if a patient's asthma is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations on their current therapy; before prescribing a regimen with SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their maintenance therapy, as otherwise they will be at higher risk of exacerbations. In Step 1, the patient takes a SABA and a low-dose ICS together for symptom relief when symptoms occur (in a combination inhaler, or with the ICS taken immediately after the SABA); in Steps 2–5, a SABA (alone) or combination ICS-SABA is used for symptom relief, and the patient takes maintenance ICS-containing medication regularly every day. If the reliever and maintenance medication are in different devices, make sure that the patient can use each inhaler correctly, and if changing between steps requires a different inhaler device, train the patient how to use the new inhaler.

Asthma — SMART versus same-dose inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta-agonist (ICS-LABA) controller therapy in ages 12 years and above — was evaluated in four blinded and two unblinded randomized controlled trials that collectively showed a 32% reduction in exacerbations with SMART (high certainty of evidence), with two studies using the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5-item (ACQ-5) showing clinically significant improvements; across three blinded studies (total 7555 participants) SMART used 160/9 or 320/9 μg budesonide-formoterol daily with up to 10 rescue puffs (total daily dose of 12 puffs or 54 μg formoterol) versus rescue SABA and significantly reduced exacerbations, while another blinded study (N = 1813) using beclomethasone-formoterol 100/6 μg two puffs daily with up to six rescue puffs (total daily dose of 48 μg formoterol) found severe exacerbations and systemic corticosteroid use were significantly lower with SMART but asthma control scores (ACQ-7) did not differ; an unblinded trial enrolled 2143 participants and reported a 20% RR decline with SMART using budesonide-formoterol 640/18 μg versus fluticasone/salmeterol 500/100 μg, and a reanalysis in 4,044 participants showed a 38% RR reduction.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115maK4T]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity — The current definition of asthma severity is based on retrospective assessment, after at least 2–3 months of asthma treatment, from the intensity of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. This definition is clinically useful for severe asthma, as it identifies patients whose asthma is relatively refractory to high intensity treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and who may benefit from additional treatment such as biologic therapy, and it is important to distinguish between severe asthma and asthma that is uncontrolled due to modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique and/or poor adherence. However, the retrospective definition of mild asthma as 'easy to treat' is less useful, and short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone actually increases the risk of exacerbations. 'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step 1 or Step 2 treatment, and GINA suggests that the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided in clinical practice if possible or, if used, qualified with a reminder that patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, and that this risk is substantially reduced with ICS-containing treatment.

In Step 1, the recommendation for as-needed, low-dose ICS–formoterol for adults and adolescents with symptoms less than twice per month is supported by indirect evidence for a large reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone. Extension of this recommendation to Step 1 was also supported by several important considerations:

- Historically, recommendations for as-needed SABA alone were never supported by evidence of long-term safety or efficacy; early guidelines had assumed that patients with mild asthma would not benefit from ICS and were concerned about its risks based on experience with OCS.
- The past distinction between eligibility for Step 1 and Step 2 treatment based on symptom frequency (e.g. ≤ or > 2 d/wk) was arbitrary, not evidence-based.
- The use of as-needed ICS–formoterol markedly reduces severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA, even in patients with SABA use less than or equal to two times per week at baseline (so-called intermittent asthma).
- A single day with more than two, more than four, more than six, or more than eight doses of as-needed budesonide–formoterol reduced the short-term (21-d) risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone (post hoc analysis). A similar effect was seen with ICS–formoterol MART in Steps 3–4.
- Even modest overuse of SABA (e.g. dispensing three or more albuterol canisters per year, i.e. average of ⩾1.6 puffs/d) is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and, in one study, higher asthma mortality.
- Even occasional short courses of OCS (e.g. four to five courses over 7 yr [i.e. less than one course per year]), are associated with significant short-term risks and cumulative risks of long-term adverse effects such as osteoporosis and diabetes.
- Regular, daily, low-dose ICS treatment is highly effective in reducing asthma symptoms and risk, including in patients with infrequent symptoms, but poor adherence to ICS is common, exposing patients to the risks of SABA-only treatment.
- As-needed budesonide–formoterol is well tolerated in mild asthma.
- Starting treatment with SABA alone trains the patient to regard it as their primary asthma treatment.

Adults and adolescents — referral and assessment for persistent symptoms: Patients of any age with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite correct inhaler technique and good adherence with Step 4 treatment should be referred to a specialist with expertise in investigation and management of severe asthma, if available (Evidence D), and the section heading specifies to refer for expert assessment, phenotyping, and add-on therapy. In severe asthma, randomized controlled trial populations may not reflect clinical practice, with a registry study finding that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy. If symptoms and/or exacerbations persist, additional treatment options may be considered, with a note to always check local eligibility and payer criteria.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112PV2iD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment tracks for adults and adolescents — Track 1, in which the reliever is low-dose ICS-formoterol, is the preferred approach recommended by GINA; when a patient at any step has asthma symptoms they use low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed for relief, and in Steps 3–5 they also take ICS-formoterol as regular daily treatment; this approach is preferred because it reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever, with similar symptom control, and because of the simplicity of needing only a single medication across treatment Steps 1–4; medications and doses for Track 1 include the maximum recommended total formoterol (with ICS) dose in any day for each formulation, and GINA suggests that the same maximum total daily dose should apply for beclometasone-formoterol. Track 2, in which the reliever is an ICS-SABA or SABA, is an alternative if Track 1 is not possible or if a patient is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations in the past year; in Step 1 the patient takes a SABA and a low-dose ICS together for symptom relief (in combination if available, or with the ICS taken immediately after the SABA), and in Steps 2–5 the reliever is a SABA or combination ICS-SABA; before considering a SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their ICS-containing treatment, as otherwise they would be at higher risk of exacerbations.

Initial ICS-containing medication from diagnosis — rationale and early use: ICS-containing treatment should be initiated when (or as soon as possible after) the diagnosis of asthma is made, and all patients should also be provided with a reliever inhaler for quick symptom relief, preferably an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR). GINA recommends ICS-containing medication from diagnosis for several reasons, including that as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reduces the risk of severe exacerbations and emergency department visits or hospitalizations by 65% compared with SABA-only treatment, starting treatment with SABA alone increases the risk of poor adherence when daily ICS is subsequently prescribed, early initiation of low-dose ICS leads to greater lung function improvement than if symptoms have been present for more than 2–4 years with higher ICS doses required and lower lung function achieved after this time, patients not taking ICS who experience a severe exacerbation have a greater long-term decline in lung function than those taking ICS, and for occupational asthma, early removal from exposure plus early ICS-containing treatment increases the probability of symptom resolution and improvements in lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness.

### Add-on therapy options in asthma not adequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids: a comprehensive review [^111znqBE]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of current asthma management and should be used in all patients with persistent asthma. Many patients with persistent asthma can be controlled with regular ICS. However, a considerable proportion of patients treated with ICS remain symptomatic, despite the use of low to moderate doses (doses defined according to the ATS classification for adults: beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 200–1000 μg/d, budesonide 200–800 μg/d or fluticasone propionate (FP) 100–500 μg/d) of ICS. Based on the differences in potency and pharmacokinetics the doses could also be defined differently. Recent treatment guidelines classify these patients as having moderate to severe persistent asthma (steps 3 and 4). According to the recent guideline the typical clinical features of step 3 asthma include symptoms daily, nocturnal symptoms at least once a week, exacerbations that may affect activity or sleep, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 60–80% of predicted or peak expiratory flow (PEF) between 60 and 80% of the personal best reading. Daily rescue therapy is usually needed. Typical findings include low values of PEF or FEV 1, a marked variation in daily PEF recordings and/or a significant response to bronchodilators. Thus, asthma is not adequately controlled, and the treatment needs to be optimized.

Asthma is characterized by persistent airway inflammation, which is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and variable airflow obstruction, which accounts for the majority of symptoms experienced by asthmatic patients. Allergen sensitization and inhalation causes airway inflammation, and is likely important in the initiation and persistence of asthma in more than 50% of patients, and while allergen avoidance (or avoidance of other initiating factors, such as occupational sensitizers) can help some patients, it is often difficult to achieve. For this reason, pharmacologic treatment to reduce airway inflammation is currently the cornerstone of therapy for most individuals who have asthma.

It adds, "We suggest that in clinical practice, the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided if possible", and advises explaining that patients with infrequent or mild symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone and that "this risk is reduced by half to two-thirds with low-dose ICS or with as-needed low-dose ICS formoterol". It further directs, "Ensure that you prescribe ICS-containing therapy to reduce the patient's risk of severe exacerbations", clarifies that "'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive", and notes that guidance about low-intensity treatment suitability is in "Step 1 and 2".

### Evaluation of inhaler technique and achievement and maintenance of mastery of budesonide / formoterol spiromax® compared with budesonide / formoterol turbuhaler® in adult patients with asthma: the easy low instruction over time (ELIOT) study [^114bVWEr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Incorrect inhaler technique is a common cause of poor asthma control. This two-phase pragmatic study evaluated inhaler technique mastery and maintenance of mastery with DuoResp® (budesonide-formoterol [BF]) Spiromax® compared with Symbicort® (BF) Turbuhaler® in patients with asthma who were receiving inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting β2-agonists.

Methods

In the initial cross-sectional phase, patients were randomized to a 6-step training protocol with empty Spiromax and Turbuhaler devices. Patients initially demonstrating ≥ 1 error with their current device, and then achieving mastery with both Spiromax and Turbuhaler (absence of healthcare professional [HCP]-observed errors), were eligible for the longitudinal phase. In the longitudinal phase, patients were randomized to BF Spiromax or BF Turbuhaler. Co-primary endpoints were the proportions of patients achieving device mastery after three training steps and maintaining device mastery (defined as the absence of HCP-observed errors after 12 weeks of use). Secondary endpoints included device preference, handling error frequency, asthma control, and safety. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of device mastery by an independent external expert reviewing video recordings of a subset of patients.

Results

Four hundred ninety-three patients participated in the cross-sectional phase, and 395 patients in the longitudinal phase. In the cross-sectional phase, more patients achieved device mastery after three training steps with Spiromax (94%) versus Turbuhaler (87%) (odds ratio [OR] 3.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.05–6.95], p < 0.001). Longitudinal phase data indicated that the odds of maintaining inhaler mastery at 12 weeks were not statistically significantly different (OR 1.26 [95% CI 0.80–1.98], p = 0.316). Asthma control improved in both groups with no significant difference between groups (OR 0.11 [95% CI -0.09–0.30]). An exploratory analysis indicated that the odds of maintaining independent expert-verified device mastery were significantly higher for patients using Spiromax versus Turbuhaler (OR 2.11 [95% CI 1.25–3.54]).

Conclusions

In the cross-sectional phase, a significantly greater proportion of patients using Spiromax versus Turbuhaler achieved device mastery; in the longitudinal phase, the proportion of patients maintaining device mastery with Spiromax versus Turbuhaler was similar. An exploratory independent expert-verified analysis found Spiromax was associated with higher levels of device mastery after 12 weeks. Asthma control was improved by treatment with both BF Spiromax and BF Turbuhaler.

Choosing Initial Asthma Treatment

When choosing the track and starting step for initial treatment (Boxes 3-4A–3-4D in Reference), consider not only the patient's current symptoms and risk of exacerbations but also practical issues, including medication access (availability and cost), inhaler technique, likely adherence, and patient preferences. Before starting, record evidence for the diagnosis of asthma, the patient's symptom control and risk factors, including lung function, and check that they can use the inhaler correctly. Provide education and skills training, and schedule a follow-up visit to assess the response (Figure 2).

During ongoing treatment, medication may be adjusted up or down within the same track (i.e. with the same reliever) or may be switched between tracks, depending on patient needs. However, for patients prescribed as-needed-only ICS–formoterol (Steps 1–2) or MART (Steps 3–5), beware of risks to the patient if their ICS–formoterol is switched without consultation (e.g. in health systems where medication substitution by pharmacists or nurses is permitted) to a combination nonformoterol ICS–LABA, as these are not suitable for as-needed use.

Stepping Down to Find the Minimum Effective Dose

When good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down to find the lowest effective step. Do not completely withdraw ICS, except if needed temporarily while confirming the diagnosis of asthma. Adults and adolescents with well-controlled asthma while on daily low-dose controller therapy can step down to either as-needed ICS–formoterol or to as-needed ICS + SABA taken together (Box 3–7 in Reference).

Stepping Up if Asthma Remains Uncontrolled

Before considering any sustained step up, first check inhaler technique, adherence, persistent allergen exposure and comorbidities.

There is no evidence to support specific recommendations about when to increase from as-needed-only ICS–formoterol in Steps 1–2 to Step 3 MART by adding maintenance ICS–formoterol, but it should be prompted by factors such as ongoing use of as-needed ICS–formoterol on most days of the week or further exacerbations.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^114rxUki]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 6: Consider the use of AIR, MART (formerly known as SMART) or ICS-SABA quick reliever regimens for treating asthma and exacerbations to address underlying inflammation as well as provide bronchodilation

For patients requiring maintenance treatment (GINA Steps 3–5), maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), formerly known as single-inhaler maintenance-and-reliever therapy (SMART), is referred to by the GINA report as a "treatment regimen in which the patient uses an ICS-formoterol inhaler every day (maintenance dose), and also uses the same medication as needed for relief of asthma symptoms (reliever doses)". The clinical rationale for recommending MART, or a combination of ICS and fast-acting bronchodilator, is based on the increased risk of severe or fatal exacerbations with SABA-only use, as well as evidence showing a lower frequency of exacerbations with ICS + formoterol as maintenance and rescue therapy.

For patients only requiring reliever treatment (Steps 1–2), GINA recommends the use of AIR, or low dose as-needed ICS-formoterol, as the preferred treatment (Track 1).

Use of ICS along with a SABA for rescue therapy can reduce exacerbations compared to SABA-only rescue therapy. In the PREPARE trial, adults with moderate-to-severe asthma who were instructed to take ICS every time they used rescue therapy had a lower annualized rate of severe exacerbations than those who weren't instructed to take ICS with rescue therapy. In the MANDALA randomized, double-blind trial, adults and adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma receiving albuterol-budesonide as rescue therapy had a significantly lower risk of severe asthma exacerbations than those receiving albuterol alone. Of note, albuterol-budesonide is approved for the as-needed treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction and to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients with asthma 18 years of age and older in the United States.

### American college of allergy, asthma and immunology members' preferred steps 1 to 3 asthma maintenance and reliever therapy and incomplete insurance coverage indicated as main practice hurdle [^117FWzQV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

New asthma guidelines (GINA, 2022; NAEPP EPR-4, 2020) include considerable changes in treatment recommendations, specifically regarding anti-inflammatory rescue and Single MAintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART).

Objective

To explore American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology members' preferred treatment and perceived hurdles.

Methods

A survey (SurveyMonkey) regarding steps 1 to 3 asthma therapy was e-mailed to American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology members.

Results

The allergists completed 147 surveys (46% with > 20 years of experience; 98% from United States; 29% academic, 75% [also] private practice). In addition, 69% follow the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and 81% the Global Initiative for Asthma recommendations. Of 147 allergists, 117 (80%) indicated correctly what SMART strategy is; 21%/36%/50%/39% would use SMART in step 3 treatment of a below 5-year-old/5- to 11-year-old/12- to 65-year-old/above 65-year-old patient, respectively. In this group, 11% to 14% incorrectly chose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus salmeterol and 9% ICS plus vilanterol for SMART. In a 4-year-old needing step 1 therapy (N = 129), 55% of the respondents would add anti-inflammatory therapy; for step 2 treatment, most would prescribe ICS 100 to 200 µg budesonide equivalent daily; in step 3, 49% would prescribe ICS plus long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). In a 7-year-old needing step 1 treatment (N = 134), 40% would prescribe only short-acting beta-agonist; in step 3, 45% would institute SMART strategy, but only 8 of 135 (6%) chose very-low dose ICS plus formoterol (as recommended in Global Initiative for Asthma); most (39%) use low-dose ICS plus formoterol. As for rescue therapy, 59% is now instituting some form of anti-inflammatory rescue. Finally, in a 25-year-old patient (N = 144): in step 1, 39% would prescribe exclusively short-acting beta-agonist; in step 2, 4% only anti-inflammatory rescue and the rest prescribes ICS maintenance; one-third begins SMART strategy at step 2 and 50% in step 3. Major hurdles for prescribing one's preferred strategy included incomplete insurance coverage, insurance not approving more than one canister of ICS-formoterol per month, and cost.

Conclusion

Asthma therapy varies among physicians, with respondents suggesting underutilization of the recommended anti-inflammatory rescue and SMART therapy. A major hurdle is lack of insurance coverage of medication in line with the guidelines.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115v8vcr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

For individuals with asthma who have allergy symptoms or a test result suggesting that they are allergic to dust mites, the Expert Panel recommends using multicomponent interventions to reduce dust mite levels in the home and improve asthma outcomes. Use of pillow and mattress covers alone does not improve asthma outcomes.

Overall, the studies of allergen mitigation strategies provide low certainty of evidence that these strategies are beneficial for key asthma outcomes. Therefore, the Expert Panel recommends tailored allergen intervention strategies only for individuals with asthma who are exposed to these specific allergens and have either symptoms based on clinical history or an allergy to these substances based on allergy testing.

Based on current data on the use of a variety of single-component and multicomponent strategies to reduce exposure to allergens, the Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementing allergen exposure reduction strategies:
Allergen mitigation strategies can be used in individuals of all ages with asthma of all levels of severity.
Clinicians need to tailor mitigation strategies to the individual based on their allergy symptoms, sensitization, and exposures. Clinicians should consider allergen testing when appropriate, before committing individuals to specific allergen mitigation strategies that may be burdensome. See Table IIIA for allergen-specific mitigation interventions addressed in the systematic review report. Table IIIB summarizes the certainty of evidence on various allergen mitigation interventions.
The Expert Panel recognizes the existing inequities in access to specialists and allergen testing. The panel therefore advises clinicians to, at a minimum, take a clinical history of symptoms and exposures for all individuals with asthma to help determine the need for allergen mitigation.
Allergy testing (with a skin prick or allergen-specific IgE test) may have false-positive and false-negative results, and certain allergens (eg, dust) may also act as irritants. For an individual whose symptoms worsen on exposure to specific aeroallergens, the Expert Panel recommends that the clinician consider mitigating that aeroallergen even if the individual's test result is negative.
Some of the interventions examined provide no or low certainty of evidence about their efficacy in improving asthma outcomes (including exacerbations, quality of life, asthma control, and symptoms). The Expert Panel recognizes that some of the interventions, especially integrated pest management and mold mitigation, may have broader public health benefits. However, these interventions do not replace routine good practices, including regular and frequent house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials.
Some people are allergic to dander (flakes of skin) or saliva from pets. The few studies on pet removal have had inconclusive results. However, if an individual with asthma experiences symptoms around a pet, the individual should consider removing the pet from the home, keeping the pet outdoors, or, if neither of these options is feasible, keeping the pet out of commonly used rooms. Testing for sensitization to pets may be particularly worthwhile for those with chronic or uncontrolled symptoms and might help support what can be a difficult decision to remove a pet from the home.
Some cleaning and integrated pest management interventions may trigger asthma and/or be hazardous. Individuals with asthma need to balance the potential benefits and harms of interventions before implementing them.
If an individual with asthma has sensitization to an allergen on skin prick testing and is exposed to that allergen but has no objective evidence of worsened disease control and denies having symptoms, chronic exposure could have led to the development of clinical tolerance to that allergen in that environment. Allergen-specific mitigation strategies could adversely modify this established balanced relationship between the individual and the environment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians need to consider the complexity of the patient population and the limitations of the evidence identified. Clinicians may also find it helpful to consider the severity of a patient's asthma, the small benefit, and the extent of previous symptoms and exacerbations when recommending allergen mitigation interventions. Allergen mitigation interventions may be expensive or difficult for patients to use or maintain. Clinicians should consider the cost implications of certain interventions, especially among those with limited financial resources, and assess the magnitude of the potential value of an intervention in improving an individual's asthma outcomes.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

Management of Severe Asthma

Refer patients to support services, where available, to help them deal with the heavy physical, emotional, social and financial burden of severe asthma and its treatment.

In Step 5, recommended add-on options include long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (tiotropium ⩾6 yr, triple therapy with ICS–LABA–LAMA ⩾18 yr). Adding LAMA provided modest improvement in lung function but not symptom control, and exacerbations were reduced in some studies. Step 4 MART with ICS–formoterol should be tried before considering add-on LAMA; as-needed ICS–formoterol can be continued as the reliever for patients prescribed ICS–formoterol–LAMA, but for patients prescribed an ICS–LABA–LAMA with nonformoterol LABA, the appropriate reliever is SABA. After specialist referral, add-on, low-dose azithromycin is another option for reducing exacerbations, but risks of antibiotic resistance and prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) on electrocardiography must be considered. Sputum-guided adjustment of the ICS dose improves outcomes in moderate-to-severe asthma but is not widely available, and the optimal frequency of sputum assessment is not known.

With add-on biologic therapies for severe eosinophilic asthma (benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab) and severe allergic asthma (dupilumab, omalizumab) the main benefits are substantial reduction in severe exacerbations and reduced OCS exposure. No head-to-head studies are available, but typical eligibility criteria for each class, and predictors of good response, are found in the GINA pocket guide decision tree.

Maintenance OCS treatment should be avoided, wherever possible, because of its serious long-term side effects.

At follow-up, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options. For patients who respond to add-on therapy, reevaluate the need for other therapies every 3–4 months, but do not completely stop ICS.

Continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with primary care and consider the patient's social and emotional needs. Arrange multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available. Invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps, including comparison of biologic therapy options and positioning of bronchial thermoplasty.

### Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (Symbicort) [^115niqzd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.8 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression

Budesonide, a component of SYMBICORT, will often help control asthma and COPD symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of SYMBICORT in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose.

Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with SYMBICORT should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.

It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of SYMBICORT should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms.

5.9 Drug Interactions With Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of SYMBICORT with ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms

As with other inhaled medications, SYMBICORT can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with SYMBICORT, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator, SYMBICORT should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted.

5.11 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of SYMBICORT, as demonstrated by cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, and bronchospasm.

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the preferred Step 4 therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. The recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA along with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control. However, individuals whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up their treatment to a higher step of therapy.

In individuals aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, combination ICS-formoterol used daily and intermittently is more beneficial than an increase in the daily ICS dose if they are already taking combination ICS-LABA (and as needed SABA). The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol for individuals aged 12 years and older:
This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older.
Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily (depending on asthma severity and ICS dose in the ICS-formoterol preparation). The additional rescue dose is 1 to 2 puffs as needed for asthma symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
Clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy.
This therapy is appropriate for Step 4.
Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
For individuals aged 5 to 11 years, the evidence was insufficient to make a recommendation regarding SMART compared to higher-dose ICS-LABA. SMART with low- or medium-dose ICS therapy is preferred for children aged 5 to 11 years as opposed to same-, low-, or medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA as part of Step 3 and Step 4 therapy (Recommendation 12).
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that the major demonstrated benefits of combination ICS-formoterol used daily and as needed are reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits and in use of systemic corticosteroids. Clinicians should also inform individuals with asthma that studies found no difference in documented harms between this type of therapy and daily ICS-LABA. Studies showed that combination ICS-formoterol reduces exposure to corticosteroids, suggesting that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.

Asthma step-up therapy — uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique: Before stepping up, first confirm symptoms are due to asthma and address common problems, then in adults and adolescents the preferred Step 3 is Track 1 with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid–formoterol as maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), which reduces severe exacerbations versus maintenance inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA) with as-needed short-acting beta agonist (SABA); if needed, increase to medium dose (Step 4) by increasing maintenance inhalations. MART is also a preferred option at Steps 3 and 4 for children 6–11 years with a lower dose ICS-formoterol inhaler. ICS-formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking a different ICS-LABA maintenance treatment. Other Step 3 options (Track 2 and in children) include maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA or ICS-SABA; for children 6–11 years, medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, and try other controller options at the same step before stepping up.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pHAH1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations — definition, triggers, and risk identification — are episodes with a progressive increase in symptoms and progressive decrease in lung function sufficient to require a change in treatment; they may occur in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis or as the first presentation. Exacerbations usually occur due to external agents and/or poor adherence with ICS-containing medication, though a subset present acutely without known risk factors, and severe exacerbations can occur in patients with mild or well-controlled symptoms. Common triggers include viral respiratory infections, allergen exposure (including soybean dust) and fungal spores, food allergy, outdoor air pollution, seasonal changes or returning to school in fall, and poor adherence with ICS; epidemics have been reported with springtime thunderstorms with rye grass pollen or fungal spores and with environmental exposure to soybean dust. Some features are specifically associated with increased risk of asthma-related death, and patients with such risk factors should be encouraged to seek urgent medical care early in an exacerbation.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^112JUH55]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While some primary care clinics may have such expertise and resources, most do not. A number of UK coronial inquests on asthma deaths in children concluded that lack of access to continuity of care contributed to these deaths –.

The section of the GINA 2022 report on severe asthma diagnosis and management spans the roles of clinicians ranging from primary to tertiary care. Figure 7 summarizes the initial approach to these patients in a primary care setting. The full severe asthma recommendations (including for biologic therapy) as well as a summary booklet are also available on the GINA website.

While most patients' asthma can be managed in primary care, specialist opinion and treatment is strongly recommended (where available) in some situations:
when the diagnosis is difficult; specialists will have access to more sophisticated investigations and resources for confirming or excluding a diagnosis of asthma;
when there is failure to control symptoms despite adequate therapy, good adherence and good inhaler technique;
when severe asthma is suspected, for characterization of phenotype and for consideration of biologic therapy, depending on availability. For example, primary care physicians should consider referral for patients taking maintenance oral corticosteroids and those who have had two or more courses of oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations in the previous year, and those who have poorly controlled asthma despite step 4 treatment;
when symptoms suggest complications or comorbidities such as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis;
when occupational asthma is suspected;
when a patient has a history of a life-threatening asthma attack, or has confirmed or suspected food allergy as well as asthma.

Maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS-formoterol — use with add-on biologic therapy and step-down considerations: If a patient treated with medium-dose MART requires addition of biologic therapy, it is not logical to switch from MART to conventional ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, as this may increase the risk of exacerbations, and there is little evidence about initiating MART in patients receiving add-on treatment such as LAMA or biologic therapy. In one study of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma on benralizumab and high-dose ICS-LABA, participants were randomized to budesonide-formoterol as high dose maintenance plus as-needed SABA or as medium-dose MART with subsequent 8-weekly options for down-titration, and asthma remained stable after the switch from high-dose ICS-formoterol to medium-dose MART. Most patients randomized to MART were able to further reduce their ICS-formoterol dose, but there was an increase in FeNO and decrease in FEV1 in those who stepped down to as-needed-only ICS-formoterol, suggesting that maintenance doses of ICS-formoterol should not be stopped.

### A practical guide to implementing SMART in asthma management [^112iShCL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of a single inhaler containing the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and formoterol, a specific long-acting bronchodilator, for both maintenance and quick relief therapy (single maintenance and reliever therapy [SMART or MART]) is recommended by both the Global Initiative for Asthma and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee in steps 3 and 4 of asthma management. This article provides practical advice about implementing SMART in clinical practice based on evidence and clinical experience. Fundamental to SMART is that ICS-formoterol provides quick relief of asthma symptoms similar to that of short-acting β 2 -agonists such as albuterol, while reducing the risk for severe asthma exacerbations and at an overall lower ICS exposure. Most SMART clinical trials were in adults and adolescents (aged ≥ 12 years), using budesonide-formoterol 160/4.5 μg (delivered dose), one inhalation once or twice daily (step 3) and two inhalations twice daily (step 4). For both steps 3 and 4, patients take additional inhalations of budesonide-formoterol 160/4.5 μg, one inhalation whenever needed for symptom relief, up to a maximum for adults and adolescents of 12 total inhalations in any single day (delivering 54 μg formoterol). The efficacy and safety of SMART with budesonide-formoterol and beclometasone-formoterol have been confirmed, but other ICS-long-acting bronchodilator combinations have not been studied. The SMART regimen should be introduced with a careful explanation of its role in self-management, preferably with a customized written asthma action plan. The cost to patients and the availability of SMART treatment will depend on the prescribed dose and national or local payer agreements.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

5.3 Next‐generation care pathways for rhinitis and asthma using ICP

Although environmental factors play a major role in allergic diseases, no guideline or recommendation has included them. Based on the results of POLLAR (Impact of air pollution on asthma and rhinitis, 55 ARIA next‐generation ICPs will embed exposure to environmental factors like pollen and air pollution as well as novel approaches like artificial intelligence that have not been considered up to now. As there is increasing evidence that patients' choices and behaviors have an impact on the planet, this will be the background of ARIA Planetary Health. 117

Another interesting approach is to propose nonmedical approaches to control allergic symptoms. In all allergy textbooks, allergen avoidance is always required but most studies failed to prove efficacy for house dust mites. However, new data in stratified severe asthmatic patients are encouraging. 118 In cat allergy, a reduction in cat allergenicity can represent a revolution in the management of cat‐allergic patients and next‐generation care pathways should recognize the results of the studies when they will be completed. Whether a patient stratification is needed should be further established.

### Improving allergy management and treatment: a proposed algorithm and curriculum for prescribing allergen immunotherapy in the primary care setting [^111M1N1r]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The current primary healthcare landscape presents challenges in providing optimal care to AR patients. To complicate matters, there is a shortage of allergists and immunologists, limiting the availability of specialized care for the increasing number of patients who could benefit from AIT. Primary care practitioners often encounter and treat patients with allergies initially. However, gaps in their training and a lack of clear guidance have hindered the effective management of persistent symptoms, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Accordingly, there is a critical need to equip primary care providers with the corresponding training. This commentary proposes a lucid, comprehensive workflow model for primary care practitioners to address the challenges of treating mild to moderate respiratory allergies and using AIT to manage patients when appropriate. The model aims to guide practitioners through critical steps in patient assessment, pharmacotherapy approaches, and initiating or continuing AIT. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of developing medical education programs and bridging the gap between primary care and allergy-related treatment, which seeks to provide more effective and efficient care for AR patients.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115eCShA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol in individuals aged 4 years and older:
No patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma.
The studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations (see below) enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year. The results suggest that such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment.
ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily (depending on age, asthma severity, and ICS dose in the ICS formoterol preparation) and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms. The maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma or their caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that in studies, this intervention consistently reduced asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids. In addition, this intervention improved asthma control and quality of life in some studies. No differences have been documented in harms between this type of therapy and the comparators (ICS or ICS-LABA) in individuals aged 12 years and older. The reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. In children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals with asthma for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance. However, the additional cost of the medication may be offset by the decrease in exacerbations and the associated improvement in quality of life and reduction in costs to both the patient and the payer. A 1-month supply of ICS-formoterol medication that is sufficient for maintenance therapy may not last a month if the inhaler is used for reliever therapy as well. Providers, individuals with asthma, pharmacists, and payers need to be aware of this possibility and prescribe, plan, dispense, or provide coverage accordingly.

### Real-life prescribing of asthmatic treatments in UK general practice over time using 2014 BTS / SIGN steps [^113NfMkJ]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We designed this study of UK patients with asthma to understand how real-world patients are managed in primary care, including the distribution of patients across BTS/SIGN steps, how regularly patients move between steps and whether the treatment approach generally follows guideline recommendations. These guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to the management of asthma, with patients starting treatment at the step most appropriate to the initial severity of their disease. Stepping up and down is recommended as needed, with regular review of patients as treatment is stepped down. Therefore, we would expect that patients move up and down consecutive treatment steps, as dictated by regular review.

The majority of the treated study population (adults and children) were in steps 1 and 2. This is similar to previous studies, for example a recent analysis published by Bloom et al. Our step 1 patients were only treated with short-acting bronchodilators, but according to the treatment algorithm in the 2016 BTS/SIGN guidelines, patients should start treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) at an earlier stage. Although it was outside of the scope of this study, it would be interesting to follow this group of patients to see if, and how, prescribing patterns change based on these new recommendations.

### Factors guiding the choice of delivery device for inhaled corticosteroids in the long-term management of stable asthma and COPD: focus on budesonide [^11298i9T]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have become the mainstay of chronic controller therapy to treat airways inflammation in asthma and to reduce exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An array of ICSs are now available that are aerosolized by a range of delivery systems. Such devices include pressurized (or propellant) metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), pMDIs plus valved holding chambers or spacers, breath-actuated inhalers, and nebulizers. More recently, dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) were developed to help overcome problems of hand-breath coordination associated with pMDIs. The clinical benefit of ICSs therapy is determined by a complex interplay between the nature and severity of the disease, the type of drug and its formulation, and characteristics of the delivery device together with the patient's ability to use the device correctly. The ICSs budesonide is available by pMDI, DPI, and nebulizer-allowing the physician to select the best device for each individual patient. Indeed, the availability of budesonide in three different delivery systems allows versatility for the prescribing physician and provides continuity of drug therapy for younger patients who may remain on the same ICSs as they mature.

Assess control and follow-up — before stepping therapy, "First check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions". If control is inadequate, "Step up if needed; reassess in 2–6 weeks", and if control is maintained, "Step down if possible (if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months)".
