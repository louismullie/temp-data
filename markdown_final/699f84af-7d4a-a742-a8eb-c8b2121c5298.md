## Question

MOA of eliquis on clot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of action of Eliquis (apixaban) on blood clots. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and primary molecular target. Then, I should verify exactly how apixaban binds and inhibits factor Xa, including free versus clot-bound forms. Next, I will examine the downstream consequences on thrombin generation and thrombus formation. After that, I should review indirect effects on platelets and any modulation of fibrinolysis. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, including pharmacodynamics, monitoring, and reversal strategies, and I will double-check any points that seem uncertain as I go.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and target. Apixaban is a direct, selective inhibitor of activated factor Xa (FXa) and does not require antithrombin III as a cofactor, which distinguishes it from indirect FXa inhibitors like fondaparinux or low-molecular-weight heparins that act via antithrombin-dependent catalysis [^43850fe8] [^c8c54759].

> Wait, let me verify the binding characteristics. Apixaban binds directly to the active site of FXa, inhibiting both free FXa in plasma and FXa incorporated within the prothrombinase complex on phospholipid surfaces, and it also inhibits clot-bound FXa, which is clinically important because clot-bound FXa remains enzymatically active and contributes to thrombin generation at the thrombus interface [^43850fe8] [^5a463851].

> I will now examine the downstream effect. By blocking FXa, apixaban reduces the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, thereby decreasing thrombin generation and limiting fibrin formation and thrombus propagation; importantly, it does not directly lyse existing clots, so its action is preventive rather than thrombolytic, which I should explicitly state to avoid confusion [^43850fe8] [^5a463851].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about platelets. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but by reducing thrombin generation it indirectly attenuates thrombin-mediated platelet activation and aggregation, which contributes to its antithrombotic effect in arterial and venous contexts [^43850fe8] [^5a463851].

> Let me consider fibrinolysis, because I recall a potential indirect effect. Some data suggest that FXa inhibitors may modulate fibrinolysis via FXa fragments that enhance tissue plasminogen activator–mediated plasmin generation, but this profibrinolytic effect is not uniformly observed across studies and should be interpreted cautiously; I should double-check that this remains hypothesis-generating rather than a core mechanism of action [^42a1b9a6] [^e6c31206].

> Next, I should review pharmacodynamic consequences and monitoring. FXa inhibition by apixaban produces small, variable prolongations of PT, INR, and aPTT at therapeutic doses, making these assays unreliable for routine monitoring; instead, anti-FXa activity correlates with plasma concentration, though even anti-FXa assays are not routinely used clinically for apixaban management in most settings [^43850fe8] [^5a463851].

> I need to ensure I address reversal. For life-threatening bleeding or urgent surgery, andexanet alfa, a recombinant, catalytically inactive FXa variant, rapidly reverses apixaban by binding and sequestering FXa inhibitors and restoring thrombin generation; PCCs can be considered when andexanet is unavailable, but they are nonspecific and carry thrombotic risk, so I should emphasize andexanet as the preferred agent when accessible [^e23c767e] [^9eb77f30] [^be1992e9].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about clinical implications across indications. Apixaban's mechanism translates into efficacy for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with favorable safety profiles in large randomized trials, which aligns with guideline preferences for DOACs over VKAs in many scenarios, though I should confirm that mechanical heart valves and certain valvular diseases remain exceptions where VKAs are still indicated [^9f9c27c0] [^5c6e3fc2].

> In summary, I should confirm the mechanistic chain clearly: apixaban directly and selectively inhibits FXa without requiring antithrombin III, thereby reducing thrombin generation, limiting fibrin formation, and indirectly suppressing platelet activation; it does not dissolve existing clots, and its anticoagulant effect is reflected by reduced thrombin generation rather than clinically useful changes in PT/INR/aPTT, with andexanet alfa available for rapid reversal when needed [^43850fe8] [^5a463851] [^e23c767e].

---

Eliquis (apixaban) **prevents clots by directly and selectively inhibiting factor Xa** [^43850fe8], a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade [^5a463851]. This blocks the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, reducing thrombin generation and fibrin formation, and thereby halts clot growth and propagation [^43850fe8]. Unlike warfarin, apixaban does not require antithrombin III and inhibits both free and clot-bound factor Xa [^43850fe8], which sustains anticoagulation even within existing thrombi [^5a463851]. It does not directly affect platelets but indirectly reduces platelet activation by lowering thrombin [^43850fe8]. Apixaban has predictable pharmacokinetics, a rapid onset/offset, and minimal routine monitoring needs [^9f9c27c0]; in bleeding emergencies, andexanet alfa can reverse its effects [^e23c767e] [^9eb77f30].

---

## Molecular mechanism of action

- **Direct factor Xa inhibition**: Apixaban binds reversibly to the active site of factor Xa, blocking its enzymatic activity and preventing prothrombin activation to thrombin [^43850fe8] [^5a463851].

- **Inhibition of free and clot-bound factor Xa**: Apixaban inhibits both circulating and clot-associated factor Xa, maintaining anticoagulation within existing thrombi [^43850fe8] [^5a463851].

- **Independence from antithrombin III**: Unlike heparins, apixaban does not require antithrombin III, enabling predictable anticoagulation [^43850fe8] [^5a463851].

---

## Downstream effects on clot formation

By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban **reduces thrombin generation**, which decreases fibrin formation and stabilizes existing clots [^43850fe8]. Lower thrombin also diminishes platelet activation and aggregation, further limiting thrombus growth [^43850fe8]. Collectively, these effects reduce thrombus propagation and recurrence risk [^43850fe8].

---

## Pharmacokinetic properties influencing anticoagulant effect

- **Rapid onset and offset**: Peak effect occurs 3–4 hours after dosing, with a half-life of ~12 hours, supporting predictable anticoagulation [^7a740795].

- **Minimal routine monitoring**: Predictable PK/PD enables fixed dosing without routine coagulation monitoring [^9f9c27c0].

- **Reversal agent**: Andexanet alfa reverses apixaban in life-threatening bleeding or urgent surgery [^e23c767e] [^9eb77f30].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Venous thromboembolism**: Effective for treatment and prevention of DVT/PE, including extended therapy [^749e4bec] [^dcbed4ae].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Reduces stroke/systemic embolism risk in nonvalvular AF [^27291558] [^0c16dc13].

- **Bleeding risk**: Lower major bleeding than warfarin, including less intracranial hemorrhage [^0c16dc13] [^9f9c27c0].

---

Eliquis **prevents clots by directly inhibiting factor Xa**, reducing thrombin and fibrin formation, with predictable PK/PD and minimal monitoring; andexanet alfa provides rapid reversal when needed [^43850fe8] [^e23c767e].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom®Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans primarily during the apixaban adult development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF.

This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of ELIQUIS

There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received ELIQUIS.

Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initiation of a 30-minute PCC infusion, compared to 45 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-apixaban levels reaching a maximum (34%-51% increase over pre-apixaban levels) at 21 hours after initiating PCC and remained elevated (21%-27% increase) at the end of the study (69 hours after initiation of PCC). The clinical relevance of this increase in ETP is unknown.

14.3 Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

Efficacy and safety of ELIQUIS for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment was derived from the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT studies. Both studies were randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trials in patients with symptomatic proximal DVT and/or symptomatic PE. All key safety and efficacy endpoints were adjudicated in a blinded manner by an independent committee.

AMPLIFY

The primary objective of AMPLIFY was to determine whether ELIQUIS was noninferior to enoxaparin/warfarin for the incidence of recurrent VTE (venous thromboembolism) or VTE-related death. Patients with an objectively confirmed symptomatic DVT and/or PE were randomized to treatment with ELIQUIS 10 mg twice daily orally for 7 days followed by ELIQUIS 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months, or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily subcutaneously for at least 5 days (until INR ≥ 2) followed by warfarin (target INR range 2.0–3.0) orally for 6 months. Patients who required thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent, and patients with creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min, significant liver disease, an existing heart valve or atrial fibrillation, or active bleeding were excluded from the AMPLIFY study. Patients were allowed to enter the study with or without prior parenteral anticoagulation (up to 48 hours).

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

At the end of the ARISTOTLE study, warfarin patients who completed the study were generally maintained on a VKA with no interruption of anticoagulation. ELIQUIS patients who completed the study were generally switched to a VKA with a 2-day period of coadministration of ELIQUIS and VKA, so that some patients may not have been adequately anticoagulated after stopping ELIQUIS until attaining a stable and therapeutic INR. During the 30 days following the end of the study, there were 21 stroke or systemic embolism events in the 6791 patients (0.3%) in the ELIQUIS arm compared to 5 in the 6569 patients (0.1%) in the warfarin arm [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

AVERROES

In AVERROES, patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation thought not to be candidates for warfarin therapy were randomized to treatment with ELIQUIS 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients) or aspirin 81 to 324 mg once daily. The primary objective of the study was to determine if ELIQUIS was superior to aspirin for preventing the composite outcome of stroke or systemic embolism. AVERROES was stopped early on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis showing a significant reduction in stroke and systemic embolism for ELIQUIS compared to aspirin that was associated with a modest increase in major bleeding (Table 14) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdose of ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of ELIQUIS overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

Apixaban — pharmacology and interactions — Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor with an oral bioavailability of > 45%. In healthy men, plasma levels peak about 3 h after oral administration and clearance occurs with a terminal plasma half-life of 8 to 14 h. Elimination involves multiple pathways, including oxidative metabolism and renal and intestinal routes. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, are contraindicated because they increase plasma drug concentrations.

### How the direct oral anticoagulant apixaban affects thrombin generation parameters [^8cd4992a]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) targeting factor Xa and thus quenching thrombin generation and clot formation. However, little information is available on the influence that apixaban may have on the parameters of thrombin generation.

Methods

Aliquots of a pooled normal plasma have been added with increased concentrations of purified apixaban and were used to assess the degree of modification brought about by the drug on the basic tests of coagulation prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time (PT and APTT) and on thrombin generation parameters.

Results

The study shows that while apixaban has little effect on PT or APTT it does affect all the parameters of thrombin generation, including the lag-time (which is increased), the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and thrombin-peak (both decreased although to a different extent), and the velocity index (decreased). Interestingly, the above effects were more pronounced when the measurements were recorded in the presence of thrombomodulin, thus making the ratio (with/without thrombomodulin) to decrease consistently as a function of the apixaban concentrations.

Conclusions

These findings support the antithrombotic properties of apixaban and can help to understand the mechanism(s) of action of this drug. Thrombin generation could be used as a convenient laboratory tool to assess the anticoagulant activity of other drugs and to make between-DOAC comparison.

This commentary focuses on the status of oral anticoagulants, namely, warfarin and the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^784dae6a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) are anticoagulation pharmacotherapy used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. 1 DOACs are categorized into 2 main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (ie, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (ie, dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the following years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; ie, warfarin), or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. 2, 3, 4, 5 Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. 6 As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). 7

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome and challenging to integrate into everyday clinical use. The purpose of this review is to be a practical reference or algorithm for the busy clinician to navigate key aspects of effective DOAC prescribing, with an emphasis on addressing key situations where clinical uncertainty exists. This review will provide recommendations to address special clinical situations to include indications, use in specific comorbidities, monitoring parameters, transitioning to or off of therapy, drug interactions, and cost.

Emerging Therapeutic Approaches

"Anticoagulation" — the first line of treatment

The standard of care for VTE is the prevention of thrombus expansion or recurrence with anticoagulants. Recent guidelines of major international societies, e.g. CHEST, European Society of Cardiology, and American Society of Hematology, recommend DOACs over conventional anticoagulants (heparins and vitamin antagonists) for acute VTE. DOACs cause less bleeding, are easy to use because of their better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, and were recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in VTE patients (Figure 3). The risk of reoccurrence in patients who completed 3 months of anticoagulation after the first episode of unprovoked VTE is as high as 36% at 10 years if anticoagulation is discontinued. These anticoagulants have been beneficial for VTE patients to a large extent in preventing the propagation of acute thrombosis and VTE reoccurrence, but bleeding remains a serious concern.

Figure 3

(A) The light green boxes represent the timeline for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and the red box (within the light green box) represents the timeline for the promising agents in clinical trials internationally specifically for venous thromboembolism. The DOACs timeline represents the approval year for specific brand names such as dabigatran (a thrombin inhibitor, Pradaxa, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals), and the inhibitors of factor X including Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc), Apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, Inc) and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Daiichi Sankyo Inc) specifically for VTE (e.g. based on the results of clinical trials in hip or knee arthroplasty patients or acutely ill medical patients). Factor XI inhibition is a novel anticoagulation strategy in advanced clinical trials (B) Thrombolytic agents including streptokinase, urokinase, and r-tPA were first approved by the FDA several decades ago. r-tPA remains the preferred thrombolytic agent for clinical use in VTE management. The limited use of streptokinase, a thrombolytic agent of bacterial origin, is still reported in developing countries. Monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the antifibrinolytic function of alpha2-antiplasmin (α2AP) are currently in phase 2 trials for submassive acute pulmonary embolism and proximal deep vein thrombosis patients.

### New antithrombotic agents – insights from clinical trials [^222888be]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic agents are the cornerstones of therapy for thrombosis. The compositions of arterial and venous clots differ, rendering antiplatelet agents more effective for arterial thrombosis and anticoagulants more effective for venous disease. Despite taking acetylsalicylic acid, some patients with arterial disease experience thrombotic events. The addition of the ADP-receptor antagonist clopidogrel to therapeutic regimens containing acetylsalicylic acid improves outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, clopidogrel has several limitations, including variable absorption, drug-drug interactions and genetic factors that lead to reduced generation of the active metabolite, and a delayed onset and offset of action. A search for new ADP-receptor inhibitors has yielded drugs such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and cangrelor. For patients with venous thrombosis, the coumarins have been the only available oral anticoagulants for more than 60 years. Despite their effectiveness in preventing and treating thromboembolism, coumarins have well-documented limitations, including drug-drug and drug-dietary interactions, a narrow therapeutic range, and inconvenience and cost of monitoring therapy. A search for new oral anticoagulants has yielded drugs such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. In this article, we review these new antithrombotic agents and provide plausible explanations for the results of phase III randomized controlled trials of these drugs.

Pharmacodynamic Drug Interaction Studies

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with aspirin, clopidogrel, aspirin and clopidogrel, prasugrel, enoxaparin, and naproxen were conducted. No pharmacodynamic interactions were observed with aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A 50% to 60% increase in anti-FXa activity was observed when ELIQUIS was coadministered with enoxaparin or naproxen.

Specific Populations

Renal impairment: Anti-FXa activity adjusted for exposure to apixaban was similar across renal function categories.

Hepatic impairment: Changes in anti-FXa activity were similar in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects. However, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there is no clear understanding of the impact of this degree of hepatic function impairment on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and bleeding. Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not studied.

Pediatric patients: In pediatric patients treated with apixaban, the correlation between anti-FXa activity and plasma concentration is linear with a slope close to 1.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Apixaban has no effect on the QTc interval in humans at doses up to 50 mg.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Apixaban demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increases in exposure for oral doses up to 10 mg.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of apixaban is approximately 50% for doses up to 10 mg of ELIQUIS. Food does not affect the bioavailability of apixaban. Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of apixaban appear 3 to 4 hours after oral administration of ELIQUIS. At doses ≥ 25 mg, apixaban displays dissolution-limited absorption with decreased bioavailability. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets suspended in 30 mL of water, exposure was similar to that after oral administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following oral administration of 10 mg of apixaban as 2 crushed 5 mg tablets mixed with 30 g of applesauce, the Cmaxand AUC were 20% and 16% lower, respectively, when compared to administration of 2 intact 5 mg tablets. Following administration of a crushed 5 mg ELIQUIS tablet that was suspended in 60 mL D5W and delivered through a nasogastric tube, exposure was similar to that seen in other clinical trials involving healthy volunteers receiving a single oral 5 mg tablet dose.

### Oral anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism [^064e6c85]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis, prevention, and management, venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. For decades, antithrombotic therapy for prevention and treatment of VTE was limited to parenteral agents related to heparin and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Both classes of anticoagulants are effective, but have limitations, including considerable variability in dose-response, narrow therapeutic margins between the risks of thrombosis and bleeding, and the need to monitor anticoagulation intensity. Over the past decade, the introduction of new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit coagulation factors IIa (thrombin) or Xa has changed practice in a variety of clinical situations, including VTE prophylaxis and treatment. In this Review, we outline the use of the novel oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of VTE, and discuss practical considerations for choosing the appropriate drug for each patient. Although the introduction of novel anticoagulant drugs is promising, selecting the optimum strategy for an individual patient requires an understanding of the specific circumstances associated with thrombus formation and the pharmacological properties of each agent.

### A systematic update on the state of novel anticoagulants and a primer on reversal and bridging [^c3b1d194]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes familiar agents that have been in use for many years, including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). A number of novel oral anticoagulants are currently developed or are in stages of development to either replace VKAs in concert with initial heparin or LMWH, or to replace both heparin/LMWH and VKAs totally as monotherapy. These agents hold the promise of not requiring monitoring, being safer in terms of bleeding risk than current agents, and being of equal or improved efficacy compared with established anticoagulants.

Methods

In the following report, we systematically review the oral agents currently approved or closest to approval for both VTE and atrial fibrillation treatment, focusing on the treatment of VTE: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.

Results

Findings of clinical use and comparisons to standard care of these agents are summarized in depth, by succinctly reviewing all major randomized controlled trials. Mechanistic and functional differences are reviewed, as Dabigatran targets activated factor II (factor IIa), while rivaroxaban and apixaban target activated factor X (factor Xa). We also discuss the inability at the present time to reliably reverse the anticoagulant effects of these agents, provide a suggested strategy for reversal, and finally discuss an approach to bridging these agents when other procedures are required while currently taking one of these three agents.

Conclusions

These agents, while still with many unanswered questions, demonstrate great promise in the prevention and treatment of VTE.

### Updates in the perioperative and emergency management of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^a1fd2122]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: new challenges

Direct thrombin inhibitors, dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®, Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany), and direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban (Xarelto®, Johnson and Johnson/Bayer HealthCare AG, Leverkusen, Germany) and apixaban (Eliquis®, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Uxbridge, UK), are non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) increasingly used in the treatment of venous thromboembolism, prevention of cerebrovascular embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Although the advantages of these new agents include rapid onset (2 to 4 hours) of action, in addition to a predictable anticoagulant effect without monitoring requirements, different clinical conditions can impair their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Despite published management perspectives, strategies are not yet clearly defined for perioperative management in patients treated with NOACs.

Direct factor Xa inhibitors — clinical properties and reversal: Apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) "are the only two drugs in this class that can be reversed by Andexanet alfa (Andexxa®)", which "has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for urgent reversal of anticoagulant effects in 2018". For rivaroxaban, the oral half-life is "5.7 to 9.2 hours" with "plasma protein binding of the drug is 92–95%", and "one-third of the dose is excreted in the urine and the remaining two-thirds of the dose is excreted as an inactive metabolite in the feces and the urine"; concomitant use with "P-glycoprotein inhibitors or metabolized by CYP3A4 increases the potential for drug interactions". For apixaban, "maximal effects are observed in 1–2 hours", it has "an oral availability of 45%", and although elimination is mixed, "the drug is primarily excreted through the intestines".

### Pharmacology and clinical development of factor XI inhibitors [^3ae27178]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic anticoagulation is indicated for a variety of circumstances and conditions in several fields of medicine to prevent or treat venous and arterial thromboembolism. According to the different mechanisms of action, the available parenteral and oral anticoagulant drugs share the common principle of hampering or blocking key steps of the coagulation cascade, which unavoidably comes at the price of an increased propensity to bleed. Hemorrhagic complications affect patient prognosis both directly and indirectly (ie, by preventing the adoption of an effective antithrombotic strategy). Inhibition of factor XI (FXI) has emerged as a strategy with the potential to uncouple the pharmacological effect and the adverse events of anticoagulant therapy. This observation is based on the differential contribution of FXI to thrombus amplification, in which it plays a major role, and hemostasis, in which it plays an ancillary role in final clot consolidation. Several agents were developed to inhibit FXI at different stages (ie, suppressing biosynthesis, preventing zymogen activation, or impeding the biological action of the active form), including antisense oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies, small synthetic molecules, natural peptides, and aptamers. Phase 2 studies of different classes of FXI inhibitors in orthopedic surgery suggested that dose-dependent reductions in thrombotic complications are not paralleled by dose-dependent increases in bleeding compared with low-molecular-weight heparin. Likewise, the FXI inhibitor asundexian was associated with lower rates of bleeding compared with the activated factor X inhibitor apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation, although no evidence of a therapeutic effect on stroke prevention is available so far. FXI inhibition could also be appealing for patients with other conditions, including end-stage renal disease, noncardioembolic stroke, or acute myocardial infarction, for which other phase 2 studies have been conducted. The balance between thromboprophylaxis and bleeding achieved by FXI inhibitors needs confirmation in large-scale phase 3 clinical trials powered for clinical end points. Several of such trials are ongoing or planned to define the role of FXI inhibitors in clinical practice and to clarify which FXI inhibitor may be most suited for each clinical indication. This article reviews the rationale, pharmacology, results of medium or small phase 2 studies, and future perspectives of drugs inhibiting FXI.

### The new era of anticoagulation [^329d9003]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Warfarin has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for medical use as an anticoagulant for more than 60 years. Although it has been an effective anticoagulant, its use is accompanied by several pitfalls, which has led to research and the discovery of new additional groups of anticoagulants: direct thrombin inhibitors, such as dabigatran, and direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. These new anticoagulants are fast-acting, noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and do not require monitoring. More data are accumulating to support their use in the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism. This article reviews the literature on these novel anticoagulants, including their pharmacokinetics and treatment indications.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^29a83b00]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Non-warfarin oral anticoagulants (NOACs, formerly 'novel' oral anticoagulants and now sometimes referred to as non-vitamin K OACs, target-specific OACs or direct OACs) are now appearing in clinical practice. For example, most patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation requiring a long-term OAC are still prescribed warfarin, but increasing numbers, currently approximately 17%, are prescribed the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, Connecticut, USA). Dabigatran has been approved for the reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5–10 days and for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE in previously treated patients.

The factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, New Jersey, USA) has been approved for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE prophylaxis after elective major joint replacement surgery. The FXa inhibitor apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, New York, New York, USA) also has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment of VTE. Another agent in this class, edoxaban (Daiichi Sankyo Co, Tokyo, Japan), has recently completed pivotal clinical trialsand received FDA approval for the reduction of risk of stroke and SE in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment of DVT and PE subsequent to initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5–10 days. Therefore, while most patients presenting to the ED who are taking an OAC are likely to be taking warfarin, it is important for all emergency care providers to gain familiarity with the NOACs. The currently approved indications for use and recommended dosing for the approved NOACs can be found in table 1.

### The new oral anticoagulants [^d194354a]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Although their first application in clinical practice occurred in the 1940s, vitamin K antagonists remain the only form of oral anticoagulant medication approved for long-term use. Although the available vitamin K antagonists are highly effective for the prevention and/or treatment of most thrombotic disease, the significant interpatient and intrapatient variability in dose-response, the narrow therapeutic index, and the numerous drug and dietary interactions associated with these agents have led clinicians, patients, and investigators to search for alternative agents. Three new orally administered anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban) are in the late stages of development and several others are just entering (or moving through) earlier phases of investigation. These novel anticoagulant medications are being studied for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes published clinical trial data pertinent to apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^cdc4e462]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

NOACs directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or indirectly inhibit activated factor X (Xa) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) to prevent blood clot formation. Dabigatran, the first approved NOAC, exerts its anticoagulant effect by strongly, reversibly, and selectively inhibiting thrombin activity, with the intensity of its effects dependent on drug concentration. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit various states of factor Xa to reduce thrombin generation without interfering with existing thrombi, while having minimal impact on normal physiological haemostasis and non‐coagulation functions. Multiple guidelines recommend the use of NOACs for secondary prevention of non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. The advantages of NOACs include minimal interactions with food and drugs, stable pharmacokinetics, no need for dose adjustments, no requirement for regular INR monitoring, rapid onset of action, good tolerability, and fewer side effects compared to warfarin. Compared to warfarin, NOACs have a lower incidence of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage, making them generally safer and more convenient. Reversal agents for NOACs, such as idarucizumab and exanetalfa, have been developed for the treatment of life‐threatening bleeding or in situations requiring urgent surgery. Some disadvantages of using NOACs, as opposed to vitamin K antagonists, include higher costs and the need for dose adjustments in individuals with renal impairment or extreme body weight.

Why it is important to do this review

The optimal timing for initiating oral anticoagulant therapy in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke remains uncertain, leading to ongoing debate about early versus late initiation. Current guidelines lack consistency and clear recommendations on when to initiate anticoagulant therapy, primarily relying on expert consensus and limited evidence. For example, the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guideline suggests using the "1‐3‐6‐12" rule based on stroke severity to determine the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends initiating oral anticoagulant therapy between 4 and 14 days after symptom onset. Due to the inconsistent recommendations among various guidelines, physicians encounter challenges in determining the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy for people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related strokes. A survey conducted among stroke physicians in the UK revealed a lack of consensus on this matter, with 95% of respondents expressing uncertainty about the appropriate time to begin oral anticoagulation. Therefore, a systematic review of the optimal timing for starting oral anticoagulation therapy after acute ischaemic stroke in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation is highly warranted.

### A comparison of outcomes with apixaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin for Atrial fibrillation and / or venous Thromboembolism [^109543e7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic outcomes were higher with the DOACs studied compared to warfarin, with the overall thrombotic rate being increased just for apixaban. This was largely driven by "other" thromboses that includes myocardial infarction. This has not been seen in other studies, but there are limited studies of similar duration and methodology. Given that thrombotic event rates are low for anticoagulated patients, this is also a composite outcome that includes a variety of thrombotic outcomes. The magnitude of difference is also relatively small. While this is hypothesis generating, the significance of it is uncertain at this point. One consideration could be that the short half-lives of the DOACs relative to warfarin could put patients at greater risk if they were to miss doses, but this would need further study. Notably the ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial showed reduced risk of the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke with rivaroxaban compared to placebo in patients with acute coronary syndrome; the APPRAISE-2 trial did not show a reduction in ischemic events with apixaban compared to placebo in a similar population. Further exploration of cardiovascular outcome differences may be warranted.

The mechanism for and reason for the observed clinical outcome differences merit further investigation. One possibility is that the twice-daily dosing of apixaban offers more steady levels of anticoagulation than the daily dosing of rivaroxaban, that could influence bleeding outcomes. However, this would not explain the observed differences in thrombotic outcomes, mostly driven by "other" thrombotic events. It is possible that there is confounding in that patients who select a once-daily drug are different from those that select a twice-daily drug. Medication adherence was not addressed in this study, but other studies suggest better adherence with daily drugs compared to twice daily. Overall, given the similar mechanism of action between apixaban and rivaroxaban, observed differences are presumably related to the pharmacokinetics of the drugs themselves.

### Reversal of antithrombotic agents [^b3ac7128]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants are the mainstay of therapy for thromboembolic diseases. In addition to the more traditional agents, new oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been shown to be effective across several indications. Bleeding is a serious complication associated with any anticoagulant, but many of the traditional parenteral and new oral agents do not currently have specific antidotes. This review describes available and future options for the reversal of the effects of anticoagulants, in particular the new oral agents and discusses current management strategies for bleeding events in clinical practice.

### Antithrombotic effects of combined PAR (protease-activated receptor)-4 antagonism and factor Xa inhibition [^c2951b40]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Factor Xa inhibition reduces thrombin generation by blocking the enzymatic activity of factor Xa and the prothrombinase complex. As such, factor Xa inhibition may interfere with thrombin-mediated PAR1 and PAR4 receptor activation and thereby reduce the potential added efficacy of PAR4 antagonism. We, therefore, wanted to explore how the combination of PAR4 antagonism with factor Xa inhibition would affect thrombus formation. We here assess the efficacy of BMS-986141 — a novel PAR4 antagonist — in combination with clinically relevant concentrations of apixaban — a factor Xa inhibitor — in ex vivo model of human thrombus formation.

### Preclinical and clinical data for factor Xa and "Universal" reversal agents [^95413e1a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, a class of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants approved for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, consistently have been shown to be noninferior to warfarin in clinical trials evaluating their safety and efficacy. – As with any anticoagulant, these drugs incrementally increase the risk of bleeding to greatly reduce the risk of clotting (eg, stroke and venous thromboembolism). Before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of idarucizumab, a specific reversal agent for the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, the lack of reversal agents was a consistent concern associated with the use of all direct-acting oral anticoagulants. Currently, there is no approved specific reversal agent for FXa inhibitors, although late-phase clinical trials of reversal agents are ongoing.

Warfarin anticoagulation historically has been reversed with vitamin K1 (to reinitiate synthesis of affected factors II, VII, IX, and X, along with proteins C and S) and fresh-frozen plasma (to replete these factors more immediately), although the effectiveness of this approach has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Despite being approved for human use in the 1950s in the United States, warfarin had no fast-acting, specific reversal agent supported by evidence from a randomized controlled trial until 2013, when a 4-Factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) was approved. – The first oral FXa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, was approved in the United States in 2011, by which time reversal agents for direct-acting oral anticoagulants were already in development. The FXa inhibitors apixabanand edoxabanhave since been approved, and more are in development (note that all FXa inhibitors have the suffix "Xa-ban" [Ten-A-Ban] to denote their mechanism of action).

### Apixaban [^b6fa9575]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdose of apixaban tablets increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In controlled clinical trials, orally administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily for 7 days or 50 mg once daily for 3 days) had no clinically relevant adverse effects.

In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: evidence and unresolved issues [^9f9c27c0]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Currently licenced direct oral anticoagulants selectively target thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or coagulation factor Xa (eg, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Designed to be given in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions than do vitamin K antagonists, and in randomised controlled trials involving around 250000 patients, they were at least as effective for prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding. The absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications because of their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of direct oral anticoagulants are likely to be in patients who were previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of direct oral anticoagulants, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost. Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. In this Therapeutics paper, we review the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarise the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explore key unresolved issues. We also briefly discuss future perspectives for the development of oral anticoagulants.

### Recent progress in anticoagulant therapy: oral direct inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa [^bc5a6be7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

While parenteral anticoagulants such as unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins and the oral vitamin K antagonists are effective for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis, they have a number of limitations. Up until recently, vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) have been the only available oral anticoagulants. These drugs have a delayed onset of action, food and drug interactions, and variable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics such that regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments are required to maintain the International Normalized Ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range. New oral anticoagulants that selectively inhibit either thrombin (dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) have now gained approval in many countries for some clinical indications. Unlike warfarin, these drugs have a rapid onset of action and a relatively wide therapeutic range such that coagulation monitoring is not required. These agents are more convenient for patients and health care providers, but also have potential for improving clinical outcomes and being more cost-effective than existing agents. This will result in major changes in the way that thrombosis is managed, both with respect to prevention and treatment. The new oral inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa, however, have limitations and the absence of a need for regular laboratory monitoring makes medication compliance extremely important for maintaining efficacy given their relatively short half-lives. Furthermore there will be challenges in managing patients on these agents who develop recurrent thrombosis or major bleeding until methods to monitor and assess the levels of the new agents are readily available and specific antidotes are developed.

### Engineering and evaluation of FXa bypassing agents that restore hemostasis following apixaban associated bleeding [^82d248a8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) targeting activated factor Xa (FXa) are used to prevent or treat thromboembolic disorders. DOACs reversibly bind to FXa and inhibit its enzymatic activity. However, DOAC treatment carries the risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding. Currently, only one specific agent, andexanet alfa, is approved to reverse the anticoagulant effects of FXa-targeting DOACs (FXaDOACs) and control life-threatening bleeding. However, because of its mechanism of action, andexanet alfa requires a cumbersome dosing schedule, and its use is associated with the risk of thrombosis. Here, we present the computational design, engineering, and evaluation of FXa-variants that exhibit anticoagulation reversal activity in the presence of FXaDOACs. Our designs demonstrate low DOAC binding affinity, retain FXa-enzymatic activity and reduce the DOAC-associated bleeding by restoring hemostasis in mice treated with apixaban. Importantly, the FXaDOACs reversal agents we designed, unlike andexanet alfa, do not inhibit TFPI, and consequently, may have a safer thrombogenic profile.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^c2fd8c52]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Distribution

Plasma protein binding in humans is approximately 87%. The volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately 21 liters.

Metabolism

Approximately 25% of an orally administered apixaban dose is recovered in urine and feces as metabolites. Apixaban is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4 with minor contributions from CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. O-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of biotransformation.

Unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in human plasma; there are no active circulating metabolites.

Elimination

Apixaban is eliminated in both urine and feces. Renal excretion accounts for about 27% of total clearance. Biliary and direct intestinal excretion contributes to elimination of apixaban in the feces.

Apixaban has a total clearance of approximately 3.3 L/hour and an apparent half-life of approximately 12 hours following oral administration.

Apixaban is a substrate of transport proteins: P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein.

Drug Interaction Studies

In i n vitro apixaban studies at concentrations significantly greater than therapeutic exposures, no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, or CYP2C19, nor induction effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 were observed. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of P-gp.

The effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are summarized in Figure 2 [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Figure 2: Effect of Coadministered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Apixaban

In dedicated studies conducted in healthy subjects, famotidine, atenolol, prasugrel, and enoxaparin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of apixaban.

In studies conducted in healthy subjects, apixaban did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, naproxen, atenolol, prasugrel, or acetylsalicylic acid.

### Intravenous thrombolysis in patients taking direct oral anticoagulation treatment before stroke onset: results from the safe implementations of treatments in stroke international stroke registry [^c6a31415]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results from these analyses would suggest that DOAC intake close to stroke onset does not seem to affect outcomes negatively on the population as a whole, as might be intuitively believed. Our observational data may help guide clinicians make a better‐informed decision when presented with patients with disabling stroke symptoms with ongoing DOAC treatment where IVT is the only reperfusion option, such as when EVT is not a treatment option due to distal/no visible occlusion or EVT is not available in the center or region.

Common wisdom would suggest that anticoagulant intake may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation after IVT through some form of combined effect, and current guidelines have accepted this view. Yet, more specific considerations about this potential mechanism may raise questions about its validity, and thus provide a possible explanation for our findings. First, unlike heparin and vitamin K antagonists, DOACs have only one target in the coagulation pathway — thrombin for dabigatran and factor Xa for apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban — making these drugs as effective as the older drug, but safer, with a lower incidence of bleeding complications. Second, hemostasis is not solely based on the coagulation cascade, but results from a complex interplay between endothelium, platelets, von Willebrand factor, and coagulation factors. Third, DOACs and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator have different mechanisms of action and functions: anticoagulants prevent the formation of new blood clots by acting at a different site of the coagulation cascade, but ultimately inhibiting fibrin formation, whereas recombinant tissue plasminogen activator dissolves existing clots by activating mainly fibrin‐bound plasminogen and consequently depolymerizing fibrin (Fig S1). In principle, the two pathways are different from each other, thus there is no obvious potentiation of the risk of hemorrhage between them. In light of these considerations, our results may not be as surprising or counterintuitive as one might initially assume.

### Pharmacology of antithrombotic drugs: an assessment of oral antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments [^6c017ad7]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Antithrombotic drugs, which include antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, prevent and treat many cardiovascular disorders and, as such, are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. The first drugs designed to inhibit platelets or coagulation factors, such as the antiplatelet clopidogrel and the anticoagulant warfarin, significantly reduced the risk of thrombotic events at the cost of increased bleeding in patients. However, both clopidogrel and warfarin have some pharmacological limitations including interpatient variability in antithrombotic effects in part due to the metabolism, interactions (eg, drug, environment, and genetic), or targets of the drugs. Increased knowledge of the pharmacology of antithrombotic drugs and the mechanisms underlying thrombosis has led to the development of newer drugs with faster onset of action, fewer interactions, and less interpatient variability in their antithrombotic effects than previous antithrombotic drugs. Treatment options now include the next-generation antiplatelet drugs prasugrel and ticagrelor, and, in terms of anticoagulants, inhibitors that directly target factor IIa (dabigatran) or Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are available. In this Series paper we review the pharmacological properties of these most commonly used oral antithrombotic drugs, and explore the development of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies.

### Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) [^e23c767e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo exerts its procoagulant effect by binding and sequestering the FXa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Another observed procoagulant effect of the ANDEXXA protein is its ability to bind to, and inhibit the activity of, Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Inhibition of TFPI activity can increase tissue factor (TF)-initiated thrombin generation.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

The effects of ANDEXXA can be measured using assays for its anti-FXa activity, free fraction of FXa inhibitor, and thrombin generation. In addition to its ability to sequester the FXa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, ANDEXXA has been shown to inhibit TFPI activity.

The dose and dosing regimen of ANDEXXA that are required to reverse anti-FXa activity and to restore thrombin generation were determined in dose-ranging studies on healthy volunteers. Dosing of ANDEXXA, as a bolus followed by a two-hour continuous infusion, resulted in a rapid decrease in anti-FXa activity (within two minutes after the completion of the bolus administration) followed by reduced anti-FXa activity that was maintained throughout the duration of the continuous infusion [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The anti-FXa activity returned to the placebo levels approximately two hours after completion of a bolus or continuous infusion, whereas TFPI activity in plasma returned to the pretreatment levels approximately 96 hours following ANDEXXA administration.

Elevation of TF-initiated thrombin generation above the baseline range (prior to anticoagulation) occurred within two minutes following a bolus administration of ANDEXXA and was maintained throughout the duration of the continuous infusion. The TF-initiated thrombin generation was elevated above placebo for at least 22 hours. The sustained elevation of thrombin generation over the baseline range and the sustained elevation over placebo were not observed in a contact-activated thrombin generation assay (an assay that is not affected by TF-TFPI interaction).

Laboratory assessment of coagulation does not necessarily correlate with or predict the hemostatic effectiveness of ANDEXXA.

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

A summary of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of ANDEXXA in healthy patients is shown in the table below (see Table 3).

Drug-Drug Interaction

The pharmacokinetics of ANDEXXA were not affected by apixaban (5 mg orally BID for six days) or rivaroxaban (20 mg orally once daily for six days).

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and reversal of apixaban anticoagulation with andexanet alfa [^c4fd8b8d]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors lack a specific reversal agent for emergencies such as major bleeding or urgent surgery. Andexanet alfa, a modified, catalytically inactive, recombinant human FXa derivative, reverses anticoagulant effect by binding and sequestering FXa inhibitors. This original report of safety and dose-finding, phase 1 and 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, investigated various doses of andexanet in healthy volunteers. Phase 1 evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of andexanet (n = 24) or placebo (n = 8). In phase 2, andexanet (n = 36) or placebo (n = 18) was administered following steady-state apixaban dosing (5 mg twice daily for 6 days); safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics were assessed. Andexanet plasma concentration increased proportionally with dose, with rapid elimination (terminal elimination half-life, 4.35–7.5 hours). Following apixaban treatment, andexanet rapidly (≤ 2 minutes) and dose dependently reduced unbound apixaban concentration vs placebo (51% to 89% vs 5% reduction; all P < .05), decreased anti-FXa activity (67.8% to 95.0% vs 7.1% reduction; all P < .05), and restored thrombin generation in 67% to 100% vs 6% of subjects (all P < .01), maintaining these effects during continuous 45- and 120-minute infusions. Andexanet was well tolerated. Nine subjects had mild/moderate infusion reactions not associated with hemodynamic changes or respiratory compromise that generally resolved without intervention or dose reduction. There were no thrombotic events or other serious safety issues. In conclusion, andexanet reversed apixaban-mediated effects on pharmacodynamic markers of anticoagulation in healthy volunteers within minutes after administration and for the duration of infusion. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01758432.

### Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of apixaban and rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in iran [^4b266797]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardioembolic stroke includes 15%−20% of the causes of ischemic stroke, and among embolic reasons, the most common underlying cause is AF, which provides for more than half of the cases. Therefore, preventing clots and emboli formation is very important in this disease. The most important and unfortunate complication of AF is the formation of an intra‐atrial clot and embolism (stroke). The risk of thromboembolism increases up to 20 times in patients with NVAF and seven times in patients with valve diseases and AF. There are about 500 000 strokes related to AF annually worldwide.

Globally, more than half of patients with AF require treatment with an oral anticoagulant medicine. Choosing the appropriate medicine treatment requires careful evaluation of the effect of reducing the risk of stroke anticoagulant medication and the possible bleeding effect of that medicine.

Warfarin, as an anti‐vitamin K agent (VKA), is the standard oral treatment for stroke prevention in people with NVAF. However, it has many limitations, such as medicine‐food interactions, slow onset of effect, high rates of medicine discontinuation, limited therapeutic range, and variable dose−response of the patient to the medicine, which requires continuous laboratory monitoring.

In recent years, several new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including edoxaban, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and dabigatran, have been approved in the United States as an alternative to Warfarin for stroke prevention in NVAF patients. These newer agents provide more convenient and practical anticoagulation therapy because they do not require daily monitoring, have a faster onset of action, and have fewer medicine‐food interactions than VKA therapy.

Considering the limited resources of the health sector and since one of the country's most expensive parts of the health system is the pharmaceutical sector, controlling medicine costs is one of the goals of policymakers. One of the requirements to achieve this goal is to conduct economic evaluation studies between two alternative medicines. Therefore, considering that in our country, no analysis has been shown in evaluating the cost‐effectiveness of Apixaban and Rivaroxaban compared to Warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant, with the Budget impact analysis (BIA), this study aimed to assess the cost‐effectiveness of Apixaban and Rivaroxaban compared to Warfarin to prevent stroke in patients with NVAF.

### Novel oral anticoagulants: focus on stroke prevention and treatment of venous thrombo-embolism [^e56dae57]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation for the long-term treatment and prevention of thrombo-embolic diseases as well as for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) has been accomplished by vitamin K antagonists for the last half century. Although effective under optimal conditions, the imminent risk of a recurrent event vs. the risk of bleeding due to the narrow therapeutic window, numerous food- and drug interactions, and the need for regular monitoring complicate the long-term use of these drugs and render treatment with these agents complicated. As a result, novel anticoagulants which selectively block key factors in the coagulation cascade are being developed. The efficacy and safety of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, as well as of the selective factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban, have been demonstrated in Phase III trials for stroke prevention in AF and the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolism. This review summarizes the results from recently published pivotal clinical trials and discusses the opportunities as well as uncertainties in the clinical applications of these novel agents.

### Preclinical and clinical data for factor Xa and "universal" reversal agents [^d2c7dec3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

1.3. Clinical studies

In a phase 2 dose-ranging, proof-of-concept study in healthy, nonbleeding volunteers treated with apixaban, rivaroxaban, the LMWH enoxaparin, or edoxaban, andexanet demonstrated rapid (within 2 minutes) reversal of anticoagulation activity, as measured by anti-FXa activity assays; anti-FXa activity returned to placebo levels in approximately 2 hours after treatment in the study of reversal of edoxaban-induced anticoagulation. The reversal could be extended with a continuous infusion. There were no observed thrombotic events, serious adverse events, discontinuation because of adverse events, or antibodies to endogenous human FXa or FX.

Andexanet has since been studied in phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies as a single bolus or a bolus plus 2-hour infusion in nonbleeding healthy older adults (50–75 years) treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban. Andexanet was administered as a bolus plus 2-hour infusion because the half-life of the drug is approximately 1 hour (Fig. 2). The apixaban and rivaroxaban groups were administered 400 or 800 mg of andexanet, respectively; doses were selected on the basis of the stoichiometric ratio needed for the reversal of each anticoagulant. In the apixaban group, anti-FXa activity was reduced by 94% in subjects (n = 24) who received an andexanet bolus versus 21% in participants (n = 9) who received placebo (P < .001), and the concentration of unbound apixaban was reduced by 9.3 ng/mL versus 1.9 ng/mL (P < .001); thrombin generation was fully restored within 2 to 5 minutes in 100% versus 11% of subjects (P < .001) (Fig. 2A). In the rivaroxaban group, anti-FXa activity was reduced by 92% in subjects (n = 27) who received an andexanet bolus versus 18% in subjects (n = 14) who received placebo (P < .001), and the concentration of unbound rivaroxaban was reduced by 23.4 ng/mL versus 4.2 ng/mL (P < .001); thrombin generation was fully restored in 96% versus 7% of subjects (P < .001) (Fig. 2B). When andexanet was administered as a bolus plus 2-hour infusion, these effects were sustained in subjects treated with apixaban and rivaroxaban (Fig. 2C and D). Transient increases in levels of D-dimer and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F1.2) occurred in a subgroup of subjects, raising a concern for prothrombotic effect, but this normalized within 24 to 72 hours. Mild infusion reactions were reported in some subjects, and 1 subject developed hives. Subjects were followed for 6 weeks, and there were no serious adverse events, thromboembolic events, or neutralizing antibody development.

### Antithrombotic effects of combined PAR (protease-activated receptor)-4 antagonism and factor Xa inhibition [^f6076860]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although this was a double-blind randomized controlled study and the primary end point was measured by blinded assessors, we acknowledge several limitations. First, we explored the effect of BMS-986141 and apixaban through extracorporeal administration of these drugs. This may have caused some alterations in the behavior of these compounds although our pharmacokinetic data confirm we achieved the approximate target plasma concentrations for each compound. Second, we required a vehicle to ensure solubility of BMS-986141. We maintained the same concentration of vehicle in all 6 infusions to minimize any potential bias, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the vehicle may have influenced the pharmacodynamics of both apixaban and BMS-986141 in our model. However, we confirmed the anticipated selective antiplatelet actions of BMS-986141 on platelet activation and aggregation in the effluent of the chamber, as well as the anticipated effects of BMS-986141 and apixaban on platelet-rich high-shear and fibrin-rich low shear stress thrombus formation. Third, we did not compare PAR4 inhibition in combination with apixaban to contemporary antiplatelet agents with apixaban. While this certainly would be of interest, our aim was to establish whether the effects of apixaban would limit the ability of PAR4 antagonism to reduce thrombus formation. This narrow focus, therefore, allows us to answer this specific question with confidence. Finally, we did not explore the dose-response relationship for BMS-986141 in this study, but our primary focus was to demonstrate whether there was added efficacy of PAR4 antagonism when added to clinically relevant doses of the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PAR4 antagonism when used in combination with factor Xa inhibition causes an additive reduction in human thrombus formation, especially for platelet-rich thrombus under conditions of high shear stress. This suggests the potential for additive benefit of combination therapy in reducing arterial thrombosis and atherothrombotic clinical events.

### Pros and cons of new oral anticoagulants [^246e9b45]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

The availability of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) targeting either thrombin (dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis has been highly anticipated. NOACs have major pharmacologic advantages over vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin), including rapid onset/offset of action, few drug interactions, and predictable pharmacokinetics, eliminating the requirement for regular coagulation monitoring. Regulatory agencies have approved several NOACs for specific indications based on the results of clinical trials demonstrating efficacy and safety that are at least as good, if not better, than warfarin (for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism) or low-molecular-weight heparin, which is injectable (for initial treatment of venous thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty). However, the adoption of this new therapeutic class into clinical practice has been slower than expected due to several factors including concerns regarding medication adherence without laboratory monitoring, uncertainty about dosing in some patient populations (eg, renal dysfunction, marked extremes of body weight), and higher drug costs compared with warfarin. Other issues are the current absence of specific antidotes for NOACs and assays to measure drug levels at most centers. The indications for NOACs on the market will expand and at least one additional agent (edoxaban) will likely gain approval within the next 2 years. As practitioners gain familiarity with the drugs and healthcare systems adapt to their use, NOAC use will increase substantially over time. Warfarin, however, will continue to be an appropriate anticoagulant choice for many patients.

### Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors [^00abd369]. Circulation Research (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, have been the mainstay of oral anticoagulation for many decades. Although effective, warfarin has numerous limitations, including a variable dose requirement from patient to patient because of differences in dietary vitamin K intake, common genetic polymorphisms, and multiple drug interactions that affect its pharmacodynamics and metabolism. Consequently, warfarin requires frequent monitoring to ensure that a therapeutic anticoagulant effect has been achieved because excessive anticoagulation can lead to bleeding, and because insufficient anticoagulation can result in thrombosis. Such monitoring is burdensome for patients and physicians and is costly for the health care system. These limitations have prompted the development of new oral anticoagulants that target either factor Xa or thrombin. Although the path to the development of these drugs has been long, the new drugs are at least as effective and safe as warfarin, but they streamline clinical care because they can be administered in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. This article focuses on rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, the oral factor Xa inhibitors in the most advanced stages of development. After 20 years of discovery research, these agents are already licensed for several indications. Thus, the long path to finding replacements for warfarin has finally reached fruition. Therefore, development of the oral factor Xa inhibitors represents a translational science success story.

Oral anticoagulant–related major bleeding and reversal agents — incidence, supportive care, and agent performance are summarized as follows: about 2% to 4% of patients who receive oral anticoagulants (OACs) experience major bleeding; activated charcoal may be administered up to 6 to 8 hours after the last dose; emergency department visits for OAC bleeding due to direct oral anticoagulants increased from 2.3% in 2011 to 37.9% in 2017; failure to achieve effective hemostasis is associated with a > 3 times higher risk of death; idarucizumab for dabigatran-induced major bleeding and andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban associated major bleeding are FDA approved; in RE-VERSE AD, idarucizumab achieved reversal in 100% of patients with 67.7% bleeding cessation and thrombosis events 4.7% within 30 days, and a post hoc gastrointestinal bleeding analysis found 97.5% complete reversal with 76.2% bleeding cessation; for dabigatran-associated bleeding, activated PCC evidence includes a 14-patient cohort with 9 patients (64%) rated good, 5 (36%) moderate, and no thromboembolic events, plus a randomized crossover trial in 12 healthy subjects showing 4-factor PCC completely reversed rivaroxaban by prothrombin time but did not reverse dabigatran by aPTT, ecarin clotting time, or thrombin time; ANNEXA 4 evaluated andexanet alfa in adults with acute major bleeding (safety population, n = 254; efficacy population, n = 254) receiving factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban 55%, rivaroxaban 36%, edoxaban 3%, enoxaparin 6%), with median anti–factor Xa activity decreased by 89%, clinical hemostasis excellent or good in 37 of 47 patients (79% [95% CI, 64%-89%]) at 12 hours, and thrombotic events in 12 of 67 patients (18%) during 30-day follow-up; currently, andexanet alfa is FDA-approved for only apixaban- or rivaroxaban–associated life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, and a meta-analysis of 22 observational studies compared andexanet alfa (n = 438) with PCC (n = 1278) in patients with acute bleeding associated with oral factor Xa inhibitors.

### Rivaroxaban and apixaban induce clotting factor Xa fibrinolytic activity [^42a1b9a6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Essentials Activated clotting factor X (FXa) acquires fibrinolytic cofactor function after cleavage by plasmin. FXa-mediated plasma fibrinolysis is enabled by active site modification blocking a second cleavage. FXa-directed oral anticoagulants (DOACs) alter FXa cleavage by plasmin. DOACs enhance FX-dependent fibrinolysis and plasmin generation by tissue plasminogen activator.

Background

When bound to an anionic phospholipid-containing membrane, activated clotting factor X (FXa) is sequentially cleaved by plasmin from the intact form, FXaα, to FXaβ and then to Xa33/13. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) produces plasmin and is the initiator of fibrinolysis. Both FXaβ and Xa33/13 enhance t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation. Although stable in experiments using purified proteins, Xa33/13 rapidly loses t-PA cofactor function in plasma. Bypassing this inhibition, covalent modification of the FXaα active site prevents Xa33/13 formation by plasmin, and the persistent FXaβ enhances plasma fibrinolysis. As the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) rivaroxaban and apixaban bind to the FXa active site, we hypothesized that they similarly modulate FXa fibrinolytic function.

Methods

DOAC effects on fibrinolysis and the t-PA cofactor function of FXa were studied in patient plasma, normal pooled plasma and purified protein experiments by the use of light scattering, chromogenic assays, and immunoblots.

Results

The plasma of patients taking rivaroxaban showed enhanced fibrinolysis correlating with FXaβ. In normal pooled plasma, the addition of rivaroxaban or apixaban also shortened fibrinolysis times. This was related to the cleavage product, FXaβ, which increased plasmin production by t-PA. It was confirmed that these results were not caused by DOACs affecting activated FXIII-mediated fibrin crosslinking, clot ultrastructure and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activation in plasma.

Conclusion

The current study suggests a previously unknown effect of DOACs on FXa in addition to their well-documented anticoagulant role. By enabling the t-PA cofactor function of FXaβ in plasma, DOACs also enhance fibrinolysis. This effect may broaden their therapeutic indications.

### Favorable therapeutic index of the direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, compared with the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran in rabbits [^22912405]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Apixaban is an oral, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in late-stage clinical development. This study assessed effects of the direct FXa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, vs. the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, on venous thrombosis (VT), bleeding time (BT) and clotting times in rabbits.

Methods

We induced the formation of non-occlusive thrombus in VT models by placing threads in the vena cava, and induced bleeding by the incision of cuticles in anesthetized rabbits. Apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran were infused IV to achieve a stable plasma level. Clotting times, including the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), modified PT (mPT) and thrombin time (TT), were measured.

Results

Apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran exhibited dose-related efficacy in preventing VT with EC(50) of 65, 33 and 194 nm, respectively. At doses for 80% reduction of control thrombus, apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran prolonged BT by 1.13 ± 0.02-, 1.9 ± 0.1- ✱ and 4.4 ± 0.4-fold*, respectively (✱ p < 0.05, vs. apixaban). In the treatment model, these inhibitors equally prevented growth of a preformed thrombus. Antithrombotic doses of apixaban and rivaroxaban prolonged aPTT and PT by < 3-fold with no effect on TT. Dabigatran was ≥ 50-fold more potent in prolonging TT than aPTT and PT. Of the clotting assays studied, apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran responded the best to mPT.

Conclusion

Comparable antithrombotic efficacy was observed between apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran in the prevention and treatment of VT in rabbits. Apixaban and rivaroxaban exhibited lower BT compared with dabigatran at equivalent antithrombotic doses. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined.

### Unbiased high-throughput screening of drug-repurposing libraries identifies small-molecule inhibitors of clot retraction [^80068f29]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

It was notable that 2 factor Xa inhibitors, edoxaban and apixaban, were hits, with IPs of 1.25 and 0.625 μM, respectively. Edoxaban has been reported to decrease platelet aggregation in response to both thrombin and thrombin receptor cctivator peptide 2 hours after administration compared with baseline levels just before dosing in patients being treated for atrial fibrillation. Similar results were found with T6-induced platelet aggregation 2 hours after receiving apixaban or dabigatran. The mechanism(s) by which the factor Xa inhibitors reduce platelet aggregation is not established. Tsujimoto et al reported that although edoxaban and rivaroxaban did not inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation, they diminished the release of phosphorylated heat shock protein by decreasing HSP phosphorylation by P 44/p42 MAPK. For comparison, the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran had no effect on platelet activation or aggregation with several different agonists, including T6.

We found that 2 epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, poziotinib and naquotinib, also inhibited CR. Chen et al reported that ADAMDEC1 released from activated platelets hydrolyzes platelet membrane proepidermal growth factor (pro-EGF) to active high-molecular-weight EGF and that platelets are the sole source of EGF in plasma. They went on to show that EGF activates platelets by binding to the EGF receptor on platelets, leading to a rapid increase in cytosolic calcium, enhanced thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and increased speed of platelet deposition on the carotid arteries of mice in response to FeCl 3. Thus, these agents may be working by preventing platelet-generated EGF from activating platelets during the thrombin-induced CR. However, naquotinib has been reported to also inhibit Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and so it may be acting through this mechanism.

VTE: ASCO Guideline Update — evidence signals were a randomized controlled trial assessing apixaban for VTE treatment in patients with cancer (the CARAVAGGIO trial) and randomized controlled trials evaluating direct factor Xa inhibitors for extended postoperative thromboprophylaxis; apixaban was not listed as an option for VTE treatment in the 2019 guideline, nor were direct factor Xa inhibitors listed as options for perioperative thromboprophylaxis. The systematic review searched PubMed and the Cochrane library for randomized controlled trials published between November 1, 2018, and June 6, 2022, on treatment of VTE and perioperative thromboprophylaxis. Eligibility criteria specified adults with cancer, pharmacologic agents used for VTE treatment or for perioperative thromboprophylaxis versus placebo or usual care, outcomes of VTE and major bleeding, and sample size ≥ 50, while exclusions were meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals, editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews, and articles published in a non-English language. Evidence grading used defined categories in which evidence quality was rated as high, intermediate, low, or insufficient and strength of the recommendation as strong, moderate, or weak, with trial quality assessed using factors such as blinding, adequate random assignment, sufficient sample size, intention-to-treat analysis, and funding sources; a guideline implementability review was conducted to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice.

Rivaroxaban — antithrombotic mechanism and kinetic parameters — acts as a competitive inhibitor of factor Xa with a concentration-dependent effect and an inhibitory constant of 0.4 ± 0.02 nM, and has 10,000-fold greater selectivity for factor Xa than for other serine proteases. The onset of action is rapid and reversible, with a kinetic association rate constant of 1.7 × 10^7 mol/L^-1/s^-1 and a kinetic dissociation rate constant of 5 × 10^-3/s^-1; inhibitory activity is maintained when factor Xa is complexed with factor Va and Ca2+ on a phospholipid membrane (prothrombinase bound) and when factor Xa is bound to the clot. In plasma, endogenous human factor Xa is inhibited to cause dose-dependent prolongation of both the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), with the PT being more sensitive than the aPTT.

### Dissociation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once-daily rivaroxaban and twice-daily apixaban: a randomized crossover study [^bd7c9d52]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials In this crossover study the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban were compared. Healthy volunteers received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Rivaroxaban was associated with more prolonged inhibition of thrombin generation than apixaban. Rivaroxaban induced a clear prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.

Summary

Background The anticoagulant actions of the oral direct activated factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have not previously been directly compared. Objectives To compare directly the steady-state pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban at doses approved for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Methods Twenty-four healthy Caucasian male volunteers were included in this open-label, two-period crossover, phase 1 study (EudraCT number: 2015-002612-32). Volunteers were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by a washout period of at least 7 days before they received the other treatment. Plasma concentrations and anticoagulant effects were measured at steady state and after drug discontinuation. Results Overall exposure was similar for both drugs: the geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for the 0-24-h interval was 1830 μg h L -1 for rivaroxaban and 1860 μg h L -1 for apixaban. Rivaroxaban was associated with greater inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential (geometric mean area under the curve relative to baseline during the 0-24-h interval: 15.5 h versus 17.5 h) and a more pronounced maximal prolongation relative to baseline of prothrombin time (PT) (1.66-fold versus 1.14-fold) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (1.43-fold versus 1.16-fold) at steady state than apixaban. Conclusions Despite similar exposure to both drugs, rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was associated with greater and more sustained inhibition of thrombin generation than apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Sensitive PT and APTT assays can be used to estimate the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban.

### The role of the laboratory in treatment with new oral anticoagulants [^0aaccd2c]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Orally active small molecules that selectively and specifically inhibit coagulation serine proteases have been developed for clinical use. Dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban and apixaban are given at fixed doses and do not require monitoring. In most circumstances, these drugs have predictable bioavailability, pharmacokinetic effects, and pharmacodynamic effects. However, there will be clinical circumstances when assessment of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs will be required. The effect of these drugs on laboratory tests has been determined in vitro by spiking normal samples with a known concentration of active compound, or ex vivo by using plasma samples from volunteers and patients. Data on the sensitivity of different reagents are now available, and so guidance as to the effect and interpretation of a test result is now possible. Laboratories should be aware of the sensitivity of their own assays to each drug. This may be achieved by using appropriate calibrated plasma samples.

### Implementing the new oral anticoagulants into the hospital formulary [^a1795d9f]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants may prove to be one of most significant innovations in clinical practice in the past 60 years. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits Factor IIa. The predictable pharmacological profile of these new agents allows physicians to prescribe these drugs without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, which is the mainstay of warfarin therapy. In addition, these new agents have not been shown to have any food interactions and minimal drug-drug interactions, interactions are limited to the p-glycoprotein (p-Gp) transporter or cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system, each drug is unique in its drug interaction profile, as will be discussed below. These unique pharmacokinetics profiles may usher in for clinicians a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. In this article, the pharmacology of these new oral anticoagulants will be reviewed along with the major clinical trials evaluating the use of these agents for thromboembolic prophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplastic surgery, the treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

### Engineering and evaluation of FXa bypassing agents that restore hemostasis following apixaban associated bleeding [^91ac003a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The use of DOACs that target FXa is rapidly expanding, but a small percent of patients treated with DOACs show acute major bleeding, which can be fatal. Although severe bleeding occurs in a small percentage of patients, DOAC-associated bleeds are an important clinical concern due to the large (and growing) number of individuals treated with DOACs. A rapid reversal agent specific to DOACs, which is effective and safe, remains an unmet medical need. Two products currently used to control bleeding-associated FXa-targeting DOACs are (i) andexanet alfa (a catalytically inactive variant of human FXa which temporarily sequesters FXa inhibitors, is the only approved specific antidote for FXaDOACs and (ii) PCCs(a nonspecific product that has not been approved for reversal of the direct FXa inhibitors). The efficacy of these strategies has not been demonstrated in well-controlled double-blinded clinical trials and their use is associated with about 10% risks of thrombotic adverse events within 30 days after treatment. The increased risks of thrombosis may be due to the inhibition of TFPI in the case of andexanet alfa and an increase in plasma levels of prothrombin, FX and FIX following use of PCCs. However, it remains to be demonstrated if the risk is associated with the reversal strategy itself, the lack of anticoagulation or underlying risks in the patients.

An alternate strategy for the reversal of bleeding caused by DOACs is to engineer FXa variants that are insensitive to inhibition by DOACs. Here we report the design and characterization of FXa variants using two independent structure-based computational approaches. The design process included: (i) Design of substrate binding site which is also the DOACs binding pocket. (ii) Identification of mutations that could be deleterious vis-à-vis the stability or enzymatic function of the FXa molecule. (iii) Insertion of sequences of human origin and/or minimizing the number of amino acid substitutions to minimize the risk of immune responses to the engineered protein (immunogenicity). (iv) Disruption of the apixaban binding pocket. The primary advantages of starting with a computational approach are high throughput and a very large design space. Given the current state of the art, despite the use of sophisticated computational design tools and principles, there is the possibility that the protein designed fails to meet one or more of the critical criteria (stability, FXa enzymatic function, lack of inhibition by a DOAC).

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^a31bb439]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The need to overcome these limitations resulted in the development of a new class of oral anticoagulants, the non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs), also known as "direct oral anticoagulants". Currently, there are 5 NOACs that have completed phase III clinical trials and are approved for clinical use (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban). Contrary to VKAs that indirectly inhibit the synthesis of coagulation factors, NOACs directly inhibit specific coagulation factors. Dabigatran inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), whereas apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban inhibit activated factor X (Xa). 10 These agents have more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than VKAs and a wide therapeutic window, allowing for a fixed oral dosing, without the need for monitoring their anticoagulation effect. In addition, most have a short elimination half‐life compared with VKAs and rapid onset of action, achieving therapeutic levels in the plasma within 1 to 2 hours. 10 Betrixaban has distinct pharmacokinetic properties because it is minimally cleared by the liver and the kidneys and has a prolonged half‐life. 11 The terminal half‐life of betrixaban is 37 hours. Table 1 summarizes the landmark phase III clinical trials involving NOACs. These trials demonstrate noninferiority or superiority of NOACs compared with VKAs in stroke prevention in patients with AF, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and prevention 17, 18, 19 and treatment 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 of VTE, with a better safety profile. The results from phase III clinical trials on NOACs and the ease of their use have resulted in their progressively increasing utilization. However, some areas of uncertainty remain. First, their efficacy has not been validated in patients with severe mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves. RE‐ALIGN (A Randomised, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral DabIgatran Etexilate in Patients After Heart Valve Replacement), a phase II clinical trial of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves, was discontinued prematurely because of an increased rate of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. 26 Second, there are limited data in patients with cancer‐associated VTE or other hypercoagulable states, such as the anti‐phospholipid syndrome (APS), the nephrotic syndrome, and congenital coagulopathies. Third, the efficacy of NOACs has not been evaluated in patients with advanced renal insufficiency, end‐stage renal disease, or hepatic dysfunction. Fourth, important patient subgroups, such as pediatric patients and pregnant women, have not been adequately studied. Last, the prevalence and sequelae of physician underdosing warrants study, as does patient adherence and long‐term medication persistence. This review will expand on the treatment gaps in NOAC use and summarize indications where anticoagulation with indirectly acting anticoagulants such as VKAs and heparins will still be considered first‐line treatment pending further studies.

### Betrixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: results of a phase 2, randomized, dose-ranging study (explore-Xa) [^3aadfd89]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that affects an estimated 7 million people in the USA and the European Union with a median age of 75 years. The greatest risk associated with AF is ischaemic stroke resulting from embolism of thrombus from the left atrium. Guidelines recommend treatment with a vitamin K antagonist for stroke prevention in patients with AF based on the results of randomized, controlled trials comparing warfarin with placebo or no warfarin. – The use of warfarin is challenging because it has an unpredictable anticoagulant effect, a high propensity for food and drug interactions, and a risk of significant bleeding. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of contemporary randomized clinical trials comprising over 50 000 patient-years on warfarin revealed major bleeding rates ranging from 1.4 to 3.4% per year, and are likely higher outside the confines of a clinical trial. Routine coagulation monitoring is required, which is inconvenient for patients and costly for the health care system.

Thrombin plays a key role in arterial and venous thromboses by activating platelets and facilitating the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Recently, dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown to be superior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke with improved ease of use; and is available in many countries. Factor Xa is also an attractive target for anticoagulant therapy as it is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Rivaroxaban and apixaban, factor Xa inhibitors, have been shown to be effective for stroke prevention in AF. –

Betrixaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa inhibitor. It is rapidly absorbed with mean peak concentrations occurring 3 to 4 h after oral administration, a pharmacodynamic half-life of 20 h and a low peak-to-trough concentration ratio over each 24 h dosing period. Oral bioavailability of an 80 mg dose is 34% and protein binding is ∼60%. Betrixaban is mostly excreted unchanged in bile, with low (17%) renal excretion. When administered immediately after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, C max and AUC were reduced by ∼50% compared with the fasting state. Betrixaban is a substrate for efflux proteins, including P-glycoprotein; however, it is not a substrate for major CYP enzymes.

The study ARCADIA (original research) was published by Hooman Kamel and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without AF? In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the population was: 1015 patients (551 female, 464 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without AF, within 180 days of stroke. The key exclusion criteria were major-risk cardioembolic source including any history of AF or LVEF < 30%; definite indication or contraindication to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy; history of spontaneous ICH; CKD; clinically significant bleeding diathesis. In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 507 apixaban (an oral dose of 5 mg or 2.5 mg BID plus aspirin placebo) n = 508 aspirin (an oral dose of 81 mg once daily plus apixaban placebo). In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in recurrent stroke (4.4% vs. 4.4%; HR 1, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55). In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in recurrent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (4.1% vs. 4.4%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.44) No significant difference in recurrent stroke or death from any cause (7.3% vs. 6.8%; HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.52). In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major hemorrhage, death from all causes. In the ARCADIA (original research) study, the conclusion was: in patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without AF, within 180 days of stroke, apixaban was not superior to aspirin with respect to recurrent stroke.

### Factor Xa inhibitors versus vitamin K antagonists for preventing cerebral or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation [^0c16dc13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are now recommended in treatment guidelines for preventing stroke and systemic embolic events in people with atrial fibrillation (AF). This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of treatment with factor Xa inhibitors versus VKAs for preventing cerebral or systemic embolic events in people with AF.

Search Methods

We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Heart Group (September 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (August 2017), MEDLINE (1950 to April 2017), and Embase (1980 to April 2017). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies, authors and sponsors of relevant published trials. We used outcome data from marketing authorisation applications of apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban that were submitted to regulatory authorities in Europe and the USA.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared the effects of long-term treatment (lasting more than four weeks) with factor Xa inhibitors versus VKAs for preventing cerebral and systemic embolism in people with AF.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary efficacy outcome was the composite endpoint of all strokes and systemic embolic events. Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed the quality of the trials and the risk of bias. We calculated a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials using the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) by means of a fixed-effect model. In case of moderate or high heterogeneity of treatment effects, we used a random-effects model to compare the overall treatment effects. We also performed a pre-specified sensitivity analysis excluding any open-label studies.

Main Results

We included data from 67,688 participants randomised into 13 RCTs. The included trials directly compared dose-adjusted warfarin with either apixaban, betrixaban, darexaban, edoxaban, idraparinux, idrabiotaparinux, or rivaroxaban. The majority of the included data (approximately 90%) was from apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The composite primary efficacy endpoint of all strokes (both ischaemic and haemorrhagic) and non-central nervous systemic embolic events was reported in all of the included studies. Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly decreased the number of strokes and systemic embolic events compared with dose-adjusted warfarin in participants with AF (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; 13 studies; 67,477 participants; high-quality evidence). Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the number of major bleedings compared with warfarin (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.84; 13 studies; 67,396 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was, however, statistically significant and high heterogeneity (I 2 = 83%). When we repeated this analysis using a random-effects model, it did not show a statistically significant decrease in the number of major bleedings (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17). A pre-specified sensitivity analysis excluding all open-label studies showed that treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the number of major bleedings compared with warfarin (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81), but high heterogeneity was also observed in this analysis (I 2 = 72%). The same sensitivity analysis using a random-effects model also showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of major bleedings in participants treated with factor Xa inhibitors (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.96). Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the risk of intracranial haemorrhages (ICHs) compared with warfarin (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.59; 12 studies; 66,259 participants; high-quality evidence). We observed moderate, but statistically significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 55%). The pre-specified sensitivity analysis excluding open-label studies showed that treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor significantly reduced the number of ICHs compared with warfarin (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.56), with low, non-statistically significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 27%). Treatment with a factor Xa inhibitor also significantly reduced the number of all-cause deaths compared with warfarin (OR 0.89, 95% 0.83 to 0.95; 10 studies; 65,624 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment with factor Xa inhibitors significantly reduced the number of strokes and systemic embolic events compared with warfarin in people with AF. The absolute effect of factor Xa inhibitors compared with warfarin treatment was, however, rather small. Factor Xa inhibitors also reduced the number of ICHs, all-cause deaths and major bleedings compared with warfarin, although the evidence for a reduction in the latter is less robust.

### New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation [^e3d2942b]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for stroke. Currently, acetylsalicylic acid (a platelet inhibitor) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; oral anticoagulants), including warfarin, are the only approved antithrombotic therapies for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Although effective, VKAs have unpredictable pharmacological effects, requiring regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment to maintain effects within the therapeutic range. The clinical development pathway for novel anticoagulants often involves evaluation of efficacy and safety in a short-term indication, such as the prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), followed by longer-term VTE treatment studies, and finally chronic indications, including stroke prevention studies in patients with AF. The coagulation pathway provides many targets for novel anticoagulants, including Factor Xa (FXa) and Factor IIa (thrombin). Numerous oral, direct FXa inhibitors are in various stages of clinical development, including rivaroxaban, LY517717, YM150, DU-176b, apixaban, and betrixaban, and are anticipated to overcome the limitations of VKAs. Dabigatran is the only oral direct thrombin inhibitor in late-stage development. Studies of these agents for stroke prevention in patients with AF are planned or ongoing. If approved, they may represent the next generation of anticoagulants, by providing new therapeutic options for stroke prevention in patients with AF.

### Comprehensive synthesis and anticoagulant evaluation of a diverse fucoidan library [^518cdeb7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots within blood vessels, is the main underlying pathology of cardiovascular diseases, which remain the leading global cause of mortality. Anticoagulants are widely used in both medical and surgical settings to manage thrombotic events. Beyond the classical drugs such as heparin and warfarin, a range of heparin derivatives (e.g. enoxaparin and fondaparinux) and direct oral anticoagulants (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) have been developed. However, all the currently available anticoagulants target coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and/or thrombin (FIIa), which are located in the common pathway, downstream of the coagulation cascade, and are essential to hemostasis function. Despite their efficacy and widespread use, these anticoagulants are associated with a high risk of bleeding. This prompts researchers to search for safer alternatives. Particularly, emerging evidence underscores the critical role of the intrinsic coagulation pathway in coagulation propagation and thrombosis, while having a limited contribution to hemostasis. Therefore, targeting intrinsic coagulation factors is recognized as a promising strategy for achieving safer and more effective antithrombotic therapies.

### Reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^7e2ba666]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) include dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin, and apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, which inhibit coagulation factor Xa. Although clinical studies of NOACs were conducted without antidotes, patient outcomes with major bleeding when receiving NOACs were no worse than those in patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Nonetheless, in patients with life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery, the capacity for rapid NOAC reversal is likely to increase patient safety. Three NOAC reversal agents are in various stages of development: idarucizumab, a specific reversal agent for dabigatran; andexanet alfa, which reverses factor Xa inhibitors; and ciraparantag, which is purported to reverse all NOACs. Idarucizumab is licensed in many countries, andexanet is under consideration by regulatory agencies, and ciraparantag is undergoing phase III evaluation. In the absence of licensed reversal agents for the oral factor Xa inhibitors, prothrombin complex concentrates are often used in patients taking these agents who present with life-threatening bleeding. In this Review, we summarize the approved indications for the NOACs, outline how to measure their anticoagulant effects, describe the mechanism of action of the reversal strategies, assess the preclinical and clinical data supporting their use, provide guidance on potential indications for reversal, and offer a management approach for patients treated with NOACs who present with serious bleeding or require urgent surgery.

### Anticoagulant therapy for mechanical heart valves-unmet need persists [^ca6ade23]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban or dabigatran have revolutionized anticoagulant treatment. These drugs, which specifically inhibit either factor Xa or thrombin, respectively, are at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism and have important safety advantages that include reduced risks of intracranial hemorrhage, fatal bleeding, and all-cause mortality. 1–3 They are also much easier to use because they are given in a fixed dose without routine laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect and dose adjustment in the individual patient.

### Dabigatran but not rivaroxaban or apixaban treatment decreases fibrinolytic resistance in patients with atrial fibrillation [^e6c31206]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most anticoagulants stimulate fibrinolysis in vitro through mechanisms dependent on and independent of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). We evaluated the effect of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban treatment on plasma fibrinolysis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

Methods and Results

Patients treated with dabigatran etexilate (n = 22), rivaroxaban (n = 24) or apixaban (n = 22) were studied. Plasma was obtained before (trough) and 2h after drug intake (peak). Fibrinolytic resistance of clots exposed to exogenous tissue plasminogen activator was significantly lower in peak than in trough samples and correlated with drug concentration only in dabigatran group. Moreover, fibrinolytic resistance at peak was lower in dabigatran than in rivaroxaban and apixaban groups. This difference disappeared if the TAFI pathway was inhibited. Thrombin generation and TAFI activation were markedly lower in peak than in trough samples in all three groups. However, TAFIa levels in trough and peak samples were significantly lower in dabigatran group than in rivaroxaban and apixaban groups. Circulating levels of prothrombin fragment F1+2 (reflecting in vivo thrombin generation) and plasmin-antiplasmin complex (reflecting plasmin generation) were not or barely influenced by drug levels in all groups.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that dabigatran, contrary to rivaroxaban and apixaban, reduces fibrinolytic resistance by virtue of its greater impact on TAFI activation. The profibrinolytic effect of dabigatran may play a role locally, at sites of fibrin formation, by making the nascent thrombus more susceptible to plasminogen-dependent degradation.

### Comparative analysis and meta-analysis of major clinical trials with oral factor Xa inhibitors versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation [^3aecf0b3]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition associated with important complications, including stroke. Anticoagulation with warfarin leads to a decreased incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with AF. Warfarin therapy in AF is associated with significant side effects, namely haemorrhagic phenomena. Warfarin use implies INR (international normalised ratio) monitoring, since genetic aspectsand interactions with food and other drugs are not uncommon. These aspects have resulted in an interest in developing new therapeutic approaches.

New anticoagulant drugs have been presented, with mechanisms of action different from warfarin: dabigatran, a thrombin inhibitor, and apixaban, rivaroxabanand edoxaban, as factor Xa inhibitor oral anticoagulant (XOAC) drugs. In what concerns factor Xa inhibitors, the three aforementioned drugs have shown interesting effects in patients with AF, in large clinical trials carried out with warfarin as the comparator drug.

The purpose of the present report was to compare the major results obtained with each of the three XOAC drugs, not only by analysing the clinical trial data, but also by carrying out a meta-analysis, aiming at the possible identification of patterns common to the different XOAC therapies. Since edoxaban was used in two different dosages in the Engage-AF Timi 48 trial, four different sets of data are in fact available. Data obtained with dabigatran were not used, since the drug has a different mechanism of action, and the inclusion of dabigatran data would lack biological meaning.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulants can be classified into conventional vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (Table 1). The prototype drug among VKAs is warfarin, which until recently was the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant worldwide. Acenocoumarol, fluindione, and phenprocoumon are the other less commonly used VKAs. Based on their mechanism of action, DOACs are classified into direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) (Fig. 1).

As compared to VKAs, DOACs have certain pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic advantages. They have a rapid onset of action, more predictable anticoagulation profile, wider therapeutic window, no need for monitoring, and fewer food-drug and drug-drug interactions. Several meta-analyses of large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with atrial fibrillation have shown that DOACs are superior (dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban) or noninferior (dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) to VKAs in terms of stroke prevention, with similar (dabigatran 150 mg) or lower bleeding rates (dabigatran 110 mg, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Current guidelines thus advocate DOACs as the first-choice oral anticoagulant except in certain situations, such as mechanical heart valves, patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, or patients requiring a higher net anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] > 3).

### Andexanet alfa for the reversal of factor Xa inhibitor activity [^9eb77f30]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Bleeding is a complication of treatment with factor Xa inhibitors, but there are no specific agents for the reversal of the effects of these drugs. Andexanet is designed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of factor Xa inhibitors.

Methods

Healthy older volunteers were given 5 mg of apixaban twice daily or 20 mg of rivaroxaban daily. For each factor Xa inhibitor, a two-part randomized placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate andexanet administered as a bolus or as a bolus plus a 2-hour infusion. The primary outcome was the mean percent change in anti-factor Xa activity, which is a measure of factor Xa inhibition by the anticoagulant.

Results

Among the apixaban-treated participants, anti-factor Xa activity was reduced by 94% among those who received an andexanet bolus (24 participants), as compared with 21% among those who received placebo (9 participants) (P < 0.001), and unbound apixaban concentration was reduced by 9.3 ng per milliliter versus 1.9 ng per milliliter (P < 0.001); thrombin generation was fully restored in 100% versus 11% of the participants (P < 0.001) within 2 to 5 minutes. Among the rivaroxaban-treated participants, anti-factor Xa activity was reduced by 92% among those who received an andexanet bolus (27 participants), as compared with 18% among those who received placebo (14 participants) (P < 0.001), and unbound rivaroxaban concentration was reduced by 23.4 ng per milliliter versus 4.2 ng per milliliter (P < 0.001); thrombin generation was fully restored in 96% versus 7% of the participants (P < 0.001). These effects were sustained when andexanet was administered as a bolus plus an infusion. In a subgroup of participants, transient increases in levels of d-dimer and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 were observed, which resolved within 24 to 72 hours. No serious adverse or thrombotic events were reported.

Conclusions

Andexanet reversed the anticoagulant activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban in older healthy participants within minutes after administration and for the duration of infusion, without evidence of clinical toxic effects.

After years of only oral vitamin K antagonists, there are new many new antithrombotic agents in development and on entering the marketplace. This review will analyze clinical trial results for these new agents-especially dibigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixiban. Also to be discussed are practical aspects of use of these new agents such monitoring, reversal, and use before procedures.

Discussion

In a double-blind randomized controlled study, we assessed the effects of PAR4 antagonism with BMS-986141 and factor Xa inhibition with apixaban, alone and in combination, on human platelet aggregation, activation, and ex vivo thrombus formation. Consistent with its known pharmacological actions, BMS-986141 markedly inhibited PAR4-mediated platelet aggregation and activation, and this was unaffected by concomitant factor Xa inhibition with apixaban. Importantly, when used in combination with apixaban, BMS-986141 produced an additional modest reduction in total thrombus area, which was attributable to inhibition of platelet-rich thrombus, especially under conditions of high shear stress. This suggests a potential additive benefit of combined factor Xa and PAR4 antagonism, which could provide a novel therapeutic antithrombotic strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular events that requires further exploration.

Using the venous effluent from the perfusion chamber, we confirmed that we had achieved high concentrations of BMS-986141 in the perfusion chamber, and this was predicted to have a near maximal inhibitory effect on platelet PAR4 receptors. Indeed, at this concentration, we confirmed that BMS-986141 selectively inhibited PAR4-mediated platelet aggregation and activation, whereas apixaban had no discernible effect. Moreover, BMS-986141, but not apixaban, caused a clear and marked reduction in platelet-rich thrombus formation, especially under conditions of high shear stress. This confirms our previous findingsthat PAR4 antagonism is an effective antiplatelet agent that would be anticipated to inhibit and to reduce arterial thrombosis.

We have previously demonstrated that bivalirudin — a direct thrombin inhibitor — and JNJ-64179375 — an exosite 1 thrombin inhibitor — inhibit fibrin-rich thrombus formation in this ex vivo model of acute arterial injury. Consistent with their anticoagulant action, they inhibited fibrin-rich thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner. Apixaban (10–160 ng/mL) has also been studied in perfusion chamber models and has similarly demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in thrombus area. We have here confirmed these findings and demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in thrombus formation and specifically fibrin-rich thrombus as would be anticipated by its mode of action.

### The mechanism of action of rivaroxaban – an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor – compared with other anticoagulants [^45b39522]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Although results of some phase III clinical trials of new oral anticoagulants are now known, it is important to understand the mechanisms of their actions. These new agents exert their anticoagulant effect via direct inhibition of a single Factor within the coagulation cascade (such as Factor Xa or thrombin). Rivaroxaban — the first oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor — is a small-molecule oxazolidinone derivative that binds directly and reversibly to Factor Xa via the S1 and S4 pockets. Rivaroxaban competitively inhibits Factor Xa and is more than 10,000-fold more selective for Factor Xa than other related serine proteases, and it does not require cofactors (such as antithrombin) to exert its anticoagulant effect. Unlike indirect Factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban inhibits both free and clot-bound Factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity, thereby prolonging clotting times. Dabigatran etexilate is a direct thrombin inhibitor that inhibits both free and fibrin-bound thrombin. Although the mechanism of action differs between the direct Factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors, phase III studies of these new agents confirmed that both Factor Xa and thrombin are viable anticoagulation targets.
