## Question

Clopidogrel for hemophilia A

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using clopidogrel in patients with hemophilia A and how to operationalize it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenarios that necessitate clopidogrel in hemophilia A, such as ACS and PCI. Then, I should verify the risk–benefit balance of antiplatelet therapy in this bleeding-prone population. Next, I will define hemostatic prerequisites and FVIII targets, followed by dosing strategy and peri-procedural considerations. After that, I need to check evidence from reports and special populations including patients with inhibitors, review contraindications, interactions, and genetic factors, outline monitoring and duration, and finally synthesize practical recommendations and alternatives while qualifying the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication. Persons with hemophilia A may still present with ACS or require PCI, and in such settings antithrombotic therapy including dual antiplatelet therapy is often required to prevent stent thrombosis and MACE, provided the coagulation defect is adequately corrected with factor replacement therapy, which is the central modification for this population [^112AsgFn] [^116VRJQ6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before defining the risk–benefit paradox. The benefit of DAPT with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor after PCI is well-established in general guidelines, and clopidogrel is recommended when prasugrel or ticagrelor are unavailable or contraindicated, but in hemophilia this benefit must be weighed against additive bleeding from platelet inhibition on top of FVIII deficiency and observational signals of higher bleeding in PWH on antiplatelet therapy, so the hemostatic balance is delicate and requires careful individualization [^111VqXBb] [^115V5wqN] [^116VRJQ6].

> I need to ensure hemostatic prerequisites are set before any antiplatelet exposure. Current expert guidance recommends peri-procedural FVIII peaks of at least 80% for PCI, maintenance of trough FVIII levels no less than 30% during the DAPT period, and that troughs around 5% are sufficient once patients transition to long-term aspirin monotherapy, with severe hemophilia requiring prophylaxis for the entire duration of antithrombotic therapy; some authors advocate troughs of 20–50% during DAPT depending on bleeding risk, which I should reconcile to the higher-quality recommendation of at least 30% during DAPT [^112AsgFn] [^115SiUhF] [^113wiwup].

> Wait, let me verify the antiplatelet dosing protocol itself. For PCI, a clopidogrel loading dose of 300–600 mg is guideline-concordant, and hemophilia-specific reviews recommend 600 mg alongside aspirin 325 mg as pre-PCI loading, followed by clopidogrel 75 mg daily with aspirin 80–100 mg daily, aiming for the shortest effective DAPT duration to mitigate bleeding risk, rather than a fixed 12-month course for everyone with ACS [^111VqXBb] [^115V5wqN] [^116VRJQ6].

> I should double-check feasibility data. A detailed case report of a 76-year-old man with severe hemophilia A undergoing radial-access PCI used pre-procedural FVIII to achieve a peak above 80%, UFH bolus, clopidogrel 600 mg plus aspirin 325 mg loading, and short inpatient DAPT, with no bleeding complications, which supports the strategy when strict hemostatic coverage is maintained [^113wiwup].

> Next, I will examine special populations and procedural modifications. In patients with FVIII inhibitors, standard FVIII is ineffective and bypassing agents such as rFVIIa or FEIBA are suggested peri-PCI, with a preference — when clinically permissible — for aspirin monotherapy rather than prolonged DAPT due to bleeding risk; in these complex scenarios, emicizumab prophylaxis complicates monitoring and necessitates bovine chromogenic assays for FVIII activity, and radial access should be prioritized to reduce bleeding and vascular complications [^113B9dyQ] [^112AsgFn] [^115SiUhF].

> But wait, what about absolute contraindications and key drug interactions. I should confirm that active pathological bleeding is a contraindication to clopidogrel, and that omeprazole and esomeprazole, as CYP2C19 inhibitors, should be avoided given reduced clopidogrel activation, while broader interaction data underscore the need to avoid strong CYP2C19 inhibition; in addition, the clopidogrel boxed warning advises against use in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, so genotype may influence agent choice or require alternative strategies [^111TNykz] [^117RYZm8] [^114ZoaQL].

> Let me think about genetic and pharmacodynamic variability. CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are common and contribute to clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness, and while stronger P2Y12 inhibitors overcome much variability, they also raise bleeding risk in general populations; in hemophilia, this pushes me to reaffirm factor targets if clopidogrel is used, and to be cautious with switching to more potent agents unless the ischemic risk is compelling and hemostasis can be assured [^1159QyHF] [^116WNw6o].

> Next, I should review monitoring and duration strategy. Routine platelet function testing to guide clopidogrel therapy is not recommended given lack of validated associations with outcomes, so clinical surveillance for bleeding and FVIII level monitoring against targets should drive care, and the DAPT duration should be the shortest effective period consistent with stent choice and ischemic risk, recognizing that while 12 months has been a default for ACS, shorter courses may be considered in high bleeding risk patients with modern stents, with decisions individualized and coordinated across cardiology and hematology teams [^115xtRy5] [^112QSaUz].

> Hold on, I should verify perioperative management because interruptions are common. Clopidogrel should generally be discontinued 5 days before elective surgery to mitigate bleeding, with aspirin often continued if clinically indicated, and resumption should occur once hemostasis is secured under appropriate factor coverage, acknowledging that earlier surgery after discontinuation may be reasonable in select urgent scenarios but demands heightened hemostatic vigilance in hemophilia [^111TNykz] [^116A694k].

> I will now synthesize practical, stepwise recommendations. Use clopidogrel in hemophilia A only under strict hemostatic protection: raise FVIII to peaks of at least 80% for PCI and maintain troughs of at least 30% for the entire DAPT period; load with clopidogrel 600 mg plus aspirin 300–325 mg around PCI when indicated, then continue clopidogrel 75 mg daily with aspirin 80–100 mg daily for the shortest effective DAPT duration, after which long-term aspirin monotherapy can be supported at FVIII troughs near 5% if tolerated, with radial access preferred, contraindications and CYP2C19 interactions screened, and close multidisciplinary follow-up for bleeding surveillance and FVIII monitoring throughout [^112AsgFn] [^111VqXBb] [^115V5wqN] [^116VRJQ6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if clopidogrel is not optimal or not activating due to genotype or interactions. Alternatives such as prasugrel or ticagrelor are more potent but generally carry higher bleeding risk and have specific contraindications, making them less attractive in hemophilia unless ischemic risk is very high and robust hemostatic support is available; cangrelor offers rapid on–off intravenous P2Y12 inhibition for PCI with quick reversibility, but hemophilia-specific data are lacking, so use would still require stringent factor coverage and careful procedural planning [^116WNw6o] [^112Ms96o] [^111VqXBb] [^115V5wqN].

> I should confirm the overall strength of evidence before concluding. Most recommendations here derive from expert consensus, adapted general cardiology guidelines, and case series rather than randomized trials in hemophilia, so the evidence quality is low to moderate at best, but represents current best practice and emphasizes individualized, team-based care to balance thrombosis prevention with bleeding control in PWH [^116VRJQ6] [^notfound].

Clopidogrel is **not routinely recommended** in hemophilia A [^112wURh7] because combined platelet inhibition [^113wnj3Z] and factor VIII deficiency confer a **high bleeding risk** [^116VRJQ6]. It should be used only when **absolutely necessary** (e.g. after PCI) [^116VRJQ6], with close hematology–cardiology coordination [^112Lt7Ah] and factor VIII replacement to maintain troughs ≥ 30% during DAPT and ≥ 80% peri-PCI [^112AsgFn]. Prefer second-generation DES with 1 month of DAPT, followed by aspirin monotherapy; avoid clopidogrel in severe hemophilia or active bleeding, and monitor closely for bleeding complications.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Clopidogrel is a prodrug [^113gGRJW] activated by hepatic CYP450 to an active metabolite [^113wnj3Z] that **irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation** [^1159QyHF] for the platelet lifespan (7–10 days). This **irreversible effect** increases bleeding risk, especially in patients with underlying coagulopathies such as hemophilia A [^113JCGgE].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **limited direct evidence** regarding clopidogrel use specifically in hemophilia A [^112wURh7]. However, consensus and expert opinion indicate that antiplatelet therapy, including clopidogrel [^116VRJQ6], **significantly increases bleeding risk** in this population. The French registry [^116VRJQ6] reported an **increased bleeding frequency** in hemophilia patients treated with antiplatelet medications compared with those not receiving such therapy.

---

## Risks and benefits

### Risks

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Clopidogrel significantly increases the risk of bleeding complications [^113wnj3Z], including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage [^114kDM5V], and postoperative bleeding [^112kQLKd].

- **Irreversible platelet inhibition**: The irreversible nature [^113wnj3Z] of clopidogrel's antiplatelet effect complicates management of bleeding episodes, as platelet function cannot be rapidly restored [^113qn1bE].

- **Drug interactions**: Clopidogrel interacts with other medications, such as proton pump inhibitors and statins, potentially reducing its efficacy or increasing bleeding risk [^117RYZm8] [^111TNykz].

---

### Benefits

Evidence supports **prevention of thrombotic events** with clopidogrel — such as myocardial infarction and stroke — in the general population [^113wnj3Z] [^111VqXBb]. In hemophilia A, it may provide **cardiovascular protection** for patients with significant risk factors or established cardiovascular disease, albeit with increased bleeding risk [^116VRJQ6].

---

## Clinical scenarios for clopidogrel use in hemophilia A

Clopidogrel **may be considered** in hemophilia A under specific clinical circumstances, including:

- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**: Clopidogrel may be used in combination with aspirin (dual antiplatelet therapy) [^111VqXBb] for the shortest possible duration, typically one month, followed by aspirin monotherapy [^116VRJQ6].

- **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**: Clopidogrel is recommended for short-term use (one month) following PCI with second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES).

- **Atrial fibrillation (AF)**: In patients with AF and high thrombotic risk, clopidogrel may be considered as an alternative to oral anticoagulation, although this approach is controversial and not universally recommended.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Clopidogrel is **contraindicated** or should be used with **extreme caution** in patients with hemophilia A who have:

- **Severe hemophilia**: Patients with severe hemophilia (factor VIII levels < 1%) are generally not treated with clopidogrel due to high bleeding risk.

- **Active bleeding**: Clopidogrel is contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding, such as peptic ulcer bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage [^111TNykz].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Patients with hypersensitivity to clopidogrel or other thienopyridines should not receive clopidogrel [^111TNykz].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

To minimize bleeding complications in patients with hemophilia A receiving clopidogrel, regular factor VIII replacement therapy is recommended [^116VRJQ6] to **maintain trough levels of at least 30%** during dual antiplatelet therapy and **80% during peri-procedural periods** [^112AsgFn]. Close clinical and laboratory monitoring for signs of bleeding — including hemoglobin levels, platelet counts, and coagulation parameters — is advised [^112wURh7]. A **multidisciplinary approach** [^112Lt7Ah] involving hematologists, cardiologists, and other specialists helps balance bleeding and thrombotic risks effectively.

---

## Alternative antiplatelet therapies

Alternative antiplatelet therapies (prasugrel, ticagrelor) **may be considered** in patients with hemophilia A. However, these agents also **carry significant bleeding risks** [^114Crd2J] and should be **used cautiously**, with careful monitoring and individualized risk assessment [^116WNw6o] [^116bxwp2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Clopidogrel is **not routinely recommended** in patients with hemophilia A because of the high risk of bleeding complications [^112wURh7]. However, in select scenarios — such as acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention — it **may be used cautiously** [^111VqXBb] with appropriate factor replacement therapy [^112AsgFn] and close monitoring. The decision to use clopidogrel should be **individualized**, balancing bleeding risk against thrombotic benefit, and made within a multidisciplinary team approach [^112Lt7Ah].

Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, indicated for the prevention of ischemic stroke and in-stent thrombosis. However, it has several drawbacks, including an increased risk of hemorrhage, a clinical effect that is slow in onset and irreversible, a genetically determined variability in its clinical potency, and interactions with other commonly administered drugs.

### How we manage cardiovascular disease in patients with hemophilia [^116VRJQ6]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

The delicate balance between coagulation and anticoagulation in patients with hemophilia (PWH) with acute coronary syndrome deserves special attention. Regarding heparin anticoagulation, a single intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be started before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the dosages reported in Figure 2. According to recent guidelines for non-hemophilia patients, continuous UFH infusion following revascularization is no longer required. UFH is preferable to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) because the anticoagulant effect can be easily measured by means of a simple point-of-care test (the activated clotting time), it has a shorter half-life (1–2 vs. 4–5 hours), and protamine sulfate is available as an antidote.

In addition to UFH, PWH are usually treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel, according to general guideline recommendations and evidence from published case series of PWH. We recommend a loading dose of 325 mg aspirin and 600 mg clopidogrel before PCI. Afterwards, PCI dual antiplatelet therapy is warranted to prevent stent thrombosis; however, this is inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding related to the combination of the inherited coagulation defect with drug-induced platelet dysfunction. In the French registry that collected information on long-term antithrombotic treatments prescribed to PWH with cardiovascular disease (CVD), bleeding was more frequent in patients treated with antiplatelet medications than in those without. Therefore, in order to minimize the risk of bleeding, we recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 80–100 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for the shortest possible time.

### Brilinta [^116bxwp2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

BRILINTA, like other antiplatelet agents, can cause significant and sometimes fatal bleeding. Do not use BRILINTA in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of intracranial hemorrhage. Do not start BRILINTA in patients undergoing urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing BRILINTA, as stopping BRILINTA increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.

- **Warning: Bleeding risk**: See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

Please note the potential for significant bleeding risks when using BRILINTA, similar to other antiplatelet agents. Proper precautions should be taken to manage and minimize these risks.

### Innohep [^112u9PVH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2008). Low credibility.

Innohep® is contraindicated in patients with active major bleeding, in those with or with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or in patients with hypersensitivity to tinzaparin sodium. Additionally, patients aged 90 years or older with creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min should not be treated with Innohep®. Those with known hypersensitivity to heparin, sulfites, benzyl alcohol, or pork products should also avoid Innohep®.

### Reversal of clopidogrel-induced bleeding with rFVIIa in healthy subjects: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, exploratory study [^114mZ8Gy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel (Plavix®) therapy, although effective for minimizing the risk of thrombotic events, is also associated with potential bleeding risk. Recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven®) induces hemostasis in hemophilia patients with inhibitors (alloantibodies) and has been proposed as a potential treatment for mitigating clopidogrel therapy-mediated bleeding.

- **Methods**: In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation, exploratory phase I trial, we assessed the safety and effects of rFVIIa in reversing clopidogrel-enhanced bleeding in an experimentally induced punch biopsy in healthy subjects. Efficacy assessments included the reversal of bleeding characteristics (bleed duration [BD], the primary endpoint and blood loss volume [BV] induced by punch biopsy, and thromboelastograph [TEG®] parameters) with rFVIIa or placebo after clopidogrel treatment.

- **Results**: A significant number of subjects (56%) had a limited response to clopidogrel (defined as ≤ 30% platelet aggregation inhibition) and were discontinued from the study. The remaining subjects continued and had four biopsies. Of the 40 subjects randomized, 37 were evaluated for efficacy. Clopidogrel treatment increased BD and BV compared with the baseline biopsy. Recombinant FVIIa (10 and 20 μg/kg) significantly mitigated the clopidogrel-induced effects on BV (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001, respectively). Early trial termination limited the evaluation of the effects of higher rFVIIa doses. Subgroup analyses of subjects biopsied by the same physician demonstrated significant reduction of clopidogrel-induced bleeding.

### Cardiovascular disease in hereditary haemophilia: The challenges of longevity [^115SiUhF]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Management of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with haemophilia (PWH) presents unique challenges. Standard management typically involves antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, and invasive procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Deployment of bare metal stents (BMS) or drug-eluting stents (DES), and/or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be required for definitive revascularization. However, it is unclear to what extent evidence-based guidelines for the general population apply to PWH.

It has been suggested that the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in PWH should align with the general population, with necessary haemostatic modifications. An expert consensus publication in 2013 recommended that primary PCI should be preferred over thrombolysis due to the increased bleeding risk associated with thrombolysis. Thrombolysis should only be used when PCI is inaccessible. Invasive treatment of ACS should be performed as soon as possible under adequate clotting factor protection. Radial access is recommended over femoral access for angiography, reflecting the general population's guidelines due to the reduction in major bleeding, vascular complications, and mortality.

The consensus indicated that trough FVIII/FIX should be around 50% within 24 hours of PCI, with minimum trough levels not falling below 5%–15% on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) post-PCI. Given more recent data on bleeding risks associated with antithrombotic therapy, discussed in more detail below, we advocate for maintaining FVIII/FIX levels above 20% on DAPT. Regarding the choice of stent, historical recommendations preferred the use of BMS over DES.

### How we manage cardiovascular disease in patients with hemophilia [^112AsgFn]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

- **Management of acute coronary syndrome**: Persons with hemophilia (PWH) with coronary artery disease (CAD) can be treated with anti-thrombotic agents, provided their coagulation defect is adequately corrected with factor replacement therapy. The dosage and intervals of factor administration should be tailored to attain a specific target plasma factor level. We recommend a trough factor level of no less than 30% for treating acute coronary syndrome during the dual antiplatelet period. A higher peak factor level (≥ 80%) is warranted during the peri-procedural percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) period, whereas trough factor levels of approximately 5% are sufficient during long-term aspirin monotherapy. This target level can be achieved with factor concentrate administration every other day or at more extended intervals using extended half-life concentrates. For patients with severe hemophilia, factor replacement prophylaxis is indicated for the duration of antithrombotic drug prescription. In rare instances requiring thrombolysis, more intensive factor replacement (trough 50% and peak ≥ 80%) should be provided.

- **Challenges in PWH with alloantibodies**: A particularly challenging situation is the management of acute coronary syndrome in PWH who have developed alloantibodies that inactivate the coagulant activity of infused coagulation factors. This occurs in up to 30% of cases with severe hemophilia A.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of fitusiran prophylaxis, and perioperative management, in people with hemophilia A or B [^111Y8UGT]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Bleeding in hemophilia A and B results from deficiencies of factor VIII (FVIII) and FIX, respectively, leading to insufficient thrombin generation (TG) and disrupted hemostasis. Treatment strategies for restoring TG to achieve hemostasis in people with hemophilia currently rely on replacing or mimicking the deficient factor. Prophylaxis is recommended as the standard of care for those with a severe bleeding phenotype; until recently, the mainstay prophylactic therapy has been to replace the deficient factor with clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) or to treat with bypassing agents (BPAs) when inhibitors are present.

Nonfactor therapies are being developed as alternative therapeutic agents that are not neutralized by anti-factor inhibitors. Emicizumab, the first approved agent in this class, is a bispecific monoclonal antibody administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection, mimicking the action of activated FVIII. It has been approved for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A, with or without inhibitors.

- **Rebalancing agents**: Aim to increase TG by inhibition of naturally occurring anticoagulants such as antithrombin (AT), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and activated protein C. Concizumab, a monoclonal antibody against tissue factor pathway inhibitor, was first approved in Canada in 2023 for the treatment of hemophilia B with inhibitors.

Gene therapy products have also been recently approved, such as valoctocogene roxaparvovec and etranacogene dezaparvovec, which aim to treat or mitigate the effects of hemophilia.

### Cardiovascular disease in hereditary haemophilia: The challenges of longevity [^115D895Y]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Previous consensus recommendations based on expert opinion have differed, but mainly suggest considering anticoagulation when FVIII/FIX is greater than 20%–30%. Based on more recent data, it may be reasonable to reduce this level to 20% in people with HAS‐BLED scores of less than 3, but the bleeding and thrombosis risks are finely balanced. DOACs are recommended over vitamin-K antagonists due to a reduced risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with high CHADS2VASC scores and factor levels of less than 20% are a particularly challenging group, and antiplatelet monotherapy has previously been recommended. Given that antiplatelet monotherapy has not been shown to be effective in AF in the general population, and is associated with a significantly increased bleeding risk in PWH, we would not advocate using this for AF in PWH. Non-anticoagulant options and the efficacy of low-dose DOACs should be investigated in PWH with AF.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^111VqXBb]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning antiplatelet therapy, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend initiating clopidogrel at a loading dose of 300–600 mg. A maintenance dose of 75 mg once daily should be administered when prasugrel or ticagrelor is unavailable, cannot be tolerated, or is contraindicated.

### Antiplatelet effects of aspirin vary with level of P2Y₁₂ receptor blockade supplied by either ticagrelor or prasugrel [^1179Xqj4]. Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy, comprising aspirin and a P2Y₁₂ receptor inhibitor, is firmly established for the secondary prevention of thrombotic events with the rationale that they inhibit thromboxane A₂ (TxA₂) and ADP-P2Y₁₂-dependent pathways of platelet activation, respectively. We have recently reported that strong P2Y₁₂ receptor blockade alone can provide inhibition of platelet aggregation to a broad range of agonists that is not further enhanced by aspirin. While the clinical relevance of these observations is unclear, we have speculated that administration of aspirin to individuals achieving sufficiently strong P2Y₁₂ receptor blockade has the potential to produce effects secondary to inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase at non-platelet sites, without providing additional antithrombotic activity. The degree of P2Y₁₂ pathway blockade achieved in clinical practice, however, is quite variable, reflecting both the choice of drug and large inter-individual differences in drug metabolism. Here, we have extended our previous observations of the interactions between aspirin and strong P2Y₁₂ blockade by considering what additional anti-aggregatory effects aspirin provides when only partial P2Y₁₂ blockade is achieved, which may better reflect the clinical reality of these drugs.

We measured aggregation responses of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) using 96-well plate light transmission aggregometry, as previously described. Blood was collected by venepuncture into tri-sodium citrate (0.32% final) from healthy volunteers who had abstained from non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.

### How we manage cardiovascular disease in patients with hemophilia [^113wiwup]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

In January 2016, a 76-year-old man with severe hemophilia A was admitted to the emergency department of the Mantova City Hospital for acute coronary syndrome. He was on prophylactic replacement therapy with a plasma-derived FVIII concentrate (Haemoctin®, Biotest Pharma, Dreieich, Germany) administered on alternate days. The patient suffered from chronic arthropathy and had undergone total hip arthroplasty in 1993 and transurethral prostate resection in 2011, both surgeries being performed under hemostatic coverage with the FVIII concentrate.

His chronic atrial fibrillation was managed with low-dose aspirin as the only antithrombotic prophylaxis. He had a family history positive for cardiovascular disease and several additional cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, obesity (body mass index of 32), and dyslipidemia.

After hospital admission, he underwent percutaneous coronary angiography (via radial access), which showed critical stenosis of the interventricular anterior and right coronary arteries. Two bare metal stents were deployed under hemostatic coverage with Haemoctin® (4000 IU) with the goal of obtaining a peak FVIII level in plasma of at least 80% prior to the revascularization procedure. Before this, an intravenous bolus of 5000 IU unfractionated heparin was administered, followed by a loading dose of 325 mg aspirin and 600 mg clopidogrel. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 100 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily was also planned.

The patient was discharged after three days with no bleeding complications.

### The platelet P2Y₁₂ receptor for adenosine diphosphate: congenital and drug-induced defects [^1159QyHF]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

The P2Y₁₂ receptor, a G(i)-coupled platelet receptor for adenosine diphosphate (ADP), is crucial in platelet function. Patients with congenital P2Y₁₂ defects exhibit a mild to moderate bleeding diathesis, marked by mucocutaneous bleedings and significant post-surgical and post-traumatic blood loss. Defects in P2Y₁₂ should be suspected when ADP, even at high concentrations (≥ 10 μM), fails to induce full, irreversible platelet aggregation. To confirm the diagnosis, tests evaluating the inhibition degree of adenylyl cyclase by ADP are recommended.

Drugs inhibiting P2Y₁₂ are potent antithrombotic agents, highlighting the critical role of P2Y₁₂ in platelet thrombus formation. Clopidogrel, the most commonly used drug inhibiting P2Y₁₂, is effective both as monotherapy and in combination with acetylsalicylic acid. However, a significant drawback of clopidogrel is its inability to adequately inhibit P2Y₁₂-dependent platelet function in about one-third of patients, who consequently remain unprotected from major cardiovascular events.

New drugs, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, effectively inhibit P2Y₁₂ in most patients and have demonstrated greater efficacy than clopidogrel in preventing major cardiovascular events. Although these new P2Y₁₂ inhibitors increase the incidence of major bleedings, the overall clinical benefit favors their use.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^115V5wqN]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, particularly concerning antiplatelet therapy, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend initiating clopidogrel at a loading dose of 300–600 mg and a maintenance dose of 75 mg once daily. This is advised when prasugrel or ticagrelor is unavailable, cannot be tolerated, or is contraindicated.

### Clopidogrel-drug interactions [^117RYZm8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Multidrug therapy increases the risk for drug-drug interactions. Clopidogrel, a prodrug, requires hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic activation to produce the active metabolite that inhibits the platelet P2Y₁₂ adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, thus decreasing platelet activation and aggregation processes.

Atorvastatin, omeprazole, and several other drugs have been shown in pharmacodynamic studies to competitively inhibit CYP activation of clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel responsiveness. Conversely, other agents increase clopidogrel responsiveness by inducing CYP activity. The clinical implications of these pharmacodynamic interactions have raised concern because many of these drugs are coadministered to patients with coronary artery disease.

There are multiple challenges in proving that a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction is clinically significant. At the time of writing, there is no consistent evidence that clopidogrel-drug interactions impact adverse cardiovascular events. Statins and proton pump inhibitors have been shown to decrease adverse clinical event rates and should not be withheld from patients with appropriate indications for therapy due to concerns about potential clopidogrel-drug interactions. Clinicians concerned about clopidogrel-drug interactions have the option of prescribing either an alternative platelet P2Y₁₂ receptor inhibitor without known drug interactions, or statin and gastro-protective agents that do not interfere with clopidogrel metabolism.

### Tailored antiplatelet therapy can overcome clopidogrel and aspirin resistance — the BoCHum Clopidogrel and Aspirin Plan (BOCLA-Plan) to improve antiplatelet therapy [^115LHUBn]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In this study protocol, in cases of low response, the ASA and/or clopidogrel treatment was modified according to a structured therapy plan. The following outlines the modified plans:

- **Clopidogrel treatment without prasugrel**:
	- Study plan involves optimizing clopidogrel treatment when prasugrel is not available or contraindicated. The patient undergoes a platelet function assay, and if treatment is ineffective, the next step is implemented. The high clopidogrel dose is 150 mg daily, and ticlopidine is administered at 2 × 250 mg daily.

- **Clopidogrel treatment including prasugrel**:
	- This study plan optimizes clopidogrel treatment when prasugrel is available and not contraindicated. Patients undergo a platelet function assay and proceed to the next step if treatment is ineffective. The high clopidogrel dose is 150 mg daily, while high prasugrel dose is 20 mg daily.

- **ASA treatment**:
	- The plan focuses on optimizing ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin) treatment. A platelet function assay is conducted, and if treatment proves ineffective, the next step is employed, with ASA administered at 100 mg daily.

### Prasugrel [^116WNw6o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prasugrel has specific contraindications, including active pathological bleeding, prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, and hypersensitivity to prasugrel or its components.

- **Active bleeding**: Prasugrel tablets are contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding, such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Prior transient ischemic attack or stroke**: Prasugrel tablets should not be used in patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. In the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel), patients with a history of TIA or ischemic stroke (> 3 months prior to enrollment) experienced a higher rate of stroke on prasugrel (6.5%; with 4.2% thrombotic stroke and 2.3% ICH) compared to those on clopidogrel (1.2%; all thrombotic). For patients without such a history, the incidence of stroke was 0.9% (0.2% ICH) on prasugrel and 1.0% (0.3% ICH) on clopidogrel. Patients with an ischemic stroke within 3 months of screening and those with a history of hemorrhagic stroke at any time were excluded from the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Therapy should generally be discontinued for patients who experience a stroke or TIA while on prasugrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Prasugrel tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylaxis) to prasugrel or any component of the product [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The genotype distribution was extrapolated to the total cohort. We included data from multiple published reports from the same study population only once. Specifically, we used only the data from the initial report, and in the case of overlapping samples, the data of the largest follow-up study were selected. If a report referred to a previous publication for the description of study design, setting, and patients' characteristics, we extracted these data. Missing data for one study were extracted from a subsequent meta-analysis conducted by the same corresponding author. To avoid the risk of retrieval bias, we did not contact the original investigators for more detailed information when we were unable to obtain complete data and protocols from all studies or to check the accurateness and reliability of the obtained data.

### Cablivi [^112WsyJi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Serious and fatal bleeding can occur, with an amplified risk in patients with underlying coagulopathies or those on concomitant antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. If clinically significant bleeding occurs, treatment should be interrupted. CABLIVI should be withheld 7 days prior to elective surgeries, dental procedures, or other invasive interventions.

- **Hemorrhage**: CABLIVI increases the risk of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Clinical studies reported severe bleeding adverse reactions such as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and metrorrhagia, each in 1% of subjects. Overall, bleeding events occurred in approximately 58% of patients on CABLIVI versus 43% on placebo.

In the postmarketing setting, life-threatening and fatal bleeding cases have been reported in patients receiving CABLIVI. The risk of bleeding is heightened in patients with underlying coagulopathies (e.g. hemophilia, other coagulation factor deficiencies) and is also increased with the concomitant use of drugs that affect hemostasis and coagulation [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Concomitant use of CABLIVI with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants should be avoided. If significant bleeding occurs, interrupt use of CABLIVI. Administer von Willebrand factor concentrate if needed to rapidly correct hemostasis. Upon restarting CABLIVI, closely monitor for signs of bleeding.

Withhold CABLIVI for 7 days prior to elective surgeries, dental procedures, or other invasive interventions.

Antiplatelet therapy

The identification of P2Y12 was key to developing next-generation therapies. These include orally available thienopyridines, such as clopidogrel and prasugrel. These are prodrugs requiring cytochrome P450-based conversion to a short-lived active metabolite that binds covalently to P2Y12, although drug resistance to clopidogrel can affect up to a third of patients. Ticagrelor and cangrelor are direct-acting and rapidly reversible antagonists; cangrelor, given intravenously, has the advantage of acting immediately.

### Kengreal [^1115rXRP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Bleeding is a potential risk associated with KENGREAL, similar to other drugs that inhibit platelet P2Y12 function.

- **Bleeding**: Drugs that inhibit platelet P2Y12 function, such as KENGREAL, are known to increase bleeding risk. In the CHAMPION PHOENIX study, bleeding events of all severities were more common with KENGREAL compared to clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Bleeding complications were consistently observed across various clinically important subgroups [see Figure 1].

Once KENGREAL is discontinued, its antiplatelet effect dissipates within an hour [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Concomitant antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy: Indications, controversies and practical advice [^117J83e5]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Use of combination antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is commonly encountered in clinical practice and often sparks controversy regarding the efficacy versus safety of this regimen. The benefit of combination therapy relates to the probable additive effect of suppressing both platelet and coagulation factor activities. However, the risk of dual therapy lies in the potential for increased hemorrhagic events, which may outweigh the clinical benefit. This review focuses on clinical evidence demonstrating greater efficacy with combination therapy over either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy alone.

Clinicians should consider the importance of documenting combination therapy use in their patients to target those who would gain the greatest benefit while avoiding unnecessary complications.

### Impact of CYP2C19 variant genotypes on clinical efficacy of antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AVVdG]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

To explore the risk of bias in individual studies, we investigated indicators that are general to the quality of epidemiological studies and specific to the quality of genetic association studies. We extracted quality information on:

- **Loss to follow-up**: Evaluated the extent to which participants dropped out of the study.
- **Funding sources**: Reviewed the sources of funding for potential conflicts of interest.
- **Comparability of groups**: Ensured demographic and clinical homogeneity between groups with and without outcomes, and between carriers and non-carriers of the allele of interest. We assessed for the absence of population stratification, ensuring ethnic homogeneity.
- **Reliability and validity of phenotype assessment**: Used standardized definitions of disease phenotypes and ensured the blinding of clinical outcome assessors to patients' genetic information.
- **Reliability and validity of genotype assessment**: Consistency of observed genotype frequencies with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, use of an appropriate genotyping method, high call rate, and the blinding of investigators who performed genotyping to clinical outcomes.

Additionally, in adopting the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, we graded the methodological quality of the selected studies with a summary score using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. We applied a modified scale (adapted for genetic association studies), awarding a maximum score of eight points, with one point each for the representativeness of the exposed group (carriers of the genotype of interest) for the underlying population and the selection of the unexposed group (non-carriers) from the same population as the exposed individuals.

### Rationale and design of the randomized, double-blind trial testing intravenous and oral administration of elinogrel, a selective and reversible P2Y(12)-receptor inhibitor, versus clopidogrel to evaluate tolerability and efficacy in nonurgent percutaneous coronary interventions patients (INNOVATE-PCI) [^1176XP4t]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Despite dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, adverse clinical events continue to occur during and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The failure of clopidogrel to provide optimal protection may be related to its delayed onset of action, interpatient variability in its effect, and an insufficient level of platelet inhibition. Furthermore, the irreversible binding of clopidogrel to the P2Y(12) receptor for the lifespan of the platelet is associated with an increased bleeding risk, especially during urgent or emergency surgery. Novel antiplatelet agents are required to improve the management of patients undergoing PCI. Elinogrel is a potent, direct-acting (i.e. non-prodrug), selective, competitive, and reversible P2Y(12) inhibitor available in both intravenous and oral formulations. The INNOVATE-PCI study is a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, clopidogrel-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of this novel antiplatelet agent in patients undergoing nonurgent PCI.

### Novel alternate hemostatic agents for patients with inhibitors: Beyond bypass therapy [^112SKvNo]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Inhibitor formation is among the most severe complications of hemophilia treatment. With a cumulative incidence of approximately 30% in those with severe hemophilia A and approximately 3% in those with severe hemophilia B, inhibitors are caused by a T-cell response directed against infused coagulation factor. These inhibitors neutralize factor VIII or IX activity and disrupt normal hemostasis. Patients with inhibitors become unresponsive to standard factor treatment and, as an alternative, use bypass treatment, such as recombinant factor VIIa or factor VIII inhibitor bypass activity. However, response to bypass agents is poorer, and the burden of disease is higher, with greater morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and mortality than in non-inhibitor patients. Furthermore, inhibitor formation interferes with prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes and is a contraindication to gene therapy. Thus, more effective therapies for inhibitor patients are greatly needed.

In recent years, there has been an explosion of novel alternative hemostatic agents for hemophilia patients with and without inhibitors. These agents take advantage of technologic manipulation of coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants to promote hemostasis. The approaches include the following: mutants or mimics of coagulation factors, rendering them resistant to natural anticoagulants; or knock-down or disruption of natural anticoagulants, preventing degradation of coagulation factors. The purpose of this article was to review these novel alternative hemostatic agents and their mechanisms of action.

### Evidence that pre-existent variability in platelet response to ADP accounts for 'clopidogrel resistance' [^116wVSDk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is a widely used antithrombotic agent that inhibits the platelet P2Y(12) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor. There is increasing interest in 'clopidogrel resistance'.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether 'clopidogrel resistance' is accounted for by a pre-existent variability in platelet response to ADP.

- **Methods**: Platelet response to 20 microm ADP was analyzed by four independent whole blood flow cytometric assays: platelet surface activated GPIIb-IIIa, platelet surface P-selectin, monocyte-platelet aggregates, and neutrophil-platelet aggregates. In 25 consecutive, non-aspirin-treated healthy subjects, we studied platelet response before and after clopidogrel administration. In addition, we studied the platelet response in 613 consecutive aspirinated patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD, as determined by angiography) who had or had not been treated with clopidogrel. In these patients, we tested for homogeneity of variance across all durations of clopidogrel exposure and severity of CAD by estimating the 'goodness of fit' of two independent models.

- **Results**: In the healthy subjects, pre-clopidogrel response to ADP predicted post-clopidogrel response to ADP. In the patients, clopidogrel, as expected, inhibited the platelet response to ADP. However, irrespective of the duration of clopidogrel administration, the severity of CAD, and the dose of aspirin, clopidogrel did not increase the variance in the platelet response to ADP in any of the four assays of platelet response.

- **Conclusions**: These studies provide evidence that 'clopidogrel resistance' is accounted for by pre-existent variability in platelet response to ADP.

### Coronavirus disease 2019-associated thrombosis and coagulopathy: Review of the pathophysiological characteristics and implications for antithrombotic management [^117UgZ7n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Patients who take low-dose aspirin should continue therapy. Confirmation or suspicion of COVID-19 is not considered an indication to stop aspirin. In patients requiring a P2Y12 inhibitor, the drug of choice depends on the COVID-19-specific treatment. Some antiviral agents have drug-drug interactions with oral P2Y12 inhibitors by sharing the same metabolic pathway (e.g. Cytochrome P450 3A4). These include lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat with clopidogrel (which reduces its efficacy) and ticagrelor (which increases its efficacy). Hence, these drug combinations are contraindicated. For these reasons, at least during antiviral treatment, prasugrel is the drug of choice. Its contraindications (previous stroke) and precautions (age > 75 years, weight < 60 kg, or history of bleeding) also need to be carefully considered. Cilostazol also has an interaction with antiviral therapy, especially with lopinavir/ritonavir; however, dipyridamole has no reported significant interactions. For parenteral antiplatelet agents, such as cangrelor or glycoprotein IIb to IIIa inhibitors, there are no reported important drug-drug interactions with COVID-19 investigational treatments.

- **Anticoagulant therapy**: Anticoagulant therapies exhibit several drug-drug interactions that warrant attention, most notably involving vitamin K antagonists and DOACs with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir) and monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab and sarilumab). In case of clinical instability or significant drug-drug interaction, baseline anticoagulant strategies should be assessed and adjusted accordingly.

Antiplatelet medications have been proven to enhance outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. The ideal platelet inhibitor would be quick and reversible, have a universal response, an excellent safety profile, and a proven benefit. Currently available antiplatelet medications have demonstrated variable patient responses. In light of this medication resistance, emerging therapies to inhibit platelet aggregation are under investigation. We review the currently available antiplatelet medications and the state of these emerging therapies.

### How I use laboratory monitoring of antiplatelet therapy [^115xtRy5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is of proven benefit in coronary artery disease and a number of other clinical settings. This article reviews platelet function, molecular targets of antiplatelet agents, and clinical indications for antiplatelet therapy before focusing on a frequent question to hematologists about the two most commonly used antiplatelet therapies: Could the patient be aspirin "resistant" or clopidogrel "resistant"? If so, should results of a platelet function test be used to guide the dose or type of antiplatelet therapy? Whether such guided therapy is of clinical benefit to patients has been a source of controversy. The present article reviews this subject in the context of two prototypical clinical cases. Available evidence does not support the use of laboratory tests to guide the dose of aspirin or clopidogrel in patients with so-called aspirin or clopidogrel "resistance".

### Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agent use among patients with von Willebrand disease and cardiac disease [^1119TvrT]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by the deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Given the increased risk of bleeding, patients with VWD are advised to avoid aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, or anticoagulants. However, patients with VWD may develop thrombotic complications that require treatment with these agents. For example, 1% to 2% of the population has atrial fibrillation (AF), which may be treated with aspirin or anticoagulation depending on CHA2DS2-VASC risk stratification. Furthermore, approximately 805,000 people each year develop an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), defined as non-ST segment myocardial infarction, ST elevation myocardial infarction, or unstable angina. Treatment includes aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and/or anticoagulation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^112kQLKd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for individuals with myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those with coronary stents. These agents increase the risk of adverse events during non-cardiac surgery for these conditions. However, continuing antiplatelet therapy also increases the risk of bleeding during surgery. Discontinuing therapy before surgery may reduce bleeding risk but could increase the likelihood of thrombotic issues, such as myocardial infarction.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal, or regional anaesthesia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We also searched clinical trial registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy for at least two weeks and scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. Quasi-randomized studies were planned for inclusion. We excluded individuals scheduled for minor surgeries under local anesthesia.

### Current state and novel approaches of antiplatelet therapy [^112oZFWy]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

An unresolved problem with clinical use of antiplatelet therapy is that a significant number of individuals either still get thrombosis or run the risk of life-threatening bleeding. Antiplatelet drugs are widely used clinically, either chronically for people at risk of atherothrombotic disease or to prevent thrombus formation during surgery. However, a subpopulation may be resistant to standard doses, while the platelet targets of these drugs are also critical for the normal hemostatic function of platelets.

In this review, we will briefly examine antiplatelet therapy and existing targets while focusing on new potential approaches for antiplatelet therapy and improved monitoring of effects on platelet reactivity in individuals, ultimately to improve antithrombosis with minimal bleeding. Primary platelet adhesion-signaling receptors, glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V and GPVI, that bind von Willebrand factor/collagen and other prothrombotic factors are not targeted by drugs in clinical use, but they are of particular interest because of their key role in thrombus formation at pathological shear.

### Prevention of inhibitor development in hemophilia A in 2016: A glimpse into the future [^1166T7Y4]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Thanks to considerable progress made over the last 30 years, hemophilia benefits from the most efficacious and safe treatment among the many monogenic inherited disorders. The most challenging complication of replacement therapy in hemophilia A is the occurrence of alloantibodies against infused factor VIII (FVIII), predisposing patients to increased morbidity and disability. Extensive research in this field has definitively unraveled that the development of inhibitors in hemophilia A is a complex and multifactorial process, where inherited and environmental factors dynamically interact. This narrative review provides a concise overview of the main genetic and non-genetic risk factors and focuses on prediction risk models and preventive strategies for minimizing the risk of developing inhibitors in hemophilia A patients.

### Rates of venous thromboembolism and use of thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery in patients with congenital hemophilia A or B: a systematic review [^115b6cvY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a well-recognized complication after total joint replacement (TJR). Persons with hemophilia A or B are considered at low postoperative VTE risk due to their coagulation factor deficiencies, and administering pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is often considered contraindicated. However, using factor replacement therapy could increase the postoperative VTE risk.

- **Objectives**: To analyze the best available evidence of VTE rates in persons with hemophilia A or B undergoing lower limb TJR and the use of postoperative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis.

- **Methods**: We systematically screened four online biomedical databases to identify studies reporting VTE rates in patients with hemophilia after TJR. Case reports and case series with fewer than 10 patients were excluded.

- **Results**: Twenty-six observational studies were included in this systematic review, reporting 1181 TJRs in patients with hemophilia A or B. Eight studies had VTE rates as the primary outcome. Five studies reported screen-detected VTE, while 21 reported symptomatic VTE events. Overall, 17 VTE events were reported (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.9%-2.3%), including 10 (6.6%) after 151 surgeries with postoperative VTE screening and 7 (0.7%) after 1080 surgeries without postoperative screening. Thromboprophylaxis protocols were specified in 21 studies; postoperative thromboprophylaxis was used in 15 (1.3%) surgeries. This information was not available for 29.0% of the analyzed population.

### The hemophilias and their clinical management [^1161neGL]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Outcomes for patients with hemophilia have improved dramatically over the past 50 years. With the increased availability of safe clotting factor concentrates, the primary focus in clinical management is now the prevention of long-term complications, most notably the debilitating hemophilic arthropathy associated with severe disease. This article reviews evidence-based approaches for managing both children and adults with hemophilia. Definitive evidence of improved clinical results from primary prophylaxis started in young patients with severe hemophilia A and a minimal bleeding history is presented. Furthermore, recent studies showing benefits for initiating prophylaxis in older adolescents and adults with established joint disease are examined.

- **Complications: Inhibitors to factor VIII**: These are the most problematic complication of factor replacement therapy. Patient-specific and treatment-related factors that contribute to the risk of inhibitor formation are discussed. Controversies and clinical evidence related to approaches for tolerance induction are reviewed.

### Resistance to clopidogrel: A review of the evidence [^114whjuJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Available data show that about 4% to 30% of patients treated with conventional doses of clopidogrel do not display an adequate antiplatelet response. "Clopidogrel resistance" is a widely used term that remains to be clearly defined. So far, it has been used to reflect the failure of clopidogrel to achieve its antiaggregatory effect. The interpatient variability in clopidogrel response is multifactorial and can be due to extrinsic or intrinsic mechanisms.

- **Extrinsic mechanisms**: These include the possibility of clopidogrel underdosing in patients undergoing stenting or with acute coronary syndrome, and drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4.
- **Intrinsic mechanisms**: Factors include genetic polymorphisms of the P2Y(12) receptor and of the CYP3As, accrued release of adenosine diphosphate, or up-regulation of other platelet activation pathways.

Presently, there is no definitive demonstration of an association between low responsiveness to clopidogrel and thrombotic events. The optimal level of clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition, which would correlate quantitatively with clopidogrel's ability to prevent atherothrombotic events, is still lacking. Furthermore, because there is no single validated platelet function assay to measure clopidogrel's antiplatelet effect, it is not justified to routinely look for clopidogrel resistance in the clinical setting. This review discusses currently available evidence surrounding the variability in the antiplatelet response to clopidogrel.

### European stroke organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^114FMgMn]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

**Choice of drug regimen**: Some people with minor stroke and TIA would have been eligible for the included trials of clopidogrel-based DAPT and the trial of ticagrelor-based DAPT. Because there are three trials of clopidogrel-based DAPT with relevant outcomes and there was no significant increase in intracranial haemorrhage, the level of certainty regarding the available evidence and the strength of the recommendation was rated higher for clopidogrel-based DAPT than for ticagrelor-based DAPT. However, it should be noted that the sample size of the THALES trial was similar to the combined sample size of the three clopidogrel-based trials. In addition, the THALES trial allowed inclusion of people with more severe stroke so the bleeding rate cannot be directly compared across the clopidogrel and ticagrelor trials. DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin should be considered as an alternative to clopidogrel-based DAPT, particularly in people known to be intolerant of clopidogrel or in people who have moderate stroke (NIHSS 4 or 5) and no other contraindication.

### How we manage cardiovascular disease in patients with hemophilia [^114DP1U8]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure, non-inferior to oral anticoagulation in the prevention of thromboembolism and cardiac death, is another intervention used in patients with hemophilia (PWH) with atrial fibrillation (AF) in order to limit the duration of antithrombotic therapy and the risk of bleeding, particularly in those with more severe factor deficiency. The rationale for this approach lies in the fact that more than 90% of emboli originate in the left atrial appendage. However, to prevent device-related thrombosis, antithrombotic treatment is required at least until complete endothelization of the device surface has occurred, usually for at least three months. Factor concentrate prophylaxis is required during this antithrombotic treatment.

Although promising, experience with this technique in PWH is limited; a recent systematic literature review identified only nine cases. In these, there was some variability in the choice of the occluding device, severity of hemophilia, as well as type and duration of antithrombotic therapy. Different antithrombotic strategies in non-hemophilia AF cases at increased hemorrhagic risk have been proposed depending on their thrombotic risk profile, ranging from dual antiplatelet therapy for one month and antiplatelet monotherapy for two additional months in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of four or more, to up to three months of antiplatelet monotherapy in those with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of less than four. In addition, data from a recent randomized trial suggest that low-dose DOAC may be an effective alternative to antiplatelet therapy.

Improving clopidogrel low response treatment

What are the options for treating clopidogrel low responders? Data suggest improving platelet inhibition in low responders to clopidogrel through alternative treatment strategies. These include either an increase in the loading dose or the use of a higher maintenance dose, or switching to alternative thienopyridine treatment (ticlopidine, prasugrel). Additionally, new platelet inhibitors, such as ticagrelor or thrombin receptor antagonists, are viable alternatives and will be introduced in the near future.

Data demonstrated that adjusting the clopidogrel loading dose according to platelet function testing translates to a significantly improved short-term outcome following PCI. The RELOAD study reveals that a new clopidogrel loading dose in patients treated long-term with 75 mg clopidogrel daily improves platelet inhibition, reducing low response.

Regarding maintenance therapy, studies have demonstrated that 150 mg of clopidogrel leads to a greater inhibition of platelet aggregation than a 75 mg daily dose. The ACC Practice Guidelines of 2005 recommend (Class IIb) increasing the dose of clopidogrel to 150 mg per day if less than 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation is apparent. The CURRENT-OASIS-7 study evaluated the effect of a 600 mg loading dosage and then doubling the maintenance dose (150 mg) of clopidogrel in ACS patients compared to standard therapy (300 mg, followed by 75 mg). In this study, all patients on a higher clopidogrel dosage had lower MACE rates.

Advances in hemophilia care have led to increased life expectancy and new challenges in the management of the aging hemophilia population, including cardiovascular risk. Despite deep knowledge into cardiovascular disease in terms of pathophysiology, risk prediction, prevention, early detection, and management gained over the last decades, studies in hemophiliacs are scarce and mainly descriptive. As a growing amount of evidence points towards a similar or increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in hemophilia compared to the general population, the role of non-traditional, disease-related, and treatment-related cardiovascular risk factors remains under investigation. A better understanding of cardiovascular risk in hemophilia is mandatory for proper cardiovascular risk prevention and management.

This review aims to summarize knowledge on cardiovascular risk in hemophilia patients focusing on:

- **Cardiovascular risk factors**: Traditional, non-traditional, disease-related, and treatment-related.
- **Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality**: Evaluating the prevalence and impact on the hemophilia population.
- **Cardiovascular prevention and management**: Strategies and recommendations for managing cardiovascular risk in hemophilia patients.

### Cangrelor: Clinical data, contemporary use, and future perspectives [^112Ms96o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Cangrelor is the only currently available intravenous platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. It is characterized by potent, predictable, and rapidly reversible antiplatelet effects. Cangrelor has been tested in the large CHAMPION (Cangrelor Versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition) program, where it was compared with different clopidogrel regimens. It is currently indicated for use in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

However, the uptake of cangrelor use varies across the globe and may also include patients with profiles different from those enrolled in the registration trials. These observations underscore the need to fully examine the safety and efficacy of cangrelor in post-registration studies. There are several ongoing and planned studies evaluating the use of cangrelor in real-world practice, which will provide important insights to this extent.

The article provides a review of the pharmacology, clinical studies, contemporary use of cangrelor in real-world practice, a description of ongoing studies, and futuristic insights on potential strategies for improving outcomes for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Combined anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel: risk factor for thrombolysis-related intracerebral hemorrhage in acute ischemic stroke [^112zTqkC]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, pre-treatment with anti-platelet agents does not constitute a contraindication for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. We tested the hypothesis that combined pre-treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel is a risk factor for thrombolysis-related symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).

We retrospectively studied patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving standard intravenous thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in our institution. Exclusion criteria included thrombolysis initiated later than 3 hours from symptom onset, the use of non-tPA-agents, absence of follow-up imaging, and missing data on prior medication. We recorded clinical baseline variables, including known risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our outcome measure was the incidence of ICH, defined as parenchymal hematoma type 2 with a decline of 4 or more points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. We performed univariate analysis to determine risk factors for sICH.

We identified 102 patients receiving any thrombolysis, of which 63 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 69 years, onset-to-treatment time was 138 minutes, 56% were male, and the median NIHSS score was 10. Three patients received additional intra-arterial interventions. Notably, three patients had received combined aspirin and clopidogrel treatment before thrombolysis. Symptomatic ICH occurred in 3 out of 63 (4.7%) patients, with two of these patients having received the combined anti-platelet treatment. In univariate analysis, only the combined pre-treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel was associated with the occurrence of sICH.

### Tegsedi [^112oMdUP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant medications**: Because of the risk of thrombocytopenia, caution should be used when taking antiplatelet drugs (e.g. adenosine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, or ticlopidine). This includes non-prescription products that affect platelets (e.g. aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or anticoagulants (e.g. heparin, warfarin) concomitantly with Tegsedi [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	- **Nephrotoxic drugs**: Due to the risk of glomerulonephritis and renal toxicity, caution should be exercised when using nephrotoxic drugs and other drugs that may impair renal function concomitantly with Tegsedi [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Sar216471, an alternative to the use of currently available P2Y12 receptor inhibitors [^113JbvJN]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

P2Y12 antagonism is a key therapeutic strategy in the management and prevention of arterial thrombosis. The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of SAR216471, a novel P2Y12 receptor antagonist. SAR216471 blocks the binding of 2MeSADP to P2Y12 receptors in vitro (IC50 = 17 nM). This inhibition was shown to be reversible.

It potently antagonized ADP-induced platelet aggregation in human and rat platelet-rich plasma (IC50 = 108 and 62 nM, respectively). It also inhibited platelet aggregation when blood was exposed to collagen or thromboxane A2. Its high selectivity was demonstrated against a large panel of receptors, enzymes, and ion channels. Despite its moderate bioavailability in rats, oral administration of SAR216471 resulted in a fast, potent, and sustained inhibition of platelet aggregation where the extent and duration of platelet inhibition were directly proportional to its circulating plasma levels.

Pre-clinical study of SAR216471 in a rat shunt thrombosis model demonstrated a dose-dependent antithrombotic activity after oral administration (ED50 = 6.7 mg/kg). By comparison, ED50 values for clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor were 6.3, 0.35, and 2.6 mg/kg, respectively. Finally, the anti-hemostatic effect of SAR216471 and its competitors was investigated in a rat tail bleeding model, revealing a favorable safety profile of SAR216471.

Together, these findings have established a reliable antiplatelet profile of SAR216471 and support its potential use in clinical practice as an alternative to currently available P2Y12 receptor inhibitors.

### P2Y12 receptor blockade augments glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonist inhibition of platelet activation, aggregation, and procoagulant activity [^115CMK5L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Institutional review board–approved written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Two hours after healthy volunteers ingested aspirin 325 mg (Bayer HealthCare), blood was collected into a final concentration of sodium citrate 0.32%, hirudin 25 μg/mL, or d‐Phe‐Pro‐Arg‐chloromethylketone 300 μmol/L (PPACK; EMD Biosciences). Platelet counts for all donors were within the normal range of 150 to 400×10³/μL. R‐138727 (provided by Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was dissolved in DMSO and kept at −80°C in sealed vials.

Immediately before use, R‐138727 was diluted in HEPES 10 mmol/L, NaCl 0.15 mol/L, pH 7.4 (HEPES‐saline). For all subsequent assays, whole blood was incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with:

- R‐138727 5 μmol/L
- Abciximab 3.0 μg/mL (ReoPro; Centocor)
- Eptifibatide 0.9 μg/mL (Integrilin; Millennium Pharmaceuticals)
- R‐138727 5 μmol/L plus abciximab 3.0 μg/mL
- R‐138727 5 μmol/L plus eptifibatide 0.9 μg/mL
- Vehicle (DMSO diluted identically to R‐138727)

R‐138727, abciximab, and eptifibatide concentrations used for these experiments were selected to correspond with the level of platelet inhibition achieved in patients treated with the recommended dosing regimens: prasugrel at 60 mg loading dose and 10 mg/day maintenance dose; abciximab at 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion of 0.125 μg/kg per minute; eptifibatide at 180 μg/kg intravenous bolus followed immediately by a continuous infusion of 2.0 μg/kg per minute and a second eptifibatide bolus of 180 μg/kg administered 10 minutes later.

### How we manage cardiovascular disease in patients with hemophilia [^113B9dyQ]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

During PCI, we suggest administering rFVIIa on the day of the procedure at a dose of 90–100 mg/kg every 3–4 hours for 24 hours, followed by the same dose given daily during the next 4-week duration of antiplatelet therapy after stent deployment. When FEIBA is chosen as bypassing medication, we suggest a dosage of 80 U/kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours, followed by the same daily dose during the next 4-week duration of antiplatelet therapy. During this period, the use of low-dose aspirin monotherapy instead of dual antiplatelet therapy is preferable due to the increased bleeding risk caused by the concomitant presence of two antiplatelet medications and the FVIII inhibitor.

More uncertainty remains as to the management of CAD in the increasing number of FVIII inhibitor patients on prophylaxis with emicizumab (a long-acting bispecific monoclonal antibody that mimics the function of activated FVIII). Because PWH on emicizumab undergoing PCI cannot be monitored in the laboratory according to activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)-based coagulation factor assays, bovine chromogenic assays should be used to monitor and tailor FVIII levels following concentrate infusion and heparin therapy.

Cardiac surgery is feasible in PWH provided replacement therapy is adequately planned in terms of dosage and duration in the frame of a multidisciplinary specialized team that offers close clinical and laboratory surveillance and follow-up. Fortunately, in recent years, the progressive increase of PCI has substantially reduced the number of CABG in general, and also in PWH with CAD.

### Advances in antiplatelet therapy [^114YshMY]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Because of the central role of platelets in cardiovascular atherothrombosis, there is a well-established therapeutic role for antiplatelet therapy that includes aspirin (a cyclooxygenase 1 [COX1] inhibitor), clopidogrel (an antagonist of the ADP P2Y(12) receptor), and the GPIIb-GPIIIa (αIIbβ3) antagonists. However, there remains a significant incidence of arterial thrombosis in patients treated with currently available antiplatelet therapy.

Novel P2Y(12) antagonists such as the recently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prasugrel, along with ticagrelor, cangrelor, and elinogrel, have advantages over clopidogrel, including more rapid, less variable, and more complete inhibition of platelet function. Currently ongoing phase 3 studies will determine whether these new P2Y(12) antagonists will result in better and/or more rapid antithrombotic effects than clopidogrel, without an unacceptable increase in hemorrhagic or other side effects, as has been recently reported in some clinical settings for prasugrel and ticagrelor. Antagonists of the thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) are also undergoing phase 3 trials, and many other novel antiplatelet agents are under investigation as antithrombotic agents.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: Fifth edition [^113qn1bE]. Critical Care (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of traumatic hemorrhage, particularly concerning the management of antithrombotics (antiplatelets), the ABC-T 2019 guidelines recommend considering the administration of desmopressin at a dosage of 0.3 mcg/kg in patients treated with platelet-inhibiting drugs or von Willebrand disease (vWD).

### To pretreat or not to pretreat (with oral P2Y12 antagonists)? That is the question [^116A694k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

As explored by Badri et al, when surgical revascularization is the intended strategy, pretreatment with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor may lead to increased postoperative bleeding complications. Unfortunately, patient presenting features offer little insight into which patients will ultimately require surgical revascularization during their hospitalization. Thus, the early medical management of an NSTEMI requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks of these medications, timing of their use, and potential consequences of these decisions.

As may be expected, the increasing potency of the P2Y12 inhibitors has been accompanied by a higher risk of bleeding, including procedure-related bleeding. Even when clopidogrel, the least potent of the P2Y12 inhibitors, was added to aspirin in the CURE study, the bleeding risk was significantly higher than with aspirin alone. Similarly, with the progressive increase in potency of P2Y12 inhibitors, bleeding risk has increased — compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel caused increased risk of bleeding, including life-threatening bleeding, and ticagrelor increased the risk of non-CABG-related major bleeding.

Guidelines currently recommend that P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be held for at least 5 days for clopidogrel or ticagrelor and 7 days for prasugrel before surgery (Class I, Levels of Evidence B and C, respectively). However, the guidelines also provide the recommendation that it is reasonable to perform surgery before these time points, and perhaps as early as 3 days from discontinuation.

### Prasugrel [^114Crd2J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI minor bleeding (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) events were more common with prasugrel than with clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as illustrated in Figure 1, which shows events through 450 days, with an inset for events through 7 days.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures, even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding [see Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events].

Do not use prasugrel in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA, or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

- **Age ≥ 75 years**: Due to the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, prasugrel use is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or a history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater, and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)].
- **CABG or other surgical procedure**: Consider the risks when prasugrel is administered in conjunction with these procedures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^115wNNbq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

**Agents concurrently affecting bleeding risk**: As mentioned above, bleeding complications increase when DOACs are coprescribed with antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors) or agents with antiplatelet properties (NSAIDs, systemic corticosteroids, etc). These combinations should be minimized whenever possible and carefully balanced against improved thrombosis prevention when clinically indicated. If concomitant therapy cannot be avoided, the addition of H2 antihistamine receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding should be undertaken.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: How long is too long [^112QSaUz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Prolonged dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) appears more beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel and who have risk factors for re-ischemia; however, this benefit comes at the cost of increased bleeding. Clinicians must recognize that not all bleeding or ACS events carry the same risk. Therefore, a clinician-patient shared decision-making approach seems apt when discussing the optimal duration of DAPT.

Notably, trials evaluating DAPT over 5 years are currently lacking. Although extended DAPT may be beneficial, there is no strong clinical evidence to support its use beyond this time frame. With continuous advances in medication and stent technology, the optimal DAPT duration is likely to change. Until such changes are established, the guidelines recommending a 12-month DAPT duration for ACS — with further tailoring based on an individual's risk of ischemic or bleeding events — provide a solid framework.

Evolving research will help further elucidate the risks and benefits of extended-duration DAPT, especially with the advent of newer-generation stents.

### To pretreat or not to pretreat (with oral P2Y12 antagonists)? That is the question [^116T8zEH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

As reflected in guidelines recommendations, treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors is a foundational element of therapy for patients presenting with NSTEMI. Before the mid-1990s, the benefit of treating coronary artery disease with percutaneous intervention was limited by stent thrombosis in the setting of aspirin alone or by bleeding among patients treated with intensive anticoagulation. In the mid-1990s, ticlodipine, a member of the thienopyridine family, became the first commercially available P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, and data soon began to show the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy among stented patients. Given hematological side effects associated with ticlodipine, clopidogrel, another member of the thienopyridine family, became an attractive alternative. The CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent ReEvents) trial showed a 30% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events when clopidogrel was added to aspirin for treatment of patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, within a subset of patients in the CURE trial who were randomized to pretreatment with clopidogrel, results showed the benefits of clopidogrel within 24 hours of randomization and extending long term, without increased bleeding risk. Prasugrel, a third-generation thienopyridine with increased potency compared with clopidogrel, was subsequently developed. The TRITON-TIMI (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 38 trial showed improved outcomes.

### Reducing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in people with hemophilia: The importance of primary prevention [^113EioE7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

Revolutionary advances in the treatment of hemophilia have led to a significant improvement in life expectancy. This improvement has been associated with an increase in age-related diseases, particularly atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). While people with hemophilia (PWH) develop atherosclerosis at rates similar to those of the general population, rates of atherothrombosis and mortality related to CVD have been much lower due to their hypocoagulable state.

Changing treatment paradigms aimed at reducing the risk of bleeding by improving hemostasis to levels approaching normality mean that the protection they are thought to have had may be lost. CVD risk factors are just as common in PWH as in the general population but appear to be undertreated. Primary prevention of CVD is vital for all individuals, particularly for PWH, as treating established CVD can be difficult.

Active identification and management of CVD risk factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, are required. Statins, in particular, have been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with few adverse events and no increased risk of bleeding in the general population. Their use needs urgent assessment in PWH. Further longitudinal research into preventing CVD in PWH, including accurate CVD risk assessment, is required to optimize prevention and management.

### How we manage cardiovascular disease in patients with hemophilia [^112wURh7]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

Management of cardiovascular diseases in persons with hemophilia (PWH) remains a significant challenge due to the lack of clinical trials providing evidence-based recommendations. The few available guidelines are primarily adaptations of those designed for individuals without hemophilia. It is generally agreed that PWH should be managed similarly to their age-related peers, with modifications in replacement therapy to accommodate the level of plasma factor deficiency and the increased risk of bleeding from invasive cardiac procedures and antithrombotic drugs. In PWH, maintaining the balance between bleeding and thrombosis is particularly delicate, presenting a major challenge when these patients develop cardiovascular disease (CVD).

- **Coronary artery disease**: Both stable angina and acute coronary syndrome, the principal types of coronary artery disease (CAD), can occur in PWH and require the same therapeutic approach as for individuals without hemophilia. However, managing CAD is challenging because standard treatment involves the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs, invasive procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and options such as bare metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents (DES), or even cardiac surgery with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Special attention must be given to long-term antithrombotic treatments, which increase the risk of bleeding for PWH with CAD, as noted by the French registry.

For managing stable angina, long-term low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day) should be prescribed. However, for PWH with severe disease, clotting factor prophylaxis should be provided to prevent any exacerbation of the condition.

### International expert consensus on switching platelet P2Y receptor-inhibiting therapies [^1144L2UP]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is the treatment of choice for preventing atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes and those undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. The availability of different oral P2Y12 inhibitors — clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor — has enabled physicians to consider switching among therapies due to specific clinical scenarios. The recent introduction of an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor, cangrelor, further adds to the multitude of modalities and settings in which switching therapies may occur.

In clinical practice, it is not uncommon to switch P2Y12 inhibitors, and switching may be attributed to a variety of factors. However, concerns about the safety of switching between these agents have emerged. Practice guidelines have not fully elaborated on how to switch therapies. This has left clinicians with limited guidance on when and how to switch therapies when needed.

This situation prompted the development of this expert consensus document by key leaders from North America and Europe with expertise in basic, translational, and clinical sciences in the field of antiplatelet therapy. The expert consensus provides an overview of the pharmacology of P2Y12 inhibitors, different modalities and definitions of switching, and available literature and recommendations for switching between P2Y12 inhibitors.
