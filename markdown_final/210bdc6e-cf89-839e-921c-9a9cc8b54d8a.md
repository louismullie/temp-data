## Question

Enteral feeding hyperbilirrubinemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how enteral feeding relates to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, including mechanisms, evidence, and practical management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entities and definitions, especially breastfeeding jaundice versus breast milk jaundice. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking feeding to bilirubin handling. Next, I will appraise the evidence base, including RCTs and guidelines, and I need to check for confounders like dehydration and weight loss. After that, I should translate this into management principles, including when to supplement, what to supplement with, and how to monitor. Finally, I will consider special populations such as preterm infants and those on parenteral nutrition, and close with a concise synthesis and bottom-line recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities so I don't conflate terms. Breastfeeding jaundice, more accurately termed suboptimal intake jaundice, presents in the first week with excessive weight loss and inadequate intake, and is mechanistically tied to increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin due to low stooling and caloric intake, whereas breast milk jaundice presents after the first week, often persisting up to 3 months, with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a thriving infant and reflects a factor in human milk that enhances enterohepatic circulation rather than intake insufficiency [^6660bb55] [^97b63a4f] [^75e4f711].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before drawing conclusions. Low enteral intake reduces stool frequency and promotes bilirubin reabsorption via the enterohepatic circulation, increasing unconjugated bilirubin; conversely, adequate enteral feeding accelerates bilirubin excretion and lowers serum bilirubin, which is why frequent breastfeeding is protective and why dehydration and poor intake amplify jaundice severity [^6660bb55] [^3a9f0ff1] [^5af47366].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence for feeding frequency and bilirubin. Observational and guideline syntheses consistently show that breastfeeding fewer than 8 times per 24 hours correlates with higher bilirubin, whereas 9–10 feeds per day associates with lower bilirubin; this supports the causal role of intake rather than an inherent toxicity of breast milk itself [^2c48c329] [^5af47366] [^6660bb55].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about supplementation. I need to check guideline positions on water or dextrose water. Multiple high-credibility sources advise against routine oral supplementation with water or dextrose water to prevent or treat hyperbilirubinemia because it does not reduce bilirubin, can interfere with breastfeeding, and risks hyponatremia; this remains a strong recommendation with aggregate evidence quality B [^e0e4a6ad] [^e14644f8] [^531f0642].

> Next, I should review when and how to supplement if intake is truly inadequate. If suboptimal intake is documented by excessive weight loss, low urine/stool output, or rising bilirubin despite lactation support, temporary supplementation with expressed maternal milk is first-line; if unavailable, donor human milk is reasonable; formula is acceptable when human milk is not available, and all supplementation should be paired with continued breastfeeding and lactation support to protect the dyad and milk supply [^5c4e9eb8] [^16e80421] [^638fa741].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about thresholds and follow-up. Weight loss greater than about 10% from birth weight is a red flag for suboptimal intake and should trigger evaluation and supplementation planning, while universal bilirubin screening before discharge and risk-based early follow-up reduce readmissions; if outpatient follow-up cannot be arranged, discharge should be delayed to mitigate risk [^7d7731d7] [^588e125d] [^79755582].

> But wait, what about preterm infants and those on parenteral nutrition; does enteral feeding still modulate bilirubin meaningfully there. In preterms, hyperbilirubinemia is more prevalent and protracted, and early enteral feeding advances maturation of gut function and may reduce cholestasis risk, though the bilirubin trajectory is less predictable; in infants with PN-associated cholestasis, progression to full enteral nutrition is the key intervention that leads to resolution of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, albeit with a lag and sometimes a transient rise before improvement [^82c82ab3] [^ea6b9b9e] [^d4880ffd] [^c0ae8cf3].

> Let me consider the quality and limits of the evidence so I don't overstate claims. Much of the feeding–bilirubin literature is observational, and RCTs directly testing feeding strategies are limited; nonetheless, converging guideline consensus and physiologic plausibility support the centrality of adequate enteral intake in mitigating unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, while acknowledging that breast milk jaundice is benign and self-limited when the infant is thriving [^6660bb55] [^97b63a4f] [^75e4f711].

> I should confirm practical steps for clinicians. Promote early and frequent breastfeeding with at least 8–12 feeds per 24 hours, assess intake and weight loss objectively, avoid routine water or dextrose water, use supplementation only when indicated with a preference for human milk, and maintain close follow-up with bilirubin monitoring; during phototherapy, continue feeding to support excretion and avoid dehydration, and consider temporary supplementation to accelerate bilirubin decline when intake is suboptimal [^638fa741] [^16e80421] [^5af47366].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and balanced. Enteral feeding is not the enemy; rather, inadequate enteral intake drives severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia via increased enterohepatic circulation, whereas adequate enteral feeding — especially frequent breastfeeding — prevents and treats suboptimal intake jaundice; breast milk jaundice is a separate, benign entity that does not require cessation of breastfeeding, and routine water or dextrose water supplementation should be avoided [^6660bb55] [^97b63a4f] [^e0e4a6ad].

---

Enteral feeding is central to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: **early and frequent breastfeeding** (≥ 8–12 feeds/24 h) lowers bilirubin by reducing enterohepatic circulation and promoting excretion [^6660bb55] [^5af47366], whereas **delayed or insufficient feeding** increases risk of significant jaundice [^3a9f0ff1] [^7d7731d7]. Supplementation with water or dextrose water is ineffective and discouraged [^e0e4a6ad]; if intake is inadequate, use expressed maternal milk or donor milk, reserving formula for when human milk is unavailable [^5c4e9eb8] [^16e80421]. In preterm infants, early enteral feeding accelerates bilirubin clearance and reduces cholestasis risk [^ea6b9b9e] [^d4880ffd]. Persistent jaundice beyond 2 weeks requires evaluation for cholestasis or other pathology [^f13163de] [^516e0baf].

---

## Physiological mechanisms linking enteral feeding and hyperbilirubinemia

Enteral feeding influences bilirubin metabolism through **several mechanisms**:

- **Enterohepatic circulation**: Breast milk contains β-glucuronidase, which deconjugates bilirubin, increasing enterohepatic circulation and unconjugated bilirubin levels [^ee0b8b09].

- **Stool frequency and bilirubin excretion**: Frequent feeding promotes stooling and bilirubin elimination; insufficient intake delays meconium passage and increases bilirubin reabsorption [^6660bb55].

- **Caloric intake and bilirubin conjugation**: Adequate calories support hepatic conjugation and excretion; caloric deprivation increases unconjugated bilirubin [^3a9f0ff1].

---

## Impact of breastfeeding on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia

Breastfeeding is strongly associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, but the relationship is **complex and multifactorial**:

| **Type of breastfeeding-related jaundice** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Breastfeeding jaundice (suboptimal intake) | Insufficient milk intake increases enterohepatic circulation | - Early jaundice (days 3–5) <br/> - Excess weight loss <br/> - Dehydration | - Increase breastfeeding frequency <br/> - Lactation support <br/> - Supplement if intake inadequate [^6660bb55] [^5c4e9eb8] |
| Breast milk jaundice (prolonged jaundice) | Substance in breast milk increases enterohepatic circulation | - Jaundice persists beyond 2 weeks <br/> - Infant thriving <br/> - Unconjugated bilirubin | - Continue breastfeeding <br/> - Monitor bilirubin <br/> - Evaluate if persistent beyond 3 weeks [^97b63a4f] [^75e4f711] |

---

Breastfeeding frequency is inversely related to bilirubin levels; **8–12 feeds per 24 hours** is optimal [^2c48c329] [^5af47366].

---

## Role of enteral feeding in preterm infants

Preterm infants have **immature hepatic conjugation** and increased bilirubin load, making them more susceptible to hyperbilirubinemia. Early enteral feeding accelerates bilirubin clearance and reduces cholestasis risk [^ea6b9b9e] [^d4880ffd]. Delayed enteral feeding increases the risk of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis and prolonged hyperbilirubinemia [^c1f5fd50] [^d4880ffd].

---

## Effect of enteral feeding on bilirubin levels and phototherapy requirements

Adequate enteral feeding reduces bilirubin levels and phototherapy needs by promoting excretion and reducing enterohepatic circulation [^6660bb55]. Supplementation with water or dextrose water does not reduce bilirubin and may interfere with breastfeeding [^e0e4a6ad] [^e14644f8]. When supplementation is needed, **expressed maternal milk or donor milk** is preferred; formula is reserved for when human milk is unavailable [^5c4e9eb8] [^16e80421].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize:

- **Early and frequent breastfeeding**: Initiate within the first hour; feed ≥ 8–12 times/24 h [^638fa741] [^5af47366].

- **Avoid routine supplementation**: Do not use water or dextrose water; supplement only if intake is inadequate [^e0e4a6ad] [^531f0642].

- **Monitor weight and hydration**: Track weight loss, urine/stool output, and bilirubin trends [^6660bb55] [^588e125d].

- **Evaluate persistent jaundice**: Measure total and direct bilirubin if jaundice persists beyond 2 weeks [^f13163de] [^516e0baf].

---

## Risks and benefits of enteral feeding in hyperbilirubinemia

Benefits include **lower bilirubin levels**, reduced phototherapy, and improved hydration and nutrition [^6660bb55] [^5af47366]. Risks are minimal; prolonged jaundice may mask cholestasis or other pathology, so persistent jaundice warrants evaluation [^f13163de] [^516e0baf].

---

## Special considerations and controversies

- **Breast milk jaundice**: Benign and self-limited; continue breastfeeding and monitor [^97b63a4f] [^75e4f711].

- **Supplementation controversies**: Formula may reduce bilirubin but can interfere with breastfeeding; shared decision-making is essential [^16e80421] [^638fa741].

- **Preterm infants**: Early enteral feeding is beneficial but may require careful monitoring for feeding tolerance and NEC [^ea6b9b9e] [^076e34af].

---

Enteral feeding — especially breastfeeding — is a **key modifiable factor** in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Early, frequent, and adequate feeding reduces bilirubin levels and phototherapy needs, while insufficient intake increases risk. Persistent jaundice requires evaluation for cholestasis or other pathology.

### Prebiotics for the prevention of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates [^e1d5353b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperbilirubinaemia occurs in approximately two-thirds of all newborns during the first days of life and is frequently treated with phototherapy. Although generally seen as safe, there is rising concern regarding phototherapy and its potentially damaging effects on DNA and increased side effects particularly for preterm infants. Other methods, such as enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics, may have an effective use in the management of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates.

Objectives

To determine whether administration of prebiotics reduces the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia among term and preterm infants compared with enteral supplementation of milk with distilled water/placebo or no supplementation.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 14 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 14 June 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered all RCTs that studied neonates comparing enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics versus distilled water/placebo or no supplementation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers screened papers and extracted data from selected papers. We used a fixed-effect method in combining the effects of studies that were sufficiently similar. We then used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

Three small studies evaluating 154 infants were included in this review. One study reported a significant reduction in the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia and rate of treatment with phototherapy associated with enteral supplementation with prebiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.58 to 0.97; one study, 50 infants; low-quality evidence). Meta-analyses of two studies showed no significant difference in maximum plasma unconjugated bilirubin levels in infants with prebiotic supplementation (mean difference (MD) 0.14 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.20, I² = 81%, P = 0.79; two studies, 78 infants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a significant difference in duration of phototherapy between the prebiotic and control groups, which was only reported by one study (MD 0.10 days, 95% CI -2.00 to 2.20; one study, 50 infants; low-quality evidence). The meta-analyses of two studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (MD -10.57 days, 95% CI -17.81 to -3.33; 2 studies, 78 infants; I² = 0%, P = 0.004; low-quality evidence). Meta-analysis of the three studies showed a significant increase in stool frequency in the prebiotic groups (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46, I² = 90%; 3 studies, 154 infants; high-quality evidence). No significant difference in mortality during hospital stay after enteral supplementation with prebiotics was reported (typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.19; I² = 6%, P = 0.95; 2 studies; 78 infants; low-quality evidence). There were no reports of the need for exchange transfusion and incidence of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, and major neurodevelopmental disability in the included studies. None of the included studies reported any side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Current studies are unable to provide reliable evidence about the effectiveness of prebiotics on hyperbilirubinaemia. Additional large, well-designed RCTs should be undertaken in neonates that compare effects of enteral supplementation with prebiotics on neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia with supplementation of milk with any other placebo (particularly distilled water) or no supplementation.

### Early intravenous nutrition for the prevention of neonatal jaundice [^dec0ba9a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The early institution of enteral feeding in the first few days of life is known to impact on the development of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. However, the effect of early intravenous nutrition on neonatal jaundice remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine the effect of early intravenous nutrition on neonatal jaundice.

Search Strategy

The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used including searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library: Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966-December 2002), and EMBASE (1974-December 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of early intravenous nutrition on unconjugated bilirubin.

Data Collection and Analysis

The search strategy identified no eligible studies, thus no data were collected.

Main Results

No studies were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Decisions regarding the institution of early intravenous nutrition must continue to be based upon factors others than its effect on neonatal jaundice.

Hyperbilirubinemia prevention — breastfeeding support and supplementation: Clinicians should promote breastfeeding support for all mothers and breast milk feeding within the first hour after birth with frequent feeding on demand (ie, at least 8 times in 24 hours). Breastfed infants who are adequately hydrated should not routinely receive supplementation with commercially available infant formula, and decisions about temporary supplementation with either donor breast milk or infant formula should be made jointly with the infant's parents, when possible, after discussion of risks and benefits.

Feeding and hydration during phototherapy — neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: Feeding should be maintained during inpatient or home phototherapy to promote bilirubin clearance and avoid dehydration, interrupting phototherapy for breastfeeding does not impact the overall effectiveness if it is otherwise appropriately used and such interruptions should be minimized if the bilirubin concentration is approaching the need to escalate care, brief use of formula might lead to a more rapid decline in TSB concentrations and reduce the risk of readmission for phototherapy, supplementation using the mother's expressed milk may have similar benefits to infant formula supplementation without the potential concerns associated with formula, use of intravenous fluids is not recommended unless there is evidence of dehydration that cannot be corrected enterally or if the TSB exceeds the escalation of care threshold, and expressed milk, or donor human milk may be considered as an alternative to readmission for phototherapy in the breastfed infant who has been discharged and presents with excess weight loss, a maternal history consistent with a diagnosis of suboptimal intake hyperbilirubinemia, and a bilirubin concentration approaching or at the phototherapy threshold.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the 2000s: what should we do next? [^5fcaf9e4]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in healthcare policy mandating early discharge of healthy, full-term infants and the higher prevalence of breast-feeding of newborns have contributed to an increased number of term infants being readmitted to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia. At high levels, total serum bilirubin causes kernicterus, which is associated with severe neurological sequelae. This article provides a review of prior studies that have examined whether and at what levels total serum bilirubin affects neurodevelopmental outcome in term infants. In addition, the article reviews some approaches in the literature that suggest means of preventing high levels of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^6660bb55]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Providing feeding support — breastfeeding-related jaundice categories and risks are described as follows: "Exclusive breastfeeding and hyperbilirubinemia are strongly associated.13 Jaundice in breastfed infants falls into 2 main categories, depending on its timing of onset". Suboptimal intake can lead to hyperbilirubinemia, the so-called breastfeeding jaundice, which "typically peaks on days 3 to 5 after birth and is frequently associated with excess weight loss", and "Breastfeeding fewer than 8 times per day has been associated with higher TSB concentrations". Mechanistically, "Low milk and low caloric intake contribute to decreased stool frequency and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin". In contrast, "hyperbilirubinemia that persists with adequate human milk intake and weight gain is referred to as "breast milk jaundice" or the "breast milk jaundice syndrome". This cause of prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which "can last up to 3 months", "is almost always nonpathogenic and not associated with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia".

### Significant weight loss in breastfed term infants readmitted for hyperbilirubinemia [^52c29347]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Significant weight loss reflects feeding problems and seems to be an important factor associated with severe hyperbilirubinemia in breastfed term infants. If these findings are confirmed by large prospective studies in order to determine not only association but also a cause-effect relationship, weight loss from birth could become a useful clinical parameter to identify breastfed term infants at risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia either during birth hospitalization or follow-up visits, particularly in settings where routine pre-discharge TSB levels have not been implemented yet.

### Is breastfeeding really favoring early neonatal jaundice? [^eb5a754c]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the development of significant hyperbilirubinemia in a large unselected newborn population in a metropolitan area with particular attention to the relationship between type of feeding and incidence of neonatal jaundice in the first week of life.

Study Design

A population of 2174 infants with gestational age ≥ 37 weeks was prospectively investigated during the first days of life. Total serum bilirubin determinations were performed on infants with jaundice. The following variables were studied: type of feeding, method of delivery, weight loss after birth in relationship to the type of feeding, and maternal and neonatal risk factors for jaundice. Statistical analyses were performed using the z test for parametric variables and the t test for nonparametric variables. In addition, the multiple logistic regression allows for the estimation of the role of the individual characteristics in the development of hyperbilirubinemia. Data concerning serum bilirubin peak distribution in jaundiced newborns were analyzed using a single and a double Gaussian best fit at least squares. The t test was performed to compare 2 values (high and low) of the serum bilirubin peak in breastfed and supplementary-fed infants with those in bottle-fed infants.

Results

The maximal serum bilirubin concentration exceeded 12.9 mg/dL (221 micromol/L) in 112 infants (5.1%). The study demonstrated a statistically significant positive correlation between patients with a total serum bilirubin concentration > 12.9 mg/dL (221 micromol/L) and supplementary feeding; oppositely, breastfed neonates did not present a higher frequency of significant hyperbilirubinemia in the first days of life. However, best Gaussian fitting of our data suggests that a small subpopulation of breastfed infants have a higher serum bilirubin peak than do bottle-fed infants. Newborns with significant hyperbilirubinemia underwent a greater weight loss after birth compared with the overall studied population, and infants given mixed feeding lost more weight than breastfed and formula-fed newborns, indicating that formula has been administered in neonates who had a weight loss beyond a predetermined percentage of birth weight. Significant hyperbilirubinemia was also strongly associated with delivery by vacuum extractor, some perinatal complications (cephalohematoma, positive Coombs' test, and blood group systems of A, AB, B, and O [ABO] incompatibility) and Asian origin. Multiple logistic regression analysis shows that supplementary feeding, weight loss percentage, ABO incompatibility, and vacuum extraction significantly increase the risk of jaundice, while only cesarean section decreases the risk.

Conclusion

The present study confirms the important role of fasting in the pathogenesis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, although breastfeeding per se does not seem related to the increased frequency of neonatal jaundice but to the higher bilirubin level in a very small subpopulation of infants with jaundice. In fact, in the breastfed infants, there is a small subpopulation with higher serum bilirubin levels. These infants, when starved and/or dehydrated, could probably be at high risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^3a9f0ff1]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Suboptimal intake jaundice of the newborn — early feeding volumes, timing, and bilirubin dynamics: In the first 24 hours of life, exclusively breastfed infants may receive no more than 1–5 mL of milk per feeding or 5–37 mL in total; normal early stomach capacity is 27 mL per feeding or about 150 mL/day, and maternal secretory activation occurs around 2–5 days of age. Strong evidence suggests that increased serum bilirubin in the first few days is highly correlated with suboptimal enteral intake. Early onset jaundice occurring within 24–48 hours of birth is unlikely to be related to breastfeeding and should be assessed and treated promptly without interruption of breastfeeding. In a normal adult, even 24 hours without caloric intake results in a small increase in unconjugated bilirubin of about 17–34 μmol/L (1–2 mg/dL), an effect due to an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin.

### Jaundice and breastfeeding [^485da029]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Optimal management of breastfeeding does not eliminate neonatal jaundice and elevated serum bilirubin concentrations. Rather, it leads to a pattern of hyperbilirubinemia that is normal and, possibly, beneficial to infants. Excessive frequency of exaggerated jaundice in a hospital or community population of breastfed infants may be a warning that breastfeeding policies and support are not ideal for the establishment of good breastfeeding practices. The challenge to clinicians is to differentiate normal patterns of jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia from those that indicate an abnormality or place an infant at risk.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^06e514ae]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infants — initial bilirubin evaluation recommends that any formula-fed infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age should be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin (1A), while breast-fed babies that appear otherwise well may be followed clinically until 3 weeks of age and, if still icteric, should then undergo serum evaluation of total and conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin. Measurements of serum bilirubin should always be fractionated into unconjugated (indirect) or conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia (1A), and conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia (> 1.0 mg/dL, 17 μmol/ L) is considered pathologic and warrants diagnostic evaluation (1A).

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^c1f5fd50]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infants — background and risk factors — Cholestasis is defined as reduced bile formation or flow with retention of biliary substances, and cholestatic jaundice affects approximately 1 in every 2500 term infants; the most common causes in the first months of life are biliary atresia (BA) (25%–40%) and individually uncommon genetic disorders (25%). Parenteral nutrition (PN)-related cholestasis is present in up to one-fifth of neonates receiving PN for > 2 weeks, with longer duration of PN and intestinal failure described as independent risk factors; small for gestational age is an independent risk factor for neonatal cholestasis. The guideline notes it is not meant to address cholestasis in the preterm infant or PN, but close follow-up and serial measurements of fractionated bilirubin levels early in life are important, alongside monitoring growth and tolerance of enteral feedings. Persistent cholestasis in any infant should be considered hepatocellular in origin and all causes of cholestasis, including BA, should be ruled out in a timely fashion, and several studies demonstrate a higher incidence of BA in preterm infants compared with term infants with delayed diagnosis resulting in poorer outcome.

### Diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia in the term neonate: for a safer first week [^eb5ed369]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

New data support restructuring the approach toward diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubenia in the term neonate to make it more physician-friendly and gain wider implementation. The authors advocate clear criteria for patient safety, preventive approaches, and timely interventions. Structural changes to facilitate a system-based approach should include predischarge bilirubin management; follow-up bilirubin management; and lactational support and nutritional management. The authors advocate total serum bilirubin screening and a scoring system based on clinical risk factors as predischarge screening strategies; we should screen all babies for hyperbilirubinemia and for targeted follow-up based on an hour-specific total serum bilirubin measured for risk assessment. We should also provide focused universal education emphasizing adequate lactational nutrition, to decrease severe hyperbilirubinemia and thus prevent kernicterus.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^e14644f8]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 2 states that oral supplementation with water or dextrose water should not be provided to prevent hyperbilirubinemia or decrease bilirubin concentrations, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B and a Strong Recommendation. Avoiding supplementation may help promote breastfeeding because supplementation has been associated with reduced maternal confidence in breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration, and one study found no difference in peak serum bilirubin concentrations or the need for phototherapy among term breastfed newborn infants with physiologic jaundice by whether they were fed supplemental water. Another study of breastfed term infants whose weight was appropriate for gestational age found that supplementation with water or dextrose water was associated with higher bilirubin concentrations on day 6 after birth. There is no evidence of the benefit of routinely providing water or dextrose water supplementation and there are possible harms, including interference with breastfeeding, hyponatremia, and water intoxication, and there are no clear risks, harms, or costs associated with not routinely supplementing infants with water or dextrose water who are not receiving phototherapy.

Jaundice is one of the most common problems faced by preterm infants in the first month of life. Decreased life span of red blood cells, immaturity of liver enzymes, increased enterohepatic circulation, and associated illnesses such as sepsis and hemolysis play important role in contributing towards increased bilirubin levels in preterm infants. Other factors including delayed initiation of enteral feeding, unable to tolerate feeds and bruising at the time of delivery may impose additional risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia in these infants. Unlike in term infants, hyperbilirubinemia is more protracted and largely unpredictable in preterm infants. Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy may manifest as kernicterus leading to choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, hearing loss or sensorimotor integration disorders. Even though exact serum bilirubin levels causing acute bilirubin encephalopathy are not known, the preterm infants despite rigorous monitoring are at higher risk for kernicterus at lower bilirubin concentrations than term infants.

Bilirubin research in preterm infants is primarily targeted towards early detection, determination of the treatment thresholds to prevent encephalopathy and assessment of neurological consequences. Current guidelines typically focus on initial management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants to prevent kernicterus. Risk for prolonged and life-threatening jaundice remains in the preterm infants beyond first week of life which can lead to undesirable consequences. Gestational age and hour of life specific nomograms for preterm infants have been created to help develop early management decisions. A recent study has demonstrated use of an electronic clinical decision-making tool to alert physicians of critical values of bilirubin levels in preterm infants. While critical hyperbilirubinemia is diagnosed in early phase there is scarcity in the literature on natural course of bilirubin levels at various gestational ages beyond first week of life. Also, the factors indirectly affecting bilirubin concentrations including inflammatory makers such as c reactive protein (CRP) or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) have rarely been taken into consideration for predicting bilirubin levels especially in preterm infants.

Hyperbilirubinemia during breastfeeding — Decreased breastfeeding frequency, especially ≤ 7 times a day, is associated with higher bilirubin concentrations, whereas breastfeeding 9 to 10 times a day is associated with lower concentrations; when supplementation is necessary it should preferably be with expressed maternal milk, and phototherapy alone in an otherwise healthy infant is not an indication for formula unless bilirubin concentrations are approaching exchange transfusion levels.

### Enteral feeding for nutritional support… [^9a12586c]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

23: Enteral Feeding for Nutritional Support Published: January 2020 "Enteral Feeding for Nutritional Support", Pediatric Nutrition, Ronald E. Kleinman, MD, FAAP, Frank R. Greer, MD, FAAP Download citation file: Pediatric patients who do not have adequate growth with oral intake may be supported by enteral nutrition for nutritional management depending on gastrointestinal digestive and absorptive capacity. Commonly used enteral tube feeding routes for nutritional support include nasogastric, gastrostomy, nasojejunal, gastrojejunal, and jejunostomy. Although both enteral and parenteral routes can be used to provide nutritional support to pediatric patients, enteral nutrition is preferred, because it is more "physiologic, " less expensive, and easier to administer. Enteral nutrition produces fewer metabolic and infectious complications and better supports the integrity of the barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract. Enteral nutrition also allows for.

### Bodyweight loss in predicting neonatal hyperbilirubinemia 72 hours after birth in term newborn infants [^be64166f]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

For non-pathological hyperbilirubinemia infants, dehydration is thought to be the major factor. However, there seemed to be low accuracy when measured by the AUC curve with BWL at 24, 48, and 72 hours. In addition, the positive and negative likelihood ratios were very close to 1, suggesting that they had low practical significance. The cutoff values we propose are based on higher specificity and higher positive likelihood ratio, as the purpose was to prevent further significant hyperbilirubinemia. Accordingly, although BWL may not be an ideal predictor for significant hyperbilirubinemia, the results may be useful for physicians and parents as an indication of when extra feeding should be added.

There are some limitations to the present study. First, we used two different methods of measuring total bilirubin. Although the accuracy of a transcutaneous device has been proven, there may have been some deviation between the two methods. Second, maternal and neonatal risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia were not addressed (time of cord clamping, diabetic mothers, information on the order of birth in each group, previous siblings with significant jaundice and preterm infants). Third, the difficulty in assessing the adequacy of intake in breastfeeding and the variable timing of shifting to mixed feeding made the line between two feeding groups more blurred. Fourth, the major limitation may have been that we didn't enroll more patients in the study. Finally, the study was performed in Taiwan and the cutoff values may not necessarily be applicable to other regions of the world.

### Bodyweight loss in predicting neonatal hyperbilirubinemia 72 hours after birth in term newborn infants [^ff3634c4]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Even though many reports support the idea that breastfeeding induces severe hyperbilirubinemia, we found that breastfeeding was not statistically correlated with significant hyperbilirubinemia, thereby supporting the use of breast milk. A previous study reported that a BWL of more than 7% was an independent risk factor for early neonatal jaundice, and that infants with a BWL of more than 7% had a 1.4-fold increased risk of jaundice. In the current study, the BWL percentages in the first three days after birth were all statistically significantly correlated with significant hyperbilirubinemia 72 hours after birth. In particular, the BWL percentage on day 3 was a better predictive factor for significant hyperbilirubinemia 72 hours after birth compared to day 1 and day 2. Moreover, regardless of being exclusively breastfed or mixed fed, the BWL within the first three days seemed to be influenced by the BWL on the previous day. This not only emphasizes the importance of BWL percentage on day 2 and day 3, but also suggests that the infants with a high BWL percentage on day 1 can still avoid further significant hyperbilirubinemia with optimal intervention. In this study, the order of birth (first born vs. second or third) was not analyzed since although the experience with breast feeding may influence the timing of giving extra formula milk and even the percentage of weight loss, the BWL was still the most objective factor regardless of how many babies the mother had.

### Bodyweight loss in predicting neonatal hyperbilirubinemia 72 hours after birth in term newborn infants [^8802d519]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, BWL on the first three days after birth may be a predisposing factor for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and may also serve as a helpful factor to prevent significant hyperbilirubinemia 72 hours after birth. The optimal BWL cutoff percentages on the first three days after birth presented in this study may predict hyperbilirubinemia and indicate the need for supplementary feeding.

### Progression of enteral feeding volumes in extremely low birth weight infants in the "Connection trial" [^076e34af]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Multivariable analysis was utilized to limit the effect of co-occurring events and the Akaike stepwise model to show the best fit of variables (including those not statistically significant) as an explanation for total variability in time to reach the TDE volumes. Using these models, the effect of BW, GA, and Apgar score essentially persisted. It also was evident that abdominal signs and serious GI complications, such as perforation, independently associated with a reduced chance of reaching the investigated volumes with up to 68%. Similarly, a hypotensive event can, after median 5 days, almost half this chance. The model also associated respiratory SAEs and to a lesser extent PDA and renal events to the TDE volumes.

Numerous factors occurring in the intensive care treatment of premature infants have been linked to the difficulty of adhering to common feeding protocols. Besides abdominal and other signs attributable to feeding intolerance, such events have included low BW, GI morbidities, metabolic acidosis, cardiovascular instability, and symptomatic PDA. Such factors also include a variety of events like hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, hyperglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, as well as concerns based on dogma (gastric residuals, transfusions, indomethacin use, etc.) rather than on a scientific basis. The present findings show the strength of association for 24 clinical variables to the feeding progression of ELBW infants, which to our knowledge has not been detailed previously. An unusually high incidence of clinical complications could be a potential explanation for the modest speed of feeding progression in the examined infants. However, this seems unlikely as the "Connection Study" protocol excludes randomization of infants "in extremis" and those with early-onset sepsis or recognized GI conditions, whereby a selection toward healthier infants as compared with unselected cohorts of ELBW infants seems probable. The present analysis of current practices across a substantial number of high-level, neonatal intensive care units show an unexpectedly slow progression of enteral feeding volumes in ELBW infants and suggest that a stricter adherence to commonly advocated feeding regimens may abbreviate the time to full enteral feeds in these infants.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of jaundice in infants — initial testing and timing at the 2‑week visit: The most important initial step in evaluating a jaundiced infant is measurement of total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin, as visual estimation is unreliable and cannot determine indirect versus direct hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice at 2 weeks of age is a relatively common finding, observed in 2.4% to 15% of newborns, but it should alert the provider of the possibility of cholestasis. Providers have several options: the most direct is to test serum for total and direct bilirubin at the 2‑week visit (or if concerned at any age). If the 2‑week‑old infant is breast‑fed with a normal physical examination and no history of dark urine or acholic stool, another option is follow‑up in 1 week; if jaundice persists at 3 weeks of age, laboratory evaluation is recommended to include fractionation of serum bilirubin.

### Toward nutrition improving outcome of critically ill patients: how to interpret recent feeding RCTs? [^843633eb]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Apart from the ideal feeding regimen or the ideal feeding mode, there is a need for validated markers of feeding tolerance and responsiveness. Indeed, although enteral nutrition is usually favored over parenteral nutrition, patients on enteral nutrition may suffer feeding intolerance and, in severe cases, non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, especially when delivered at higher doses in patients with shock. Currently, there are no validated biomarkers or bedside monitoring devices that can predict enteral feeding tolerance, which could help avoid complications of too early enteral feeding, such as aspiration pneumonia. At current, gastric residual volumes are still widely used and recommended by guidelines, although a RCT (N = 449) did not show benefit of measuring gastric residual volumes in adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Also, metabolic responsiveness to feeding cannot be predicted or monitored at the bedside, which requires further investigation (Fig. 1). In the past, experts have recommended to use nutritional risk scores to inform which patients would benefit most from early enhanced nutrition. However, RCT data have shown that no biomarker was able to discern subpopulations of patients benefiting from early full nutrition. Future research in metabolomics could help to identify which patients may benefit from enhanced or more restricted feeding and at what time. Currently used signs of energy or protein overload are nonspecific and frequently occur outside the context of overfeeding, including hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperuremia and hyperammonemia. A potential sign that may assist in determining readiness for feeding may be the degree of insulin resistance, as can be derived from the amount of insulin required to maintain blood glucose at a predefined level. One important biomarker is, however, phosphate, to detect and early treat refeeding syndrome.

### A practical approach to neonatal jaundice [^f1c3a886]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Kernicterus and neurologic sequelae caused by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are preventable conditions. A structured and practical approach to the identification and care of infants with jaundice can facilitate prevention, thus decreasing rates of morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention includes ensuring adequate feeding, with breastfed infants having eight to 12 feedings per 24 hours. Secondary prevention is achieved by vigilant monitoring of neonatal jaundice, identifying infants at risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, and ensuring timely outpatient follow-up within 24 to 72 hours of discharge. Total serum bilirubin or transcutaneous bilirubin levels should be routinely monitored in all newborns, and these measurements must be plotted on a nomogram according to the infant's age in hours. The resultant low-, intermediate-, or high-risk zones, in addition to the infant's risk factors, can guide timing of postdischarge follow-up. Another nomogram that consists of age in hours, risk factors, and total bilirubin levels can provide guidance on when to initiate phototherapy. If the infant requires phototherapy or if the bilirubin level is increasing rapidly, further work-up is indicated.

### The role of enteral nutrition in the reversal of parenteral nutrition-associated liver dysfunction in infants [^d4880ffd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Liver dysfunction in children dependent on parenteral nutrition (PN) is well established, and the extent of hyperbilirubinemia has been shown to correlate with morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess whether increasing provisions of enteral nutrition can improve PN-associated hyperbilirubinemia over time.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted on infants in our institution's Short Bowel Syndrome Clinic from 1999 to 2004. Inclusion criteria included PN duration more than 1 month, serum direct bilirubin more than 3 mg/dL while on PN, and tolerance of full enteral nutrition with eventual discontinuation of PN. Paired t tests were used for statistical analyses.

Results

Twelve infants were identified with a PN duration of 5 ± 1 months. Five patients underwent liver biopsy while on PN, and histological evidence of cholestasis was found on all specimens. Peak total and direct bilirubin levels were 10.5 ± 1.9 and 7.0 ± 1.6 mg/dL, respectively, and occurred at time of PN discontinuation. Only 2 patients had improvement in serum bilirubin levels before initiation of full enteral nutrition. After initiation of full enteral nutrition and discontinuation of PN, all patients achieved permanent normalization of bilirubin levels by 4 months (P < .05) after a 1-month plateau phase. Alkaline phosphatase levels approached reference range within this time but were not significant.

Conclusion

These data demonstrate for the first time that although PN-dependent infants can achieve normalization of marked hyperbilirubinemia with enteral nutrition, the improvement in liver function usually begins only after full enteral nutrition is tolerated and PN is withdrawn. These findings support the aggressive weaning of PN to enteral nutrition in infants with short bowel syndrome.

### Management of jaundice and prevention of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in infants ≥ 35 weeks gestation [^d2bbef2b]. Neonatology (2008). Low credibility.

Kernicterus is still occurring but should be largely preventable if health care personnel follow the recommendations listed in this guideline. These recommendations emphasize the importance of universal, systematic assessment of the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, lactation support, close follow-up, and prompt intervention when necessary. A systems-based approach to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia should be implemented at all birthing facilities and coordinated with continuing ambulatory care. Translational research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of bilirubin neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic interventions.

### Associations between UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Thai population [^6387c87d]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding combined SLCO1B1, there was a decreasing trend of total bilirubin levels in normal (*1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b), intermediate (*1a/*5, *1a/*15, *1b/*15), low (5/*5, *5/*15, *15/*15) function respectively. The relationship between low function neonates, having lower total bilirubin levels than that of intermediate and normal function, was evident.

In the present study, total bilirubin levels were significantly between case and control groups. In case group, mean of total bilirubin levels were 18.8 ± 2.6 mg/dL, which had higher total bilirubin levels than control group (10.7 ± 3.5 mg/dL). The total bilirubin levels in control group showed slightly high levels in Thai neonates. There was a nutrition significance to be noted in this study. The results showed that there was a correlation between nutrition and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Thai neonates (P = 0.013). The finding was consistent with Bratton S et al. stating that breast milk may cause jaundice in newborns in their first week of life. There is limited research regarding formula and mixed-feeding and its association with neonatal jaundice.

In addition, some limitations of this study were regarding small sample size, which does not represent the whole population. Large sample size could be studied in further study. Our study was also limited to only two genes, SLCO1B1 and UGT1A1, so other genes related with hyperbilirubinemia could be investigated in further studies. Since this was a retrospective study, some clinical data were also missed, including nutrition.

### Breastfeeding and jaundice [^ee0b8f09]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

In the breastfed infant, prolongation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia into the third and later weeks of life in the healthy newborn is a normal and regularly occurring extension of physiologic jaundice. This is known as breastmilk jaundice. A factor in human milk increases the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Insufficient caloric intake resulting from maternal and/or infant breastfeeding difficulties may also increase serum unconjugated bilirubin concentrations. This is the infantile equivalent of adult starvation jaundice. It is known as breastfeeding jaundice or "breast-nonfeeding jaundice". This increase in severity of physiologic jaundice of the newborn also results from increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, but not because of a factor in human milk. In extreme cases, it may place the infant at risk for development of bilirubin encephalopathy. Optimal breastfeeding practices, which result in minimal initial weight loss and early onset of weight gain, are associated with both reduced breastfeeding jaundice and minimization of the intensity of breastmilk jaundice.

### Early or delayed enteral feeding for preterm growth-restricted infants: a randomized trial [^ea6b9b9e]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Growth-restricted preterm infants are at increased risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and initiation of enteral feeding is frequently delayed. There is no evidence that this delay is beneficial and it might further compromise nutrition and growth.

Methods

Infants with gestation below 35 weeks, birth weight below the 10th centile, and abnormal antenatal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms were randomly allocated to commence enteral feeds "early", on day 2 after birth, or "late", on day 6. Gradual increase in feeds was guided by a "feeding prescription" with rate of increase the same for both groups. Primary outcomes were time to achieve full enteral feeding sustained for 72 hours and NEC.

Results

Four hundred four infants were randomly assigned from 54 hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland (202 to each group). Median gestation was 31 weeks. Full, sustained, enteral feeding was achieved at an earlier age in the early group: median age was 18 days compared with 21 days (hazard ratio: 1.36 [95% confidence interval: 1.11–1.67]). There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of NEC: 18% in the early group and 15% in the late group (relative risk: 1.2 [95% confidence interval: 0.77–1.87]). Early feeding resulted in shorter duration of parenteral nutrition and high-dependency care, lower incidence of cholestatic jaundice, and improved SD score for weight at discharge.

Conclusions

Early introduction of enteral feeds in growth-restricted preterm infants results in earlier achievement of full enteral feeding and does not appear to increase the risk of NEC.

### Significant weight loss in breastfed term infants readmitted for hyperbilirubinemia [^83e2e3b6]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In the current worldwide context of short postpartum hospital stays, it is important to assess factors associated with potentially preventable causes of newborn readmissions. Hyperbilirubinemia and feeding difficulties with or without dehydration are the most frequent indications for readmission in the first 2 weeks of life and strongly related each other due to inadequate oral intake, particularly in term infants. Exclusively breastfed healthy term infants in whom breastfeeding has not been well established by the time of discharge are at greater risk of poor caloric intake, dehydration associated with decreased volume and frequency, and the secondary delayed gastrointestinal motility determines an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Weight loss in the infant of greater than 7% from birth weight indicates possible breastfeeding problems. Several studies have previously reported significant weight loss in patients with extreme hyperbilirubinemia; however, only few have analyzed separately this association in breastfed otherwise healthy term infants. The objective of this study was to determine the overall readmission rate due to hyperbilirubinemia and to describe the association between total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels and weight loss during the first two weeks of life in breastfed term infants who were discharged home after birth hospitalization and considered to be well infants.

Although it is a frequently observed and usually benign finding, prolonged jaundice in the breastfed newborn requires a thoughtful evaluation that excludes possible pathological aetiologies. While recommendations for the treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the first 7 days of life are straightforward, the approach to the breastfeeding infant with jaundice that persists beyond the immediate neonatal period is less clearly delineated. A sound understanding of bilirubin physiology and familiarity with current literature must guide the management of the otherwise well breastfeeding infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Assessment and monitoring — risk factor–based follow-up: Infants with risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia (Table 1) require closer monitoring than infants without risk factors. Determining the presence of these risk factors requires examining the infant, assessing laboratory data, and obtaining a family history of blood disorders or neonatal jaundice.

### Bodyweight loss in predicting neonatal hyperbilirubinemia 72 hours after birth in term newborn infants [^379d0fda]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Methods of analysis

The following variables were analyzed: gender, gestational age, birth BW, BW on the first day (24 hours) after birth (day 1), BW on the second day (48 hours) after birth (day 2), BW on the third day (72 hours) after birth (day 3), BWL/percentage on day 2 and day 3, feeding style (exclusively breast fed or mixed feeding), delivery method (normal spontaneous delivery or cesarean section), and total bilirubin level on day 3.

Exclusive breast feeding is the optimal initial feeding style for infants according to the WHO treatment guidelines. However, when there was insufficient breast milk formula was given, and the feeding style was classified as mixed feeding.

Transcutaneous total bilirubin was routinely checked in all infants using a transcutaneous device (BiliChek, Respironics, USA), and total serum bilirubin (TSB) was checked by heel stick for blood sampling (direct spectrophotometric method) when the infants presented with a transcutaneous bilirubin level of more than 15 mg/dL. The infants were divided into two groups: the significant hyperbilirubinemia group (total bilirubin level greater than 15 mg/dL 72 hours after birth), and the non-significant hyperbilirubinemia group (total bilirubin level ≤ 15 mg/dL 72 hours after birth). The infants in the significant hyperbilirubinemia group were admitted for phototherapy. The correlations between BWL percentage within the first 3 days and the total bilirubin level 72 hours after birth were analyzed separately. We further analyzed the correlations between the TSB level and related clinical parameters.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^16dedeca]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

While we set out to ensure that our recommendations are realistic and consistent with the prevailing conditions in most LMICs, the methodological approach used in this document deserves clarification. We followed standard protocols for guideline adaptation including a comprehensive review of the priority issues to be considered, the formation of a working group, quality rating of existing guidelines and independent review by a panel of leading clinicians and experts on newborn care from different world regions. However, we did not grade specific studies in support of various proposals in this paper, more so because the body of evidence was predominantly adapted from existing guidelines or supported by the best available data from LMICs. Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is frequently underpinned by complex interactions of diverse biological and environmental risk factors across populations. It is our view therefore, that each LMIC still needs to develop context-specific guidelines for their own population. Such an initiative should be broadened to involve key stakeholders including parent groups and community leaders. It may be helpful to prepare separate documents for each level of care to avoid information overload especially at the primary care level. While the scope of this framework is not exhaustive, like any of the existing guidelines, we believe that most of the recommendations will still be valuable to LMICs that did not meet our selection criteria. Finally, strong clinical and public health leadership at all levels will be required to surmount the challenges that typically mitigate against initiatives for improved child and newborn care in LMICs.

### Case report: severe COVID-19 with late-onset sepsis-like illness in a neonate [^ee20edd2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Early adequate feeding is an important and fundamental issue that must be considered in newborns, including when we face new diseases such as COVID-19. In addition to being able to prevent jaundice, early adequate feeding can also prevent clinical worsening of the disease and its associated risk of mortality. Therefore, if physicians focus only on new hypotheses about the cause of jaundice, this could result in a harmful situation.

In septic patients, the etiopathology of hyperbilirubinemia usually also results in hemolysis. Although the etiology has some differences, both show the same trend of increased bilirubin levels, starting with an increase in indirect bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) followed by an increase in direct bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin). This increase is correlated with worsening of the disease. Our patient was treated with phototherapy and ursodeoxycholic acid, which is the standard drug for cholestasis management.

There is no specific drug treatment of SARS‐CoV-2 for neonates. Symptomatic and supportive treatment, including oxygen supplementation and maintenance of hydration, electrolytes, and acid–base balance, are the mainstay therapies for patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Supplementation with water and electrolytes should be appropriate to avoid aggravating pulmonary edema and reducing oxygenation. Antibiotic therapy for susceptible organism is usually given for 7 to 10 days, and should be discontinued immediately after clinical improvement and negative blood culture results. Neonates with persistent, complicated infections may require a longer duration of antibiotic treatment. It is important to stop antibiotics after a bacterial infection is sufficiently ruled out. In our patient, antibiotics were stopped after 7 days.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved remdesivir for neonates weighing more than 3,500 g. In this case, our patient weighed less than 3,500 g and evidenced hyperbilirubinemia. The administration of remdesivir is not included in the protocol of COVID-19 in children and neonates in Indonesia. Our patient was discharged after resolution of respiratory symptoms and fever, with clinical stability, and after two negative nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 acquired 48 hours apart.

### Two-hourly versus 3-hourly feeding for very low birthweight infants: a randomised controlled trial [^f30c0c6c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether feeding with 2-hourly or 3-hourly feeding interval reduces the time to achieve full enteral feeding and to compare their outcome in very low birthweight preterm infants.

Design

Parallel-group randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio.

Setting

Two regional tertiary neonatal intensive care units.

Patients

150 preterm infants less than 35weeks gestation with birth weight between 1.0 and 1.5kg were recruited.

Interventions

Infants were enrolled to either 2-hourly or 3-hourly interval feeding after randomisation. Blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was time to achieve full enteral feeding (≥ 100mL/kg/day). Secondary outcomes include time to regain birth weight, episode of feeding intolerance, peak serum bilirubin levels, duration of phototherapy, episode of necrotising enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis and gastro-oesophageal reflux.

Results

72 infants were available for primary outcome analysis in each group as three were excluded due to death-three deaths in each group. The mean time to full enteral feeding was 11.3days in the 3-hourly group and 10.2days in the 2-hourly group (mean difference 1.1days; 95% CI -0.4 to 2.5; p = 0.14). The mean time to regain birth weight was shorter in 3-hourly group (12.9 vs 14.8days, p = 0.04). Other subgroup analyses did not reveal additional significant results. No difference in adverse events was found between the groups.

Conclusion

3-hourly feeding was comparable with 2-hourly feeding to achieve full enteral feeding without any evidence of increased adverse events.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^5c4e9eb8]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #22 — Supplement selection for jaundiced breastfeeding infants: Expressed own mother's milk is the first and best supplement and can be hand expressed into a small cup or spoon for direct feeding with skilled support. If own mother's milk is not available, donor human milk will increase enteral intake, and breastfeeding infants supplemented only with donor milk meet the World Health Organization definition of exclusive breastfeeding, though the specific effect of donor milk supplementation on bilirubin levels has not been studied. If neither own mothers' milk nor donor human milk is available, it may be necessary to supplement with infant formula. Supplementation with water or glucose water is contraindicated because it does not reduce serum bilirubin, interferes with breastfeeding, and might cause hyponatremia.

### Natural history of conjugated bilirubin trajectory in neonates following parenteral nutrition cessation [^c0ae8cf3]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

While our findings appear to confirm that there are two distinct bilirubin curves after PN cessation, the eventual biochemical resolution of cholestasis appears to occur in majority of infants four weeks post PN cessation. It is important to note that normalization of bilirubin values does not always reflect normalization of liver histology. In fact, a number of publications have demonstrated persistence of liver fibrosis despite resolution or improvement in cholestasis following PN cessation. Nevertheless, further investigation of these individuals is unlikely to be of significant help in the majority. Longitudinal observation in most infants following PN cessation is sufficient, inasmuch as a rise in serum bilirubin can now be viewed as a common occurrence before resolution of cholestasis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to follow-up after discharge, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to calculate and use the difference between the bilirubin concentration measured closest to discharge and the phototherapy threshold at the time of the bilirubin measurement, beginning at least 12 hours after birth, to guide follow-up if patient discharge is being considered.

### Significant weight loss in breastfed term infants readmitted for hyperbilirubinemia [^7d7731d7]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, significant weight loss was notably associated with hyperbilirubinemia readmission in exclusively breastfed otherwise healthy term infants. The overall readmission rate was 64 per 1000 term infants, and approximately 50 per 1000 exclusively breastfed term infants. Hyperbilirubinemia readmission rates in term infants usually vary from 2 to 21.7 per 1000. Exclusive breastfeeding is not only a major risk factor for hyperbilirubinemia but also for dehydration, particularly if nursing is not going well and weight loss is excessive. Weight loss > 5% was observed in about 25% of breastfed infants during their first 24 hours of life. Approximately one-third of breastfed term infants readmitted for hyperbilirubinemia (mean TSB level of 22.8 mg/dL) showed to have weight loss from birth > 12%. In addition, breastfed infants with significant hyperbilirubinemia (> 12.9 mg/dL) showed greater weight loss from birth than bottle-fed infants (6.9% vs. 4.2%). Also, significant hyperbilirubinemia was associated with a greater weight loss after 72 hours of life (8.0% vs. 6.4%). Fasting and poor caloric intakes seem to have a greater effect on the regulation of serum bilirubin than breastfeeding per se. We found a significant difference in percent of weight loss between infants with severe and significant hyperbilirubinemia (8.8% vs. 5.9%, respectively). Our study also showed that approximately 60% of infants readmitted for severe hyperbilirubinemia had significant weight loss.

A mean age at admission of 4.7 days found in our study is comparable to previous reports. Breastfed infants experience their maximum weight loss by day 3. In a previous study, the majority of newborns readmitted for feeding problems were 4 to 7 days old, and many had concurrent dehydration and jaundice (34.3%). Since infants with severe hyperbilirubinemia were readmitted approximately 2 days later than infants with hyperbilirubinemia alone, we could assume that a significant proportion of these infants would have been detected early in follow-up visits based on weight loss from birth according to the weak positive correlation found in this study. This analysis is consistent with the findings of a recent study which demonstrated that if weight loss > 10% leads to interventions to improve nutrition and hydration, no association with extreme hyperbilirubinemia is found.

### Development of liver dysfunction under artificial nutrition: a reason to modify nutrition therapy in the intensive care unit? [^34587beb]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Actual research suggests that artificial nutrition in critically ill patients can be associated with alterations in liver dysfunction biomarkers such as enzymes and serum bilirubin. In addition to known patient-dependent and nutrient-dependent factors, the time of initiation of nutrition therapy seems to influence the risk of altered biomarkers, whereas age and gender, weight, range of clinical scores, type of primary diagnosis, necessity for mechanical ventilation, and the composition of the lipid emulsion used within total parenteral nutrition had no significant effects. This commentary analyzes these new results in the light of known relationships between illness and artificial nutrition therapy.

Neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a diagnostic challenge. A full term, small for gestational age boy presented with cholestasis, hypoglycemia, hyperferritinemia and severe bilateral deafness. Diagnostic work-up revealed two hereditary diseases: alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (PI*ZZ genotype) and autosomal recessive deafness type 3 (compound heterozygous MYO15A gene mutation). In addition, we found late hypoglycemia on full enteral feeding which complicated this case. Hyperferritinemia is an uncommon finding in newborn cholestasis without liver failure.

### Natural history of conjugated bilirubin trajectory in neonates following parenteral nutrition cessation [^0ebaf9cd]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

All patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) for greater than or equal to 21 days from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010 were screened for eligibility. For purposes of this study, patients were included if they had a diagnosis of cholestasis with a bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dL during their hospitalization in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Those infants who remained on PN prior to discharge with insufficient laboratory follow up (sufficient laboratory follow-up defined as having laboratory data available for at least four weeks post PN cessation), those with other identified etiologies for liver disease, and those with cyanotic congenital heart disease were all excluded from this study. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the University of Texas Health Science at Houston and Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital prior to the initiation of this retrospective chart review.

Data collection

Demographic data (including date of birth, gender, gestational age, ethnicity, birth weight, presence or absence of intrauterine growth retardation); gastrointestinal related medical diagnoses (number of episodes of necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal resection); nutritional/growth parameters (days receiving PN, days receiving parenteral lipid > 2 g/kg/day, date of initiation of enteral feeds, type of enteral nutrition, route of feeding administration), cholestasis history (date and value of maximal conjugated bilirubin (CB), date of resolution of cholestasis defined as CB < 2), and infectious history (number of episodes of sepsis/suspicion of sepsis, type of sepsis event, organism) were collected.

Statistical analysis

Patients were classified into two groups based on whether CB increased ("up" group) or decreased ("down" group) immediately after PN cessation. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients who reached normalized CB < 2 mg/dL within 4 weeks of PN cessation in each group, tested by Fisher's exact test. Nutritional and host factors were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Time to CB normalization was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and tested by log-rank test.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^8338faf9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal cholestasis — rare diseases and idiopathic causes — is described as a shrinking "black box", with identifiable causes increasing through modern clinical genetics; reducing costs and access to genetic testing, including exome and genome sequencing and extended gene panels, have facilitated diagnosis, the most studied causes include metabolic diseases and disorders of bile transport and of bile acids, and the meaning of a gene mutation or polymorphism is dependent on clinical context with advanced sequencing methods promising to further increase the diagnostic yield. In conclusions, cholestatic jaundice in an infant is a typical presenting feature of inherited liver disease and frequently clinically confounds prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia; identification of infants with cholestasis remains crucial, the guideline is not intended as a substitute for individualized care, and vigilance is crucial in detecting these infants and referring them to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist who can provide essential diagnostic and treatment modalities to optimize outcome.

### Randomized, controlled trial of early intravenous nutrition for prevention of neonatal jaundice in term and near-term neonates [^3b97429f]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of early parenteral nutrition on prevention of neonatal jaundice in term and near-term neonates who could not be enterally fed.

Patients and Methods

Seventy-two infants were randomized into 2 groups: the early parenteral nutrition group (group 1) received 1.0 g/kg/d amino acids beginning within the first day and 1.0 g/kg/d lipid added the next day. The conventional nutrition group (group 2) started on a solution containing 10% glucose and electrolytes in the first 72 hours of life, followed by 0.5 g/kg/d amino acids and lipid. Amino acids and lipid were each increased by 0.5 g/kg/d to a maximum of 3.0 g/kg/d in both groups. Main outcome measures were energy intake; serum bilirubin levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours; need for phototherapy; and duration of phototherapy.

Results

Higher energy intake was achieved after the first day in group 1. Daily serum bilirubin levels did not significantly differ between groups. Nine patients in each group required phototherapy. The initiation times of phototherapy were 92.9 hours ± 25.5 in group 1 and 83.1 hours ± 28.5 in group 2. Durations of phototherapy were 37.3 hours ± 11.1 in group 1 and 52.0 hours ± 20.7 in group 2. There were no significant differences in the requirement, initiation time, and duration of phototherapy.

Conclusions

Early parenteral nutrition has no proven benefit in terms of therapy requirement or severity and duration of neonatal jaundice compared with conventional parenteral nutrition in term and near-term infants who could not be enterally fed.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^ded75b7f]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding infant jaundice — monitoring and initial treatment highlights standard bilirubin assessment and breastfeeding-compatible therapies: for monitoring, guidelines from the United States, Canada, and several other countries recommend a measurement of the TSB or TcB in every infant before discharge from the birth hospitalization, and Universal TcB measurement is also standard practice in Japan. Combining the TcB measurement with the infant's gestational age and plotting on an appropriate graph provide a prediction of the risk of hyperbilirubinemia that is as accurate as the combination of all other nonpathologic risk factors. When TSB levels rise above the thresholds stated in guidelines, despite adequate lactation support, phototherapy is recommended as the most effective treatment, and other therapeutic options include temporary additional feedings with expressed breast milk; temporary supplementation with donor human milk if available; temporary supplementation with infant formula; or very rarely, temporary interruption of breastfeeding and replacement feeding with infant formula. When discussing any treatment options with parents, healthcare providers should emphasize that all treatments are compatible with continuation of breastfeeding, and healthcare providers should offer special assistance to these mothers to ensure that they understand the importance of continuing to breastfeed and know how to maintain their milk supply if temporary interruption is necessary.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: evaluation and treatment… [^71fd3360]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

More than two-thirds of newborns develop jaundice, the clinical manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia, and most cases are physiologic and benign. 1 In healthy newborns, unconjugated bilirubin, a lipid-soluble breakdown product of heme, transiently elevates during days 2 to 5 after delivery due to the turnover of fetal erythrocytes. 2 The liver conjugates the bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted via urine and stool. Bilirubin levels usually return to normal over one to three weeks without intervention or adverse effects. 2, 3. Phototherapy Phototherapy is the first-line treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Absorbed light converts unconjugated bilirubin to lumirubin, one of its structural isomers. Lumirubin is then directly excreted via urine or stool, thereby bypassing the need for conjugation in the liver. 34 Guidelines do not recommend direct or indirect sunlight as a reliable or safe treatment option. 4, 20.

Newborns with hyperbilirubinemia due to suboptimal breast milk intake, as evidenced by weight loss of greater than 10% of birthweight or decreased urine and stool output, may benefit from supplementation to promote bilirubin excretion and shorten phototherapy duration. Supplementation with formula or expressed or donor breast milk should be considered using shared decision-making between parents and physicians.
4. 4 Phototherapy should begin before the transfer, if not already initiated, along with intravenous hydration. Urgent laboratory testing should include TSB and direct or conjugated bilirubin level, direct antiglobulin test, complete blood count, albumin level, chemistry panel, blood typing and crossmatching, G6PD concentration, and end-tidal carbon monoxide level if available. The TSB level should be monitored every two hours until the bilirubin decreases to at least 2 mg per dL less than the exchange transfusion threshold or a transfer of care is achieved.
4.

EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION Emergent exchange transfusion is recommended for newborns exceeding the exchange transfusion threshold or with signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. 4 Exchange transfusion involves slowly replacing the newborn's blood with donor red blood cells to remove bilirubin and antibodies that may be causing hemolysis. 49 Exchange transfusion effectively lowers bilirubin, but it is unclear if it decreases rates of acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus because they already occur so rarely. 4.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^f5016dcb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged neonatal jaundice is yellowing of the skin and sclerae, secondary to hyperbilirubinaemia, persisting beyond 14 days after birth. It is very common — 20–30% of breastfed neonates are still jaundiced at 1 month — and is usually transient and benign; however, it can be an important indicator of serious underlying pathology. The most common cause is physiological jaundice (especially in breastfed neonates), but a number of disease processes must be excluded, including haemolysis, sepsis, hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, metabolic disease and liver disease (mainly congenital hepatitis B/C or biliary atresia). It is particularly important to diagnose biliary atresia as, although rare, it is the only cause that is usually asymptomatic but in which early specialist assessment and surgery (Kasai portoenterostomy; ideally within 6–8 weeks of age) are crucial for prognosis. The abnormality of the biliary tree causes an obstructive jaundice with conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas physiological jaundice and almost all other pathological causes result in a predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence — the primary publisher of UK clinical guidelines (NICE) — guidance is that the cause of prolonged jaundice requires investigation and referral for any neonate with a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia > 25 µmol/L, but this is based on no referenced data. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHN) recently released an updated guideline in collaboration with their European Society (ESPGHN) recommending further investigation under the definition of an abnormal direct bilirubin (a slight overestimate of conjugated bilirubin — see the Methods section) as > 1.0 mg/dL (17.2 µmol/L). Their previous guideline, which also incorporated the direct–total bilirubin ratio, acknowledged that their thresholds are based on 'lower quality studies'. And they now state that the move away from using the ratio is for simplicity rather than any novel evidence.

### Management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: pediatricians' practices and educational needs [^da068c32]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus

The pediatricians' response regarding risk factors for the development of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is presented in Table 3. The majority believed "to a very high or moderate degree" that jaundice presenting in the first 24 hours and Rh/ABO incompatibility were significant risk factors for the development of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants. More than 70% of the pediatricians stated that "hardly ever or to a small degree" would they consider gestational age between 37–38 weeks and jaundice noted after discharge from the hospital as significant risk factors for the development of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Breast-feeding, bruising/cephalohematoma, and previous siblings with jaundice were rated by more than 80% of pediatricians' as risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia with only a small or moderate degree of belief. The pediatricians' belief regarding the relationship between these risk factors and severe hyperbilirubinemia was not associated with the practice type.

Table 3
Pediatricians' answers to the question: "Do you believe that following factors are associated with severe hyperbilirubinemia in term neonates?"

Only 48 of the 351 respondents (13.9%) reported first hand experience with one or more patients with kernicterus. These pediatricians were older (50.7 ± 11.5 vs. 44.5 ± 11.3 years, P < 0.03) and had been in practice much longer (18.0 ± 12.4 vs. 13.8 ± 12.4 years, P < 0.01) as compared those who had not seen a single case of kernicterus. A large number of pediatricians believed that a TSB more than 20 mg/dL was a significant risk factor for the development of kernicterus (Figure 3). Among these, a higher proportion of pediatricians from community hospitals regarded bilirubin > 30 mg/dL as a risk factor for kernicterus. The vast majority of respondents (more than 88% in each practice group) rated kernicterus as a public health concern and about 50% agreed that severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus should be made laboratory based reportable conditions in New Jersey.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (indications for initiation), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate intensive phototherapy at the total serum bilirubin thresholds on the basis of gestational age, hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors, and age of the infant in hours.

### Fluid supplementation for neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia [^460f61d7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a common problem which carries a risk of neurotoxicity. Certain infants who have hyperbilirubinaemia develop bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus which may lead to long-term disability. Phototherapy is currently the mainstay of treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. Among the adjunctive measures to compliment the effects of phototherapy, fluid supplementation has been proposed to reduce serum bilirubin levels. The mechanism of action proposed includes direct dilutional effects of intravenous (IV) fluids, or enhancement of peristalsis to reduce enterohepatic circulation by oral fluid supplementation.

Objectives

To assess the risks and benefits of fluid supplementation compared to standard fluid management in term and preterm newborn infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia who require phototherapy.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 7 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 7 June 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 7 June 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared fluid supplementation against no fluid supplementation, or one form of fluid supplementation against another.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group using the Covidence platform. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

Out of 1449 articles screened, seven studies were included. Three articles were awaiting classification, among them, two completed trials identified from the trial registry appeared to be unpublished so far. There were two major comparisons: IV fluid supplementation versus no fluid supplementation (six studies) and IV fluid supplementation versus oral fluid supplementation (one study). A total of 494 term, healthy newborn infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia were evaluated. All studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of care personnel, five studies had unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors, and most studies had unclear risk of bias in allocation concealment. There was low- to moderate-quality evidence for all major outcomes. In the comparison between IV fluid supplementation and no supplementation, no infant in either group developed bilirubin encephalopathy in the one study that reported this outcome. Serum bilirubin was lower at four hours postintervention for infants who received IV fluid supplementation (MD -34.00 μmol/L (-1.99 mg/dL), 95% CI -52.29 (3.06) to -15.71 (0.92); participants = 67, study = 1) (low quality of evidence, downgraded one level for indirectness and one level for suspected publication bias). Beyond eight hours postintervention, serum bilirubin was similar between the two groups. Duration of phototherapy was significantly shorter for fluid-supplemented infants, but the estimate was affected by heterogeneity which was not clearly explained (MD -10.70 hours, 95% CI -15.55 to -5.85; participants = 218; studies = 3; I² = 67%). Fluid-supplemented infants were less likely to require exchange transfusion (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.71; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02; participants = 462; studies = 6; I² = 72%) (low quality of evidence, downgraded one level due to inconsistency, and another level due to suspected publication bias), and the estimate was similarly affected by unexplained heterogeneity. The frequencies of breastfeeding were similar between the fluid-supplemented and non-supplemented infants in days one to three based on one study (estimate on day three: MD 0.90 feeds, 95% CI -0.40 to 2.20; participants = 60) (moderate quality of evidence, downgraded one level for imprecision). One study contributed to all outcome data in the comparison of IV versus oral fluid supplementation. In this comparison, no infant in either group developed abnormal neurological signs. Serum bilirubin, as well as the rate of change of serum bilirubin, were similar between the two groups at four hours after phototherapy (serum bilirubin: MD 11.00 μmol/L (0.64 mg/dL), 95% CI -21.58 (-1.26) to 43.58 (2.55); rate of change of serum bilirubin: MD 0.80 μmol/L/hour (0.05 mg/dL/hour), 95% CI -2.55 (-0.15) to 4.15 (0.24); participants = 54 in both outcomes) (moderate quality of evidence for both outcomes, downgraded one level for indirectness). The number of infants who required exchange transfusion was similar between the two groups (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.27; RD 0.11, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.34; participants = 54). No infant in either group developed adverse effects including vomiting or abdominal distension.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence that IV fluid supplementation affects important clinical outcomes such as bilirubin encephalopathy, kernicterus, or cerebral palsy in healthy, term newborn infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia requiring phototherapy. In this review, no infant developed these bilirubin-associated clinical complications. Low- to moderate-quality evidence shows that there are differences in total serum bilirubin levels between fluid-supplemented and control groups at some time points but not at others, the clinical significance of which is uncertain. There is no evidence of a difference between the effectiveness of IV and oral fluid supplementations in reducing serum bilirubin. Similarly, no infant developed adverse events or complications from fluid supplementation such as vomiting or abdominal distension. This suggests a need for future research to focus on different population groups with possibly higher baseline risks of bilirubin-related neurological complications, such as preterm or low birthweight infants, infants with haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia, as well as infants with dehydration for comparison of different fluid supplementation regimen.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^edfbae81]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In sharp contrast to the practice in most high-income nations, national guidelines for the effective management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia are rare in LMICs where the disease burden is greatest. In this paper, the authors have attempted to identify a number of key considerations for the effective management of hyperbilirubinaemia in LMICs that can be considered truly resource-poor, based on their HDI status. Most of the recommendations have been adapted from existing evidence or consensus-based guidelines in the industrialised world after extensive consultations at different stages with experts from various countries. Efforts were made to ensure that the proposed framework is consistent with universally accepted requirements for quality in healthcare. It is hoped that these recommendations will assist in the development of context-specific national guidelines and mobilisation of requisite resources for the care of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery in LMICs.

### Correlation between serum vitamin D level and neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^f666a4d4]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The result of this study showed no relationships between vitamin D levels and NIH. In spite a fact that, a larger statistical population was examined in this study compared to previous studies, more extensive research or a cohort study or an animal study is still needed to generalize the result of this study.

Limitations

A multivariable linear regression model with the infants' indirect bilirubin as the outcome measure controlling for confounders and a regression model with infant Vitamin D as outcome and maternal Vitamin D as exposure to assess relationship would be helpful but unfortunately we weren't able to do it in this study.

Background

Liver disease associated with prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) is a well-recognized phenomenon. Evidence of biochemical liver injury may be present as early as 2 weeks after initiation of parenteral nutrition. Numerous studies have shown that patients with parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) have significant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, in neonates with short bowel syndrome, reduction of PNALD is associated with improvement in survival and outcomes. The mechanism of PN-associated liver disease is not entirely known and is likely multi-factorial. Potential causes include loss of epithelial barrier function leading to passage of enteric organisms into the hepatic circulation with subsequent endotoxin and inflammatory cytokine release. Additionally, alteration in expression of proteins involved with canalicular bile acid transport, such as multi-drug resistance transporters (MDR1 and MDR2), may contribute to the liver dysfunction seen in individuals receiving PN. The use of intravenous lipid emulsions has also been shown to place patients at higher risk for liver disease and is an independent risk factor for the development of PNALD. Studies have indicated that strategies such as lipid minimization may be useful in preventing PNALD.

While it is clear that PN has significant effects on neonatal morbidity and mortality, the progression of liver disease after parenteral nutrition has been discontinued has not been well studied. The general assumption is that PN cholestasis will improve once full enteral nutrition has been achieved. However, one study by Yang et al. reported that in pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome ALT and bilirubin worsened for several weeks after cessation of PN and normalized 8 weeks after PN discontinuation.

This study will attempt to describe the natural history of PNALD in infants without intestinal failure following cessation of PN. Further, we aim to identify host and nutritional factors associated with resolution of PNALD.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infancy — abstract recommendations and epidemiology — affects approximately 1 in every 2500 term infants; the most common causes in the first months of life are biliary atresia (25%–40%) and an expanding list of monogenic disorders (25%). The recommendations include that any infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin, and that an elevated serum direct bilirubin level (direct bilirubin ≥ 1.0 mg/dL or > 17 μmol/L) warrants timely consideration for evaluation and referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist.

Results

Patients

A total of 341 charts of NICU patients receiving PN for ≥ 21 days were screened for this study. Based on the criterion of having CB ≥ 3 mg/dL during hospitalization, 164 (48%) patients were eligible. Of these, 43 met all inclusion criteria with no evidence for any other identified cause of liver disease and with sufficient laboratory monitoring for analysis. The vast majority were excluded due to insufficient bilirubin values available for review four weeks after PN cessation. The mean gestational age was 27.3 weeks +/− 3.9 SD (median 26 weeks, min 23–max 38). Patients were observed for a median of 120 days (min 63–max 311) after PN cessation.

Biochemical monitoring on PN

PN administration requires careful clinical and laboratory monitoring. High blood urea nitrogen, hyperglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are frequently encountered biochemical abnormalities on PN. In addition to routine observations, periodic measurements of the following biochemical parameters are suggested during PN therapy. Suggested monitoring by the group is shown in Additional file 1: Table S3.

No data are available to determine the effect of higher versus lower amino acid and lipid intake in PN in 'sick' infants (e.g. infants with moderate-severe respiratory distress, receiving cardiovascular support, possible sepsis, acidosis); and 'surgical' or postoperative infants or infants post-cardiopulmonary bypass.

Blood Urea Nitrogen [Conversion blood urea nitrogen = blood urea divided by 2.14]: In the Cochrane review comparing higher versus lower amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition, six studies reported BUN levels. The criteria for abnormal blood urea nitrogen differed between the studies and varied from > 10 mmol/L to 21.4 mmol/L. There was a significant increase in abnormal blood urea nitrogen level from higher amino acid intake in all these studies although a threshold level was not clear. Given the data supporting the importance of early amino-acid administration in premature infants, limiting amino acid intake based on serum BUN alone is not warranted. BUN levels up to 14.3 mmol/L may be considered acceptable in VLBW infants on PN provided there are no other parameters to suggest protein intolerance (eg hyperammonaemia > 122 μmol/L).

Hyperglycaemia

Hyperglycaemia (> 8.3 mmol/L) is not uncommon in ELBW infants. If blood glucose > 10 mmol/L (moderate hyperglycaemia), further management to control hyperglycaemia should be considered including reducing the glucose infusion rate (e.g. changing over to 7.5% Dextrose PN).

Hypoglycaemia (BGL < 2.6 mmol/L) can occur particularly with a sudden cessation of PN or undetected extravasation of solutions.

Cholestasis

Defined as serum level of direct bilirubin > 20% of total serum bilirubin or serum level of direct bilirubin > 34 mmol/L [mg/dL × 17.10].

Hypoalbuminemia

Defined as serum albumin, preterm < 18 g/L in preterm and < 25 g/L in term neonates.

Results and discussion

Study selection

The results of the literature search are shown in the Fig. 1. Searches of Medline and EMBASE databases yielded 193 references. An additional 44 citations were found by extensively searching the bibliographies of selected articles. From the 237 studies identified, 180 studies were excluded after a cursory review of the title, abstract, and, when necessary, the results section. The full text of the remaining 57 articles was reviewed in detail. Forty of the remaining studies were excluded: 11 reports failed to report specific diagnoses; 6 reports had inclusion criteria that were too narrow; 6 reports included patients without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; 6 reports were not case series or cohort studies; 5 reports had subjects with previously identified disease processes; 2 failed to include a detailed clinical evaluation; 1 each had vague inclusion criteria, non-consecutive patients, included the same patient population from another selected study, or had a sample size of less than 10. The remaining 17 studies comprise this review.

### A case report of a challenging diagnosis of biliary atresia in a patient receiving total parenteral nutrition [^762c422b]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

This prematurely-born infant presented with a cholestatic jaundice that transiently improved after discontinuation of parenteral nutrition but then recurred and was ultimately found to have BA. At the time of his initial liver biopsy, the patient had prolonged exposure to TPN and had only recently begun to tolerate full feeds. These factors, combined with an improving conjugated bilirubin, led to the decision that close clinical observation was appropriate since these findings were consistent with PNAC. Patients on TPN frequently have a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and can have concurrent biochemical markers of liver injury as well as histologic changes ranging from steatosis to obstructive features with portal fibrosis and cirrhosis. This patient's conjugated hyperbilirubinemia was initially felt to be related to TPN initially, especially since work-up for additional causes of cholestasis was negative. In general, there is an expectation that after discontinuation of TPN, cholestasis should improve, although the time to resolution is not well characterized in the literature. Some patients have a rise in their conjugated bilirubin in the first month after TPN discontinuation prior to resolution.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^75e4f711]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Breast milk jaundice (prolonged jaundice associated with breast milk feeding) — duration and evaluation: Many breastfed infants have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that extends into the second and third week, but can continue for as long as 2–3 months; at 28 days, 21% of predominantly breastfed infants were still visibly jaundiced and 34% had a TcB ≥ 85 μmol/L (≥ 5 mg/dL). Prolonged jaundice beyond the second to third week in healthy breastfeeding newborns has been called breast milk jaundice to distinguish it from suboptimal intake jaundice, which should resolve by 1–2 weeks. Whenever jaundice in a breastfed newborn is prolonged beyond the third week, it is important to rule out cholestasis by measuring the direct or conjugated bilirubin level and to evaluate for other causes of prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia. If breast milk hyperbilirubinemia extends beyond 2 months, conditions such as ongoing undiagnosed hemolysis, Gilbert's syndrome, or the very rare Crigler–Najjar syndrome (with an incidence of 1 per million births) should be considered.

### Jaundice in low birthweight infants: pathobiology and outcome [^82c82ab3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2003). Low credibility.

Jaundice in preterm, as well as full term, infants results from (a) an increased bilirubin load in the hepatocyte, (b) decreased hepatic uptake of bilirubin from the plasma, and/or (c) defective bilirubin conjugation. Hyperbilirubinaemia in preterm infants is more prevalent, more severe, and its course more protracted than in term neonates.

### The early use of minimal enteral nutrition in extremely low birth weight newborns [^1e511f23]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To gather information regarding the efficacy of early minimal enteral nutrition on overall feeding tolerance in extremely low birth weight infants.

Study Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the early use of minimal enteral nutrition in extremely low birth weight infants from day 2 to day 7 vs control infants. On day 8, feeding volume in both groups were advanced by 10 mL kg(-1) day(-1) until full enteral feedings were reached. Time to full feeds, number of intolerance episodes, anthropometric measurements, peak total bilirubin levels, incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and incidence of sepsis were compared between the two groups with t-test and chi (2) test.

Result

Eighty-four infants were enrolled in the study but only 61 infants completed the feeding protocol. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups with regards to growth patterns, feeding tolerance, mortality, length of hospital stay and incidence of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis.

Conclusion

Early minimal enteral nutrition use in extremely low birth weight infants did not improve feeding tolerance.
