## Question

What are the recommended dosing regimens of claromir for treating hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the recommended dosing regimens of "claromir" are for treating hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what drug "claromir" likely refers to. Then, I should verify approved indications and any hypertension-related dosing in authoritative sources. Next, I will review cardiovascular safety and drug–drug interaction issues that could be mistaken for therapeutic blood pressure effects. Finally, I will outline evidence-based options for treating hypertension and provide a clear recommendation, while asking for clarification if the drug name was misspelled.

> Wait, let me verify the identity first: "claromir" does not appear in the provided references, and given context, it most plausibly reflects a misspelling of clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, so I should proceed by confirming clarithromycin's pharmacologic class and label indications to ensure I'm not conflating agents with similar names.

> I need to check the official indications and dosing for clarithromycin and see if hypertension appears anywhere; clarithromycin is indicated for respiratory tract infections such as pharyngitis/tonsillitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and lower respiratory tract infections, certain skin/soft tissue infections, H. pylori eradication as part of combination therapy, and prevention/treatment of disseminated MAC in HIV, with typical adult oral regimens of 250–500 mg twice daily depending on the infection and regimen, but none of these labels include an indication for hypertension [^116jFBoA] [^111GcjoT] [^114FPRCt] [^116vSQJW] [^114htiA7] [^114oxPie] [^114pHLHN] [^112WxEts] [^113jGyQE] [^1125Puuw] [^111d8jJR] [^111z1RBc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether any recognized hypertension guidelines or evidence syntheses list clarithromycin as an antihypertensive option or provide dosing for blood pressure control, and I find that first-line antihypertensive classes include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and sometimes beta-blockers, with no role for antibiotics such as clarithromycin in treating hypertension or any recommended dosing for that purpose [^1174mEMA].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular safety and interaction contexts where clarithromycin might influence blood pressure indirectly; clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and can dangerously increase exposure to dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers used for hypertension, leading to hypotension and acute kidney injury, and this risk has been demonstrated in population-based data and case reports, which reflects harmful interaction rather than a therapeutic antihypertensive indication [^115yEMki] [^1136yZ3m].

> Let me also examine proarrhythmic risk, because macrolides can prolong QT and precipitate arrhythmias; clarithromycin and related macrolides are associated with QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, and safety reviews underscore this class effect and its potential for serious cardiac events, which again argues against any intentional use for blood pressure management [^113RK28p] [^113FUEje] [^1169BKDt].

> But wait, what if the question stems from mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist coadministration or potassium concerns; clarithromycin can interact with MRAs metabolized by CYP3A, and observational data suggest potentiation of hyperkalemia risk with some agents such as esaxerenone, while the eplerenone label cautions against coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors and provides modified dosing with moderate inhibitors, highlighting safety issues rather than any BP-lowering intent for clarithromycin [^111SGjxb] [^114yWx7L].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should consider whether any historical antibiotic–cardiovascular hypotheses might have confused the issue; a past observational study explored whether antichlamydial antibiotics could reduce myocardial infarction risk in elderly hypertensive patients, showing at most a tentative signal without clear consistency, but this is not an indication for treating hypertension and has not translated into antibiotic use for blood pressure control or guideline-supported practice [^1172BXnm].

> I will now examine proper hypertension therapy options to ensure the clinical recommendation is complete; guideline-supported choices include thiazide-type diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers as foundational therapies, with consideration of initial combination therapy in appropriate patients to achieve faster and more reliable BP control, all of which are evidence-based approaches unlike macrolide antibiotics that have no antihypertensive role [^113gqDFC].

> Let me think about practical next steps for the user; clarithromycin has no established role in hypertension treatment and there is no recommended dosing regimen for hypertension, so if the intent was to ask about an antihypertensive with a similar-sounding name, please clarify the specific drug, and in the meantime, if guidance is needed for standard agents, I can provide labeled dosing for options like metoprolol succinate, loop diuretics where appropriate adjunctively, or others consistent with guideline-supported therapy while avoiding hazardous macrolide interactions with calcium channel blockers [^113q15kd] [^115xLheo].

> Conclusion and medical recommendation: Clarithromycin is not indicated for hypertension, and there are no dosing regimens for clarithromycin to treat high blood pressure; given its interaction profile and cardiac risks, it should not be used for BP control, and management should follow established antihypertensive classes and strategies, with attention to potential drug–drug interactions if a macrolide is concurrently required for infection treatment [^116jFBoA] [^115yEMki] [^113RK28p].

I **can't find** a medication named "claromir". Did you mean:

- **Clarithromycin** (an antibiotic, not an antihypertensive)?
- **Clonidine** (an antihypertensive)?
- **Clopamide** (a thiazide-like diuretic)?
- **Clopidogrel** (an antiplatelet, not for hypertension)?

If you **confirm the exact drug name**, I can provide the correct hypertension dosing strategy. If you meant a common antihypertensive, here are examples:

- **Metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL)**: start 25–100 mg once daily; titrate weekly; max 400 mg/day [^113q15kd].
- **Furosemide (Lasix)**: usual initial 40 mg twice daily; adjust to response [^115xLheo].
- **Torsemide**: start 5 mg once daily; maintenance 5–10 mg daily [^1171yUNr].

Please confirm the **medication** so I can give the precise dosing strategy.

## References

### SPL drug information for torsemide [^1171yUNr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of torsemide administered orally (PO) for the treatment of hypertension in adults is as follows:

- **Initial dosage**: Start at 5 mg PO daily for 4–6 weeks.
- **Maintenance dosage**: 5–10 mg PO daily.

---

### Lasix [^115xLheo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Therapy should be individualized according to the patient's response to gain maximal therapeutic benefit and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain said response.

- **Adults**: The usual initial dose of Lasix for hypertension is 80 mg, typically divided into 40 mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If the response is not satisfactory, other antihypertensive agents should be added.

Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when Lasix is used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent an excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50% when Lasix is added to the regimen. As blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of Lasix, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary.

- **Geriatric patients**: In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see precautions: geriatric use).

### Toprol-XL [^113q15kd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**: In adults, the usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust the dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. Generally, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after one week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.

	- For pediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 years or older, the recommended starting dose of Toprol-XL is 1 mg/kg once daily. However, the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. Doses above 2 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- Toprol-XL has not been studied in pediatric patients under 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Angina pectoris**: Individualize the dosage of Toprol-XL. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until the optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

- **Heart failure**: Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to the initiation of Toprol-XL, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of Toprol-XL is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYH.

### Is it time to move to multidrug combinations [^115b7nia]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical benefit of aggressive blood pressure (BP) control in reducing adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes is well documented. However, a majority of patients with hypertension remain poorly controlled with monotherapy and require two or more agents to achieve their target BP levels. Patients with hypertension who also have diabetes or renal disease benefit from even lower BP targets but may be more difficult to treat and require three or more drugs to achieve control. Using two or more drugs, each at lower doses, is usually more effective and less commonly associated with adverse effects than higher doses of a single drug. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes and renal disease, the treatment of hypertensive patients with multidrug combinations will become even more common. Knowing how specific combinations can be used effectively will be an important component of the treatment strategy for hypertension.

### Associations between macrolide antibiotics prescribing during pregnancy and adverse child outcomes in the UK: Population based cohort study [^111J1MeG]. BMJ (2020). High credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics, including erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, are among the most frequently prescribed antibiotics during pregnancy in Western countries. Policy advice about macrolide use in pregnancy varies. In Sweden, a warning against the use of erythromycin during the first trimester was issued in 2005 following a reported association between macrolides and cardiac malformations. The United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency advises that alternatives to clarithromycin and azithromycin should be prescribed during pregnancy. Warnings have also been issued in the United States and the UK against the use of azithromycin and clarithromycin in adults with a high risk of cardiovascular complications, based on evidence of an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac mortality from two systematic reviews and 19 randomized controlled trials. A recent systematic review on the use of macrolides during pregnancy showed consistent evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage, but less consistent evidence for congenital malformations, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy.

We conducted a large retrospective cohort study with data from a UK representative primary care database to address these uncertainties. We compared children born to mothers prescribed macrolide antibiotics during pregnancy with those whose mothers were prescribed penicillins to minimize the effects of confounding due to infection. Macrolides are often used as alternatives for patients with penicillin allergy; penicillins have long established safety records during pregnancy.

### Best treatment approach: Should a national consensus be the best consensus [^114F7fTP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed at achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti-H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance. According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related factors (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen, and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori-related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113gqDFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

We found a large average difference in home systolic blood pressure (HSBP) in favor of initial use of combination therapy compared with initial monotherapy across the first 8 months of the study (phases 1 and 2); there was no discernible subset of patients in whom this difference was not observed. This difference was largely due to the superiority of combination therapy in the first 16 weeks (phase 1), by margins of almost 8 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, for home and clinic systolic blood pressure (BP). Although combination therapy is expected to show superior efficacy and is recommended for stage 2 hypertension by some guidelines, this has not yet become the norm in routine practice. Consequently, we incorporated a number of planned measurements in the study design that we believed, if positive, would help to change practice.

- **Co-primary end point of HSBP at 32 weeks**: The prespecified time point for evaluation of the never-catch-up hypothesis suggested that initial less intense BP control results in subsequently poorer BP control. This hypothesis was rejected. The phenomenon of never catching up, observed in studies such as the ASCOT and VALUE trials, from which the hypothesis arose, may be more a consequence of suboptimal treatments being combined rather than optimal treatments being started sequentially. In contrast, our other original comparisons provide strong support for the rationale of initial combination.

A unique feature of PATHWAY-1 is the "trial within a trial" of a randomized monotherapy crossover trial, the aims of which were to ensure that each participant's best therapy at maximal force-titrated dose was co.

### Diagnosis and therapy in the era of antimicrobial stewardship [^112MWcca]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Understanding the mechanism of treatment failure is crucial in the development and implementation of effective therapies. During the development of clarithromycin-containing therapy for FDA approval, various experiments were conducted, including trials using a triple combination of clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole. These trials initially tested antimicrobial susceptibility only before treatment and reported successful outcomes for susceptible infections. However, as highlighted above, a comprehensive understanding of therapy requires susceptibility testing both before therapy and in treatment failures, as was done in the FDA submissions.

The general lack of susceptibility testing in both scenarios has significantly contributed to the failure of early development of highly effective regimens. Common causes for treatment failure include the presence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, the emergence of resistance during treatment, ineffectiveness of antisecretory therapy, improper drug doses or dosing intervals, too short a duration of therapy, and poor patient adherence to therapy. A failure to identify the cause of treatment failures, coupled with simply comparing outcomes with other therapies, has delayed the identification of uniformly effective therapies and the improvement of poorly performing regimens.

Notably, low-dose amoxicillin significantly reduced the emergence of resistance during therapy with clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin. It remains unclear whether amoxicillin also enhanced therapy by acting as an additional antibiotic.

### Antibiotics in primary prevention of myocardial infarction among elderly patients with hypertension [^1172BXnm]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Given the premise that certain bacteria, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, may play a role in the etiology of atherosclerosis, subjects treated with antibiotics that have antibacterial activity against C. pneumoniae may be at lower risk for the development of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) than untreated subjects.

- **Methods**: A case-control design, nested within a cohort of 29,937 elderly subjects in whom antihypertensive therapy was initiated (1982–1995), was used. Each subject who was hospitalized with a primary discharge diagnosis of MI between 1987 and 1995 (n = 1047) was matched on calendar time to five randomly selected control subjects for exposure contrasts. Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted to adjust for predisposing factors for MI.

- **Results**: Although no clear consistent effect of antibiotics use was found in relation to MI, a trend was observed for a decreased risk of acute MI in patients receiving a prescription for antichlamydial antibiotics in the preceding three months (odds ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.46–1.00). Antibiotics without antichlamydial activity showed no benefit in MI risk.

- **Conclusion**: The beneficial effect of certain antichlamydial antibiotics in reducing the risk of MI cannot be excluded based on this representative cohort of elderly patients in a routine clinical care setting. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm the usefulness of antibiotics in the primary prevention of MI.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

- **Primary objective**: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

- **Search strategy**: Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane clinical trial register using the standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of at least one-year duration comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

- **Main results**: Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95), and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides.

### Hypotension induced by the concomitant use of a calcium-channel blocker and clarithromycin [^1136yZ3m]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Calcium-channel blockers are the first-line treatment for hypertension in the elderly. Macrolides, such as clarithromycin, are the most widely prescribed antibiotics to outpatients. However, it is not widely known that hypotension can be induced by the interaction between these two types of drugs. Here, we report a case of hypotension caused by the concomitant use of a calcium-channel blocker and clarithromycin.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113VYVBH]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Searches were performed in the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for possible results in unpublished studies, and the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC [ProQuest]) was searched for results in non-indexed journals or other reporting forms, all from inception to 15 September 2021, with no language restrictions. To improve search strategy sensitivity, the strategies were developed using Medline subject heading (MeSH) terms, synonyms, and Boolean operators (where possible). Keywords and MeSH terms included:

- **Thiazide diuretics**: 'hydrochlorothiazide', 'chlorothiazide', 'bendroflumethiazide', 'hydroflumethiazide', 'cyclopenthiazide', 'chlorthalidone', 'metolazone', 'indapamide', 'mefruside', 'xipamide', 'bemetizide'
- **Potassium-sparing diuretics**: 'spironolactone', 'eplerenone', 'amiloride', 'triamterene'
- **General terms**: 'thiazide diuretics', 'inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel', 'potassium-sparing diuretic', 'hypertension'

Comprehensive search strategies are provided in the Supplement (Search Strategy).

- **Study selection**: An electronic database was exported to reference manager software (EndNote X9), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were independently selected by pairs of independent reviewers using the liberal accelerated approach. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Authors were contacted to seek any potential unpublished outcomes.

### Hyperkalemia by eplerenone or esaxerenone in the presence or absence of clarithromycin in hypertensive patients: A retrospective observational cohort study [^111SGjxb]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

This study investigates how mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), specifically eplerenone and esaxerenone, cause hyperkalemia in a dose-dependent manner. The research focuses on the cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated drug-drug interaction between the MRAs and clarithromycin.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study involved adult hypertensive patients who were administered either MRA plus clarithromycin or MRA alone, using a propensity score matching (1:1). The difference in serum potassium level (ΔK, maximum level - baseline level) between groups was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Linear regression analysis identified variables correlating with ΔK in patients administered MRA plus clarithromycin.

- **Results**: Following propensity score matching (each with nine patients), serum potassium levels increased after treatment with MRA plus clarithromycin [4.3 (3.5 to 5.1) meq/L to 4.9 (4.0 to 5.5) meq/L, P = 0.0234] and MRA alone [4.3 (4.0 to 4.7) meq/L to 4.6 (4.4 to 5.2) meq/L, P = 0.0469]. Although no significant difference in ΔK was found between groups [MRA plus clarithromycin: 0.5 (0.1 to 1.1) meq/L vs. MRA alone: 0.3 (0.1 to 1.2) meq/L, P = 0.7231], ΔK was notably higher in patients taking esaxerenone plus clarithromycin compared to those taking esaxerenone alone [0.6 (0.5 to 1.1) meq/L vs. 0.1 (0.1 to 0.2) meq/L, P = 0.0495]. In contrast, clarithromycin did not significantly affect ΔK in patients with eplerenone [0.4 (-0.2 to 1.2) meq/L vs. 0.8 (0.1 to 1.3) meq/L, P = 0.5745]. A positive correlation between ΔK and age was observed in patients treated with MRA plus clarithromycin (y = 0.03×x - 1.38, r = 0.71, P = 0.0336).

### Estimated cardiac risk associated with macrolides and fluoroquinolones decreases substantially when adjusting for patient characteristics and comorbidities [^113YhLtz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This study aimed to assess the cardiac risk associated with the use of macrolides and fluoroquinolones and how it changes when adjusting for patient characteristics and comorbidities. The research analyzed medical data to determine the extent of these risks.

- **Study findings**: The results indicated that the estimated cardiac risk significantly decreases after accounting for individual patient factors.

- **Methodology**: The study employed a detailed statistical analysis to control for various comorbidities, enhancing the accuracy of the risk assessment.

- **Conclusion**: Adjusting for patient-specific variables is crucial for accurately evaluating the cardiac risks associated with these antibiotics.

This work received funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health and the University of Iowa Health Venture's Signal Center.

### Fixed-drug combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension [^113HmGzx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

As combinations of drugs from different classes that have synergistic or additive effects and properties to cancel out each other's untoward hemodynamic and metabolic effects become more widely used, their use as first-line therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients is growing in popularity. The possibility of beginning therapy with a fixed two-drug combination may be preferable to starting with monotherapy followed by upward titration and the addition of other agents. More combinations are entering the market and proving their effectiveness in randomized controlled trials and large multicenter studies. One suggestion is the "polypill", a fixed combination of multiple agents that address various components of the metabolic syndrome and coexisting common risk factors in both high-risk patients with conditions requiring polypharmacy and in healthy asymptomatic individuals.

### Inspra [^114yWx7L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A inhibitors: In post-MI HFrEF patients, do not exceed 25 mg once daily when used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as verapamil, erythromycin, saquinavir, or fluconazole. In patients with hypertension, initiate at 25 mg once daily. For inadequate blood pressure response, dosing may be increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily.

- **CYP3A inhibitors**: Eplerenone metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP3A. Do not use INSPRA with drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In post-MI HFrEF patients taking a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, do not exceed 25 mg once daily. In patients with hypertension taking a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, initiate at 25 mg once daily. For inadequate blood pressure response, dosing may be increased to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists**: The risk of hyperkalaemia increases when eplerenone is used in combination with an ACE inhibitor and/or an ARB. Close monitoring of serum potassium and renal function is recommended, especially in patients at risk for impaired renal function, such as the elderly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Lithium**: A drug interaction study of eplerenone with lithium has not been conducted. Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Serum lithium levels should be monitored frequently if INSPRA is administered concomitantly.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: Bedtime dosing or daytime dosing [^1145xVDZ]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Hypertension management strategies have evolved from solely controlling office blood pressure (BP) to comprehensive 24-hour BP regulation. This review synthesizes evidence on the timing of antihypertensive medication, with a focus on circadian BP rhythms and patients with specific BP patterns or comorbidities. Bedtime dosing may benefit individuals with nocturnal hypertension and nondipper BP patterns, but large trials, such as the TIME study, have shown no significant cardiovascular outcome differences between morning and bedtime dosing. However, the optimal timing of antihypertensive medication for patients with distinct BP rhythms or comorbidities remains uncertain. Future research should investigate the potential benefits of personalized medication timing tailored to BP patterns and clinical conditions. Additionally, treatment strategies should consider BP rhythms, comorbidities, and adherence to optimize outcomes, paving the way for more effective management of hypertensive patients with complex clinical profiles.

### Macrolides and ketolides: Azithromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin [^113RK28p]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The advanced macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, and the ketolide telithromycin are structural analogues of erythromycin. They have several distinct advantages compared to erythromycin, including enhanced spectrum of activity, more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, once-daily administration, and improved tolerability. This article reviews the pharmacokinetics, antimicrobial activity, clinical use, and adverse effects of these antimicrobial agents.

### High-dose versus standard-dose PPI in triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^117VdfqK]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Empiric clarithromycin-containing triple therapies for the eradication of *Helicobacter pylori* do not reliably produce a success rate of 80% or greater on an intention-to-treat basis. This inadequate treatment response is primarily due to clarithromycin resistance. A meta-analysis by Villoria et al. investigated whether a triple therapy containing a high-dose PPI and clarithromycin, plus either amoxicillin or tinidazole, improves the success rate of *H. pylori* eradication compared with a triple therapy containing a standard-dose PPI.

The mean intention-to-treat cure rates were higher in patients who used the high-dose PPI regimen compared to the standard-dose regimen (82% vs. 74%, respectively). However, the actual cure rates in these studies were poor, and the improvements were unlikely to be clinically significant. The prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in most of the world is such that clarithromycin-containing triple therapy should not be used empirically. Alternatives include sequential or concomitant therapy and bismuth-containing quadruple therapies.

### Process evaluation of a double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a quadruple ultra-low-dose treatment for hypertension within a federally qualified health center network (QUARTET USA) [^111kfPLp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Most clinicians were willing to implement LDQT into their everyday clinical practice if supported by clinical research, covered by Medicaid managed care plans, and included in the federal 340B drug discount program. Nearly all clinicians interviewed had experience with prescribing FDC and perceived its benefits on hypertension control. However, despite familiarity with prescribing FDC for hypertension and diabetes, clinicians expressed hesitancy in managing adverse effects and up-titrating LDQT if initial dosing fails to achieve sufficient blood pressure lowering. Therefore, developing treatment algorithms for LDQT, including introducing stepped-care combinations and providing additional guidance on managing adverse effects, would be beneficial in increasing adoption.

- **Antihypertensive FDCs**: A change in the product landscape may be needed to improve conversion of real-world treatment patterns with FDC-equivalent options. Notably, this was not a barrier discussed by health care professionals in this study. In addition, overcoming therapeutic inertia with greater initial (i.e. upfront) blood pressure lowering was not mentioned as a perceived benefit of LDQT (or antihypertensive FDCs) among clinicians in this study, although this is one of the main aims of an LDQT strategy. This suggests low awareness of using antihypertensive FDCs as initial or early treatment of hypertension to overcome therapeutic inertia among health care professionals involved in the QUARTET USA clinical trial.

A paradigm shift in primary care medical education is likely needed to promote an initial understanding and use of LDQT in hypertension management.

### Azithromycin [^1169BKDt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens, such as *S. pneumoniae* and *S. aureus*. The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial involving 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1,000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. Compared to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms, and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

Since the mean Cmax of azithromycin following a 500 mg IV dose given over 1 hour is higher than the mean Cmax of azithromycin following the administration of a 1,500 mg oral dose, it is possible that QTc may be prolonged to a greater extent with IV azithromycin at close proximity to a one-hour infusion of 500 mg.

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management of infections [^1151dKp9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

As noted previously, the first highly successful therapy for H. pylori was a triple therapy consisting of bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole. It used acid-independent antibiotics and needed no antisecretory drug. The rapid increase in metronidazole resistance reduced its effectiveness, which was restored by the addition of a PPI, thus producing bismuth quadruple therapy. Clarithromycin, fluoroquinolones, and amoxicillin are acid-dependent antibiotics and thereby require concomitant antisecretory drugs to achieve high treatment success.

They are all also susceptible to the emergence of resistance during therapy. Emergence of resistance can be markedly reduced by adding a low dose of amoxicillin. H. pylori therapy is also duration-dependent, with 14-day therapy generally being the most effective. Part of this may be due to the fact that PPIs require 3 or 4 days to achieve full effectiveness. Drugs that achieve full effect more rapidly, such as P-CABs, may be fully effective with a duration shorter than 14 days.

Amoxicillin is likely the most acid-dependent of the antibiotics. As a penicillin, it acts by inhibiting production of the bacterial cell, thus requiring active bacterial replication to be effective. The effectiveness is therefore dependent on the effectiveness of the antisecretory drug to produce a milieu that encourages the organism to divide and thus become susceptible to the antibiotic. H. pylori replication occurs when the local pH is between 6 and 8.

### Pattern, frequency and factors associated with inappropriate high dosing in chronic kidney disease patients at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan [^115b2uqb]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Although antibiotics such as cefixime, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin comprised only 7.9% (24/2265) of the total prescribed drugs in our study, we found that 79.1% (19/24) of them were not adjusted for dose. The inappropriate dosing of these drugs in patients with CKD may lead to acute renal failure with tubulointerstitial nephritis, neurotoxicity (hallucination and psychosis), and cardiotoxicity (QT interval prolongation and sudden cardiac death).

In our study, metformin and sitagliptin were the two most frequently prescribed antidiabetic agents, followed by glibenclamide, gliclazide, and glimepiride. However, it was noted that doses of 59.2% of the prescribed antidiabetics — metformin (60.6%), sitagliptin (60.6%), gliclazide (50.0%), glimepiride (41.6%), and glibenclamide (75.0%) — were not adjusted appropriately. This is concerning as the use of metformin in CKD patients with hypoxemic conditions may lead to lactic acidosis. It is recommended that the dose of metformin should be reduced by 50% in CKD stage-3 and should be avoided altogether in CKD stage 4 and 5 patients.

Additionally, the plasma concentration of sitagliptin can increase by two to four folds in patients with moderate to severe CKD, increasing the risk of congestive heart failure. Therefore, it is recommended to start sitagliptin at a lower dose in patients with an eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m². Glibenclamide, gliclazide, and glimepiride are long-acting potent hypoglycemic drugs. Their use without dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment could result in episodes of severe hypoglycemia.

### Prevpack [^112SQR6B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Clarithromycin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of 250 mg clarithromycin tablets is approximately 50%. For a single 500 mg dose, food slightly delays the onset of clarithromycin absorption, increasing the peak time from approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. Food also increases the clarithromycin peak plasma concentration by about 24% but does not affect the extent of clarithromycin bioavailability. It does not affect the onset of formation of the antimicrobially active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin, or its peak plasma concentration, but it slightly decreases the extent of metabolite formation, indicated by an 11% decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Therefore, clarithromycin tablets may be given without regard to food.

In non-fasting healthy human subjects (males and females), peak plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to 3 hours after oral dosing. Steady-state peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations are attained within 3 days and are approximately 3 to 4 mcg/mL with a 500 mg dose administered every 8 to 12 hours. The elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours at this dosage. The nonlinearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended dose of 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 hours. With this dosing, the peak steady-state concentration of 14-OH clarithromycin is up to 1 mcg/mL, and its elimination half-life is approximately 7 to 9 hours.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112mNnxT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

A limitation of our study is that although it is larger and longer than most studies comparing combination therapy to monotherapy, the results are limited to one year and cannot address the impact on morbidity and mortality. In the VALUE study, a 3.8 mm Hg lower clinic systolic BP in the first three months of the study translated into a significant increase in the primary endpoint, driven mainly by mortality and stroke, and was borderline for increased myocardial infarction. In our study, clinic systolic BP was 10.1 mm Hg lower in the first two months and 6.8 mm Hg on average lower over the first four months on combination therapy versus sequential monotherapy. It is likely that such differences applied to a large population would be clinically important, especially for those with similar cardiovascular risk as those who participate in morbidity–mortality studies. The BP Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration found that the relative risk reduction of BP lowering was similar for low- and higher-risk individuals. It is likely that significant proportional reductions in cardiovascular events would accrue from treating all hypertensive patients with initial combination therapy.

Some reviewers argued that more powerful ARBs have been identified since our study was initiated, citing a meta-analysis of azilsartan, or that HCTZ 25 mg is a paltry and unacceptable diuretic because, in combination with this same ARB, it reduced systolic BP by 5.6 mm Hg less than a combination with chlortalidone, affecting a meta-analysis of thiazide-like versus thiazide-type diuretics. There is a paucity of outcome data for further exploration.

### Risks of population antimicrobial resistance associated with chronic macrolide use for inflammatory airway diseases [^115MF1xp]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics have established efficacy in the management of cystic fibrosis and diffuse panbronchiolitis — uncommon lung diseases with substantial morbidity and the potential for rapid progression to death. Emerging evidence suggests benefits of maintenance macrolide treatment in more indolent respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Given the larger patient population affected by these disorders and the potential for macrolide use to spread to conditions such as chronic cough, the widespread use of macrolides, particularly azithromycin, has the potential to significantly influence antimicrobial resistance rates of a range of respiratory microbes.

In this personal view, I explore theories around population (rather than patient) macrolide resistance, appraise evidence linking macrolide use with the development of resistance, and highlight the risks posed by injudicious broadening of their use, particularly of azithromycin. These risks are weighed against the potential benefits of macrolides in less aggressive inflammatory airway disorders. A far-sighted approach to maintenance macrolide use in non-cystic fibrosis inflammatory airway diseases is needed, which minimizes risks of adversely affecting community macrolide resistance. This involves the preferential use of erythromycin and restricting macrolide use to patients at greatest risk, representing an appropriately cautious management approach.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews (2020). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment for hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

### Biaxin [^113PWEu9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Biaxin Filmtab (clarithromycin tablets, USP) and Biaxin Granules (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) may be administered with or without food. However, Biaxin XL Filmtab (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) should be taken with food. Biaxin XL tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed.

Clarithromycin can be administered without dosage adjustment in the presence of hepatic impairment if there is normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR < 30 mL/min), the dose should be reduced by 50%. When patients with moderate or severe renal impairment are taking clarithromycin concomitantly with atazanavir or ritonavir, the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50% or 75% for patients with CLCR of 30 to 60 mL/min or < 30 mL/min, respectively.

### Low-dose combination therapy: The rationalization for an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker in higher risk patients [^116nxBY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

As more high-risk hypertensive patients are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. These combination agents should provide 24-hour control with one daily dose, thereby ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. It not only provides significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapy but also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Additionally, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide other cardiovascular protective benefits.

### The cytochrome P4503A4 inhibitor clarithromycin increases the plasma concentrations and effects of repaglinide [^111CXJhs]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Our objective was to study the effects of the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repaglinide, a novel short-acting antidiabetic drug.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover study, nine healthy volunteers were treated for four days with 250 mg oral clarithromycin or placebo twice daily. On day five, they received a single dose of 250 mg clarithromycin or placebo, and one hour later, a single dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide was given orally. Plasma repaglinide, serum insulin, and blood glucose concentrations were measured up to seven hours.

- **Results**: Clarithromycin increased the mean total area under the concentration-time curve of repaglinide by 40% (P < .0001) and the peak plasma concentration by 67% (P < .005) compared with placebo. The mean elimination half-life of repaglinide was prolonged from 1.4 to 1.7 hours (P < .05) by clarithromycin. Clarithromycin increased the mean incremental area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 3 hours of serum insulin by 51% (P < .05) and the maximum increase in the serum insulin concentration by 61% (P < .01) compared with placebo. No statistically significant differences were found in the blood glucose concentrations between the placebo and clarithromycin phases.

- **Conclusions**: Even low doses of the cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor clarithromycin increase the plasma concentrations and effects of repaglinide. Concomitant use of clarithromycin or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 with repaglinide may enhance its blood glucose-lowering effect and increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Use of clarithromycin and roxithromycin and risk of cardiac death: Cohort study [^116hh8Jy]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has several strengths that merit attention. Firstly, owing to the nationwide coverage of the study, the results are probably widely generalizable. Secondly, the comparative design allowed us to assess roxithromycin and clarithromycin relative to an antibiotic with similar indications, thereby reducing the potential for confounding by indication. Thirdly, to increase the probability of isolating an effect attributable to roxithromycin and clarithromycin, we restricted the study population to people free from serious disease, with no recent use of antibiotics, and no recent hospital admission.

The study also has some limitations. We lacked information on several important lifestyle and health factors that are known to influence the risk of cardiac death, such as smoking and body mass index. Thus, despite propensity score adjustment, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. In propensity score-matched analysis, which might provide more robust control for confounders than adjustment, the results, although less precise, were similar to the main findings. Furthermore, the fact that the risk of cardiac death was similar between penicillin V and both clarithromycin and roxithromycin in periods of past use would indicate that baseline differences between the groups are unlikely to have influenced the results significantly. Whereas the incidence of cardiac death during the use of antibiotics is influenced by acute infection (for which the antibiotic was prescribed), the incidence during past use probably resembles the study participants' baseline risk.

### Relationship between azithromycin and cardiovascular outcomes in unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease [^1177NWf7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin is highly used in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID‐19, despite prior research suggesting that azithromycin may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events.

- **Methods and results**: This study was conducted using data from the ISACS‐COVID‐19 (International Survey of Acute Coronavirus Syndromes‐COVID‐19) registry. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were eligible for inclusion. The study included 793 patients exposed to azithromycin within 24 hours from hospital admission and 2141 patients who received only standard care. The primary exposure was cardiovascular disease (CVD). Main outcome measures were 30‐day mortality and acute heart failure (AHF). Among 2934 patients, 1066 (36.4%) had preexisting CVD. A total of 617 (21.0%) died, and 253 (8.6%) had AHF. Azithromycin therapy was consistently associated with an increased risk of AHF in patients with preexisting CVD (risk ratio [RR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.06–2.06]). Receiving azithromycin versus standard care was not significantly associated with death (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.69–1.28]). By contrast, we found significantly reduced odds of death (RR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.79]) and no significant increase in AHF (RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.75–2.04]) in patients without prior CVD. The relative risks of death from the two subgroups were significantly different from each other (P interaction = 0.01). A statistically significant association was observed between AHF and death (odds ratio, 2.28 [95% CI, 1.34–3.90]).

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: Bedtime dosing or daytime dosing [^112zjTrp]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Hypertension management strategies have evolved from solely controlling office blood pressure (BP) to comprehensive 24-hour BP regulation. This review synthesizes evidence on the timing of antihypertensive medication, focusing on circadian BP rhythms and patients with specific BP patterns or comorbidities. Bedtime dosing may benefit individuals with nocturnal hypertension and nondipper BP patterns, but large trials, such as the TIME study, have shown no significant cardiovascular outcome differences between morning and bedtime dosing. However, the optimal timing of antihypertensive medication for patients with distinct BP rhythms or comorbidities remains uncertain. Future research should investigate the potential benefits of personalized medication timing tailored to BP patterns and clinical conditions. Additionally, treatment strategies should consider BP rhythms, comorbidities, and adherence to optimize outcomes, paving the way for more effective management of hypertensive patients with complex clinical profiles.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: Bedtime dosing or daytime dosing [^115Xgjc7]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a significant contributor to secondary hypertension, is intricately linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) through its association with disrupted nocturnal blood pressure (BP) patterns, often characterized by a nondipper pattern in patients with OSA. Nocturnal hypoxia-induced micro-arousals and heightened sympathetic activity contribute to these abnormal BP patterns. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), the gold standard for treating hypertension in OSA patients, does demonstrate BP-lowering benefits; however, its long-term compliance remains low, and its antihypertensive impact is relatively limited. As a result, the timing of antihypertensive medication in OSA patients has recently garnered research interest.

Kasiakogias et al.'s findings suggest that in hypertensive individuals with newly diagnosed moderate or severe OSA, bedtime dosing outperforms morning dosing in controlling office systolic blood pressure (SBP), nocturnal SBP, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Additionally, nighttime dosing was more beneficial in restoring normal BP rhythms. This simple adjustment to medication timing could benefit patients who struggle with CPAP adherence. However, Serinel et al.'s study, which has higher evidence strength, reported no significant nocturnal BP reduction from evening perindopril administration compared to morning dosing in patients with class III hypertension and moderate to severe OSA. Instead, they observed that morning dosing led to a greater daytime BP reduction than nighttime dosing. In light of the lack of high-quality, relevant studies and the preliminary nature of the findings from both studies, further research is needed.

### Biaxin [^113PEpWe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

After a 250 mg tablet every 12 hours, approximately 20% of the dose is excreted in the urine as clarithromycin, while following a 500 mg tablet every 12 hours, the urinary excretion of clarithromycin is somewhat greater, approximately 30%. In comparison, after an oral dose of 250 mg (125 mg/5 mL) suspension every 12 hours, approximately 40% is excreted in urine as clarithromycin. The renal clearance of clarithromycin is, however, relatively independent of the dose size and approximates the normal glomerular filtration rate. The major metabolite found in urine is 14-OH clarithromycin, which accounts for an additional 10% to 15% of the dose with either a 250 mg or a 500 mg tablet administered every 12 hours.

Steady-state concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin observed following administration of 500 mg doses of clarithromycin every 12 hours to adult patients with HIV infection were similar to those observed in healthy volunteers. In adult HIV-infected patients taking 500- or 1000-mg doses of clarithromycin every 12 hours, steady-state clarithromycin Cmax values ranged from 2 to 4 µg/mL and 5 to 10 µg/mL, respectively.

The steady-state concentrations of clarithromycin in subjects with impaired hepatic function did not differ from those in normal subjects; however, the 14-OH clarithromycin concentrations were lower in the hepatically impaired subjects. The decreased formation of 14-OH clarithromycin was at least partially offset by an increase in renal clearance of clarithromycin in the subjects with impaired hepatic function when compared to healthy subjects.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: Bedtime dosing or daytime dosing [^115e5Abf]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Excessive morning increases in blood pressure (BP) can result in morning hypertension, a condition frequently associated with both persistent nocturnal hypertension and nocturnal hypotension. A study by Jaewon Oh et al. involving 1070 patients with cardiovascular risk factors revealed that 34.9% of morning hypertension cases were linked to nocturnal hypertension following ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Furthermore, this issue disproportionately affects Asian hypertensive populations. Given the heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with morning hypertension, it has garnered significant attention. The HOPE Asia Network's 2022 consensus emphasizes the importance of managing morning hypertension to a target of below 135/85 mmHg, regardless of office-based readings.

Consequently, for patients experiencing a morning surge in BP due to nocturnal hypotension, it is advisable to take long-acting antihypertensive medications in the morning. This timing can also mitigate the premorning dose increase in BP. In patients with morning hypertension resulting from nocturnal hypertension, theoretically, adding antihypertensive medication at bedtime or administering it then could be a viable option if morning dosing of long-acting antihypertensive drugs is not effective. Moreover, bedtime administration of antihypertensive medication appears to be more suitable for individuals with isolated nocturnal hypertension (INH) and morning hypertension.

### Biaxin [^111cQpFP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Clarithromycin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of 250 mg clarithromycin tablets is approximately 50%. For a single 500 mg dose, food slightly delays the onset of absorption, increasing the peak time from approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. Food also increases the clarithromycin peak plasma concentration by about 24%, but does not affect the extent of bioavailability. Additionally, food does not affect the onset of formation of the antimicrobially active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin, or its peak plasma concentration, but it does slightly decrease the extent of metabolite formation, indicated by an 11% decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Therefore, Biaxin tablets may be given without regard to food.

In nonfasting healthy human subjects (males and females), peak plasma concentrations were attained within 2 to 3 hours after oral dosing. Steady-state peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations were reached within 3 days and were approximately 1 to 2 µg/mL with a 250 mg dose administered every 12 hours and 3 to 4 µg/mL with a 500 mg dose administered every 8 to 12 hours. The elimination half-life of clarithromycin was about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 hours, but it increased to 5 to 7 hours with 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 hours. The nonlinearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended doses of 250 mg and 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 hours.

### High-dose versus low-dose clarithromycin in 1-week triple therapy, including rabeprazole and levofloxacin, for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^111JRdEB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

To compare high-dose versus low-dose clarithromycin in 1-week triple therapy, including rabeprazole and levofloxacin, regimens containing rabeprazole and levofloxacin have proved to be effective against H. pylori infection.

One hundred H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned to one of the following 1-week regimens: rabeprazole 20 mg o.d. plus levofloxacin 500 mg o.d. and clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (RLC-1 group); rabeprazole 20 mg o.d. plus levofloxacin 500 mg o.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. (RLC-2 group). H. pylori status was assessed at entry and after the treatment. Patients who experienced treatment failure underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing.

- **Results**: Forty-two patients in the RLC-1 group (both PP and ITT analysis: 84%; 95% CI: 71–93%) and 47 in the RLC-2 group (both PP and ITT analysis: 94%; 95% CI: 83–98%) became H. pylori negative. Clarithromycin resistance was detected in all of the 8 (100%) RLC-1 failures and in 1 out of 3 (33%) RLC-2 failures. Side effects occurred in 8% of patients in the RLC-1 group and in 12% in the RLC-2 group.

- **Conclusions**: The regimens tested are competitive with other PPI-based treatments. The 1-week triple therapy containing rabeprazole, levofloxacin, and high-dose clarithromycin yielded a higher eradication rate than the one containing low-dose clarithromycin and may be considered a first-line therapy option.

### Comparison of different therapeutic strategies in hypertension: a low-dose combination of perindopril/indapamide versus a sequential monotherapy or a stepped-care approach [^114kgV6L]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of three different strategies in the treatment of hypertension: low-dose combination, sequential monotherapy, and stepped-care.

- **Design**: Hypertensive patients were randomized to a 9-month treatment with the aim of lowering blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. Treatment adjustments were allowed at months 3 and 6. The study was discontinued for patients with normal blood pressure at month 6. In the 'low-dose combination' group, perindopril (2 mg) and indapamide (0.625 mg) were first administered, with the possibility to increase the doses in two steps to 4 mg and 1.25 mg respectively. In the 'sequential monotherapy' group, treatment was initiated with atenolol (50 mg), replaced if necessary by losartan (50 mg), and then by amlodipine (5 mg). In the 'stepped-care' group, valsartan was given first at a 40 mg dose, then at an 80 mg dose, to be co-administered finally if needed with hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg). All study tablets were encapsulated to conceal their identity and were taken once a day.

- **Patients**: Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were recruited (n = 180 in the 'low-dose combination' group, n = 176 in the 'sequential monotherapy' group, and n = 177 in the 'stepped-care' group).

- **Results**: The percentage of patients achieving the target blood pressure was significantly greater in the 'low-dose combination' group (62%) compared to the 'sequential monotherapy' (49%, P = 0.02) and the 'stepped-care' group (47%, P = 0.005). The percentage of patients who normalized their blood pressure without further adjustment was not reported in the excerpt.

### Adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics versus placebo for any indication [^112uETRA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment-specific rather than disease-specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across various diseases.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and of previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics.

### Cardio-rheumatology insights into hypertension: Intersection of inflammation, arteries, and heart [^116tpvNa]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

The effect of medications used for the treatment of underlying inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) must be considered when assessing hypertension. All nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both nonselective and selective, at doses required to control inflammation, can increase blood pressure, though the effect on blood pressure is variable. NSAIDs can also diminish the efficacy of many antihypertensive medications, with the exception of calcium channel blockers (CCBs).

There has been ongoing interest in identifying which NSAIDs have the best safety profile concerning hypertension and cardiovascular outcomes, but this remains uncertain. A meta-analysis of randomized trials studying the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure found that, when pooled, NSAIDs elevated mean blood pressure by 5.0 mmHg (95% CI, 1.2–8.7 mmHg). Additionally, long-term NSAID use may also have a negative impact on kidney function, further contributing to hypertension. Therefore, using the smallest dose required for the shortest duration possible, with careful monitoring of blood pressure, is recommended with all NSAIDs.

There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on blood pressure in patients with IRD. Long-term use (greater than six months) and moderate-to-high doses (prednisone > 7.5 mg daily) have been associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension in rheumatoid arthritis, independently of other risk factors. The disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) leflunomide has been reported to induce hypertension in 2–5% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, thought to be related to an increase in autonomic sympathetic tone, displacement of the free fraction of any concomitant NSAID from protein binding, and increasing salt and water retention. Cyclosporine can also induce hypertension.

### Use of clarithromycin and roxithromycin and risk of cardiac death: Cohort study [^113FUEje]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Acute cardiac toxicity is an increasingly recognized potential adverse effect of antimicrobial drug treatment. Several agents of the macrolide class of antibiotics are known to interfere with the delayed rectifier potassium current (I Kr), resulting in the accumulation of potassium ions in cardiac myocytes and thereby delaying cardiac repolarization. Evident on the common electrocardiogram as a prolongation of the QT interval, this mechanism is thought to underlie an increase in the risk of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia, with macrolides.

Although numerous case reports and spontaneous reports support this notion, evidence from controlled studies to confirm and quantify a potential increase in serious cardiac event risk is limited. Two cohort studies of U.S. Medicaid beneficiaries have found increased risks of sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular death associated with erythromycin and azithromycin, respectively. Both studies reported increases in risk during periods of use of these antibiotics, supporting an acute mechanism. Whereas these studies were performed in cohorts at relatively high baseline cardiovascular risk, a recent population-based cohort study of young and middle-aged adults at low baseline risk did not find a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death associated with azithromycin. The cardiovascular risks associated with exposure to macrolides other than erythromycin and azithromycin are largely unknown, although a small Dutch case-control study pointed towards the possibility of an association between sudden cardiac death and other macrolides.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure lead to a critically important clinical question: what class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives include quantifying the blood pressure-lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, compared to placebo or no treatment.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one-year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

### Evaluation of recent fixed-dose combination therapies in the management of hypertension [^115CKgwF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Control of hypertension remains sub-optimal, with only half of patients achieving adequate control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommend the initial use of two antihypertensive agents in patients with stage 2 hypertension. This review discusses the drug combinations that have additive effects and those that do not provide additional benefit while increasing adverse events.

Results from late-breaking trials have shown that combinations of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are superior to a diuretic with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for reducing cardiovascular events. Additionally, in patients with vascular disease with relatively 'controlled' blood pressure at baseline, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker did not reduce cardiovascular endpoints compared with either monotherapy and modestly increased the incidence of adverse effects.

Combination therapy of antihypertensive agents (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretics, and angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretics) as initial therapy in stage 2 hypertension can lead to markedly improved blood pressure control in patients compared with monotherapeutic regimens.

### Azithromycin [^115LT7pR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Mechanism of action**: Azithromycin exhibits antibacterial activity. Based on animal models of infection, this activity appears to correlate with the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens, including S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial involving 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1,000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. Compared to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms, and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

Since the mean Cmax of azithromycin following a 500 mg IV dose given over 1 hour is higher than the mean Cmax of azithromycin following the administration of a 1,500 mg oral dose, it is possible that the QTc interval may be prolonged to a greater extent with IV azithromycin at close proximity to a one-hour infusion of 500 mg.

### Single-dose azithromycin microspheres vs clarithromycin extended release for the treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^113pypZX]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The inability or failure of many subjects to adhere to standard antibiotic regimens, which may last up to 10 days, results in suboptimal antibiotic treatment. Treatment with a single-dose antibiotic regimen may improve compliance with prescribed therapy. A novel microsphere formulation of azithromycin provides a single-dose regimen while maintaining tolerability.

- **Study objective**: To compare the efficacy and safety of a single 2.0-g dose of azithromycin microspheres to that of an extended-release formulation of clarithromycin (1.0 g/d for 7 days) for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate CAP.

- **Design**: A phase III, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, comparing single-dose azithromycin microspheres to extended-release clarithromycin, both administered orally.

- **Methods**: Subjects with mild-to-moderate CAP (Fine class I and II) were included. The primary endpoint was clinical response at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (days 14 to 21) in the clinical per protocol (CPP) population. The bacteriologic response at the TOC visit was assessed in subjects with a baseline pathogen.

- **Results**: A total of 501 subjects were randomized, and 499 were treated. Clinical cure rates at the TOC visit in the CPP population were 92.6% (187 of 202 subjects) for azithromycin microspheres and 94.7% (198 of 209 subjects) for extended-release clarithromycin. Overall pathogen eradication rates were 91.8% (123 of 134 subjects) for azithromycin microspheres and 90.

### Orkambi [^113dV76n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Antibiotics**: Concomitant use of Orkambi may decrease the exposure of clarithromycin, erythromycin, and telithromycin, which could reduce the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Consider alternatives such as ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and levofloxacin.

- **Antifungals**: Concomitant use of Orkambi may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. This combination is not recommended. Monitor patients closely for breakthrough fungal infections if these drugs are necessary, and consider alternatives like fluconazole.

- **Anti-inflammatories**: Concomitant use of Orkambi may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of ibuprofen. A higher dose may be required to achieve the desired clinical effect.

- **Antidepressants**: Concomitant use of Orkambi may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline. A higher dose of these antidepressants may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect.

- **Hormonal contraceptives**: Orkambi may decrease hormonal contraceptive exposure, reducing their effectiveness. Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable forms, should not be relied upon as effective contraception when co-administered with Orkambi. Concomitant use may increase menstrual abnormality events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Avoid such use unless the benefit outweighs the risks.

- **Oral hypoglycemics**: Concomitant use of Orkambi may require adjustments in treatment strategy.

### Cleviprex [^1176o4WF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Cleviprex is intended for intravenous use. Titrate the drug to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction, individualizing the dosage depending on the target blood pressure and the patient's response.

- **Initial dose**: Initiate the intravenous infusion of Cleviprex at 1–2 mg/hour.

- **Dose titration**: The dose may be doubled at short (90-second) intervals initially. As the blood pressure approaches the goal, the increases in doses should be less than doubling, and the time between dose adjustments should be lengthened to every 5–10 minutes. An approximately 1–2 mg/hour increase will generally produce an additional 2–4 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure.

- **Maintenance dose**: The desired therapeutic response for most patients occurs at doses of 4–6 mg/hour. Patients with severe hypertension may require doses up to 32 mg/hour, although there is limited experience at this dose rate.

- **Maximum dose**: Most patients were treated with maximum doses of 16 mg/hour or less. There is limited short-term experience with doses up to 32 mg/hour. Due to lipid load restrictions, no more than 1000 mL or an average of 21 mg/hour of Cleviprex infusion is recommended per 24-hour period. In clinical trials, 55 hypertensive patients were treated with more than 500 mL of Cleviprex infusion per 24-hour period. There is little experience with infusion durations beyond 72 hours at any dose.

- **Transition to an oral antihypertensive agent**: Discontinue Cleviprex or titrate downward while appropriate oral therapy is established. When instituting an oral antihypertensive agent, consider the lag time.

### Macrolide myths [^111Pn4sE]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

In spite of decades of research, our knowledge of the mode of interaction of macrolide antibiotics with their ribosomal target and the mechanism of action of these drugs remains fragmentary. Experimental facts obtained over the past several years question some of the concepts that were viewed as 'common knowledge'. This review focuses on certain aspects of the binding and action of macrolides that may need re-evaluation in view of the new findings.

### Calcium-channel blocker-clarithromycin drug interactions and acute kidney injury [^115yEMki]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Calcium-channel blockers are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4; EC 1.14.13.97) enzyme. Blood concentrations of these drugs may rise to harmful levels when CYP3A4 activity is inhibited. Clarithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and azithromycin is not, making comparisons between these two macrolide antibiotics useful in assessing clinically important drug interactions.

- **Objective**: To characterize the risk of acute adverse events following coprescription of clarithromycin compared with azithromycin in older adults taking a calcium-channel blocker.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study was a population-based retrospective cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada, from 2003 through 2012. It involved older adults (mean age 76 years) who were newly coprescribed clarithromycin (n = 96,226) or azithromycin (n = 94,083) while taking a calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was hospitalization with acute kidney injury. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization with hypotension and all-cause mortality, which were examined separately. Outcomes were assessed within 30 days of a new coprescription.

- **Results**: There were no differences in measured baseline characteristics between the clarithromycin and azithromycin groups. Amlodipine was the most commonly prescribed calcium-channel blocker, with more than 50% of patients using it. Coprescription of clarithromycin vs. azithromycin with a calcium-channel blocker was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization with acute kidney injury (420 patients of 96,226 taking clarithromycin).

### Biaxin [^111C6BAJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

When 250 mg doses of clarithromycin as BIAXIN suspension were administered to fasting healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations were attained around 3 hours after dosing. Steady-state peak plasma concentrations were reached in 2 to 3 days and were approximately 2 µg/mL for clarithromycin and 0.7 µg/mL for 14-OH clarithromycin when 250-mg doses of the clarithromycin suspension were administered every 12 hours. The elimination half-life of clarithromycin (3 to 4 hours) and that of 14-OH clarithromycin (5 to 7 hours) were similar to those observed at steady state following the administration of equivalent doses of BIAXIN tablets.

For adult patients, the bioavailability of 10 mL of the 125 mg/5 mL suspension or 10 mL of the 250 mg/5 mL suspension is similar to a 250 mg or 500 mg tablet, respectively.

In children requiring antibiotic therapy, the administration of 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours doses of clarithromycin as the suspension generally resulted in steady-state peak plasma concentrations of 3 to 7 µg/mL for clarithromycin and 1 to 2 µg/mL for 14-OH clarithromycin.

In HIV-infected children taking 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, steady-state clarithromycin peak concentrations generally ranged from 6 to 15 µg/mL.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: An update [^116MU46H]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

The exploration of combination therapy for hypertension has been ongoing, addressing the complex mechanisms of blood pressure regulation and the need for tailored treatment strategies. Various classes of antihypertensive agents work synergistically to provide improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects. This detailed update delves into recent advancements in combination therapies, which have demonstrated significant potential in achieving better patient outcomes. It is crucial to evaluate the compatibility and pharmacokinetics of the combined medications to optimize treatment efficacy and patient safety.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: Bedtime dosing or daytime dosing [^116swb4o]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

In light of the ongoing debate surrounding the bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications and concerns regarding nocturnal BP dips, the World Hypertension League and the European Society of Hypertension suggested in their 2022 consensus statement that routine bedtime dosing should not be advocated, advocating instead for monotherapy with long-acting agents or morning-dosed combinations. The TIME study later contradicted this by reporting no increased fracture risk in the bedtime dosing group. In fact, participants in the bedtime group displayed a slightly lower fall risk (P = 0.048) and fewer symptomatic adverse events compared to the morning group. Similar findings emerged from the MAPEC and the Hygia Chronotherapy trial, indicating no heightened side effects from bedtime dosing compared to morning dosing. Liu et al. and Serinel et al. further indicated that when employing long-acting antihypertensives, nocturnal BP reductions were comparable between morning and bedtime dosing. Therefore, for hypertensive patients using long-acting medications, there seems to be no discernible difference in either safety or efficacy between morning and bedtime dosing. The decision on the optimal timing should be personalized, considering each patient's preference for the most compliant time of day, as enhancing adherence to treatment appears to be the key to effective therapy.

Beyond the complex interplay of intrinsic neuroendocrine systems, research has elucidated that individual behavioral traits, particularly activity level, an…

### Biaxin [^114n6Vgx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Clarithromycin use in patients receiving theophylline may be associated with an increase in serum theophylline concentrations. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations should be considered for patients receiving high doses of theophylline or with baseline concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. In two studies, in which theophylline was administered with clarithromycin (a theophylline sustained-release formulation was dosed at either 6.5 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg together with 250 or 500 mg q12h clarithromycin), the steady-state levels of Cmax, Cmin, and the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of theophylline increased by about 20%.

	- Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving verapamil, which belongs to the calcium channel blockers drug class.

	- Concomitant administration of single doses of clarithromycin and carbamazepine has been shown to result in increased plasma concentrations of carbamazepine. Blood level monitoring of carbamazepine may be considered.

	- When clarithromycin and terfenadine were co-administered, plasma concentrations of the active acid metabolite of terfenadine were threefold higher, on average, than the values observed when terfenadine was administered alone. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin were not significantly affected by co-administration of terfenadine once clarithromycin reached steady-state conditions. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with terfenadine is contraindicated.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1125mY9c]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly concerning long-term macrolides, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend considering add-on azithromycin (3 times per week for at least 6 months) after specialist referral. This is applicable for adult patients with persistent symptomatic asthma despite high-dose ICSs-LABAs. It is advised to assess sputum for atypical mycobacteria and obtain an ECG to evaluate long QTc before initiation, with reassessment following a month of treatment, while considering the risk of increasing antimicrobial resistance.
