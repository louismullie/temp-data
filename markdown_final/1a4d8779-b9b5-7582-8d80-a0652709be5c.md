## Question

Thyroid cancer

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about thyroid cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and histologic subtypes to frame the disease burden. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including ultrasound risk stratification, fine-needle aspiration, and molecular testing. Next, I will examine initial management by subtype, with emphasis on differentiated thyroid cancer and the evolving roles of surgery, radioactive iodine, and active surveillance. After that, I need to review advanced disease therapies, including targeted agents and immunotherapy, and consider special populations. Finally, I should confirm long-term surveillance, survivorship, and guideline evolution, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and classification so I don't jump to conclusions. Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy globally, with rising incidence largely driven by detection of small papillary carcinomas, while mortality remains relatively stable, suggesting overdiagnosis contributes substantially to the trend [^55c7c099] [^f44eb481]. Differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular) accounts for over 90% of cases, medullary thyroid cancer for about 3–5%, and anaplastic thyroid cancer for less than 2% but carries disproportionate mortality [^c948e8ce] [^1911c492].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic framework before discussing treatment. Modern care relies on ultrasound-based risk stratification systems (e.g. ATA, ACR TI-RADS) to guide whether nodules warrant fine-needle aspiration, which reduces unnecessary biopsies while maintaining sensitivity for clinically significant disease [^f44eb481]. Molecular testing, particularly BRAF V600E and RAS mutations, refines malignancy risk and informs prognosis and targeted therapy selection, and is increasingly integrated into decision-making for indeterminate cytology and advanced disease [^aaf6f7c1] [^d46e7e9a].

> I will now examine differentiated thyroid cancer management, starting with surgery, because this anchors initial therapy. Historically, total thyroidectomy was routine, but contemporary guidelines endorse risk-adapted surgery: lobectomy is appropriate for low-risk, unifocal tumors 1–4 cm without extrathyroidal extension or nodal disease, whereas total thyroidectomy is preferred for high-risk features, bilateral disease, or when radioactive iodine is planned or likely needed [^4c5d65c3] [^d0d1d7d2]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: this shift reduces overtreatment and complications without compromising oncologic outcomes in appropriately selected patients [^d0d1d7d2].

> Next, I should review radioactive iodine use, since this is where practice has changed most. RAI is no longer routine for all patients; instead, it is reserved for intermediate- and high-risk disease or for specific indications such as remnant ablation to facilitate surveillance or treatment of known residual disease, with low-risk patients generally spared given lack of survival benefit and potential harms [^de9eeb2f] [^60e77b96]. Let me double-check dosing: low-activity ablation (about 30 mCi) is favored when RAI is used, with rhTSH often preferred over thyroid hormone withdrawal to mitigate hypothyroid symptoms and quality-of-life impairment [^cb36d1b1] [^baf85bcd].

> But wait, what if the tumor is very small and indolent? Active surveillance has emerged as a reasonable alternative for papillary microcarcinomas, typically less than 1 cm, with low-risk features and no evidence of progression on serial ultrasound, aligning with efforts to reduce overtreatment and its sequelae [^25c6e6ce] [^d0d1d7d2]. I should confirm that this approach requires careful selection and shared decision-making given patient preferences and the possibility of later surgery if progression occurs [^d0d1d7d2].

> I need to ensure I address advanced and radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. For progressive, symptomatic, or immediately threatening disease not amenable to surgery or RAI, multikinase inhibitors such as sorafenib and lenvatinib improve progression-free survival, though responses are modest and toxicity is substantial, necessitating judicious patient selection and dose management [^ee78fae8] [^a32d67b1]. Hold on, I should verify timing: many experts favor initiating TKIs when disease is symptomatic or rapidly progressive, balancing oncologic benefit against quality-of-life trade-offs [^ee78fae8].

> Let me consider anaplastic thyroid cancer separately, because the paradigm differs markedly. Historically, ATC carried median survival around 3–6 months, but recent approvals of BRAF/MEK inhibition (dabrafenib/trametinib) for BRAF V600E–mutated ATC have improved outcomes, and modern guidelines emphasize rapid molecular profiling, aggressive multimodal therapy when feasible, and enrollment in clinical trials [^023ee169] [^0c61252e]. I should confirm that immunotherapy, including PD-1 inhibitors, is under active investigation and may be considered in select patients, though evidence remains limited and toxicity must be weighed carefully [^7ffa79d5].

> For medullary thyroid cancer, I should confirm that surgery is the mainstay and that systemic therapy is reserved for advanced disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib are FDA-approved for progressive or symptomatic MTC, providing meaningful disease control albeit with notable adverse effects, and genetic counseling is essential given hereditary forms and RET-driven pathobiology [^05bccd3e]. Let me reconsider whether RAI is ever used in MTC; it is not, because MTC does not concentrate iodine, reinforcing the distinction from differentiated disease [^05bccd3e].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, total thyroidectomy with selective RAI is standard, with heightened sensitivity to late effects and a lower threshold for referral to pediatric-experienced centers; molecular alterations and targeted therapies are increasingly relevant in refractory cases [^27adb6d6] [^9d9728ec]. In pregnancy, surgery is generally deferred unless there are high-risk features, with levothyroxine optimization prioritized; active surveillance is reasonable for small, low-risk papillary cancers diagnosed during gestation [^d809ed68]. For elderly or comorbid patients, I need to ensure treatment intensity is individualized, often favoring less aggressive surgery and sparing RAI when risks outweigh benefits [^56df0fb0].

> I will now examine long-term surveillance and survivorship, because this shapes quality of life. Dynamic risk stratification using thyroglobulin, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, and ultrasound guides follow-up intensity; patients with an excellent response undergo de-escalated surveillance, whereas those with biochemical or structural incomplete responses require closer monitoring and consideration of additional therapy [^a9b80dd5] [^a57662e0]. Hold on, I should verify TSH suppression goals: long-term suppression is not recommended for low- or intermediate-risk patients without evidence of disease, given cardiovascular and skeletal risks, and suppression should be reassessed over time [^faa6dc70].

> Let me think about guideline evolution and controversies so I don't overstate consensus. The 2025 ATA guidelines operationalize the DATA framework (Diagnosis, Assessment, Treatment, Assessment) to individualize care, expand molecular testing, and further de-emphasize routine RAI and total thyroidectomy in low-risk disease, reflecting ongoing efforts to reduce overtreatment without compromising outcomes [^d0d1d7d2] [^27955801]. However, I should acknowledge persisting debates, including the optimal extent of surgery for 1–4 cm tumors and the role of RAI in intermediate-risk patients, with European perspectives often favoring more liberal RAI use than North American guidelines [^baf85bcd].

> Finally, I should synthesize the current standard of care succinctly. For differentiated thyroid cancer, risk-adapted surgery with selective use of RAI, TSH suppression tailored to risk and response, and structured surveillance with dynamic risk stratification constitute best practice, with active surveillance for appropriately selected microcarcinomas and targeted therapy for radioiodine-refractory disease [^d0d1d7d2] [^a9b80dd5]. For anaplastic thyroid cancer, rapid molecular profiling and aggressive multimodal therapy including BRAF/MEK inhibition when applicable, clinical trials, and palliative care integration are essential [^023ee169]. For medullary thyroid cancer, surgery remains curative in early disease, with vandetanib or cabozantinib for advanced cases and attention to hereditary syndromes [^c948e8ce]. Throughout, shared decision-making, multidisciplinary care, and attention to patient-reported outcomes and financial toxicity are critical to delivering high-quality, equitable thyroid cancer care [^7f9d0708] [^f9d3bb87].

Thyroid cancer is the **most common endocrine malignancy** [^c948e8ce], with rising incidence due to improved detection of small papillary tumors [^f44eb481]. Most cases are **differentiated (papillary/follicular)** and have excellent 5-year survival (> 98%) [^notfound]; however, anaplastic thyroid cancer remains aggressive with poor outcomes [^1911c492]. Management is **risk-adapted**: surgery is first-line [^7259e86a], with radioactive iodine for intermediate/high-risk disease [^08758c62] and targeted therapy (e.g. lenvatinib, sorafenib) for radioiodine-refractory or advanced disease [^ee78fae8]. Active surveillance is appropriate for select low-risk papillary microcarcinomas [^25c6e6ce] [^d0d1d7d2]. Prognosis depends on age, histology, size, and stage; recurrence risk guides long-term follow-up with thyroglobulin and ultrasound [^a57662e0].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Incidence is increasing globally, largely due to detection of small papillary tumors [^f44eb481]; mortality remains stable, indicating overdiagnosis [^notfound]. Risk factors include **female sex, age 20–55, radiation exposure, family history, and genetic syndromes** (e.g. RET, BRAF, RAS) [^aaf6f7c1].

---

## Histological classification

| **Category** | **Subtype** | **Characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Differentiated | Papillary | - Indolent <br/> - Excellent prognosis <br/> - Lymphatic spread [^c948e8ce] |
| Differentiated | Follicular | - Hematogenous spread <br/> - Moderate prognosis [^7259e86a] |
| Poorly differentiated | Insular | - Aggressive <br/> - Poor prognosis [^notfound] |
| Undifferentiated | Anaplastic | - Highly aggressive <br/> - Median survival ~6 months [^notfound] |
| Neuroendocrine | Medullary | - C-cell origin <br/> - RET-driven <br/> - Intermediate prognosis [^7259e86a] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include a **painless thyroid nodule**, cervical lymphadenopathy, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea. Most patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Ultrasound**: Risk stratification (TI-RADS, ATA) guides biopsy [^f44eb481].
- **Fine-needle aspiration**: Gold standard for cytology; Bethesda system classifies malignancy risk [^notfound].
- **Molecular testing**: BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC, PAX8/PPARγ refine diagnosis and guide therapy [^aaf6f7c1].
- **Imaging**: CT/MRI for local invasion; PET for aggressive or metastatic disease [^063901e1].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)

- **Surgery**: Lobectomy for low-risk; total thyroidectomy for intermediate/high-risk or bilateral disease [^4c5d65c3].
- **Radioactive iodine**: Adjuvant therapy for intermediate/high-risk disease; remnant ablation facilitates surveillance [^08758c62] [^de9eeb2f].
- **TSH suppression**: Individualized based on risk and response [^8b7deffe].
- **Active surveillance**: For papillary microcarcinomas (< 1 cm, low-risk) [^25c6e6ce].

---

### Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)

Total thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection is standard; **targeted therapy** with vandetanib or cabozantinib is used for advanced disease [^notfound].

---

### Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC)

Multimodality therapy includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy; **targeted therapy** with BRAF/MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib/trametinib) improves outcomes in BRAF-mutated ATC [^0c61252e].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is excellent for DTC (> 98% 5-year survival) [^notfound] but poorer for MTC and ATC. Recurrence risk is stratified by **initial risk, response to therapy, and molecular features**; long-term surveillance uses thyroglobulin, ultrasound, and selective imaging [^a57662e0].

---

## Follow-up and survivorship

Follow-up emphasizes **personalized surveillance** with dynamic risk stratification, patient-reported outcomes, and attention to long-term toxicities (hypothyroidism, salivary dysfunction, second malignancies) [^a9b80dd5] [^3807d99c]. Financial toxicity and quality-of-life impairments are common and require supportive care [^f9d3bb87] [^3807d99c].

---

Thyroid cancer is **highly curable** when detected early and managed with risk-adapted therapy; ongoing advances in molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies continue to improve outcomes and reduce overtreatment [^f44eb481].

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^87ed32c9]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most prevalent cancer of thyroid and is among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States. The practice guidelines of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) for DTC management in adult patients (previously combined with thyroid nodules) were published initially in 1996, with subsequent revisions based on advances in the field. The goal of this update is to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, and those involved in health policy with rigorous, comprehensive, and contemporary guidelines to assist in the management of adult patients with DTC, emphasizing the patient journey beginning with a thyroid cancer diagnosis. Methods: The questions addressed were based, in part, on prior versions of the guidelines, with input from a larger, more diverse complement of stakeholders. The panel included members from multiple specialties involved in thyroid cancer care, including a patient advocate and an expert in systematic reviews/meta-analyses/guidelines who educated and supported task force members. The panel conducted systematic literature reviews to inform the recommendations and commissioned two additional systematic reviews. Published English-language articles were eligible for inclusion, with a final search date of July 1, 2024. A modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used for critical appraisal of evidence and determining the quality of data. The guidelines panel had editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of task force members were pre-vetted, regularly updated, communicated with task force members, and assessed and managed by ATA leadership and the Clinical Practice Guidelines and Statements Committee. Results: These revised guidelines begin with the initial cancer diagnosis and continue with recommendations for staging and risk assessment, initial treatment decisions, assessment of treatment responses, monitoring approaches, diagnostic testing, and subsequent therapies based on the strength of evidence for response and consideration of side effects and outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes and identified areas of need for additional high-quality research are highlighted. Conclusions: These revised evidence-based recommendations inform clinical decision-making in the management of DTC that reflect the changing science and optimize the evidence-based clinical care of patients throughout their journey with DTC. Critical areas of need for additional research are highlighted.

### New therapeutic advances in the management of progressive thyroid cancer [^fadfe415]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The spectrum of thyroid cancers ranges from one of the most indolent to one of the most aggressive solid tumors identified. Conventional therapies for thyroid cancers are based on the histologic type of thyroid cancers such as papillary or follicular thyroid cancer (differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), or anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). While surgery is one of the key treatments for all such types of thyroid cancers, additional therapies vary. Effective targeted therapy for DTC is a decades-old practice with systemic therapies of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression and radioactive iodine therapy. However, for the iodine-refractory DTC, MTC, and ATC there is no effective systemic standard of care treatment. Recent advances in understanding pathogenesis of DTC and development of molecular targeted therapy have dramatically transformed the field of clinical research in thyroid cancer. Over the last five years, incredible progress has been made and phases I-III clinical trials have been conducted in various types of thyroid cancers with some remarkable results that has made an impact on lives of patients with thyroid cancer. Such history-making events have boosted enthusiasm and interest among researchers, clinicians, patients, and sponsors and we anticipate ongoing efforts to develop more effective and safe therapies for thyroid cancer.

### Thyroid cancer [^c948e8ce]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women in the USA, and an estimated over 62000 new cases occurred in men and women in 2015. The incidence continues to rise worldwide. Differentiated thyroid cancer is the most frequent subtype of thyroid cancer and in most patients the standard treatment (surgery followed by either radioactive iodine or observation) is effective. Patients with other, more rare subtypes of thyroid cancer-medullary and anaplastic-are ideally treated by physicians with experience managing these malignancies. Targeted treatments that are approved for differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers have prolonged progression-free survival, but these drugs are not curative and therefore are reserved for patients with progressive or symptomatic disease.

### Thyroid cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^7259e86a]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Well-differentiated tumors are highly treatable and usually curable. Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid tumors are less common, aggressive, metastasize early, and have a poorer prognosis. Medullary thyroid cancer is a neuroendocrine cancer that has an intermediate prognosis. A retrospective surgical series of 931 previously untreated patients with differentiated thyroid cancer found that age older than 45 years, follicular histology, primary tumor larger than 4 cm, extrathyroidal extension, and distant metastases were adverse prognostic factors. Favorable prognostic factors included female sex, multifocality, and regional lymph node involvement. However, other studies have shown that regional lymph node involvement had no effect or had an adverse effect on survival.

Follicular adenomas, which are characterized by their lack of invasion through the capsule into the surrounding thyroid tissue, must be distinguished from follicular thyroid carcinoma. While follicular cancer has a good prognosis, it is less favorable than that of papillary carcinoma. The 10-year survival is better for patients with follicular carcinoma without vascular invasion than it is for patients with vascular invasion. Treatment Options for Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Cancer Localized/regional papillary and follicular thyroid cancer Surgery is the therapy of choice for all primary lesions. Surgical options include total thyroidectomy or lobectomy. The choice of procedure is influenced mainly by the age of the patient and the size of the nodule. For patients with early-stage disease, survival rates are similar when comparing the two procedures; however, the rates of surgical complications and local recurrences are different.

Treatment options for localized/regional papillary and follicular thyroid cancer Treatment options for localized/regional papillary and follicular thyroid cancer include:

- Surgery.
- Radioactive iodine therapy.
- Thyroid-suppression therapy.
- External-beam radiation therapy. For patients undergoing RAI, removal of all normal thyroid tissue is an important surgical objective. Additionally, for accurate long-term surveillance, RAI whole-body scanning and measurement of serum thyroglobulin are affected by residual, normal thyroid tissue. In these situations, near total or total thyroidectomy is required. This approach facilitates follow-up thyroid scanning.

### Prospects and challenges of immunotherapy for thyroid cancer [^7ffa79d5]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid cancer generally boasts a favorable prognosis; however, advanced and refractory cases exhibit aggressive characteristics and resistance to conventional therapies, necessitating the investigation of innovative treatment modalities. Immunotherapy, which harnesses the body's immune system to target cancer cells, has shown considerable promise for specific thyroid cancer subtypes.

Objective

This review article aims to encapsulate the latest advancements in immunotherapy for thyroid cancer, examining its mechanisms, therapeutic efficacy, ongoing challenges, and the potential benefits of combination therapy approaches.

Methods

An extensive literature review and critical analysis of clinical trial data were conducted to inform this synthesis.

Results

The review reveals that immunotherapy strategies, encompassing immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapy, tumor vaccines, and immunomodulators, are demonstrating efficacy in the treatment of thyroid cancer. Notably, checkpoint inhibitors have been particularly effective in anaplastic and poorly differentiated thyroid cancers, albeit with challenges such as treatment resistance and adverse effects. The application of CAR-T cell therapy, successful in hematologic cancers, provides a novel perspective for thyroid cancer treatment, although its efficacy in solid tumors requires further study. Additionally, research into tumor vaccines and immunomodulators is advancing, with preliminary evidence suggesting their therapeutic potential for thyroid cancer patients.

Conclusion

The recognition of the immune microenvironment's role in treatment responsiveness is pivotal for enhancing the care of thyroid cancer patients. This review underscores the significance of combination therapy as a means to optimize treatment outcomes and charts a course for future research endeavors to broaden the spectrum of effective treatment options available to thyroid cancer patients.

### Thyroid cancer [^f44eb481]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The past 5–10 years have brought in a new era in the care of patients with thyroid cancer, with the introduction of transformative diagnostic and management options. Several international ultrasound-based thyroid nodule risk stratification systems have been developed with the goal of reducing unnecessary biopsies. Less invasive alternatives to surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer, such as active surveillance and minimally invasive interventions, are being explored. New systemic therapies are now available for patients with advanced thyroid cancer. However, in the setting of these advances, disparities exist in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer. As new management options are becoming available for thyroid cancer, it is essential to support population-based studies and randomised clinical trials that will inform evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of thyroid cancer, and to include diverse patient populations in research to better understand and subsequently address existing barriers to equitable thyroid cancer care.

### New horizons: emerging therapies and targets in thyroid cancer [^10655394]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of patients with progressive metastatic follicular cell-derived and medullary thyroid cancers that do not respond to standard therapeutic modalities presents a therapeutic challenge. As a deeper understanding of the molecular drivers for these tumors has occurred and more potent and specific compounds are developed, the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for thyroid cancer has expanded. In addition, with the advent of disease-agnostic target-directed FDA approvals an ever-broadening number of therapeutic options are available for clinicians and patients. However, to date, complete remissions are rare, the average durations of response are relatively modest, and toxicities are common. These factors accentuate the need for further understanding of the mechanisms of resistance that result in treatment failures, the development of biomarkers that can improve patient selection for treatment earlier in the disease process, and the continued need for new therapeutic strategies. In this article, recent approvals relevant to thyroid cancer will be discussed along with selected new potential avenues that might be exploited for future therapies.

### Medical therapy for advanced forms of thyroid cancer [^1fbcdaa8]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

More options than ever before are currently available for medical therapy in patients who present with advanced thyroid cancer or develop surgically unresectable recurrences or symptomatic or progressive disease. The newer medical therapies have addressed the need to find effective therapies beyond the conventional treatment with radioactive iodine, thyroid stimulating hormone suppression, and palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy for patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Although tumor responses to these medical therapies vary by type of thyroid cancer and type of therapy selected, they remain encouraging and provide therapeutic options for selected patients while new drugs are in development.

### Update: the status of clinical trials with kinase inhibitors in thyroid cancer [^95f2012f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid cancer is usually cured by timely thyroidectomy; however, the treatment of patients with advanced disease is challenging because their tumors are mostly unresponsive to conventional therapies. Recently, the malignancy has attracted much interest for two reasons: the dramatic increase in its incidence over the last three decades, and the discovery of the genetic mutations or chromosomal rearrangements causing most histological types of thyroid cancer.

Objective

This update reviews the molecular genetics of thyroid cancer and the clinical trials evaluating kinase inhibitors (KIs) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The update also reviews studies in other malignancies, which have identified mechanisms of efficacy, and also resistance, to specific KIs. This information has been critical both to the development of effective second-generation drugs and to the design of combinatorial therapeutic regimens. Finally, the update addresses the major challenges facing clinicians who seek to develop more effective therapy for patients with thyroid cancer.

Results

PubMed was searched from January 2000 to November 2013 using the following terms: thyroid cancer, treatment of thyroid cancer, clinical trials in thyroid cancer, small molecule therapeutics, kinase inhibitors, and next generation sequencing.

Conclusions

A new era in cancer therapy has emerged based on the introduction of KIs for the treatment of patients with liquid and solid organ malignancies. Patients with thyroid cancer have benefited from this advance and will continue to do so with the development of drugs having greater specificity and with the implementation of clinical trials of combined therapeutics to overcome drug resistance.

### Surgery for thyroid cancer [^2923cfdf]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid cancer, is rising at an epidemic rate. The mainstay of treatment of most patients with thyroid cancer is surgery. Considerable controversy exists about the extent of thyroid surgery and lymph node resection in patients with thyroid cancer. Surgical experience in judgment and technique is required to achieve optimal patient outcomes.

Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers are sometimes treated with radioactive iodine therapy. RAI is taken by mouth and collects in any remaining thyroid tissue, including thyroid cancer cells that have spread to other places in the body. Since only thyroid tissue takes up iodine, the RAI destroys thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer cells without harming other tissue. Before a full treatment dose of RAI is given, a small test-dose is given to see if the tumor takes up the iodine. For tumors that take up iodine
- Total thyroidectomy.
- Radioactive iodine therapy.
- Hormone therapy to prevent the body from making thyroid-stimulating hormone. For tumors that do not take up iodine.
- Total thyroidectomy.
- Hormone therapy to prevent the body from making thyroid-stimulating hormone.
- Targeted therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
- Surgery to remove cancer from areas where it has spread.
- External-beam radiation therapy.

Treatment of Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer may include the following:

- Total thyroidectomy as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients whose cancer is in or near the thyroid.
- Tracheostomy as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life.
- External radiation therapy.
- Chemotherapy.
- Targeted therapy with protein kinase inhibitors for patients with a certain mutation in the.

### Radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer in the era of risk stratification and alternative targeted therapies [^bf2bbd73]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancers are typically iodine-avid and can be effectively treated with radioiodine. In most patients, radioiodine treatment is done for ablation of residual tissue, and in these cases the focus should be on using the minimum effective dose. Adjuvant therapy can be done to reduce the risk of recurrence, but optimal patient selection and dose are unclear. Patients with advanced disease benefit most from treatment with the maximum-tolerated dose. Recent research has focused on better patient selection and reduced radioiodine doses for remnant ablation. There are emerging targeted therapeutic approaches in patients who are appropriately shown to have iodine-refractory disease, with 1 drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Numerous trials are ongoing to assess targeted therapeutics alone or in combination with radioiodine.

### Advancements in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer [^ca0b0f04]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although surgery and radioiodine ablation remain the mainstay of DTC therapy, we have become less aggressive in our management of low-risk patients. As our understanding of the natural history and molecular underpinnings of DTC evolves, so might our approach to managing this patient subset, obviating the need for invasive intervention. At the same time, advances in interventional and systemic therapies have greatly expanded treatment options for high-risk surgical candidates and patients with widespread disease, and continue to be areas of active investigation. Continued research efforts are essential to improve our ability to offer effective individualized therapy to patients at all disease stages and to reduce the incidence of recurrent and progressive disease.

### Contemporary management of thyroid cancer [^a6ac7dc9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer is a relatively common and frequently curable malignant neoplasm, accounting for nearly 2% of all new cancers diagnosed annually in the United States. The diagnostic and management options have evolved considerably in the past decade, and a current understanding of these trends in the standard of care have assumed an important consideration in the practices of head and neck surgeons and endocrinologists alike. We sought to review the epidemiology and pathology of the several types of thyroid cancer and to present our evidence-based management algorithm. Every effort was made to offer alternative treatment strategies and supporting data where available. In addition to reviewing well-established approaches to diagnosis and management, emphasis is placed on newer techniques, including minimally invasive thyroidectomy, molecular detection of disease propensity, and the use of recombinant thyrotropin prior to radioiodine ablation.

### Thyroid dysfunction from treatments for solid organ cancers [^a0673b75]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, cancer care has been transformed by immune-based and targeted treatments. Although these treatments are effective against various solid organ malignancies, multiple adverse effects can occur, including thyroid dysfunction. In this review, the authors consider treatments for solid organ cancers that affect the thyroid, focusing on immune checkpoint inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and radioactive iodine-conjugated treatments (I-131-metaiodobenzylguanidine). They discuss the mechanisms causing thyroid dysfunction, provide a framework for their diagnosis and management, and explore the association of thyroid dysfunction from these agents with patient survival.

### Multikinase inhibitors in thyroid cancer: timing of targeted therapy [^ee78fae8]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

In the 9 years since the publication of our 2011 review of targeted treatment of thyroid cancer with multikinase inhibitors, much has changed in the landscape of this heterogeneous disease. New multikinase and selective inhibitor treatments for medullary thyroid cancer, radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer have completed trials and improved progression-free survival. Many physicians are concerned by dose-limiting adverse effects of these drugs and are wary to begin treatment in patients who are systemically well but have marked disease burden, which makes the timing of treatment initiation challenging. Published mechanistic data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have helped guide our understanding of how to dose effectively with these drugs. A major goal in TKI therapy is to optimize inhibition of oncogenic kinase drivers while maintaining patient quality of life. Real-world data have now been published on how TKIs have fared outside the clinical trial environment. In this Review, we provide a summary of published data on the efficacy of TKIs in clinical practice, to provide clinicians with a more realistic view of how their patients will manage and respond to TKI therapy. Furthermore, we review the data on mechanisms of inhibition, outcomes and adverse effects of TKIs and provide an update on targeted treatment of thyroid cancer, focusing on optimizing the timing of treatment initiation.

### Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: an overview [^1911c492]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer is an uncommon malignancy that accounts for roughly 1% of all new cancers. Although anaplastic lesions constitute fewer than 5% of thyroid cancers, they represent over half of thyroid cancer-related deaths. The relative rarity of anaplastic thyroid cancer, its aggressive nature, and its rapidly fatal course have contributed to the difficulty in developing effective treatment for this disease. Radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery are rarely curative, but combinations of these modalities appear to offer greater benefit than any single treatment. New treatment modalities are desperately required, and promising molecular-based therapies are being investigated.

### Thyroid carcinoma [^8e2d489c]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid carcinomas are fairly uncommon and include disease types that range from indolent localised papillary carcinomas to the fulminant and lethal anaplastic disease. Several attempts to formulate a consensus about treatment of thyroid carcinoma have resulted in published guidelines for diagnosis and initial disease management. Multimodality treatments are widely recommended, although there is little evidence from prospective trials to support this approach. Surgical resection to achieve local disease control remains the cornerstone of primary treatment for most thyroid cancers, and is often followed by adjuvant radioiodine treatment for papillary and follicular types of disease. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is used not only to rectify postsurgical hypothyroidism, but also because there is evidence to suggest that high doses that suppress thyroid stimulating hormone prevent disease recurrence in patients with papillary or follicular carcinomas. Treatment for progressive metastatic disease is often of limited benefit, and there is a pressing need for novel approaches in treatment of patients at high risk of disease-related death. In families with inherited thyroid cancer syndromes, early diagnosis and intervention based on genetic testing might prevent poor disease outcomes. Care should be carefully coordinated by members of an experienced multidisciplinary team, and patients should be provided with education about diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options to allow them to make informed contributions to decisions about their care.

### Executive summary of the 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^d0d1d7d2]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Developed by members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Clinical Affairs Committee, this executive summary of the 2025 ATA guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer provides a summary of key points and recommendations with an emphasis on notable differences between the 2025 and 2015 guidelines. Summary: The updated guidelines emphasize individualized care through the DATA framework (Diagnosis, risk/benefit Assessment, Treatment decisions, and response Assessment) with the goal of enhancing shared decision-making and personalized care. Highlights include expanded role of molecular diagnostics, refined risk stratification, greater emphasis on active surveillance and lobectomy, inclusion of ablative procedures, and selective use of external beam radiation therapy and chemoradiotherapy. De-escalation of surveillance for low-risk patients and introduction of the concept of complete remission are also new. Conclusions: This executive summary aims to provide a summary of key points and recommendations with an emphasis on notable differences between the 2025 and 2015 guidelines.

### Differentiated thyroid cancer-personalized therapies to prevent overtreatment [^ed9ea39b]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

The concept of individualized therapy is rapidly gaining recognition in the management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). This Review provides an overview of the most important elements of this paradigm shift in DTC management and discusses the implications for clinical practice. In the majority of patients with DTC who have an inherently good prognosis, the extent of surgery, the dosage of (131)I therapy and the use of levothyroxine therapy are all aspects suitable for individualization, on the basis of both the stage of disease and the response to treatment. In individuals with advanced disease, newer imaging techniques, advances in (131)I therapy and the use of targeted molecular therapies (such as multitargeted kinase inhibitors) have provided new options for the personalized care of patients, for whom until recently no effective therapies were available. Individualized therapies could reduce adverse effects, including the sometimes debilitating hypothyroidism that used to be required before initiation of (131)I treatment, and major salivary gland damage, a common and unpleasant side effect of (131)I therapy. Highly individualized interdisciplinary treatment of patients with DTC might lead to improved outcomes with reduced severity and frequency of complications and adverse effects. However, in spite of ongoing research, personalized therapies remain in their infancy.

### Advances in surgical therapy for thyroid cancer [^eeef7feb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system and its incidence has dramatically increased over the past three decades. Well-differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) are the main focus of this article, as they represent > 90% of thyroid malignancies. This Review provides an overview of the controversies surrounding the optimal choice of surgery and extent of resection for patients with low-risk DTC or with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, and the role of prophylactic central lymph node dissection. This Review also outlines the current surgical management of DTC and presents updated results for these techniques, along with important advances and current dilemmas in surgical approaches to treatment of these cancers. For example, endoscopic and robotic thyroidectomy are the two most recent innovations to present technical and other challenges to the endocrine surgeon; in addition, the risks as well as the advantages of same-day thyroid surgery, which has gained some acceptance, are detailed. Arguments for and against each approach are presented, along with supporting evidence. The authors' personal opinions are also provided for each topic.

### Is less more? A microsimulation model comparing cost-effectiveness of the revised American Thyroid Association's 2015 to 2009 guidelines for the management of patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1213d87c]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess relative clinical and economic performance of the revised American Thyroid Association (ATA) thyroid cancer guidelines compared to current standard of care.

Background

Diagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States has tripled whereas mortality has only marginally increased. Most patients present with small papillary carcinomas and have historically received at least a total thyroidectomy as a treatment. In 2015, the ATA released the revised guidelines recommending an option for active surveillance (AS) of small papillary thyroid carcinoma and thyroid lobectomy for larger unifocal tumors.

Methods

We created a Markov microsimulation model to evaluate the performance of the ATA's 2015 guidelines compared to the ATA's 2009 guidelines. We modeled a cohort of simulated patients with demographic and thyroid nodule characteristics representative of those presenting clinically in the United States. Outcome measures include life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and frequency of surgical adverse events.

Results

In our base case analysis, the ATA 2015 strategy dominates the ATA 2009 strategy. The ATA 2015 strategy delivers greater discounted average quality-adjusted life years (13.09 vs 12.43) at a lower discounted average cost ($14,752 vs $20,126). Deaths due to thyroid cancer under the 2015 strategy are higher than the 2009 strategy but this is offset by a reduction in surgical deaths, leading to greater average life expectancy under the ATA 2015 strategy. The optimal strategy is sensitive to patients who experience a greater decrement in quality of life while undergoing AS.

Conclusions

The ATA 2015 Guidelines represent a cost-effective strategy regarding AS and extent of surgery.

If surgery is chosen for patients with thyroid cancer < 1 cm without extrathyroidal extension and cN0, the initial surgical procedure should be a thyroid lobectomy unless there are clear indications to remove the contralateral lobe, and thyroid lobectomy alone is sufficient treatment for small, unifocal, intrathyroidal carcinomas in the absence of prior head and neck radiation, familial thyroid carcinoma, or clinically detectable cervical nodal metastases (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence).

### How can we meet the information needs of patients with early stage papillary thyroid cancer considering radioactive iodine remnant ablation? [^2cdf6411]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid carcinoma is increasingly being diagnosed–, and the most common subtype is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). New cases of PTC are most commonly diagnosed at an early stage, with a low risk of disease-related mortality. After the standard surgical removal of the thyroid (total or near-total thyroidectomy), radioactive iodine remnant ablation (RRA) treatment or no RRA (with close medical follow-up) is considered acceptable options for management of early stage PTC, with some flexibility in the approach depending on the individual case characteristics and treatment preferences.

### European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES) consensus statement on advanced thyroid cancer: definitions and management [^4a63e6f4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and consists of a diverse group of histological entities. Although ranging from indolent and well differentiated to aggressive and rapidly developing carcinomas, advanced disease may present in each histological subtype. Even though the characteristics of advanced thyroid cancer are recognized intuitively by experienced surgeons in the field, a common definition among scientific societies is yet to be reached. General definitions of advanced disease are included in the broader management guidelines for each cancer subtype, such as the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). In the European setting, the 2019 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelineon thyroid cancer includes a subsection on the management of advanced disease for each thyroid cancer type. Given the recent progress and new developments in targeted therapy, depending on the genetic alterations of the tumour, new interest has emerged in better defining advanced thyroid disease and selecting candidates for tailored therapy, either in an adjuvant systemic or neoadjuvant setting. This is reflected in the most recent published position statement by the American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) and International Thyroid Oncology Group, as well as the clinical practice guidelines update by ESMO for the use of systemic therapy in advanced thyroid cancer. Nevertheless, existing efforts to define advanced thyroid cancer and to produce management guidelines have been burdened by a common denominator, the lack of high-quality evidence, especially regarding definitions and surgical management.

In May 2023, the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES) organized the 10th biennial conference with the topic 'Consensus meeting on advanced endocrine malignancies', in Mainz (Germany). One working group was tasked to evaluate the current evidence on advanced thyroid carcinoma, and to produce a position statement to be discussed and voted for by the ESES assembly at the Mainz conference. The members of this working group are the authors of the present manuscript.

### Tailoring the approach to radioactive iodine treatment in thyroid cancer [^7de1b762]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer continues to move away from a 'one size fits all' approach to a process of tailored therapeutic decision-making that incorporates disease-specific factors and individual patient preferences. Management options range from active surveillance to thyroid lobectomy to total thyroidectomy with or without the use of postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI). RAI may be administered for one or more reasons: Thyroid remnant ablation, adjuvant therapy, or therapy for persistent structural disease. It is important to be cognizant of the therapeutic intent of RAI and weigh the risks and benefits of treatment for each individual patient. Risk stratification should be used to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from RAI and guide therapeutic choices. Available data suggest that RAI can be safely deferred for most patients considered at low risk for structural recurrence, while adjuvant RAI is associated with improved disease-free survival in patients with higher-risk disease. Although progress has been made, many areas of uncertainty related to the use of RAI remain. These include: (1) The appropriate selection of intermediate-risk patients to receive adjuvant RAI, (2) the superiority or inferiority of different RAI dosing activities, (3) the optimal approach to the use of RAI in special populations, including patients with end-stage renal disease and children, and (4) the management of patients with RAI-refractory disease.

### American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer [^b8d3de9a]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but highly lethal form of thyroid cancer. Rapid evaluation and establishment of treatment goals are imperative for optimum patient management and require a multidisciplinary team approach. Here we present guidelines for the management of ATC. The development of these guidelines was supported by the American Thyroid Association (ATA), which requested the authors, members the ATA Taskforce for ATC, to independently develop guidelines for ATC.

Methods

Relevant literature was reviewed, including serial PubMed searches supplemented with additional articles. The quality and strength of recommendations were adapted from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians, which in turn was developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation workshop.

Results

The guidelines include the diagnosis, initial evaluation, establishment of treatment goals, approaches to locoregional disease (surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, supportive care during active therapy), approaches to advanced/metastatic disease, palliative care options, surveillance and long-term monitoring, and ethical issues including end of life. The guidelines include 65 recommendations.

Conclusions

These are the first comprehensive guidelines for ATC and provide recommendations for management of this extremely aggressive malignancy. Patients with stage IVA/IVB resectable disease have the best prognosis, particularly if a multimodal approach (surgery, radiation, systemic therapy) is used, and some stage IVB unresectable patients may respond to aggressive therapy. Patients with stage IVC disease should be considered for a clinical trial or hospice/palliative care, depending upon their preference.

### Cancer risk after radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78976fb6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for hyperthyroidism associated with an increased cancer risk?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis, including 12 observational studies and 479 452 participants, found that RAI therapy was not associated with a significant increase in overall cancer risk or site-specific cancer incidence or mortality, except for thyroid cancer. However, a linear radiation dose-response association between RAI therapy and solid cancer mortality was observed, based on 2 studies with information on RAI administered dose.

Meaning

Considering the global use of RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism, further studies are needed to provide quantitative estimates of site-specific cancer risks associated with RAI therapy, particularly at higher doses.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — using risk stratification to guide disease surveillance and therapeutic management decisions, risk stratification is the cornerstone of individualized thyroid cancer management, and initial risk estimates are useful to guide the wide variety of clinical management decisions that need to be made around the time of initial diagnosis and treatment. Initial risk estimates can also be used to guide recommendations with regard to the extent of thyroid surgery, the need for and extent of cervical lymph node dissection, the need for and dose of administered activities of radioactive iodine (RAI), the need for and degree of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression, the need for and details of external beam radiation therapy, the need for and types of systemic therapy, the need for and types of studies required for initial staging, and the intensity and type of follow-up studies required for evaluating response to therapy in the early years following initial therapy. This approach tailors the aggressiveness of intervention and follow-up to the specific risks associated with the tumor in an individual patient, and these initial management plans are then modified over time as additional data accumulate and allow for restratification based on individual response to therapy.

### Stratified impact of therapies on anaplastic thyroid cancer outcomes in the pre-gene-targeted therapy era [^8afdede8]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), characterized by rapid progression and high mortality, presents significant treatment challenges. At diagnosis, 15–50% of patients with ATC present with locoregional invasion and distant metastases. Current therapies, albeit aggressive, yield a median overall survival (OS) of merely 3–5 months and a 20% 1-year survival rate, underscoring an urgent need for more effective interventions. While complete resection is the mainstay of therapeutic approaches for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), it is rarely suitable for patients with ATC at diagnosis, due to the extent of disease and the unfavorable prognosis of incomplete palliative resection.

With regard to therapeutic response for patients with ATC, most published reviews, series, and guidelines from the most updated European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO, 2019)and American Thyroid Association (ATA, 2021) guidelinesall advocate aggressive multimodality therapy in the absence of distant metastases. However, there is a lack of substantial backing evidence for these aggressive interventions, and estimates of their effectiveness remain inaccurate. On the other hand, targeted therapy represents a promising avenue in the treatment of patients with ATC, as it aims to exploit specific molecular abnormalities present within the tumor cells. Targeted inhibitors have shown the best efficacy thus far in a phase II clinical trial, for BRAF-mutated patients with ATC. These targeted inhibitors include dabrafenib and trametinib (D+T), other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Although targeted therapies have demonstrated potential, their integration into standard treatment algorithms has been slow, hindered by the lack of robust clinical trials and the pressing need for individualized treatment strategies. The absence of significant enhancement in OS rates for patients with ATC has necessitated a critical reassessment of baseline treatment approaches, which have been largely empirical, with limited evidence-based guidelines due to the disease's rapid progression and the challenges inherent in conducting randomized controlled trials.

The objective of this study was to categorize the therapeutic responses of patients with ATC to baseline treatment modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and their combinations. By establishing a framework for understanding the response of patients with ATC to baseline treatment regimens, we seek to (1) provide evidence to support the practice of precision medicine in patients with ATC; and (2) build a comparison baseline for the efficacy of novel targeting and immune therapies in the future.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^c59de0e6]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

### Thyroid cancer survivorship: challenges and opportunities [^3807d99c]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide a narrative review of challenges and opportunities in the care of thyroid cancer survivors.

Methods

A literature search for full-text articles pertaining to quality of life and survivorship in thyroid cancer was performed and supplemented with personal experience of the authors.

Results

Despite usually favorable prognosis for most thyroid cancer survivors, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) can be as poor or even worse than that in more aggressive cancers. Worry of cancer recurrence and long-term effects from cancer treatment adversely affects HRQOL in addition to other factors. Disparities and financial hardships among thyroid cancer survivors further affect HRQOL. In addition to monitoring for cancer recurrence and managing hypothyroidism, long-term effects from cancer treatment, including surgical complications, effects from radioactive iodine therapy, a small but increased risk of second primary malignancies, and aging-related health conditions (bone, cardiac, and fertility), need to be monitored for and addressed during survivorship care.

Conclusion

Survivorship care models can vary depending on the specifics of the population served; however, a team-based survivor-centered approach provides the best care to thyroid cancer survivors.

Recommendation grading and Good Practice Statements (GPS) specify that "Each recommendation was graded as strong or conditional (Table 1)". "Strong recommendations are applicable to all or nearly all persons or situations and are indicated when benefits clearly outweigh harms with at least moderate certainty", and supporting factors include "high feasibility and acceptability, low or efficient costs of use of resources, and anticipated positive impacts on equity", with Table 1 noting that "Strong recommendations are only indicated when certainty is low or very low in limited circumstances". "Conditional recommendations are appropriate to most people or situations" and "are indicated when the balance of benefits to harms is relatively close, when there is lower certainty about benefits and/or harms, when decisions are preference-sensitive, or when there are important concerns about feasibility, acceptability, resource use, or equity impact". A "Good Practice Statement (GPS) served as an alternative to a graded recommendation in selected situations"; "A GPS is not GRADE-d but is like a strong recommendation, in that it is applicable to all or nearly all persons or situations; not following a GPS would be considered outside of usual practice", requires that "the benefits of the recommended intervention must be obvious and actually and certainly outweigh harms", and "A unanimous consensus was required for all GPS included in these guidelines".

### New therapeutic approaches for metastatic thyroid carcinoma [^3c2f10f1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

Treatment of metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) includes the use of radioiodine and suppressive thyroid hormone treatment. A third of patients with distant metastases (who have radioiodine uptake, are younger than 40 years, have small metastases, and have well differentiated thyroid tumour) can be cured with radioiodine treatment. For other patients, there are no effective treatment modalities. However, the recent availability of molecularly targeted treatments has led to changes in the treatment strategy for DTC in patients with distant metastases, especially in those who are resistant to radioiodine treatment.

### The effectiveness of radioactive iodine for treatment of low-risk thyroid cancer: a systematic analysis of the peer-reviewed literature from 1966 to April 2008 [^60e77b96]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Radioactive iodine (RAI) remnant ablation has been used to eliminate normal thyroid tissue and may also facilitate monitoring for persistent or recurrent thyroid carcinoma. The use of RAI for low-risk patients who we define as those under age 45 with stage I disease or over age 45 with stage I or II disease based on American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th edition, or low risk under the metastases, age, completeness of resection, invasion, size (MACIS) staging system (value < 6) is controversial. In this extensive literature review, we sought to analyze the evidence for use of RAI treatment to improve mortality and survival and to reduce recurrence in patients of various stages and disease risk, particularly for those patients who are at low risk for recurrence and death from thyroid cancer.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was conducted for studies published between January 1966 and April 2008 that compared the effectiveness of administering versus not administering RAI for treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Studies were grouped A through D based on their methodological rigor (best to worst). An analysis, focused on group A studies, was performed to determine whether treatment with RAI for DTC results in decreased recurrences and improved survival rates.

Results

The majority of studies did not find a statistically significant improvement in mortality or disease-specific survival in those low-risk patients treated with RAI, whereas improved survival was confirmed for high-risk (AJCC stages III and IV) patients. Evidence for RAI decreasing recurrence was mixed with half of the studies showing a significant relationship and half showing no relationship.

Conclusions

We propose a management guideline based on a patient's risk-very low, low, moderate, and high-for clinicians to use when delineating those patients who should undergo RAI treatment for initial postoperative management of DTC. A majority of very low-risk and low-risk patients, as well as select cases of patients with moderate risk do not demonstrate survival or disease-free survival benefit from postoperative RAI treatment, and therefore we recommend against postoperative RAI in these cases.

### Management of small papillary thyroid cancers [^49064fd9]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. With increasing imaging utilization, there has been an increase in the recognition of small, indolent cancers that would otherwise go undiagnosed. Historically, the surgical recommendation for all patients with thyroid cancer was a total thyroidectomy. However, over the last 20 years, there have been numerous studies evaluating the de-escalation of interventions for low-risk thyroid cancers, transitioning from total thyroidectomy to thyroid lobectomy or active surveillance when indicated. Here, we review the current literature and recommendations with each of these treatment options.

### Recurrence of papillary thyroid cancer: a systematic appraisal of risk factors [^fbcdd161]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroid cancer recurrence is associated with increased mortality, and early detection of thyroid cancer recurrence has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Currently, risk of recurrence is predicted using clinical tools that often restage patients after their cancer treatment. While this is useful in stratifying patients to the level of follow-up and degree of thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone) suppression required postoperatively, it does not inform the surgeon and patient about risk of recurrence until after all treatment has been completed.

The primary management of thyroid neck recurrence remains surgical, with any microscopic residual disease managed via radioiodine if the malignancy is radioiodine avid. Distant metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer are often not radioiodine avid and are particularly difficult to treat. If not amenable to surgery, radioiodine refractory disease can be considered for high-dose external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), but this is considered much less effective. Sometimes radioresistant disease can be indolent and can be monitored. For rapidly progressive, symptomatic, or imminently threatening disease not amenable to local control, kinase inhibitor therapy can be considered, although this has a significant associated morbidity. Despite recent progress, most patients' tumors eventually stop responding to kinase inhibitor therapies, and almost all patients have adverse events. Therapy targeted to individual patient genotype and phenotype may be key to future progress. Within this broader context, understanding which thyroid carcinomas are going to recur, and the functional reasons behind the recurrence, will be crucial to improving patient care.

### Treatment of advanced thyroid cancer with targeted therapies: ten years of experience [^05bccd3e]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer is rare, but it is the most frequent endocrine malignancy. Its prognosis is generally favorable, especially in cases of well-differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs), such as papillary and follicular cancers, which have survival rates of approximately 95% at 40 years. However, 15–20% of cases became radioiodine refractory (RAI-R), and until now, no other treatments have been effective. The same problems are found in cases of poorly differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic (ATC) thyroid cancers and in at least 30% of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases, which are very aggressive and not sensitive to radioiodine. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent a new approach to the treatment of advanced cases of RAI-R DTC, MTC, PDTC, and, possibly, ATC. In the past 10 years, several TKIs have been tested for the treatment of advanced, progressive, and RAI-R thyroid tumors, and some of them have been recently approved for use in clinical practice: sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC and PDTC and vandetanib and cabozantinib for MTC. The objective of this review is to present the current status of the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer with the use of innovative targeted therapies by describing both the benefits and the limits of their use based on the experiences reported so far. A comprehensive analysis and description of the molecular basis of these therapies, as well as new therapeutic perspectives, are reported. Some practical suggestions are given for both the choice of patients to be treated and their management, with particular regard to the potential side effects.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^4dd710c6]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

ATA low-risk DTC — Evidence summary regarding RAI effects: Existing studies examining the impact of RAI remnant ablation/adjuvant therapy on long-term thyroid cancer outcomes in ATA low-risk patients are subject to limitations due to their observational nature (and potential bias). In a retrospective registry analysis there was no significant effect of RAI adjuvant therapy on overall or disease-free survival using multivariate and stratified propensity techniques, and prospective NTCTCSG data suggest that overall disease-specific and disease-free survival are not improved by RAI treatment in NTCTCSG stage I and II patients. The guideline notes that there is little evidence to suggest that RAI may improve disease-specific mortality in low-risk DTC patients, with some conflicting evidence regarding recurrence outcomes.

### European perspective on 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: proceedings of an interactive international symposium [^baf85bcd]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are highly influential practice recommendations. The latest revision appeared in 2015 ("ATA 2015"). These guidelines were developed predominantly by North American experts. European experts frequently have different perspectives, given epidemiological, technological/methodological, practice organization, and medicolegal differences between the respective regions.

Summary

Divergent viewpoints were the focus of an invited symposium organized by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine involving 17 European thyroidologists, four ATA Guidelines Taskforce members, and an audience of 200 international experts. The group discussed the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules, surgery and the role of pathology, radioiodine (RAI) therapy (RAIT), the assessment of initial therapy and dynamic risk stratification, and the treatment of persistent disease, recurrences, and advanced thyroid cancer. The dialogue resulted in this position paper contrasting European and ATA 2015 perspectives on key issues. One difference pertains to the permissiveness of ATA 2015 regarding lobectomy for primary tumors ≤ 4cm. European panelists cited preclusion of RAIT, potential need for completion thyroidectomy, frequent inability to avoid chronic thyroid hormone replacement, and limitations of supportive evidence as arguments against widely applying lobectomy. Significant divergence involved ATA 2015's guidance regarding RAIT. European panelists favored wider use of postoperative RAIT than does ATA 2015. Rationales included the modality's association with favorable patient outcomes and generally limited toxicity, and lack of high-quality evidence supporting withholding RAIT. Additionally, European panelists favored recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) in more settings than does ATA 2015, citing avoidance of hypothyroid morbidity and quality-of-life impairment, without apparent sacrifice in oncologic outcomes. Based on clinical evidence plus theoretical advantages, European experts advocated dosimetric versus fixed-activity RAIT approaches for advanced DTC. European panelists noted that the ATA 2015 risk-stratification system requires information sometimes unavailable in everyday practice. ATA 2015 recommendations regarding RAI-refractory DTC should consider potential palliative benefits of RAIT in patients who also have RAI-susceptible lesions.

Conclusions

European panelists suggested modifications to approximately one-third of ATA 2015 recommendations. Varying European and ATA 2015 perspectives can stimulate analysis and discussion of the literature and performance of primary research to resolve discrepant recommendations and potentially improve patient outcomes.

### Evolving approaches in managing radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer [^4b4e3eda]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the approach to care of patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), in particular those with radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory disease, and the transition to systemic treatment.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted using the search terms "radioactive iodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer and treatment" restricted to a 2000–2012 timeframe, English language, and humans. Relevant articles were identified from the bibliographies of selected references. Four patient cases are presented to illustrate the clinical course of RAI-refractory DTC.

Results

The current standard of care for early stage DTC could include surgery, RAI in some cases, and thyroid hormone suppression. For advanced RAI-refractory DTC, clinical practice guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Thyroid Association recommend, as one option, the use of systemic therapy, including kinase inhibitors. Numerous trials are underway to evaluate the clinical benefit of these targeted therapies.

Conclusion

Preliminary results are encouraging with respect to the clinical benefit of targeted systemic therapies. However, at present there is no consensus on the criteria that define RAI-refractory disease and the optimal timing for transition to systemic therapy. There remains a need to establish common criteria to enhance patient care and enable better comparison across clinical studies.

### Genomic alterations in thyroid cancer: biological and clinical insights [^aaf6f7c1]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Tumours can arise from thyroid follicular cells if they acquire driver mutations that constitutively activate the MAPK signalling pathway. In addition, a limited set of additional mutations in key genes drive tumour progression towards more aggressive and less differentiated disease. Unprecedented insights into thyroid tumour biology have come from the breadth of thyroid tumour sequencing data from patients and the wide range of mutation-specific mechanisms identified in experimental models, in combination with the genomic simplicity of thyroid cancers. This knowledge is gradually being translated into refined strategies to stratify, manage and treat patients with thyroid cancer. This Review summarizes the biological underpinnings of the genetic alterations involved in thyroid cancer initiation and progression. We also provide a rationale for and discuss specific examples of how to implement genomic information to inform both recommended and investigational approaches to improve thyroid cancer prognosis, redifferentiation strategies and targeted therapies.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^27adb6d6]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association pediatric thyroid cancer guidelines — scope and methods emphasize that a task force commissioned by the American Thyroid Association developed clinically relevant questions for managing children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), used an extensive literature search focused on studies with subjects ≤ 18 years of age with articles identified through April 2014, and graded recommendations using a modified schema from the United States Preventive Services Task Force. These inaugural guidelines provide recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents, including the role and interpretation of ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and the management of benign nodules; for DTC they outline evaluation, treatment, and follow-up including preoperative staging, surgical management, postoperative staging, the role of radioactive iodine therapy, and goals for thyrotropin suppression, and they propose management algorithms with separate recommendations for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers. The need for pediatric-specific guidance is noted because previous guidelines were geared toward adults, pediatric thyroid neoplasms differ in pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and long-term outcomes, and children may be at low risk for death but at higher risk for long-term harm from overly aggressive treatment.

### Low risk papillary thyroid cancer [^25c6e6ce]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing diagnoses; more cases of thyroid cancer are found every year than all leukemias and cancers of the liver, pancreas, and stomach. Most of these incident cases are papillary in origin and are both small and localized. Patients with these small localized papillary thyroid cancers have a 99% survival rate at 20 years. In view of the excellent prognosis of these tumors, they have been denoted as low risk. The incidence of these low risk thyroid cancers is growing, probably because of the use of imaging technologies capable of exposing a large reservoir of subclinical disease. Despite their excellent prognosis, these subclinical low risk cancers are often treated aggressively. Although surgery is traditionally viewed as the cornerstone treatment for these tumors, there is less agreement about the extent of surgery (lobectomy v near total thyroidectomy) and whether prophylactic central neck dissection for removal of lymph nodes is needed. Many of these tumors are treated with radioactive iodine ablation and thyrotropin suppressive therapy, which-although effective for more aggressive forms of thyroid cancer-have not been shown to be of benefit in the management of these lesions. This review offers an evidence based approach to managing low risk papillary thyroid cancer. It also looks at the future of promising alternative surgical techniques, non-surgical minimally localized invasive therapies (ethanol ablation and laser ablation), and active surveillance, all of which form part of a more individualized treatment approach for low risk papillary thyroid tumors.

### Targeting BRAF in thyroid cancer [^df5829da]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing throughout the world. Although this appears to be due largely to enhanced detection of early thyroid cancers by the more generalised use of thyroid ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration, the number of patients who succumb to this disease is also rising annually. Thyroid cancer therapy is based on a three-pronged approach that includes thyroidectomy, and in more aggressive cases, radioactive iodine therapy and suppression of thyrotropin (TSH) levels using levothyroxine. This regimen achieves outstanding long-term survival rates for most patients with thyroid cancer, particularly for the majority diagnosed with early-stage disease. However, for the subset of patients who do not respond to this treatment paradigm, or who present with aggressive primary tumours, therapeutic options are relatively limited and long-term survival rates are low. Treatment using cytotoxic chemotherapy has been largely unsuccessful and although external beam radiation has been shown to be helpful in palliation, cure is rarely achieved. Therefore, developing new approaches to treating patients with aggressive and/or progressive thyroid cancers is an important avenue of research that requires identification of appropriate molecular therapeutic targets.

Over the past few years, it has become evident that aberrant signalling through the RAS–RAF–MEK cascade is crucial for the development of thyroid cancer. In the case of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the subtype that accounts for more than 80% of all thyroid cancers, mutations and/or gene rearrangements in cell surface receptors or signalling molecules in this cascade occur in ∼70% of cases and are tumorigenic in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in). Of these abnormalities, activating mutations in BRAF (V600E) are particularly common in adults with PTC, accounting for approximately 45% of cases (reviewed in). Because BRAF is activated through multiple mechanisms in the majority of thyroid cancers (see Figure 1), there has been an interest in targeting BRAF for potential therapeutic benefit in patients with thyroid cancer.

### Targeting BRAF in thyroid cancer [^c3027238]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

SUMMARY

Activating mutations in the BRAF gene and constitutive signalling through RAF kinases are common events in the development of thyroid cancer. BRAF V600E mutations may be associated with thyroid cancer progression, have been defined as thyroid oncogenes experimentally, and may be, in part, responsible for tumour dedifferentiation and loss of response to standard therapies, such as TSH suppression and radioiodine. Because patients who do not respond to these therapies have a poor prognosis with no proven effective therapeutic options, they represent an important population for the development of new therapies. BRAF and its downstream signalling pathway represent a potential therapeutic target that is being actively studied in thyroid cancer. The studied compounds vary in their specificity for RAF kinases, but have shown potential benefit in preclinical studies and in early reports of clinical trials. Validating the actual targets of these drugs in clinical trials and exploration of combination therapies are important future goals to maximise the potential utility of this approach for patients with progressive thyroid cancer.

### Advancements in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer [^36d59992]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Derived from follicular epithelial cells, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) accounts for the majority of thyroid malignancies. The threefold increase in DTC incidence over the last three decades has been largely attributed to advancements in detection of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas. Efforts to address the issue of overtreatment have notably included the reclassification of encapsulated follicular variant papillary thyroid cancers (EFVPTC) to non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). In the last 5 years, the overall management approach for this relatively indolent cancer has become less aggressive. Although surgery and radioiodine ablation remain the mainstay of DTC therapy, the role of active surveillance is being explored. Furthermore, the most recent American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines offer flexibility between lobectomy and total thyroidectomy for thyroid nodules between 1 cm and 4 cm in the absence of extrathyroidal extension or nodal disease. As our understanding of the natural history and molecular underpinnings of DTC evolves, so might our approach to managing low-risk patients, obviating the need for invasive intervention. Simultaneously, advances in interventional and systemic therapies have greatly expanded treatment options for high-risk surgical candidates and patients with widespread disease, and continue to be areas of active investigation. Continued research efforts are essential to improve our ability to offer effective individualized therapy to patients at all disease stages and to reduce the incidence of recurrent and progressive disease.

### Progress in thyroid cancer genomics: a 40-year journey [^1ae3f734]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Very little was known about the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer until the late 1980s. As part of the Centennial celebration of the American Thyroid Association, we review the historical discoveries that contributed to our current understanding of the genetic underpinnings of thyroid cancer. Summary: The pace of discovery was heavily dependent on scientific breakthroughs in nucleic acid sequencing technology, cancer biology, thyroid development, thyroid cell signaling, and growth regulation. Accordingly, we attempt to link the primary observations on thyroid cancer molecular genetics with the methodological and scientific advances that made them possible. Conclusions: The major genetic drivers of the common forms of thyroid cancer are now quite well established and contribute to a significant extent to how we diagnose and treat the disease. However, many challenges remain. Future work will need to unravel the complexity of thyroid cancer ecosystems, which is likely to be a major determinant of their biological behavior and on how they respond to therapy.

### The outcome of treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer according to recommendations in current Dutch and American guidelines [^aa01c3e2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the landmark study of Mazzaferri et al.differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has been treated primarily with total thyroidectomy (TT), followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy and thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy. Bilimoria et al.underlined these results after analyzing the US National Cancer Database, and directed the American Thyroid Association (ATA) to recommend this treatment strategy in all patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) > 1 cm in the guidelines of 2009.

In the last decades, a steady increase in low‐risk DTC, most likely explained by earlier diagnosis due to imaging used for different reasons. Though DTC often shows an indolent biological behaviour with excellent prognosis, a more risk‐adapted approach, balancing potential treatment benefits and risks, has been suggested. Current ATA management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and DTC from 2015 (ATA‐15) guidelines support a more conservative approach, based on the likelihood of recurrence as seen in low‐risk DTC. However, the considerable variation in thyroid cancer is accompanied by the potential risk of under‐ or overtreatment.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) after thyroidectomy — definitions and overall use are as follows: remnant ablation eliminates residual benign thyroid tissue in the thyroid bed to facilitate treatment monitoring; adjuvant therapy is additional RAI administered to reduce the risk of recurrence; and treatment of known disease targets known areas of residual/metastatic disease. Postoperative RAI administration can be used to accomplish remnant ablation, adjuvant therapy, or treatment for known residual disease, and when deciding if RAI is appropriate, patient- and tumor-specific features should be considered, including histopathology, comorbidities, serological biomarkers and metabolic function panel, logistic feasibility for posttreatment isolation and follow-up evaluation, and patient concerns and preferences.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^5f4166e1]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Given the uncertainties regarding thyroid nodule assessment and management, physicians require systematically and transparently developed recommendations. This systematic review assesses the quality and consistency of the recommendations of international clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer to assist physicians in making appropriate recommendations.

Methods

The CPGs on the management of thyroid nodules and cancer published before June 2013 were retrieved. All the reviewed guidelines were in English. Four reviewers independently assessed the rigor of guideline development by using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument, and their reported evidence was evaluated.

Results

Ten eligible guidelines were included: nine had been developed by professional organizations, and the remaining guideline was endorsed by an independent regional body. Three guidelines achieved a score of greater than 50% in all six AGREE-II domains. Guidelines scored highest on the measurement of 'scope and purpose' (≥ 61.1% for eight CPGs) and lowest on the measurement of 'applicability' (≤ 38.5% for five CPGs). The overall quality ranged from 3.0 to 6.25 on a seven-point scale on the AGREE-II tool. Most CPG recommendations on the management of thyroid cancer were relatively consistent. Guidelines varied regarding the indication of fine-needle aspiration for thyroid nodules, as well as in their suggestions for postoperative radioiodine ablation.

Conclusions

Our analysis showed that the current CPGs varied in methodological quality. More effort is needed to improve the quality of recommendations on the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer.

### Less is more: comparing the 2015 and 2009 American Thyroid Association guidelines for thyroid nodules and cancer [^3eb884eb]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) has recently revised its guidance pertaining to thyroid nodules and follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer. The 2015 guidelines are massive in both scope and scale, with changes in the organizational approach to risk stratification of nodules and cancer, as well as multiple sections covering new material. This review highlights the major structural and organizational changes, focusing attention on the most dramatically changed recommendations, that is, those recommendations that clinicians will find striking because they call for significant divergence from prior clinical practice.

Summary

The revised approach to thyroid nodule risk stratification is based on sonographic pattern, with an emphasis on pattern rather than growth in the long-term surveillance of nodules. Accumulating data have also been incorporated into an updated risk stratification scheme for thyroid cancer that increases the size of the low-risk pool, in part because low-volume lymph nodal metastases are now considered low risk. The most fundamentally altered recommendation is that lobectomy might be considered as the initial surgical approach for follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers from 1 to 4cm in size.

Conclusions

The underlying theme of the 2015 ATA guidelines is that "less is more". As these new recommendations are adopted, fewer fine-needle aspiration biopsies will need to be done, less extensive surgeries will become more common, less radioactive iodine will be used either for treatment or for diagnostics, and less stimulated thyroglobulin testing will be done. Mastery of these guidelines will help clinicians know when it is reasonable to do less, thus providing responsibly individualized therapy for their patients.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — response-to-therapy risk stratification guides follow-up intensity and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression. Ongoing risk stratification allows the clinician to continue to provide individualized management recommendations based on the risk estimates evolve over time. An excellent response to therapy should lead to a decrease in the intensity and frequency of follow-up and the degree of TSH suppression, and this change in management will be most apparent in ATA intermediate- and high-risk patients. If associated with stable or declining serum thyroglobulin (Tg) values, a biochemical incomplete response should lead to continued observation with ongoing TSH suppression in most patients, while rising Tg or anti-Tg antibody values should prompt additional imaging and potentially additional therapies. A structural incomplete response may lead to additional treatments or ongoing observation depending on multiple clinico-pathologic factors including the size, location, rate of growth, RAI avidity, 18FDG avidity, and specific pathology of the structural lesions. An indeterminate response should lead to continued observation with appropriate serial imaging of the nonspecific lesions and serum Tg monitoring, and nonspecific findings that become suspicious over time or rising Tg or anti-Tg antibody levels can be further evaluated with additional imaging or biopsy.

3.2 Consequences of Variation in Risks

The predicted choices from the CLM were used to explore the effect of varying each risk within a clinically plausible range for the same hypothetical clinical scenario. We report these results using focused choices between AS and HT and between HT and TT.

The effect of perceived cancer‐associated risks on treatment choice is presented in Figure 3. As the perceived risk of cancer recurrence increased, more participants preferred HT over AS. The greatest effect size was seen in this group with a 200% increase in preference for more extensive surgery in participants with decisional regret but without thyroid cancer (Figure 3). In contrast, an increased perceived risk of cancer recurrence had minimal effect on preference of TT over HT. Alternatively, this can be described as what perceived risk of cancer recurrence threshold a patient would consider more extensive surgery over AS. When the perceived risk of recurrence is almost double the clinical standard risk, the choice for TT exceeds the choice for AS (Supplementry Information S6). Although increased perceived risk of future thyroid surgery impacted preferences for HT over AS and TT over HT, the effect was much smaller than that of increased cancer recurrence, without a clear association between those with benign nodules or decisional regret.

### Adjuvant radioiodine for intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancer-to treat or not to treat [^08758c62]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), the most common endocrine cancer, has steadily increased over the last 2 decades. DTC comprises both papillary (PTC) and follicular (FTC) thyroid cancer, of which PTC is the most common. The vast majority of the patients with PTC have either stage I or stage II disease at presentation, with the 10-year disease-specific survival approaching 100% in stage I disease. Therefore, predicting the risk of recurrence and/or persistent disease as a basis for guiding the appropriate extent of therapy has become much more important in day-to-day clinical practice. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification system is designed to predict response to therapy and recurring disease in patients with DTC, and patients are stratified as either low-, intermediate-, or high-risk.

Historically, treatment of DTC is based on a combination of thyroid surgery followed by radioiodine (RAI) therapy. The current 2015 ATA guidelines roughly state that RAI therapy can be omitted in low-risk, should be considered in intermediate-risk, and is recommended in high-risk patients. The recommendation not to give RAI therapy in low-risk patients is based on systematic reviews which did not find a significant benefit of RAI therapy on cancer-related death. Recently, Leboulleux et al showed prospectively that in low-risk DTC patients, omitting low-activity RAI remnant ablation is noninferior to a treatment regimen including low-activity RAI remnant ablation with respect to the occurrence of functional, structural, and biologic events after 3 years, but longer follow-up is needed to have more robust conclusions as these patients usually have excellent disease-free survival rates. For intermediate-risk patients, the evidence on the impact of RAI therapy on disease recurrence is conflicting thus far, showing beneficial effects in some and no benefit in others. Benefits regarding survival or recurrence can be expected to be larger in intermediate-risk patients with higher risk of recurrent or persistent disease, but more studies are needed to characterize RAI treatment efficacy in these intermediate-risk patients as the evidence is of low-quality and heterogeneous.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) pediatric thyroid cancer guidelines — A task force commissioned by the ATA developed a series of clinically relevant questions for the management of children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), used an extensive literature search primarily focused on studies that included subjects ≤ 18 years of age with articles identified through April 2014, and graded recommendations using a modified schema from the United States Preventive Services Task Force. These inaugural guidelines provide recommendations for evaluation and management of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents, including the role and interpretation of ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and the management of benign nodules; they also outline evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of DTC including preoperative staging, surgical management, postoperative staging, the role of radioactive iodine therapy, and goals for thyrotropin suppression. Management algorithms are proposed and separate recommendations for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are provided.

### Evolution of anaplastic thyroid cancer management: perspectives in the era of precision oncology [^0c61252e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a rare aggressive malignancy resulting in poor outcomes, including significant morbidity and mortality. Historically, the overall survival of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer has been less than 12months. Multidisciplinary approaches combining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have been implemented to control this ominous disease. The evolution in science and technology has promoted deeper knowledge in the genetic pathways and mechanisms driving advance thyroid cancer. Furthermore, understanding molecular pathways resulted in the application of antineoplastic agents used in other tumors to thyroid cancer and the development of new highly selective drugs. A major landmark in anaplastic thyroid cancer management history was recently reached with the approval of BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination, specifically dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer; this treatment has improved survival and outcomes in this population. Similarly, newer kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy are further shifting advanced thyroid cancer management to consider as first-line therapy inhibiting actionable oncogenic alterations. Therefore, newer treatment paradigms are incorporating molecular testing to provide personalized cancer care in anaplastic thyroid cancer. In this review, the principal aim is to provide an overview of the available international data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy in the management of anaplastic thyroid cancer.

### Current controversies in the initial post-surgical radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer: a narrative review [^5fdb9bf7]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy and the fifth most common cancer in women. DTC therapy requires a multimodal approach, including surgery, which is beyond the scope of this paper. However, for over 50 years, the post-operative management of the DTC post-thyroidectomy patient has included radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation and/or therapy. Before 2000, a typical RAI post-operative dose recommendation was 100mCi for remnant ablation, 150mCi for locoregional nodal disease, and 175-200mCi for distant metastases. Recent recommendations have been made to decrease the dose in order to limit the perceived adverse effects of RAI including salivary gland dysfunction and inducing secondary primary malignancies. A significant controversy has thus arisen regarding the use of RAI, particularly in the management of the low-risk DTC patient. This debate includes the definition of the low-risk patient, RAI dose selection, and whether or not RAI is needed in all patients. To allow the reader to form an opinion regarding post-operative RAI therapy in DTC, a literature review of the risks and benefits is presented.

### Thyroid cancer [^d809ed68]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Thyroid cancer encountered during pregnancy requires a systematic approach balancing risks and benefits to both maternal and fetal health specific to this unique phase of life. Thyroid nodules are common and are predominantly evaluated to detect thyroid cancer. Clinical examination, serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement, ultrasonographic risk stratification, and fine needle aspiration biopsy when indicated are used to assess for malignancy. When thyroid cancer is diagnosed, further evaluation determines whether surgery during gestation is necessary or if delaying surgery until after delivery to minimize fetal and maternal risks is preferred. For patients who have undergone thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, whether during pregnancy or before it, active management of levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy is recommended to ensure a sufficient thyroid hormone supply for both thyroid cancer treatment and optimal reproductive outcomes. This clinically oriented review summarizes key data, recommendations, and current trends regarding thyroid cancer care in pregnancy.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment intent definitions and thyrotropin suppression — Remnant ablation is RAI administration to destroy benign remnant thyroid tissue following total or near-total thyroidectomy. Adjuvant therapy is RAI administration to destroy suspected (but not identified) remaining thyroid cancer following total or near-total thyroidectomy. Therapeutic treatment is RAI administration to treat known residual or recurrent thyroid cancer, either initially or with subsequent re-presentation after total or near-total thyroidectomy. Thyrotropin suppression therapy uses thyroid hormone to suppress serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations below the normal range based on the risk of recurrence and/or response to therapy.

4.5 Unlabeled Options

The presentation of unlabeled treatment options in this hypothetical scenario allows delineation between the attributes associated with a treatment choice and the treatment choice itself. The study vignette clearly introduced that the hypothetical patient had "cancer" and that the three options presented represented no surgery, HT, and TT. However, when each unlabeled option was presented in the scenario (as option A, B, and C), the order was randomized. The options could not easily be equated to the extent of surgery. Despite this, it remains possible that some patients did not appreciate that no surgery would be offered with one of the options (AS) and that the cancer would remain in situ. Nevertheless, omission of labels has a powerful impact on patient decision‐making and choice. In two prior DCEs examining the extent of treatment of thyroid cancer, when the word "cancer" was omitted, patients chose a less invasive option. Although in clinical practice, the term cancer should not be avoided, care should be taken to communicate the typically excellent prognosis of a thyroid cancer diagnosis when presenting treatment options.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer of endocrine system, with a rapid worldwide increase over recent decades. The disease is classified into three types based on pathological characteristics: papillary carcinoma (PTC), follicular carcinoma (FTC) and anaplastic carcinoma (ATC). About 90% of thyroid cancer are well differentiated, while 10% or less are poorly differentiated or anaplastic subtypes. Of the differentiated carcinomas, 85–90% are PTC and 10–15% are FTC. ATC is a rare, but very aggressive, human malignant tumor. The approximate incidence of ATC is one to two cases per million every year, but the median survival of ATC patients is only about five months. Most thyroid cancer patients become disease-free after initial treatment with surgical resection, radioiodine, and thyroid hormone therapy. However, there are few treatment options available for patients with advanced disease, including radioiodine-resistant and metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Tumors initially categorized as poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) or ATC are often highly aggressive and recurrent. In addition to their aggressive growth and metastasis, loss of the capacity to uptake iodine makes both PDTC and ATC difficult to treat, leading to poor prognosis. Moreover, chemotherapeutic treatment has been proved to be largely ineffective against aggressive thyroid carcinomas. These inadequacies of current treatment protocols for PDTC and ATC strongly emphasize the urgent need for novel targeted treatment options.

Over the past few decades, significant advances have been made in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. The pathogenesis of thyroid cancer is thought to involve a multi-step process, in which genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes lead to aberrant proliferation of cells, and alterations in angiogenic genes lead to tumor invasion and spread. Some important tumorigenic factors have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for novel anticancer treatments. Multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated significant antitumor effects in a variety of tumor types, including thyroid cancer, by inhibiting the angiogenic and proliferative signaling. Recently, some kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, vandetanib and cabozantinib have been proved to be the first-line therapies of advanced thyroid malignancies. In addition, more and more multi-kinase inhibitors are included in clinical trials.

### Global burden of thyroid cancer from 1990 to 2017 [^55c7c099]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What were the epidemiologic patterns and variation in the trends of thyroid cancer worldwide from 1990 to 2017?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study covering data on incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years and their temporal trends from 195 countries and 21 regions, increasing trends of thyroid cancer burden were observed, with significant differences by sex, region, country, age, and sociodemographic index. Almost half of the thyroid cancer burden was noted in Southern and Eastern Asia, and a third of patients with thyroid cancer resided in countries with a high sociodemographic index.

Meaning

This study suggests an increasing global burden of thyroid cancer; the geographic disparities may provide support for cancer health care planning and resource allocation.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy — Adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for patients with DTC with high-risk features for locoregional disease progression may be considered in select cases, especially if expected progression would not be amenable to salvage surgery; the potential benefit of improving locoregional relapse-free survival must be weighed against the absence of data demonstrating improvement in overall survival and the known risks of clinically meaningful toxicity (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). EBRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy for gross residual postoperative disease or locally advanced unresectable disease may be considered in select patients who may benefit from improved locoregional control, recognizing that EBRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy may increase locoregional control but also cause acute and long-term treatment-related toxicity (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence).

In the last several years, however, NCI-funded researchers have developed genomic tests that can help tell whether such inconclusive nodules are cancerous and require surgery. These tests have the potential to spare many people potentially unnecessary surgery. In the future, the tests may also be used to select treatments that match the genetic characteristics of individual cancers and determine how much of the thyroid to remove. Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Cancer Treatment Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are both slow growing cancers that usually don't spread elsewhere in the body. Follicular thyroid cancer is less common. Most people diagnosed with thyroid cancer have papillary thyroid cancer, which can usually be cured by surgery to remove the entire thyroid. Sometimes, if papillary thyroid cancer is more advanced, patients will also receive treatment with radioactive iodine.

Researchers are continuing to study whether more people with papillary thyroid cancer could choose to avoid surgery to remove the whole thyroid. Deferring surgery. Other research has shown that most people with very small papillary thyroid cancers — less than 1 centimeter — don't need to have any type of surgery immediately. They can be safely monitored with periodic ultrasound imaging and have surgery only if their cancer starts to grow. Aggressive forms of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer In rare cases, papillary or follicular thyroid cancer can be aggressive and grow and spread despite surgery and radioactive iodine treatment. The Food and Drug Administration has approved two targeted drugs for such cancers: sorafenib tosylate and lenvatinib. Both drugs block the action of several different altered proteins that promote cancer cell growth.

Another targeted drug, called cabozantinib, has been approved for cancers that continue to grow after sorafenib or lenvatinib treatment. Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Treatment Anaplastic thyroid cancer is rare. But it is the most aggressive type of thyroid cancer and one of the most aggressive cancer types overall. Historically, few people with this disease are still alive one year after diagnosis. The disease had proved resistant to all tested therapies. However in 2018, FDA approved the combination of two targeted drugs, dabrafenib mesylate and trametinib, for anaplastic thyroid cancers that have a certain mutation in the.
