## Question

Do I draw lipid panel on 85 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to draw a lipid panel on an 85-year-old and, if so, how to approach it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline status and whether they are already on lipid-lowering therapy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about screening frequency in older adults not on therapy. Next, I will consider the role of lipid testing in very old adults for risk stratification and shared decision-making. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits versus burdens, including life expectancy and frailty. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note any exceptions where testing is still reasonable even if not routinely indicated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: if the 85-year-old is already on a statin or other lipid-lowering therapy, then monitoring LDL-C every 3–12 months is appropriate to assess response and adherence, so in that case, yes, I would draw a lipid panel at clinically reasonable intervals, typically every 3–12 months depending on stability and changes in therapy [^0f603d06] [^441eab1d].

> Wait, let me verify the more common and contentious scenario: the patient is 85 years old, not on lipid-lowering therapy, and we are considering primary prevention. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly recommends against routinely ordering a lipid panel more often than every 10 years for primary prevention in patients not on statins, reflecting minimal within-person change and potential overtreatment from overly frequent testing, so routine lipid testing in this 85-year-old is not recommended if the sole purpose is screening without a therapeutic plan [^e751a6d1] [^8414765d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether any high-credibility sources still endorse measuring lipids in the very old for risk stratification. The 2025 AGS/NLA consensus recommends measuring LDL-C in adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD as part of ASCVD risk stratification, which implies that obtaining a lipid panel can be reasonable when the results will inform a decision about initiating therapy or further risk assessment, even in the very old, provided we integrate geriatric factors and life expectancy into the discussion [^bb850911] [^dfb098cc].

> I need to check the practical implications of that. In an 85-year-old, traditional 10-year risk calculators overestimate risk because they do not account for competing risks, so if I am going to use a lipid panel to inform a statin decision, I should pair it with geriatric assessment and, when uncertain, consider coronary artery calcium to refine risk, recognizing that a CAC of zero can support deferring statins in older adults with borderline risk profiles [^51698422] [^18ca2029] [^822206bc].

> Let me consider the benefit–harm balance carefully. The absolute benefit of LDL-C lowering depends on baseline risk and life expectancy; in the oldest old, the time-to-benefit for primary prevention is often 2–5 years, so a healthy 85-year-old with a substantial remaining life expectancy may accrue meaningful absolute risk reduction, whereas a frail, multimorbid 85-year-old with limited life expectancy is unlikely to benefit and may experience treatment burden, reinforcing that testing is most justified when results will change management in line with the patient's goals and prognosis [^bdde0bda] [^ca86e8eb] [^732cf948].

> But wait, what if the patient has never had lipids checked and we suspect familial hypercholesterolemia or marked dyslipidemia? In that narrow circumstance, documenting baseline lipids can be reasonable to clarify diagnosis and guide counseling, even in very old adults, though the threshold to start therapy remains individualized and should follow shared decision-making that incorporates frailty, cognition, and patient preferences [^77f78a14] [^768f314c].

> I should double-check the bottom line. For an 85-year-old not on lipid-lowering therapy, routine screening with a lipid panel is not recommended; however, if the results will inform a decision about primary prevention therapy, risk stratification, or deprescribing, then yes, drawing a lipid panel is reasonable within a patient-centered, geriatric-informed discussion that weighs life expectancy, functional status, and patient values, and uses competing-risk–aware tools when available [^e751a6d1] [^bb850911] [^78de1e2c].

---

In select 85-year-olds, a lipid panel is reasonable when results will change management — especially for **primary prevention decisions** in those with substantial life expectancy, or for **monitoring therapy** if already on statins. Routine screening is not recommended for frail, multimorbid, or those with limited life expectancy, as benefits are unlikely. Use **shared decision-making** and consider frailty, cognition, and patient preferences before testing [^bb850911] [^e751a6d1] [^768f314c].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **General screening recommendations**: The VA/DoD guideline advises against routine lipid panels more often than every 10 years for primary prevention in patients not on statins, given minimal within-patient change and potential overtreatment [^e751a6d1] [^8414765d].

- **Older adults considerations**: The AGS/NLA consensus recommends measuring LDL-C in adults > 75 years without ASCVD for risk stratification, but decisions should be individualized based on life expectancy, frailty, and comorbidities [^bb850911] [^dfb098cc].

- **Shared decision-making**: Emphasized for older adults, incorporating patient preferences, functional status, and competing risks [^768f314c] [^8e5b811a].

---

## Clinical scenarios where lipid panel may be beneficial

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for lipid panel** |
|-|-|
| Primary prevention in healthy 85-year-old with substantial life expectancy | - LDL-C remains predictive of ASCVD events in older adults [^dfb098cc] <br/> - Potential benefit from statin therapy if life expectancy exceeds time-to-benefit [^bdde0bda] |
| Monitoring response to statin therapy | - Recommended to monitor LDL-C every 3–12 months in patients > 75 years on statins [^0f603d06] <br/> - Ensures adherence and therapeutic effect [^75d0afea] |
| Suspected familial hypercholesterolemia or marked dyslipidemia | - Identify genetic or severe lipid disorders that may warrant therapy even in advanced age [^77f78a14] [^b5ac129d] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where lipid panel may not be beneficial

- **Limited life expectancy**: Frail, multimorbid, or cognitively impaired patients are unlikely to benefit from lipid-lowering therapy due to competing risks and limited time-to-benefit [^bdde0bda] [^ca86e8eb].

- **Patient preference**: Patients prioritizing comfort or with strong preferences against testing/treatment should avoid routine screening [^768f314c].

- **Already on statins with stable control**: If LDL-C is at goal and adherence is good, frequent retesting may not change management [^e21c004d].

---

## Risks and benefits of lipid panel testing in elderly patients

Benefits include informing **primary prevention decisions** in those with substantial life expectancy and supporting **monitoring of therapy** to ensure adherence and therapeutic effect. Risks include potential overtreatment, polypharmacy, and patient anxiety, especially when results are unlikely to change management [^e751a6d1] [^8414765d].

---

## Alternative approaches and considerations

- **Clinical assessment**: Integrate frailty, cognition, and functional status into decisions; tools like ePrognosis can estimate life expectancy to guide prevention [^768f314c] [^78de1e2c].

- **Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring**: Consider in 76–80-year-olds with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL to refine risk and avoid unnecessary statins if CAC is zero [^18ca2029] [^822206bc].

- **Deprescribing**: Reasonable in patients with limited life expectancy or significant adverse effects, aligning with patient goals [^547e8563] [^ca86e8eb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A lipid panel is **not routinely indicated** for all 85-year-olds; it is reasonable when results will change management, such as in healthy patients with substantial life expectancy or when monitoring therapy. Avoid routine testing in frail, multimorbid, or those with limited life expectancy. Use shared decision-making to align testing and treatment with patient preferences, functional status, and prognosis [^e751a6d1] [^bb850911] [^768f314c].

Recommendation-specific supportive text — life expectancy framing for prevention decisions states that there is substantial variability in life expectancy among older adults of the same age, e.g., a healthy 85-year-old woman is expected to live an additional 10 years (and would be likely to benefit from primary prevention) while a frail, multimorbid 85-year-old woman may have less than 2 years remaining life expectancy and may not stand to benefit. Clinicians can consider morbidity burden, functional status and frailty to estimate life expectancy; if an individual's life expectancy is greater than the time to benefit for a given preventive intervention, the intervention may help and should generally be recommended.

Summary of recommendations for lipid management from the 2015 NLA Expert Panel on older patients — secondary and very high risk prevention (ASCVD or type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end organ damage) recommends consideration of moderate or high intensity statin therapy for those individuals age ≥ 65 to ≤ 75 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus; secondary prevention patients who are > 75 to < 80 years of age may be treated with similar regimens after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio; in those ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon provider–patient discussion including drug–drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations and patient preference; combination therapy evidence from IMPROVE-IT indicates individuals (mean age 64 years) with acute coronary syndrome were more likely to benefit from simvastatin–ezetimibe than simvastatin alone, and in those older than age 65 years the ASCVD event rate was 34.6% vs 39.9% with an absolute risk reduction of 3.5%.

### Early impact of the 2018 AHA / ACC / multisociety cholesterol guideline on lipid monitoring after statin initiation [^75d0afea]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline emphasizes the need for lipid monitoring more strongly than the previous 2013 guideline to ensure patients reach recommended percent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions. Real-world compliance to monitoring recommendations is currently unknown.

Objectives

This study examined the proportion of patients with a lipid panel measured within 3 months of statin initiation.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated University of Colorado Health primary care patients aged 18 to 89 years with a new statin prescription identified via the Epic Clarity database. Patients initiated on a statin during January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 and January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 were included in the pre-2018 guideline cohort and the post-2018 guideline cohort, respectively. Patients with active liver disease, pregnancy, or missing demographic data were excluded.

Results

A total of 13,726 patients were included, 7476 in the preguideline cohort and 6250 in the postguideline cohort. A total of 13.9% of patients in the preguideline cohort had a lipid panel completed within 3 months of statin initiation compared with 16.2% in the postguideline cohort (adjusted P < .001). In the postguideline cohort, 56% (n = 857) of patients with lipid monitoring warranted a therapeutic intensification as recommended by the 2018 guideline; however, only 5% had their lipid-lowering regimen changed.

Conclusion

In a large integrated health system, lipid monitoring increased among patients newly started on statin therapy soon after release of the 2018 guideline but remains low. Clinical interventions are needed to improve lipid monitoring to optimize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy and ensure that guideline-recommended goals are achieved.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^d6e129d4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Plasma ceramides independently predict all-cause mortality in men aged 85 [^48ca8c5a]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dyslipidaemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in the general population. The role of dyslipidaemia as a risk factor is more obscure among oldest-old — over 85 years of age — due to frailty, subclinical conditions, multimorbidity and polypharmacy including frequent statin use. Overall, in this oldest age group, common risk prediction scores are not helpful for stratifying cardiovascular risk, because almost all individuals aged ≥ 70 years exceed conventional risk thresholds. The Framingham risk score, for example, only applies to those aged 30–79 years. Consequently, assessing cardiovascular and mortality risk in oldest-old patients is difficult complicating safe decisions about deprescribing cardiovascular medications.

This implicates an unmet need for reliable predictors as the number of oldest-old individuals is rapidly growing. Among people reaching high age, the number of years to live may still be substantial. For example, an 85-year-old man can have a 75% chance of surviving 2 years and a 25% chance of living 9 years. Although heart disease coronary calcium score may be useful for the assessment risk even in older patients, reliable, scalable and easy-to-assess blood-based biomarkers are additionally needed.

Ceramides are bioactive molecular lipids, which have a role in several cellular functions and implicated in apoptosis, inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance, and are present in small amounts in plasma. Measurement of plasma concentrations of ceramides has been found to improve cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk prediction over other variables like low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in midlife, but whether this applies to oldest-old individuals is unknown. We examined this in the oldest home-dwelling survivors (median age 88 years) of a longitudinal study.

Recommendations for controlling cholesterol in older adults

Most recently, 2018 American College of Cardiology/AHA guideline recommended statin use for primary prevention in patients with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, DM, or a 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk ≥ 7.5% with risk enhancers. Atherosclerotic CVD risk is validated for age 20 to 79 years. On the other hand, cardiovascular risk score-3 risk calculator is valid up to the age of 85 years.

Coronary artery calcium score is a valuable prognostic tool in older adults. The negative predictive value of zero coronary artery calcium score for predicting CAD events and mortality increases with age and can be used as an impactful prognostic marker for de-risking at older ages.

Adherence to a healthy lifestyle aids in cholesterol lowering. Statins are important for secondary prevention, and to reduce first CVD event at least to age 75 years. Observational data suggest lower risk for CV events for primary prevention over age 75 years with statin. Few trials have included individuals aged 75 and older. The PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trial, the first dedicated trial to older individuals (70–82 years), demonstrated an overall improvement in CVD outcomes with pravastatin treatment in a mixed primary and secondary prevention population. Subsequent analysis of primary prevention data from Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin and Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 demonstrated a significant 26% relative reduction in CVD events and death among individuals aged ≥ 70 years. Moreover, meta-analysis of 28 major statin trials that included over 186,000 participants (both primary and secondary prevention) and found a 12% reduction in vascular mortality per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, though benefits were attenuated in those over age 75 without pre-existing CVD. Two ongoing randomized controlled trials, the STAREE (Statin Therapy for Reducing Events in the Elderly;) trial and the PREVENTABLE (Pragmatic Evaluation of Events and Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in Older Adults;) trial will address the role of statins for primary prevention in those aged 75 years and older. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins may have antiaging properties through modulation of telomerase activity. That being said, in older adults with life-limiting illnesses and polypharmacy concerns, the potential net benefits of statin treatment for primary prevention are likely attenuated.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^02e07cf7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening and classification of initial lipoprotein lipid levels — In all adults (≥ 20 years of age), a fasting or nonfasting lipoprotein profile should be obtained at least every 5 years and should include at minimum total cholesterol and HDL-C to allow calculation of non–HDL-C (total-C – HDL-C); if fasting (generally 9–12 hours), the LDL-C level may be calculated provided the triglyceride concentration is < 400 mg/dL. If atherogenic cholesterol levels (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) are in the desirable range, lipoprotein lipid measurement and ASCVD risk assessment should be repeated in 5 years, or sooner based on clinical judgment, with earlier rescreening prompted by changes in ASCVD risk factors (including weight gain), a premature ASCVD event in a first-degree relative, evidence of ASCVD in the patient, or a new potential secondary cause of dyslipidemia; for those with atherogenic cholesterol in the desirable range, public health recommendations regarding lifestyle should be emphasized.

Dyslipidemia screening in diabetes — All persons should receive information about enduring lifestyle changes, including daily physical activity, regular exercise (several times a week), and nutritional guidance to improve glucose, lipid, and blood pressure profiles and maintain a healthy weight; access to healthy lifestyle behaviors should be assessed frequently with support from a registered dietitian, a CDCES, and/or a behavioral psychologist; all persons with prediabetes, T1D over the age of 40 years, or T2D should be screened at diagnosis and monitored yearly with a lipid panel including total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C; fasting lipid panels are not necessary for therapeutic decisions and nonfasting lipid panels may aid compliance with timely blood draws; additional biomarkers including apo B, lipoprotein(a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), coronary artery calcification score, and ankle-brachial index are independent risk factors.

### Provider understanding of the 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol guideline [^bf2720c5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Providers' understanding of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol guideline in clinical practice is not known.

Methods

We designed a questionnaire, which was administered to internal medicine, family practice, cardiology, and endocrinology providers at 21 venues across the United States. We compared responses between providers in training or practice and between specialists (cardiology and endocrinology) and nonspecialists (internal medicine and family practice).

Results

Response rate was 72.1% (543 of 725). About 43% of the providers in training and 48% of those in practice indicated having read the guideline. Almost 50% in each group were unable to identify the 4 statin benefit groups and a large proportion (41% in training and 49% in practice) were not aware of the ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk threshold for discussion regarding statin therapy. Most (∼85%) were unaware of the 4 outcomes assessed by the 10-year ASCVD risk equation. About 36% of the providers in training and 48% in practice could identify a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia and start a discussion regarding statin therapy. Only 27.6% of the providers in training and 40.4% in practice recommended repeating a lipid panel 6–8 weeks after starting statins in a patient with recent myocardial infarction. Similar gaps were noted when comparing specialists to nonspecialists.

Conclusion

Most providers do not completely understand the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline. As an unintended consequence, providers are moving away from lipid testing to document response and adherence to statin therapy. Efforts are needed to address these gaps.

### Advanced lipid thinking prior to incorporating advanced lipid testing [^0f9a915a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lipid profiles help estimate patient's short- and long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk over the life course and inform treatment decisions. Advanced lipid testing can provide additional information in selected patients. New 2018 cholesterol guidelines suggest which patients may benefit from additional testing. In patients ages 40–75 years, calculation of a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score begins the clinician-patient risk discussion. In those at intermediate risk (10-year risk 7.5%-19.9%) for future events, inclusion of enhancing factors personalizes the risk decision. The guidelines identify enhancing factors that can support initiating statin therapy. Two advanced lipid tests may be used. Apolipoprotein B levels improve risk estimations and identify genetic disorders in hypertriglyceridemic patients. In patients with a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, significantly elevated lipoprotein (a) levels may reclassify risk. The decision-making cascade of estimating 10-year risk, personalizing risk status with risk-enhancing factors, and, if appropriate, reclassifying risk with a coronary artery calcium score is advanced lipid thinking that can utilize advanced lipid testing to optimize atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention.

Statin effects on LDL-C and events in older adults are summarized from observational and trial data: LDL-C response to low to moderate-intensity statins was slightly greater (2–5% depending on statin and dose) among adults without ASCVD older than 75 years compared to those aged ≤ 50, and differences with high-intensity therapy were minimal. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, major vascular event reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction showed adjusted HR 0.76, 0.73, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.77 across age groups with no differences by age. Among individuals without ASCVD up to age 75 in randomized statin trials, the average time to benefit was 2.5 years. Across 28 major statin trials (n = 186,854), only 8% were over age 75 and only 2% of primary prevention participants were over age 75.

Older adults — primary prevention statin therapy evidence is mixed. An RCT enrolling 5,084 men and women 70 to 82 years of age showed no benefit from pravastatin 40 mg/d versus placebo in the primary-prevention subgroup, and another RCT using pravastatin 40 mg per day versus usual care in older adults showed no statin benefit. In contrast, a recent meta-analysis combining data from JUPITER and HOPE-3 in those ≥ 70 years of age showed a statistically significant 26% RRR for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. A prospective cohort study comparing healthy older patients (age ≥ 70 years) who used statins with those who did not showed significantly lower risk of death but nonsignificant cardiovascular event reduction. Because support is inconsistent and few data exist for adults > 80 years of age, clinician-patient discussion of risk versus benefit remains particularly important, and statins may be indicated if, after a clinician-patient discussion, the potential for benefit is thought to outweigh the risks of adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and cost.

Management of hyperlipidemia in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we recommend an annual lipid profile. In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we recommend statin therapy and the use of an annual lipid profile to achieve the recommended levels for reducing absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause mortality. Technical remark: The Writing Committee did not rigorously evaluate the evidence for specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in this population, so we refrained from endorsing specific LDL-C targets; for patients aged 80 years old and older or with short life expectancy, we advocate that LDL-C goal levels should not be so strict. Epidemiological evidence documents that diabetes is an independent risk factor for CVD, and individuals with diabetes have more than twice the risk for CVD than those who do not have diabetes; most patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes do not have marked elevations of LDL-C, yet these LDL-C levels are high enough to support the development of atherosclerosis.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^f568aa17]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to an increasing number of older adults with (risk factors for) cardiovascular disease (CVD), the sum of older adults eligible for lipid-lowering drugs will increase. This has risen questions about benefits and harms of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults with a varying number of (cardiovascular) comorbidities and functional status. The heterogeneity in physical and functional health increases with age, leading to a much wider variety in cardiovascular risk and life expectancy than in younger adults. We suggest treatment decisions on hypercholesterolaemia in adults aged ≥ 75 years should shift from a strictly 10-year cardiovascular risk-driven approach to a patient-centred and lifetime benefit-based approach. With this, estimated 10-year risk of CVD should be placed into the perspective of life expectancy. Moreover, frailty and safety concerns must be taken into account for a risk-benefit discussion between clinician and patient. Based on the Dutch addendum 'Cardiovascular Risk Management in (frail) older adults', our approach offers more detailed information on when not to initiate or deprescribe therapy than standard guidelines. Instead of using traditional risk estimating tools which tend to overestimate risk of CVD in older adults, use a competing risk adjusted, older adults-specific risk score (available at https://u-prevent.com). By filling in a patient's (cardiovascular) health profile (eg, cholesterol, renal function), the tool estimates risk of CVD and models the effect of medication in terms of absolute risk reduction for an individual patient. Using this tool can guide doctors and patients in making shared decisions on initiating, continuing or deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of older patients with hypercholesterolemia: a clinical review [^97af7038]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercholesterolemia is common among people older than 80 years. Substantial functional heterogeneity exists among older patients, and decision making for statin use differs in older patients relative to younger ones.

Objective

To discuss the presentation, modifying factors, and treatment of hypercholesterolemia (usually with statins) among persons older than 80 years.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE and other sources were searched from January 1990 to June 2014. Personal libraries and a hand search of reference lists from guidelines and reviews from January 2000 to June 2014 were also used.

Findings

No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of statin or any other hypocholesterolemic medication included persons older than 80 years at baseline. Findings from 75- to 80-year-old patients enrolled in RCTs and information from observational studies support statin treatment for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and probably in patients with diabetes without ASCVD. Harms from statin drugs are not increased in older patients, so the use of these agents for primary prevention is possible. Because people older than 80 years are biologically heterogeneous with varying life expectancy, may have frailty or comorbid conditions, and may take multiple medications, the decision to treat with statins must be individualized.

Conclusions and Relevance

Ideally, treatment of hypercholesterolemia for patients at risk of ASCVD should start before they turn 80 years old. No RCT evidence exists to guide statin initiation after age 80 years. Decisions to use statins in older individuals are made individually and are not supported by high-quality evidence.

### JCL roundtable: lipid-lowering drugs in those older than 75 years of age [^ef2a5893]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Using drugs in the elderly requires some special considerations; however, there is no question that our older patients benefit tremendously from the use of agents that prevent and/or control many of the risk factors for vascular disease that are most prevalent in the latter years of life. Recently, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol elevations. For the first time, little specific guidance was given for the age group older than 75 years of age. The rationale given for this approach was primarily that the data from randomized trials comparing drug therapy to treatment with placebos were inadequate for such recommendations. There was also concern regarding safety in this group. This Roundtable will consider this lack of recommendations in a broader context than statin trials.

QUESTION 5
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, how do we assess the expected net benefit of statin therapy?

Synopsis

Comorbidity burden and life expectancy vary widely among older adults of the same age. There is thus considerable variability in the likelihood that an older adult will benefit from preventive and therapeutic interventions. Any benefit from preventive measures may be attenuated by competing health risks from multiple chronic conditions, and the risk of adverse outcomes may be magnified. Lifetables and validated mortality indexes which consider co‐morbidities are available to allow clinicians to refine their patient's prognosis. Furthermore, as discussed under Question 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, competing risk‐adjusted models can help assess ASCVD risk and potential benefit.

Frailty, a syndrome of biologic aging and vulnerability, ranges in prevalence from 7% in community‐dwelling older adults to over 50% in institutionalized patients. The prevalence of functional limitation is 66% in adults aged 65 years and older (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health, United States, 2020‐2021: Functional Limitation. Updated January 16, 2024. Accessed February 21, 2024). In the U.S. in 2022, an estimated 37.2% of people aged 75–84 years and 35.7% of people aged 85 years and older have Alzheimer's dementia and other dementias. Mild cognitive impairment affects 12‐18% of people aged 60 and older in the United States. Frailty, cognition and functional impairment should be considered in person‐centered decision making about preventive measures. Numerous tools are available to assess these geriatric conditions at the bedside, and decision aids can be helpful in assessing patient preferences.

Is statin therapy effective in aged subjects?

Most retrospective cohort studies have demonstrated that statin use is associated with a lower risk of CHD morbidity and mortality in the old population. For example, a study was conducted in Sweden between 1999 and 2003 that included 21,410 patients ≥ 80 years of age who were admitted with the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction. The study showed that CV incidence and coronary mortality were significantly lower in patients who received statins at discharge. Since retrospective studies may be confounded by the "healthy patient bias" (i.e. by the administration of statins to relatively healthy aged patients), prospective randomized trials are needed. However, in many prospective randomized clinical trials, older patients are frequently underrepresented (Table 2). Many studies have excluded people over the age of 75 years, and the others included only small numbers of old individuals.

Table 2
Elderly patients in major statin prospective trials (identified by the trial acronym)

Despite these caveats, some conclusions can be drawn from these studies. In almost all of them, post hoc analyses have shown a reduction in CV events in patients aged ≥ 65 years who were taking statins. The studies that included the largest numbers of old people were the Heart Protection Study (HPS) and the Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER).

In the HPS, almost 6,000 participants were ≥ 70 years old at the beginning of the study. These participants displayed the same risk reduction using simvastatin as younger patients. The proportional reduction in the rate of major vascular events with simvastatin was approximately one-quarter irrespective of the age of the participants. Indeed, even among the 1,263 individuals aged 75–80 years at entry, the reduction in the event rate was substantial and definite (23.1% vs. 32.3%; P = 0.0002). Treatment with statins remained cost-saving or cost-effective in people as old as 85 years, with 5-year risks of a major vascular event as low as 5% at the start of treatment.

When uncertainty exists, CAC scoring is especially useful in older adults, and a CAC score of zero revises ASCVD risk downward and selects adults who show reduced benefit from starting a statin.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^67391d48]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75years with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults.

### Screening for lipid disorders in adults: recommendation… [^12d450dd]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Summary of Recommendations Screening men: The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends screening men 35 years and older for lipid disorders. A recommendation. The USPSTF recommends screening men 20 to 35 years of age for lipid disorders if they are at increased risk of coronary heart disease. There is good evidence that lipid-lowering drug therapy substantially decreases the incidence of CHD in persons with abnormal lipid levels. The absolute benefits of lipid-lowering treatment depend on a person's underlying risk of CHD. Men older than 35 years and women older than 45 years who are at increased risk of CHD will realize a substantial benefit from treatment. There is good evidence that the harms from screening and treatment are small, and include possible labeling and the adverse effects associated with lipid-lowering therapy.

USPSTF assessment The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in all men 35 years and older, and women 45 years and older at increased risk of CHD substantially outweigh the potential harms. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in young adults at increased risk of CHD moderately outweigh the potential harms*. Clinical Considerations Lipid disorders, also called dyslipidemias, are abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism and include elevations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides; or deficiencies of HDL cholesterol. These disorders can be acquired or familial. This recommendation applies to adults 20 years and older who have not previously been diagnosed with dyslipidemia. The optimal interval for screening is uncertain.

On the basis of other guidelines and expert opinion, reasonable options include every five years; shorter intervals for persons who have lipid levels close to those warranting therapy; and longer intervals for those not at increased risk who have had repeatedly normal lipid levels. An age to stop screening has not been established. Screening may be appropriate in older persons who have never been screened; repeated screening is less important in older persons because lipid levels are less likely to increase after 65 years of age. However, because older adults have an increased baseline risk of CHD, they stand to gain greater absolute benefit from the treatment of dyslipidemia, compared with younger adults.

Recommendation‐specifc supportive text

There is substantial variability in life expectancy among older adults of the same age, e.g. a healthy 85‐year‐old woman is expected to live an additional 10 years (and would be likely to benefit from primary prevention) while a frail, multimorbid 85‐year‐old woman may have less than 2 years remaining life expectancy and may not stand to benefit. Clinicians can consider morbidity burden, functional status and frailty to estimate life expectancy. If an individual's life expectancy is greater than the time to benefit for a given preventive intervention, the intervention may help and should generally be recommended. If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, the intervention is more likely to harm and generally should not be recommended. If the life expectancy is approximately equal to the time to benefit, patient preferences should be the guiding factor in decision making. An online calculator, ePrognosis, can help clinicians incorporate evidence‐based information about life expectancy for older adults into decisions about preventive therapies such as statins. For example, for an individual with advanced dementia, the time to benefit of primary prevention statin therapy may exceed life expectancy and the goals of therapy may shift over time from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life.
For patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, incorporating patient preferences in decisions about statin therapy is essential for patient‐centered care. These conditions are associated with physical and functional decline, increased mortality risk, and increased risk of harm from polypharmacy. Yet, individuals with frailty, functional impairment and dementia should not automatically be denied statin therapy. Although few studies have included such patients, a retrospective cohort study of 326,981 Veterans aged 75 years and older without ASCVD at baseline found that new statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, even at advanced ages (e.g. aged > 90 years) and in those with dementia. This association was evident within 2 years and remained significant in those with frailty. However, for some patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, goals of therapy may shift from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life. Practical tools to assess functional status, frailty and cognition are listed in Table 5. The presence of any of these syndromes may prompt elicitation of patient values and preferences for prevention and medication use (see Question 6, Section 2).

### Primary prevention statins in older adults: personalized care for a heterogeneous population [^b8a322c9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of cholesterol acknowledge a lack of robust randomized clinical trial data to support routine use of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults older than 75years. Shared decision making is emphasized because potential recommendations should reflect limitations of the current data, as well as heterogeneity of the older adult population, spanning the robust to the most frail. Although the National Institute on Aging recently funded PRagmatic EValuation of EvENTs And Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in OldEr Adults (PREVENTABLE), a trial to study benefits of statins in very old adults, data are not anticipated for 5years. Thus interim guidance is essential. Furthermore, even when PREVENTABLE is completed, individual idiosyncrasies among older adults suggest that decisions for each patient will still need to be personalized, relative to their unique clinical situation. In this article, we present three case studies to highlight dynamics that commonly impact choices regarding statins in older adults. Details underlying shared decision making are also described including the evolving application of coronary artery calcium to inform this practice. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:467–473, 2020.

### Primary prevention: do the very elderly require a different approach? [^50d7b4fa]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recent cardiovascular prevention guidelines place a greater emphasis on randomized placebo-controlled trial data as the basis for recommendations. While such trial data are sparse for people over the age of 75 or 80 years, data demonstrate altered risk-benefit relationships in these older patients. Primary prevention strategy decisions should consider estimated life expectancy and overall function as well as cardiovascular event risks, magnitude and time to benefit or harm, potentially altered adverse effect profiles, and informed patient preferences. Data support treatment of systolic hypertension to reduce stroke, cardiovascular events, and dementia in older patients with at least a 2-year estimated lifespan with modifications in systolic blood pressure goals and a need for greater attention to non-cardiovascular side effects such as falls in the very old. Lowering of elevated cholesterol levels with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for primary prevention in people over the age of 75 years requires greater individual considerations, as benefits may not accrue for 3–5 years and there is the potential impact of adverse effects. There is a rationale for lipid-lowering treatment in the more highly functional older patient with cardiovascular (especially stroke) risk higher than side effect risks in the near term and with an estimated lifespan longer than the time to benefit. Aspirin has higher side effect risks and requires a longer time to achieve benefit. Trial data are lacking on exercise interventions, but multi-system benefits have been shown in older patients such that exercise should be part of a preventive regimen. Preventive therapy in the very old means considering not only medical issues of co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and altered risk-benefit relationship of medications but also adjusting goals and approaches across the older agespan in keeping with informed patient preferences.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^14c9192c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia management — older patients (Chart 6) states that primary prevention strategies in patients 65–79 years of age should be managed in accordance with the NLA Recommendations for the Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia-Part 1, and that for patients age ≥ 65 to < 80 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, moderate or high intensity statin therapy should be considered after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio. For secondary prevention in patients ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon a provider-patient discussion of the risks and benefits of such therapy, consideration of drug-drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations, and patient preference. Risk calculators such as the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk calculator or the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator can be used in select older individuals with one additional risk factor to further assess risk, using the thresholds for high risk of ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event with the Pooled Cohort Equations, and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham risk calculator; however, these risk calculators have several limitations for use in older patients and may result in overestimation of lower risk older individuals. Older, primary prevention patients who are statin-eligible should undergo a patient-centered discussion with their provider about the risks and benefits of statin therapy, and if unable to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification, the provider should discuss the pros and cons of drug therapy and, if feasible, prescribe moderate intensity statin therapy, particularly when risk exceeds the high risk threshold. CAC scoring may be useful to further assess risk in older patients for whom questions remain about whether to prescribe drug therapy. If statin intolerance is an issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens or low dose statin combination therapy or non-statin monotherapy, with a goal of at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C.

Lifetime risk assessment and thresholds — assessment of lifetime risk is now accepted as important, particularly among younger individuals (< 50 years of age). The NLA Expert Panel selected a high-risk long-term threshold of ≥ 45% using the Framingham long-term (30 year) risk calculator, and among Framingham Heart Study participants free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at 50 years of age, estimated lifetime risk to 95 years of age was 51.7% for men and 39.2% for women. The NLA approach considers high long-term risk as a finding that might alter the decision to use pharmacologic therapy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^26480d9e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### Screening for lipid disorders in adults: recommendations and… [^e548cb67]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Summary of Recommendations The USPSTF strongly recommends that clinicians routinely screen men 35 years and older and women 45 years and older for lipid disorders and treat abnormal lipid levels in persons who are at increased risk of coronary heart disease. The USPSTF has found good evidence that lipid measurement can identify asymptomatic middle-aged persons at increased risk of coronary heart disease and that lipid-lowering drug therapy substantially decreases the incidence of coronary heart disease in such persons with abnormal lipid levels and causes few major harms. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in persons who are middle aged and older substantially outweigh the harms.

Screening is recommended for men 20 to 35 years of age and women 20 to 45 years of age in the presence of any of the following conditions: diabetes; a family history of cardiovascular disease before age 50 years in male relatives or age 60 years in female relatives; a family history suggestive of familial hyperlipidemia; and multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease. The optimal screening interval is uncertain. On the basis of other guidelines and expert opinion, reasonable options for optimal screening intervals include every five years, shorter intervals for persons who have lipid levels close to those warranting therapy, and longer intervals for low-risk persons who have had low or repeatedly normal lipid level measurements. An age at which screening should stop has not been established.

Screening may be appropriate in older persons who have never been screened, but repeated screening is less important in older persons because lipid levels are less likely to increase after age 65 years. Treatment decisions should take into account overall risk of heart disease rather than lipid levels alone. Overall risk assessment should include the presence and severity of the following risk factors: age, gender, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, family history, and smoking. Tools that incorporate specific information on multiple risk factors provide more accurate estimation of cardiovascular risk than categorizations based on counting the numbers of risk factors. Discussion The clearest benefit of lipid screening is the identification of persons whose near-term risk of coronary heart disease is sufficiently high to justify drug therapy or other intensive lifestyle interventions to lower cholesterol levels.

Screening men older than 35 years and women older than 45 years will identify nearly all persons whose risk of coronary heart disease is as high as that of the patients in the existing primary prevention trials.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^44b9f4ac]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Prediabetes screening in adults aged 65 years and older — In patients aged 65 years and older without known diabetes who meet prediabetes criteria by fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c, we suggest obtaining a 2-hour glucose post–oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurement; applicability is emphasized for high-risk patients with features such as hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level < 35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level ≥ 250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L), and shared decision-making and standard dietary preparation for the test are advised.

### New features of the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III lipid-lowering guidelines [^60fe9377]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk contain a number of features that distinguish them from the previous ATP guidelines. These new features include modifications in lipid/lipoprotein levels considered optimal, abnormal, or reflective of risk; increased focus on primary prevention through use of Framingham risk scoring to define risk in persons with multiple lipid/nonlipid risk factors; and increased focus on the association of the metabolic syndrome with CHD risk. The introduction of the category of CHD risk equivalents-including persons with atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, or 10-year CHD risk > 20% based on Framingham scoring-results in an increase over previous guidelines in the proportion of patients categorized as being at high risk and therefore eligible for more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapy. Use of the new secondary therapeutic target of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol should improve management of lipid risk factors in patients who have elevated triglyceride levels after LDL-C goals have been met. These new features of the NCEP ATP III guidelines should improve identification and treatment of patients with dyslipidemias associated with CHD risk.

### Lipid management in the geriatric patient [^fa6dac88]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Elderly individuals are at higher risk for cardiovascular events, and thus this population stands to gain a greater reduction in events from lipid therapy than younger individuals. Multiple primary and secondary prevention trials have demonstrated that the benefits of statins in geriatric patients are equivalent to, or greater than, those seen in younger patients. Combination therapy with non-statin agents should be considered in patients who do not meet cholesterol goals or who have concomitant hypertriglyceridemia or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although increased side effects may occur with high-dose statin therapy, careful vigilance of drug interactions and limiting polypharmacy can reduce these effects.

Children at least 2 years with parental hypercholesterolemia or lipid-lowering medication use, family history of premature ASCVD in men < 55 or women < 65, or unknown family history should be screened. Children should be regularly screened for major risk factors, but there are no validated methods for risk factor scoring in patients < 20 years of age. Cascade screening and reverse cascade screening are recommended to enhance detection of individuals at risk for FH.

Rethinking 10-year risk of CVD

Table 1 gives an overview of the recommendations for managing hypercholesterolaemia in older adults for three major guidelines: the 2014 British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelineand the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline. They all recommend that hypercholesterolaemia treatment in older adults, in principle, should not differ from those in younger patients, and is based on estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk. As previously experienced, CVD is a major risk factor for the occurrence of new cardiovascular events, all patients with pre-existing CVD are at very high 10-year risk of CVD and therefore eligible for lipid-lowering drugs. For patients without CVD, guidelines recommend estimating 10-year risk with traditional risk tools, which state that the majority of older adults are at (very) high 10-year risk of CVD because of their age (and presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors). As a consequence, almost every older adult — with or without CVD — is eligible for use of a lipid-lowering drug. Traditional risk estimation tools do not adjust for competing risks, and consequently, tend to overestimate an older patient's actual 10-year risk of CVD. Also, as described above, a large number of older adults, especially those with multimorbidity or frailty, will not live as long as 10 years. On a group level, the beneficial effects of lipid-lowering drugs in terms of establishing a clinically relevant difference in preventing CVD occur approximately 2–3 years after initiating treatment. For some older patients, the time-until-benefit of lipid-lowering therapy therefore may exceed their life expectancy. Every guideline acknowledges that evidence on benefits and harms of lipid-lowering drugs in older patients, especially patients without CVD, is limited. They all mention that treatment decisions should be guided by clinical judgement, and recommend to include comorbidity, frailty, adverse effects, adherence and patient preference in the decision to treat or not. Compared to the 2014 NICE and the 2016 ESC guidelines, the 2018 AHA/ACC guideline clarifies in more detail what should be meant by this. Also, the latter guideline is the only guideline addressing when to consider deprescribing a lipid-lowering drug (although only for older patients without pre-existing CVD). An important shortcoming of all guidelines is that they are single-disease based, solely based on data from clinical trials in relatively young and fit adults and give advice on how to treat 'average' patients. Recently, a multidisciplinary addendum 'Cardiovascular Risk Management (CVRM) in (frail) older adults' was published in the Netherlands. Based on current, best-available evidence and expert opinion, it provides advice on starting, continuing or discontinuing lipid-lowering drugs in fit and frail older adults. The recommendations may be seen as progressive, because more attention is paid to frailty status, not initiating and deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy than in standard guidelines. Our recommendations presented below are based on this addendum.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^e21c004d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent. 11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication.

Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo. Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values.

Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations. Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl. Editor's Note: Dr. Arnold is a contributing editor for American Family Physician.

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL)-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75 years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75 years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75 years with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Preamble

Since 2014, the National Lipid Association (NLA) has issued several scientific statements on key aspects of the management of lipids and lipoproteins to prevent cardiovascular disease. The current Expert Clinical Consensus, focused on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia among individuals older than 75 years without clinically manifest atherosclerotic cardio vascular disease (ASCVD), was developed as a collaboration between the NLA and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). The governing bodies of both organizations appointed members with relevant expertise to the writing group which was jointly chaired by a representative of NLA (V. B.) and AGS (S. A.L.). The Expert Clinical Consensus was developed by a diverse group of clinical lipidologists, cardiologists, geriatricians, and pharmacists with cumulative expertise in clinical medicine, geriatrics, cardiology, endocrinology, pharmacology, clinical trials, epidemiology, health outcomes research, and public health.

The chairs and members of the writing group jointly developed a set of key clinical questions to be addressed by the panel. Once the key clinical questions were agreed upon, writing assignments were jointly determined by the group based on content expertise with a primary and secondary author assigned to each question. The literature was reviewed and recommendations were developed using the 2019 Update of the American Heart Association (AHA) / American College of Cardiology (ACC) rating system for clinical guidelines, assigning a Class of Recommendation (I‐III) and a Level of Evidence (A‐C with sub categories) for each recommendation (Figure 1). Each section and its associated recommendations were discussed in detail by the writing group. Preliminary recommendations were presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of AGS (AGS23) in May 2023 and feedback from the audience was incorporated as appropriate. Final recommendations based on consensus of at least 60% of the expert panel were then reviewed by external peer reviewers, edited as appropriate and approved by the respective Boards of the NLA and AGS on 9/20/2024.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — the abstract notes that the risk of ASCVD increases with age, that elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol remain predictive of events among individuals older than 75 years, and that risk prediction is less certain because current calculators lack specificity and do not adjust for key geriatric factors. In older primary prevention patients without ASCVD, data on benefits and risks of LDL-cholesterol lowering with statins are limited since most trials included younger patients, yet available data suggest statin therapy may reduce events and that benefits from statin lipid-lowering outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Regarding cognition, while some evidence suggests a possible association between statins and incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making, which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy, is particularly important in older patients, and randomized clinical trial data on non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse.

### Genomic medicine and the "loss of chance" medical malpractice doctrine [^ad611e79]. HGG Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

A successful genomic medical malpractice claim requires the plaintiff to prove all elements of the cause of action: a duty existed, the defendant breached that duty, and the breach caused damages. Under traditional medical malpractice law, a plaintiff cannot satisfy the last of these elements unless she can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's negligence more likely than not caused her injury. Nondisclosed, erroneous, or delayed genetic testing can, in turn, delay treatment that might reduce the risk of the underlying genetic condition. But is such negligence the proximate cause of injury — say, a cardiac event? To draw on one of the examples above, suppose that a doctor fails to adhere to current guidelines and does not order a lipid panel for a 10-year-old, missing the opportunity to detect a pathogenic FH variant. The FH is diagnosed, and LLMs begun, only years later, when they are less helpful in preventing cardiac events. Although the underlying FH variant is a but-for cause of the injury, if the patient can show that similarly situated patients with more timely accurate genetic testing have, say, a 70% chance of avoiding such an event, whereas with delayed testing and uptake of risk management measures have only a 10% chance, then providing expert evidence of this will probably allow her to recover. But if her chance of avoiding a cardiac event were less than 50% even with timely, accurate, and disclosed genetic testing, traditional tort law would deny her recovery, since she would not be able to show that the proximate cause of her injury is the medical negligence.

Supporting evidence notes little within-patient change in annual lipid measurements, variation as high as 18% in three successive total cholesterol (TC) measurements, and that annual lipid testing, when compared to testing every three years, results in unnecessary treatment in 7 per every 1,000 patients; additionally, for primary prevention the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 1.0 when testing is spaced by 9–10 years, and measuring TC at five-year intervals is sufficiently accurate for primary CVD prevention.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with incident ASCVD and recommendation: "Among adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, LDL-C is associated with incident ASCVD and should be measured as part of ASCVD risk stratification". Supporting evidence includes a meta-analysis of "61 prospective studies" where risk "remained statistically significant to 80–89 years", and the Copenhagen General Study of "91,311 participants" (including "10,591 participants were 70–79 years old and 3,188 participants were 80–100 years old") in which "Higher LDL-C was predictive of incident MI and ASCVD independent of age". Adjusted hazard ratios were "highest in the youngest (20–49 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.47 (95% CI 1.45–1.87); ASCVD HRadj 1.47 (95% CI 1.32–1.64))" and "lowest in the oldest (80–100 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.26 (95% CI 1.08–1.52); ASCVD HRadj 1.16 (95% CI 1.05–1.29))". Based on observational estimates for treatment effect per "every 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) lowering of LDL-C in each of the 5 years", numbers needed to treat were "42" vs "345" for ASCVD in ages "80–100" vs "50–59", and "80" vs "439" for MI, respectively.

Older adults with ASCVD — statin initiation and continuation: In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug–drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and patient preferences; in those older than 75 years of age who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation.

### Statins in the elderly: a patient-focused approach [^13e3146c]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals age > 65 years represent the fastest-growing subpopulation in the United States. Although these individuals with the highest cardiovascular risk profile would be anticipated to be the most aggressively treated, paradoxically, treatment and baseline risk are inversely related. Presumably, the elderly population would benefit from high-intensity statin therapy; however, as per the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, given the scarcity of evidence in patients age > 75, there are only sufficient data from randomized controlled trials to support use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. Despite evidence demonstrating statins are beneficial in the elderly, the decision to initiate and sustain treatment should be a well-informed and collaborative decision. One must balance the benefits (secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular prevention, stroke reduction, decreased morbidity and mortality) with the potential risks to the elderly (altered metabolism, comorbidities, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, side effects, cognitive limitations, and cost).

Question 5 — adults older than 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) assesses expected net benefit of statin therapy as follows: In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, validated mortality indexes that include noncardiac conditions and functional status are recommended to help clinicians incorporate the patient's remaining life expectancy into decision making about statin therapy for ASCVD prevention (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, integrating screening for frailty, dementia, and functional impairment into decisions about initiating statin therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD can be useful (COR IIa, LOE B-NR).

Making treatment decisions: from a risk-based to a benefit-based approach

Treatment decisions on hypercholesterolaemia in adults aged ≥ 75 years call for shift from a strictly 10-year cardiovascular risk-driven approach to a patient-centred and lifetime benefit-based approach in which shared decision-making is key. With the latter, estimated 10-year risk of CVD is also taking into consideration, but only after putting this into the perspective of life expectancy and by including potential negative effects of lipid-lowering therapy. To avoid overestimating an individual patient's 10-year risk of CVD with traditional (older adults-specific) risk tools, we propose to use a competing risk adjusted, older adults-specific risk score. Contrary to traditional risk tools, this tool has been validated in studies that also included older patients and patients with several comorbidities. The tool is available free of charge on, and models the effect of medication changes in terms of 10-year absolute risk reduction (or number needed to treat). Together with the patient, risk is estimated after filling in easily available clinical parameters, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, renal function and number of drugs used. The clear graphics (figure 4, online supplementary appendix) can help facilitate a physician–patient discussion on whether the potential lifetime benefits versus the impact potential adverse effects are sufficient to validate therapy for the years left to live. This tool is less suitable in very frail patients, those with multimorbidity or those with a limited life expectancy, as these patients were not included in the (cohort) studies the tool algorithm is based on. Randomised studies on deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy in older adults are scarce, and there is no need to deprescribe therapy solely because of chronological age. However, we believe that there are two reasons to consider deprescribing lipid-lowering therapy: limited life expectancy (< 1–2 years) and adverse effects overshadowing preventive treatment benefits. In patients with a limited lifespan, lifetime risk of CVD has fallen to such a degree that it is unlikely treatment will prevent (new) cardiovascular events, even in patients at (very) high baseline risk of CVD. In these patients, quality of life, functional status and doing no harm take priority over preventing (fatal) CVD. Although observational studies observed increased risk of cardiovascular events after deprescribing statins in older patients, randomised deprescribing trials observed no increase in mortality after deprescribing statins, and a potential to improve quality of life.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Measurements of LDL–C and non–HDL–C — adults who are 20 years of age or older and not on lipid-lowering therapy may be assessed with either a fasting or a nonfasting plasma lipid profile to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL–C; if an initial nonfasting profile reveals triglycerides 400 mg/dL or higher (≥ 4.5 mmol/L), a fasting lipid profile should be performed to assess fasting triglycerides and baseline LDL–C; for adults with an LDL–C level less than 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L), measuring direct LDL–C or a modified LDL–C estimate is reasonable to improve accuracy over the Friedewald formula; in adults 20 years or older without personal ASCVD but with a family history of premature ASCVD or genetic hyperlipidemia, obtaining a fasting plasma lipid profile is reasonable to aid in understanding and identification of familial lipid disorders.

Synopsis for older adults and coronary artery calcium (CAC): Limited life spans may also curtail the time horizon for likely statin benefits, especially as the 4 to 5 years associated with statins' stroke-reducing benefits. Decisions to not initiate statins, or even to de-prescribe them, are reasonable in older adults when aggregate risks outweigh potential for meaningful benefit, and a shared decision-making process that targets individualized decisions with regular reassessments over time is warranted. CAC determination focuses statin therapy on those who benefit most, and for older adults with CAC scores of zero, the likelihood of benefits from statin therapy does not outweigh the risks. Evidence supporting primary prevention with statin therapy extends up to age 79 years, whereas data in older subsets (> 80 years of age) remain sparse.

### Screening for lipid disorders in adults… [^e02109d0]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Case Study E. B. is a 50-year-old black woman who comes to your office for weight-loss counseling. She reports that her brother recently had a heart attack at 58 years of age. She does not smoke and takes no medications other than a daily multivitamin. Her body mass index is 32 kg per m². 2. Which one of the following reasons to screen E. B. for lipid disorders is best supported by scientific evidence. A. Lipid screening should be repeated every three years in adults. B. Lipid screening should be performed in all women older than 45 years. C. Lipid screening should be performed before beginning a weight-loss program. D. Lipid screening should be performed in all women at increased risk of CHD. E. Lipid screening should be performed in all women with a family history of cardiovascular disease before 60 years of age in male relatives.
3. Which one of the following methods for screening for lipid disorders is preferred by the USPSTF. A.

Measure fasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels; repeat if abnormal and average the results for CHD risk assessment. B. Measure fasting or nonfasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels; repeat if abnormal and use the higher result for CHD risk assessment. C. Measure fasting or nonfasting total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels; repeat if abnormal and average the results for CHD risk assessment.
2. The correct answer is D. Decisions to screen for lipid disorders should be based on the patient's age and sex, and the presence of CHD risk factors. Because E. B. has a BMI of greater than 30 kg per m², she is at increased risk of CHD. Another risk factor for CHD is a family history of cardiovascular disease before 50 years of age in male relatives or 60 years of age in female relatives. Women older than 20 years who are at risk of CHD are likely to benefit from screening. The optimal interval for lipid screening is uncertain.

The USPSTF also recommends that all men 35 years and older receive screening for lipid disorders. However, in men 20 to 35 years of age and women 20 years and older who are not at risk of CHD, the benefits and harms of screening are closely balanced. Consequently, the USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against routine lipid screening in these groups.

The ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines

The ACC/AHA guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommends moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy for primary prevention for the following groups (class I recommendations): (1) persons with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 190 mg/dL or higher; (2) persons aged 40 to75 years with type 1 or 2 diabetes; or (3) persons aged 40 to 75 years with LDL cholesterol levels between 70 and 189 mg/dL and 7.5% or higher estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The peril of a global "statinization" of the planet for this grey zone of cardiovascular risk has been put forward, predicting an increase of healthy people for whom statins are recommended by nearly 70 percent (about 920 million people around the world would be classified in this risk categories), and a cumulative global sales of statins approaching $1 trillion by 2020. Critics also point out that 8 of the 15 panelists of the new cholesterol guidelines had industry ties.

### The 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society cholesterol guidelines: looking at past, present and future [^23104331]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors review more than three decades of progress in providing clinicians and patients with guidance on risk assessment, patient evaluation and cholesterol management. Beginning with the National Cholesterol Education Program's Initial Adult Treatment Panel report, the cholesterol guidelines increasingly reflect the progress made in understanding the benefits of improved lifestyle and nutrition to improve lipid profiles, major risk factors and reduce ASCVD risk. Moreover, they now provide qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to guide appropriate risk reduction LDL-C lowering therapy. Use of the Pooled Cohort Equations to determine Low, Borderline, Intermediate and High 10-year ASCVD risk is now joined by recognition of conditions and biomarkers that enhance ASCVD risk. This personalizes the risk discussion for the patient. An important addition is the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to reclassify risk in patients at borderline or intermediate risk, but for whom a risk decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. In secondary prevention, current guidelines provide criteria for determining a "very high" risk group in whom risk is especially high and in whom aggressive LDL-C lowering can be shown to provide increased absolute benefit. Current guidelines provide a comprehensive look at children and adolescents, young adults, elderly, women and issues specific to women through the life course. They provide guidance for those adults at risk due to severe hypercholesterolemia, persistent hypertriglyceridemia after secondary causes have been addressed, those with inflammatory disorders and HIV, those adults with chronic kidney disease, and those affected by issues of race/ethnicity. They conclude with a brief summary of recommendations emphasizing important concepts for providing safety with LDL-C lowering therapy. This combination of best external evidence and clinical expertise from the expert panel should provide a solid foundation for lipid management of patients at risk for or with clinical ASCVD.

Heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk and life expectancy

Older adults are likely to have multimorbidity, polypharmacy and functional impairments putting them at risk of frailty. This results in a heterogeneous population ranging from very fit patients with a long remaining life span to very frail older adults with a limited life expectancy (see online supplementary appendix 1 for more information on (assessing) frailty). With increasing chronological age, this difference in biological age becomes larger (figure 2). For every patient, potential benefit of lipid-lowering therapy depends on pre-treatment (ie, baseline) risk, the relative burden of treatable risk factors, for example, high blood pressure or cholesterol, and competing risks (ie, the risk of dying from other causes than CVD). Due to the large variety in cardiovascular risk factors, in older adults a much wider variety in baseline cardiovascular risk exists compared with younger adults. Differences in pre-treatment risk do not significantly influence the RR reduction established by lipid-lowering therapy, but pre-treatment cardiovascular risk does heavily influence the potential absolute risk reduction. For example, in two patients with the same estimated life expectancy, benefits of lipid-lowering therapy are greatest in the patient with the highest pre-treatment risk of CVD. However, it is important to realise that high pre-treatment risk of CVD does not necessarily mean a high lifetime risk of CVD. This can be explained by competing risks; older adults are likely to have one or more chronic diseases, which puts them at high risk of non-vascular death. Consequently, they may not live long enough to experience a (new) cardiovascular event, making their 10-year risk of CVD lower than their lifetime risk of CVD (ie, the time-until-benefit exceeds life expectancy). As with cardiovascular risk, a substantial heterogeneity in life expectancy exists in older adults. For example, an average 75-year-old male has a median estimated remaining life expectancy of approximately 8–9 years. On the other hand, a 75-year-old with multiple comorbidities belonging to the 'sickest' 25% of the population is estimated to live a maximum of 5 years. See online supplementary appendix 2 for more information on estimating life expectancy.
