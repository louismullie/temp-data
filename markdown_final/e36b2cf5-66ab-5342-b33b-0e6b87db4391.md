## Question

A 72-year-old man presents to the urology clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent painless gross hematuria. He has a known history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and has been on tamsulosin for urinary symptoms. He denies dysuria, weight loss, or flank pain. Urinalysis confirms hematuria without evidence of infection. Cystoscopy and upper tract imaging (CT urogram) are negative for malignancy, stones, or other pathology. The hematuria persists despite conservative management. His prostate is enlarged on digital rectal examination. The urologist is considering further management options.

According to the AUA guideline, what pharmacologic therapy should be considered for this patient, and under what circumstances?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacologic therapy should be considered for a 72-year-old man with persistent, painless gross hematuria presumed secondary to BPH after a negative malignancy/stone workup, and under what circumstances it should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the hematuria has been appropriately attributed to BPH after excluding other causes. Then, I should verify the guideline-backed pharmacologic option for BPH-related bleeding. Next, I will review the mechanism and expected timeline of benefit. After that, I need to check dosing, counseling, and monitoring, including PSA adjustments. Finally, I should consider what to do if hematuria persists despite therapy and ensure the plan aligns with shared decision-making principles.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and attribution. The patient has intermittent painless gross hematuria with known BPH, negative cystoscopy, and negative CT urogram, which supports attributing the bleeding to prostatic vascular fragility from BPH after excluding malignancy, stones, and infection; this is precisely the scenario in which guidelines allow consideration of BPH-directed therapy for hematuria once other etiologies are ruled out [^a26ee1b3] [^3e081702].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic recommendation. The AUA guideline states that after exclusion of other causes of hematuria, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) may be an appropriate and effective treatment alternative in men with refractory hematuria presumably due to prostatic bleeding, which is an Expert Opinion recommendation reflecting clinical experience and mechanistic plausibility rather than randomized trials specific to hematuria endpoints [^a26ee1b3] [^3e081702] [^59f65832].

> I need to check the mechanism to ensure it fits the pathophysiology. 5-ARIs reduce dihydrotestosterone, induce epithelial apoptosis and vascular regression, and suppress VEGF within the prostate, which decreases vascularity and friability; prospective data show reduction or cessation of bleeding with finasteride and lower recurrence on long-term follow-up, supporting its use for BPH-related hematuria [^89173efc] [^1d4f084c].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and practical details. Approved dosing is finasteride 5 mg daily or dutasteride 0.5 mg daily; finasteride selectively inhibits type II 5-AR, whereas dutasteride inhibits types I and II and achieves greater DHT suppression, though both are acceptable for this indication; patients should be counseled that symptom or bleeding benefit may take weeks to months given the slow onset of action, so expectations should be set accordingly [^a26ee1b3] [^ba2f591b].

> Next, I should review counseling and monitoring. Before starting a 5-ARI, I need to counsel on sexual side effects, rare physical effects, and the low risk of prostate cancer; importantly, PSA decreases by about 50% on therapy, so any measured PSA should be doubled for interpretation during monitoring; I should also confirm that the patient understands the need for adherence over months to realize benefit and that we will reassess hematuria and LUTS periodically [^7f14c80b] [^1d4f084c].

> But wait, what if the hematuria persists despite a reasonable trial of a 5-ARI. The guideline advises that if hematuria continues despite 5-ARI therapy, surgical removal or ablation of the offending adenomatous tissue should be the next step; indications for surgery in BPH include recurrent gross hematuria due to BPH, so persistent bleeding despite medical therapy would meet a surgical indication and should prompt discussion of options like TURP, laser vaporization/enucleation, or other appropriate modalities based on prostate size and patient factors [^3389ff49] [^da8aedb1] [^9fe04ef0].

> I should double-check that we are not missing a non-BPH cause. Given negative cystoscopy and CT urogram, and no dysuria, flank pain, or systemic symptoms, the likelihood of alternative urologic pathology is low; however, if hematuria recurs or evolves, I need to reconsider the differential and repeat evaluation per hematuria guidelines, but in this case the balance of evidence supports a BPH-related bleeding source and a trial of a 5-ARI is appropriate [^a26ee1b3] [^e6575d8b].

> Let me reconsider the role of alpha-blockers. The patient is already on tamsulosin, which addresses dynamic obstruction but does not reduce prostate vascularity; adding a 5-ARI targets the static component and vascular friability, so combination therapy is reasonable if LUTS are bothersome or if there is prostatic enlargement, but for isolated refractory hematuria, initiating a 5-ARI alone is the guideline-concordant move here [^f2928ecf] [^a26ee1b3].

> Final recommendation: I should confirm the plan with the patient using shared decision-making. Start a 5-ARI (finasteride 5 mg daily or dutasteride 0.5 mg daily), continue tamsulosin if LUTS persist, counsel on delayed onset and sexual/PSA effects, monitor hematuria and symptoms over 3–6 months, and if bleeding persists despite adherence, proceed to surgical consultation for transurethral or other appropriate prostate tissue removal or ablation, aligning with AUA guidance for refractory BPH-related hematuria [^a26ee1b3] [^3389ff49] [^3a098f39].

---

The AUA recommends a **5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI)** (finasteride 5 mg daily or dutasteride 0.5 mg daily) [^768fa774] for persistent gross hematuria attributed to BPH after excluding other causes, as it reduces prostate vascularity and bleeding [^89173efc]. Alpha-blockers are not indicated for hematuria control and should be continued only for LUTS. If hematuria persists despite 3–6 months of 5-ARI therapy, consider surgical options such as TURP or laser procedures [^3389ff49] [^da8aedb1]. Counsel on sexual side effects and the need for ongoing monitoring [^7f14c80b].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy recommended by AUA guidelines

The AUA recommends **5-ARIs** as the pharmacologic therapy of choice for persistent gross hematuria attributable to BPH after other causes have been excluded [^a26ee1b3] [^3e081702]. 5-ARIs reduce prostate size and vascularity, thereby decreasing bleeding [^89173efc].

---

### Mechanism of action

5-ARIs inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), reducing androgen-mediated prostate growth and vascular proliferation [^1d4f084c]. This decreases prostate size and vascularity, thereby reducing bleeding [^89173efc].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting 5-ARIs

Clinical studies demonstrate that 5-ARIs effectively reduce or stop prostatic bleeding, with **lower recurrence on long-term follow-up** [^89173efc]. A prospective study confirmed these benefits, supporting their use in refractory BPH-related hematuria [^89173efc].

---

### Recommended 5-ARI agents and dosing

| **Agent** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| Finasteride | 5 mg orally once daily [^768fa774] |
| Dutasteride | 0.5 mg orally once daily [^768fa774] |

---

Both agents are effective; **dutasteride** provides greater DHT suppression and may be more effective in larger prostates [^768fa774].

---

## Circumstances under which pharmacologic therapy is recommended

Pharmacologic therapy with 5-ARIs is recommended when:

- **Other causes excluded**: Malignancy, stones, or infection have been ruled out [^a26ee1b3] [^3e081702].
- **Persistent hematuria**: Bleeding continues despite conservative measures [^a26ee1b3] [^3e081702].
- **Enlarged prostate**: The prostate is enlarged on exam or imaging, suggesting BPH-related bleeding [^a26ee1b3] [^3e081702].

---

## Role of alpha-blockers in managing hematuria

Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin) relax smooth muscle and improve urine flow but **do not reduce prostate vascularity or bleeding** [^d89138b6]. They are not indicated for hematuria control and should be continued only for bothersome LUTS [^d89138b6].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients on 5-ARIs require regular follow-up to assess efficacy and monitor for side effects:

- **IPSS**: Monitor symptom scores at each visit [^4d25609c].
- **PSA**: Adjust PSA values by doubling to account for ~50% reduction on therapy [^1d4f084c].
- **Side effects**: Counsel on sexual dysfunction and rare adverse effects [^7f14c80b].

---

## Alternative therapies if pharmacologic therapy fails

If hematuria persists despite 3–6 months of 5-ARI therapy, consider **surgical options**:

- **TURP**: Gold standard for refractory BPH-related hematuria [^notfound].
- **Laser procedures**: Photoselective vaporization or enucleation offer effective alternatives with lower bleeding risk [^d89138b6].
- **PAE**: Prostatic artery embolization is an emerging option for refractory cases, though evidence is limited [^dab451c8] [^89173efc].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Counsel patients on:

- **Delayed benefit**: 5-ARIs require 3–6 months for full effect [^notfound].
- **Sexual side effects**: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory changes [^7f14c80b].
- **Persistence**: If hematuria continues, surgical options should be discussed [^3389ff49].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: 5-ARIs (finasteride 5 mg or dutasteride 0.5 mg daily) after excluding other causes [^a26ee1b3] [^768fa774].
- **Alpha-blockers**: Continue only for LUTS, not for hematuria control [^d89138b6].
- **Monitoring**: Regular IPSS, PSA adjustment, and side-effect assessment [^4d25609c] [^1d4f084c].
- **Surgery**: Consider TURP, laser procedures, or PAE if hematuria persists despite 5-ARI therapy [^3389ff49] [^dab451c8].

---

5-ARIs are the **AUA-recommended pharmacologic therapy** for persistent gross hematuria due to BPH after other causes are excluded, with surgery considered if bleeding persists despite therapy [^a26ee1b3] [^3389ff49].

Benign prostatic hyperplasia — prostatic artery embolization (PAE) is not supported for routine LUTS treatment relative to other minimally-invasive therapies; the panel was unable to find substantial evidence to recommend PAE over more widely available minimally-invasive therapies, though there is evidence showing a short-term benefit of PAE compared to observation in a very select patient population. PAE is technically demanding, averaging fluoroscopy times of up to 50 minutes and procedure times up to 2 hours, with a challenging learning curve; the Panel recommends that these procedures are only performed by physicians specifically trained in this technique and recommends continued investigation of PAE through trials involve multi-disciplinary teams of urologists and radiologists focused on further defining specific indications, including but not limited to gross hematuria recalcitrant to other therapies.

AUA nomenclature — statement types and evidence strength define how recommendations are framed: Strong Recommendations are directive statements that an action should or should not be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is substantial; Moderate Recommendations are directive statements that an action should or should not be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is moderate; and Conditional Recommendations are non-directive statements used when the evidence indicates there is no apparent net benefit or harm or when the balance between benefits and risks/burdens is unclear. Body of evidence strength Grade A in support of a Strong or Moderate Recommendation indicates the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances and that future research is unlikely to change confidence; Grade B indicates the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances, but better evidence could change confidence; and Grade C indicates the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances, but better evidence is likely to change confidence. Where gaps in the evidence exist, Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions are provided via consensus of the Panel, where a Clinical Principle is a statement about a component of clinical care widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature, and Expert Opinion refers to a statement based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment — goals, medications, and procedural indications/classification are outlined as follows: Traditionally, the primary goal of treatment has been to alleviate bothersome LUTS that result from BPO, and more recently treatment has also focused on the prevention of disease progression and complications such as AUR; pharmacologic classes used to treat LUTS/BPH include alpha-adrenergic antagonists (alpha blockers), 5-ARIs, PDE5, and anticholinergics, which may be utilized alone or in combination to take advantage of their different mechanisms of action, and an additional class of agent that may be considered in combination with alpha blockers is beta-3 agonists; there exist clinical scenarios in which conservative or pharmacological management are either inadequate or inappropriate and long-term use of medications for LUTS/BPH have been implicated in cognitive issues and depression, and these situations merit consideration of one of the many invasive procedures available for the treatment of LUTS/BPH; indications include a desire by the patient to avoid taking a daily medication, failure of medical therapy to sufficiently ameliorate bothersome LUTS, intolerance to pharmaceutical side effects, and conditions for which medical therapy is insufficient such as acute and/or chronic renal insufficiency, refractory urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, recurrent bladder stones, and recalcitrant gross hematuria; acute and chronic adverse events associated with each class of medical therapy can include cardiovascular and sexual effects; surgical treatment of symptomatic BPH may be classified into three general types: 1. MIST; 2. Simple prostatectomy; and 3. Transurethral surgery, with transurethral surgery involving removal of the obstructing adenomatous tissue via the transurethral route, classically with monopolar electrocautery TURP, and alternatives developed including bipolar TURP and various laser-based therapies to achieve similar clinical efficacy while reducing the risks of perioperative bleeding and short- and long-term complications; in appropriate patients for whom the physical size of the prostate cannot be addressed due to the expertise of the surgeon via a safe or efficacious transurethral approach, simple prostatectomy (i.e., adenoma enucleation) may be considered.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^89173efc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — medical and interventional adjuncts for prostatic bleeding and refractory hematuria: One early intraprostatic effect of finasteride is suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor, and men with prostate-related bleeding responded to finasteride with reduction or cessation of bleeding and reduced recurrence in long-term follow-up, with a prospective study verifying these observations; the role of short term finasteride to decrease perioperative bleeding in men undergoing TURP is less defined and is not considered to be a routine method of care, and while 5-ARIs have benefits regarding bleeding events, patients should still be counseled on potential side effects. The potential role of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) in the management of refractory hematuria is evolving; many of the studies include a small number of patients with various etiologies of hematuria, and the ability to decrease prostate volume and vascular inflow makes PAE a potential adjunct in management of refractory hematuria.

For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Update on AUA guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^960457ec]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To revise the 2003 version of the American Urological Association's (AUA) Guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Materials and Methods

From MEDLINE® searches of English language publications (January 1999 through February 2008) using relevant MeSH terms, articles concerning the management of the index patient, a male ≥ 45 years of age who is consulting a healthcare provider for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were identified. Qualitative analysis of the evidence was performed. Selected studies were stratified by design, comparator, follow-up interval, and intensity of intervention, and meta-analyses (quantitative synthesis) of outcomes of randomized controlled trials were planned. Guideline statements were drafted by an appointed expert Panel based on the evidence.

Results

The studies varied as to patient selection; randomization; blinding mechanism; run-in periods; patient demographics, comorbidities, prostate characteristics and symptoms; drug doses; other intervention characteristics; comparators; rigor and intervals of follow-up; trial duration and timing; suspected lack of applicability to current US practice; and techniques of outcomes measurement. These variations affected the quality of the evidence reviewed making formal meta-analysis impractical or futile. Instead, the Panel and extractors reviewed the data in a systematic fashion and without statistical rigor. Diagnosis and treatment algorithms were adopted from the 2005 International Consultation of Urologic Diseases. Guideline statements concerning pharmacotherapies, watchful waiting, surgical options and minimally invasive procedures were either updated or newly drafted, peer reviewed and approved by AUA Board of Directors.

Conclusions

New pharmacotherapies and technologies have emerged which have impacted treatment algorithms. The management of LUTS/BPH continues to evolve.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA GUIDELINE PART I-initial work-up and medical management [^360fb53a]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a histologic diagnosis describing proliferation of smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. The prevalence and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men are progressive and impact the health and welfare of society. This revised Guideline provides a useful reference on effective evidence-based management of male LUTS/BPH. See the accompanying algorithm for a summary of the procedures detailed in the Guideline (figures 1 and 2[Figure: see text] [Figure: see text]).

Materials and Methods

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible English language studies published between January 2008 and April 2019, then updated through December 2020. Search terms included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords for pharmacological therapies, drug classes, and terms related to LUTS or BPH. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1[Table: see text]).

Nineteen guideline statements pertinent to evaluation, work-up, and medical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to direct both primary care and urologic providers towards streamlined and suitable practices.

Conclusions

The work up and medical management of BPH requires attention to individual patient characteristics, while also respecting common principles. Clinicians should adhere to recommendations and familiarize themselves with standards of BPH management.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^45b2cd0d]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based guidance to clinicians of all specialties on the evaluation, management, and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB). The guideline informs the reader on valid diagnostic processes and provides an approach to selecting treatment options for patients with OAB through the shared decision-making process, which will maximize symptom control and quality of life, while minimizing adverse events and burden of disease.

Methods

An electronic search employing OVID was used to systematically search the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, as well as the Cochrane Library, for systematic reviews and primary studies evaluating diagnosis and treatment of OAB from January 2013 to November 2023. Criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies were based on the Key Questions and the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, types of studies and settings (PICOTS) of interest. Following the study selection process, 159 studies were included and were used to inform evidence-based recommendation statements.

Results

This guideline produced 33 statements that cover the evaluation and diagnosis of the patient with symptoms suggestive of OAB; the treatment options for patients with OAB, including Noninvasive therapies, pharmacotherapy, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters; and the management of patients with BPH and OAB.

Conclusion

Once the diagnosis of OAB is made, the clinician and the patient with OAB have a variety of treatment options to choose from and should, through shared decision-making, formulate a personalized treatment approach taking into account evidence-based recommendations as well as patient values and preferences.

Patient-reported anejaculation and age-related trends — Anejaculation is noted by patients and may lead to dissatisfaction and treatment discontinuation. In the phase III silodosin studies, the number of men reporting EjD as an adverse event decreased from 46% to 11% for men in their 50s versus 70s, respectively, and the number of men discontinuing treatment due to the adverse events decreased from 4.7% to 0%. Based on these examples, it is reasonable to select alpha blockers with equal efficacy based on expected adverse events, and younger sexually active men are more likely to discontinue due to EjD; therefore, it would be prudent to select alpha blockers with a low incidence of EjD.

### Medical and minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^dcd1ca01]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has changed with a substantial decrease in the use of transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and a simultaneous increase in the use of medical therapy and minimally invasive surgical therapy (MIST). The goal of management of this chronic progressive condition is not only to provide relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) but also to reduce the lifetime risk of adverse outcomes. Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated a clear role for medical therapy, particularly with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) either alone or in combination with alpha-blockers, to reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and need for surgery and provide symptom relief. Clinical data on MISTs also indicate a more pronounced short-term effect; however, the long-term durability of these therapies remains uncertain. Minimally invasive surgical therapies confer treatment benefits in a single 1-h treatment session under local anesthesia. Recovery times and adverse events are improved compared with TURP, but issues such as hematuria, prolonged catheterization, urinary tract infection and retreatment remain commonly reported issues. Today, urologists are faced with the challenge of identifying the most appropriate treatment option for the long-term management of BPH. The initial choice for any given patient will depend on his presenting circumstances and the influence of treatment risks on these circumstances. Providing patients with informed treatment decisions is a key element of management.

Numerous robust analyses of randomized, placebo‑controlled trials have shown an improvement in standardized symptom scores superior to placebo, with improvements of 3 to 4 points observed and maintained for 6 to 10 years of follow‑up. Given the slow onset of action of this class, other medication classes may lead to more immediate relief, and patients should be counseled on a slower improvement in symptoms if men are treated with 5‑ARI alone.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) initial medical therapy — trial duration and next-step evaluation are specified as follows: "An initial trial of medical management over 4 weeks with an alpha blocker or PDE5, and over 6–12 months with a 5-ARI is reasonable in men with bothersome LUTS". "Referral to a specialist is recommended for men who either do not improve with medical management, or have symptomatic improvement but intolerable medication-related side effects". If "initial medical management does not lead to symptomatic improvement", clinicians should consider "performance of studies, such as urodynamics, to confirm BOO versus DO", noting that "Understanding the contribution of DO versus BOO can aid in patient counseling and in the selection of additional medication options". In men "with LUTS predominantly due to BPH", "procedural or surgical options may be considered", whereas in "complicated LUTS… additional medication classes should be considered along with procedural options".

### How would you manage this patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^e3ae4fee]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in older patients assigned male sex at birth, regardless of gender identity, and treatment of these symptoms is therefore common in primary care practice. In 2021, the American Urological Association published guidelines for management of BPH. They recommend using a standardized scoring system such as the International Prostate Symptom Score to help establish a diagnosis and to monitor the efficacy of interventions, α-blockers as the first-choice pharmacotherapy option, and 5α-reductase inhibitors for patients with prostate size estimated to be at least 30 cc. Tadalafil is another option regardless of erectile dysfunction. Combination therapies with α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, or β 3 -agonists are effective options. A surgical referral is warranted if the BPH results in chronic kidney disease, refractory urinary retention, or recurrent urinary tract infections; if there is concern for bladder or prostate cancer; or if symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. In this article, a general internal medicine physician and a urologist discuss the treatment options and how they would apply their recommendations to a patient who wishes to learn more about his options.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5‑alpha‑reductase inhibitors (5‑ARI) — dosing, PSA threshold, and pharmacology are as follows: providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5‑ARI response, and a minimum threshold PSA 1.5ng/mL is advised when initiating therapy; approved doses are finasteride 5 mg daily and dutasteride 0.5 mg tablet daily. Finasteride inhibits 5‑AR type II while dutasteride inhibits types I and II; serum dihydrotestosterone reduction is approximately 70% with finasteride versus approximately 95% with dutasteride, with prostate tissue reductions approximately 80% (finasteride) and approximately 94% (dutasteride). The serum half‑life of finasteride ranges from six to eight hours, whereas that of dutasteride is five weeks.

### Evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men [^712473cb]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The 6th International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Diseases met from June 24–28, 2005 in Paris, France to review new developments in benign prostatic disease.

Materials and Methods

A series of committees were asked to produce recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men. Each committee was asked to base recommendations on a thorough assessment of the available literature according to the International Consultation on Incontinence level of evidence and grading system adapted from the Oxford system.

Results

The Consultation endorsed the appropriate use of the current terminology lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia/benign prostate enlargement and benign prostatic obstruction, and recommended that terms such as "clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia" or "the benign prostatic hyperplasia patient" be abandoned, and asked the authorities to endorse the new nomenclature. The diagnostic evaluation describes recommended and optional tests, and in general places the focus on the impact (bother) of lower urinary tract symptoms on the individual patient when determining investigation and treatment. The importance of symptom assessment, impact on quality of life, physical examination and urinalysis is emphasized. The frequency volume chart is recommended when nocturia is a bothersome symptom to exclude nocturnal polyuria. The recommendations are summarized in 2 algorithms, 1 for basic management and 1 for specialized management of persistent bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms.

Conclusions

The use of urodynamics and transrectal ultrasound should be limited to situations in which the results are likely to benefit the patient such as in selection for surgery. It is emphasized that imaging and endoscopy of the urinary tract have specific indications such as dipstick hematuria. Treatment should be holistic, and may include conservative measures, lifestyle interventions and behavioral modifications as well as medication and surgery. Only treatments with a strong evidence base for their clinical effectiveness should be used.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^d3921924]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

All decision trees were analysed and compared to each other to determine consensus or discrepancies between each possible combination of parameters using web-based software (Diagnostic Nodes), as described previously.

To evaluate discrepancies, a combined tree containing all recommendations was generated. A mode tree was also generated to identify the most common combination of recommendations for each possible situation.

Consensus was defined as complete overlap between the recommended treatments for any case. If all guidelines recommended only one therapy for a specific situation, agreement was 100%. However, if three of six guidelines recommended therapy A only, and the others therapy A or B, this resulted in only 50% agreement for therapy A.

In addition to comparing all guidelines, the two international and most frequently cited guidelines issued by the EAU and AUA were separately compared to highlight discrepancies or areas of consensus.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) evidence appraisal: PFS is a controversial and poorly-defined constellation of chronic 5-ARI-induced sexual, physical, and psychological symptoms that putatively persist after discontinuation of the 5-ARI. Concerns regarding PFS prompted the FDA to amend the labels for 5-ARI with a warning of its risks, and the robustness of the data justifying this change, which is based on anecdotal patient-reported outcomes rather than prospective trials, remains unclear. Dutasteride, which has activity at more 5-ARI receptors than finasteride, has largely not been implicated, and dose response association with finasteride does not seem present as the 1mg dose has been more closely linked to PFS than the more potent 5mg dose. The significant increases in reporting after the first published reports of PFS in 2012 (with no signal before 2012) points towards stimulated reporting. In general, current data on PFS draw primarily from case reports rather than prospective trials, and it is the assessment of the Panel that much of these data are susceptible to bias. Overall, the existence of persistent sexual dysfunction following cessation of 5-ARI is currently not demonstrated by reliable scientific research; there are no properly designed studies that report a significant association, and if the Bradford-Hill criteria are applied, they do not support an inference of causality with neither a strong nor consistent association reported. As for biological gradient, it is difficult to understand how 1 mg of finasteride may cause persistence when the 5 mg dose of the same drug is much less likely, and DHT levels return to normal within four weeks after cessation of finasteride use, which implies no persistent effect through a mechanism involving suppressed serum DHT levels.

5-Alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) effects and monitoring — Inhibition of 5AR reduces the androgenic growth stimulus in the prostate with an increase in apoptosis and atrophy, yielding a shrinkage of the organ ranging from 15–25% measured at six months; use of 5-ARIs is associated with a reduction in serum PSA by approximately 50% and a concomitant decrease in serum free PSA by 50%, therefore the measured serum value of the PSA should be doubled during monitoring. Regarding treatment thresholds, the accepted historic threshold for significant improvement with 5ARI therapy has been 40 cc, while several very large studies defined enrolment at > 30g and achieved significant results.

### What's in a P-value? A fragility analysis of RCTs in the AUA guidelines for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^030c3994]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To use the fragility index (FI) and fragility quotient (FQ) to assess the strength of statistically significant findings for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) cited in the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Methods

Two investigators independently screened the AUA guidelines for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia for RCTs cited as evidence for recommendations. Investigators extracted data related to event rate per group and loss to follow-up which was compared against the FI. Stata 17.0 was used to calculate the FI and FQ which was then summarized and reported according to primary or secondary endpoints.

Results

Among the 373 citations in the AUA guidelines, 24 RCTs met inclusion criteria with 29 distinct outcomes analyzed. The median fragility index was 12 (IQR = 4–38), indicating that twelve alternative events to either study arm would nullify statistical significance. Six studies had a FI of ≤ 2, indicating that only 1–2 outcomes would need to be changed in order to render nonsignificance of results. In 10/24 RCTs, the number of patients lost to follow-up was greater than the FI.

Conclusion

The AUA Clinical Practice Guidelines for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia cite RCTs with more robust findings when compared to previous studies assessing fragility in the field of Urology. While several included studies had high fragility, the median FI in our analysis was approximately 4–5 times higher than comparable studies of urologic RCTs. However, there are areas where improvement is necessary to support the highest quality of evidence-based medicine.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — finasteride outcomes and recommendation: (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). The Proscar Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled U.S. trial, randomized more than 3,000 men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and an enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination (DRE) to finasteride 5 mg/day or placebo; over the 4-year study period, 10% of the 1,516 men on placebo underwent surgery for BPH versus 5% of the 1,524 men on finasteride (a 55% reduction), and acute urinary retention (AUR) developed in approximately 7% versus approximately 3% (a 57% reduction). Finasteride produced a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in mean International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) with a 3.3-fold reduction versus a 1.3 reduction on placebo, improved urinary flow rates, and significantly (p < 0.001) reduced prostate volume; the study suggests that long-term medical therapy could impact the natural history of BPH as manifested by AUR and surgery.

Furthermore, guidelines are criticized for having various methodological and structural issues that could influence their recommendations. These include widespread conflicts of interest from sponsors that support the guidelines. Conflicts of interest, both professional and financial, are also prevalent among guideline authors and boards. Such conflicts, along with industry influence on guideline panels and "panel stacking" (biased selection of panel members), can impact the integrity of the guidelines. The lack of independent peer review before guideline publication is another concern that could compromise the reliability of the recommendations.

Our study builds on the work by Enikeev et al. which compared recommendations using the AGREE II tool for the AUA, EAU, and NICE guidelines. Our analysis includes updated guidelines from both the DGU and CUA and excludes outdated NICE guidelines, providing a more current and comprehensive perspective. The consensus algorithm developed through our analysis (Fig. 1) not only integrates the most accepted and recent guidelines but also offers a detailed and balanced interpretation of these guidelines, independently assessed by four authors. We want to emphasize that our presented algorithm provides a structured overview of current guideline recommendations, it is not intended as a validated clinical decision-making tool. Rather, it serves to illustrate areas of agreement and divergence between established guidelines and to support clinicians in navigating an increasingly complex therapeutic landscape. A formal validation of the algorithm would require a separate prospective study, which is beyond the scope of this work.

The limitations of our study have already been addressed and predominantly arise from inconsistent classifications and categorizations within and across various guidelines. Furthermore, despite our structured and comprehensive search strategy, it is possible that some relevant guidelines were missed, particularly if they were not listed via SIU membership or not publicly available online. This represents a potential source of selection bias. In addition, by limiting inclusion to guidelines published in English or German (Table 1), some documents in other languages may have been excluded. While this was necessary for practical reasons, it may have reduced the global representativeness of our sample.

In addition, the clarity of the consensus flow-chart may be affected by the numerous footnotes. However, given the complexities outlined above and the fact that most guidelines include only vague statement on factors such as patient-preferences, therapy under anticoagulants, preservation of ejaculatory function, such intricacies were inevitable. Therefore, further simplification would have likely led to a loss of precision.

### Recent developments in guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia [^90b09f9b]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines within the healthcare system aim to rationalize the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of a particular disease and can be applicable on an international scale or may be country specific. Specialists, who determine the clinical evidence for individual practices, prepare these guidelines, and the strength of these recommendations depends on available evidence. The assessment of patients includes a minimal number of non-invasive tests. Only in cases of abnormalities are additional (more invasive) tests recommended. Treatment decisions should be evidence-based but, despite guidelines, the choice of treatment is often highly dependent on the personal preference of the urologist. Patients' awareness of different treatment options and their involvement in choosing a treatment is also increasing. Economical aspects are becoming more and more important in making healthcare decisions. Data on durability of treatments, however, are limited and deserve special attention in order to provide the most cost-effective care for different patient groups.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — Pharmacologic treatment in patients with BPH and predominant OAB symptoms: Clinicians may consider pharmacologic interventions among patients with predominant OAB symptoms and who happen to have BPH. The pharmacologic options to treat OAB symptoms in this setting include antimuscarinics, β3 agonists, alpha adrenergic antagonists, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Antimuscarinics and β3 agonists are effective in treating OAB in this population as monotherapy, while antimuscarinic medications may increase PVR volumes slightly, they do not appear to be associated with a significant increased risk of urinary retention among groups of patients with co-existing BOO secondary to BPH; discussion of the risk of retention should occur with those presenting with elevated PVR values, and the effects of these medications among those with residual volumes greater than 200 mL are not well studied.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) initial evaluation — core assessments: In the initial evaluation of patients presenting with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) possibly attributed to BPH, clinicians should obtain a medical history, conduct a physical examination, utilize the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and perform a urinalysis (Clinical Principle). The IPSS, a validated self-administered questionnaire, can provide clinicians with information regarding symptom burden, and while a urinalysis cannot diagnose BPH, it can help clinicians to rule out other causes of LUTS not associated with BPH through detection of bacteria, blood, white cells, glucose, or protein in the urine.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^966b6000]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA GUIDELINE PART II-surgical evaluation and treatment [^3ba6f511]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Surgical therapies for symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are many, and vary from minimally invasive office based to high-cost operative approaches. This Guideline presents effective evidence-based surgical management of male lower urinary tract symptoms secondary/attributed to BPH (LUTS/BPH). See accompanying algorithm for a detailed summary of procedures (figure[Figure: see text]).

Materials/Methods

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible studies published between January 2007 and September 2020, which includes the initial publication (2018) and amendments (2019, 2020). The Team also reviewed articles identified by Guideline Panel Members. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table[Table: see text]).

Results

Twenty-four guideline statements pertinent to pre-operative and surgical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to direct urologic providers towards suitable and safe operative interventions for individual patient characteristics. A re-treatment section was created to direct attention to longevity and outcomes with individual approaches to help guide patient counselling and therapeutic decisions.

Conclusion

Pre-operative and surgical management of BPH requires attention to individual patient characteristics and procedural risk. Clinicians should adhere to recommendations and familiarize themselves with criteria that yields the highest likelihood of surgical success when choosing a particular approach for a particular patient.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Evidence-based guidelines in lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia and variation in care [^7bb1b143]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Guidelines have been developed to assist physicians in the diagnosis and management of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. These guidelines vary in the level of evidence used and the strength of their recommendations. With variations in guidelines, multiple variations in clinical practice may also been seen.

Recent Findings

Although examinations of physician compliance with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) guidelines date back to the 1980s, researchers have become more interested in closer examination of guideline compliance. Furthermore, guidelines themselves are becoming more robust documents, with the American Urological Association and European Association of Urology guidelines updated in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This review examines both the evidence base behind these BPH guidelines and the variations in clinical care related to the guidelines.

Summary

Despite over 40 years of study, variations continue to occur in the work up and treatment of men with BPH. With the proliferation of medications and surgical procedures available for symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH, we will continue to see this variation in care. Our current guidelines can help mitigate this variation by providing a baseline set of assessments and algorithms for routine patients. However, only through continued refinement will the guidelines meet their full potential. The prior review shows how the evidence base is limited for the diagnostic work up for LUTS, provides limited information on comparative effectiveness of therapies in LUTS and BPH, and has not led to consistency between guidelines.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^0a8edd12]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this American Urological Association (AUA) Guideline amendment is to provide a useful reference on the effective evidence-based management of male lower urinary tract symptoms secondary/attributed to BPH (LUTS/BPH).

Materials and Methods

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database to identify studies relevant to the management of BPH. The guideline was updated in 2023 to capture eligible literature published between September 2020 and October 2022. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Results

The BPH amendment resulted in changes to statements/supporting text on combination therapy, photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP), water vapor thermal therapy (WVTT), laser enucleation, and prostate artery embolization (PAE). A new statement on temporary implanted prostatic devices (TIPD) was added. In addition, statements on transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) and transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) were removed and information regarding these legacy technologies was added to the background section. References and the accompanying treatment algorithms were updated to align with the updated text.

Conclusion

This guideline seeks to improve clinicians' ability to evaluate and treat patients with BPH/LUTS based on currently available evidence. Future studies will be essential to further support these statements to improve patient care.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^33e6e054]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Hematuria in ADPKD — practice points and management: Healthcare providers should be aware of the causes and natural history of hematuria in people with ADPKD to provide proper guidance and, if appropriate, reassurance, and should discuss the possibility of gross hematuria with patients at the time of diagnosis of ADPKD to avoid unnecessary worry if it happens. Gross hematuria is a common clinical finding that is distressing to people with ADPKD, and early-onset (i.e., at age < 30 years) gross hematuria is associated with more rapid progression of kidney disease in people with ADPKD. Gross hematuria due to cyst rupture generally resolves within 2–7 days with conservative therapy that consists of bedrest, hydration, and analgesics that exclude NSAIDs, except for short-term use (< 1 week) in people with preserved kidney function; antibiotics are not indicated unless gross hematuria is associated with culture-proven infection. If hematuria is painless, it often resolves spontaneously within 1 or 2 days, and immediate medical attention may not be necessary, but patients should increase their fluid intake and monitor for any additional symptoms. With unusual and severe bleeding, percutaneous arterial embolization or even nephrectomy may become necessary, and while the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid has been used in severe gross hematuria or kidney hemorrhage, the possible benefit needs to be balanced with an increased risk of urinary tract obstruction due to clotting, and of thromboembolic events. In children, an episode after a sports event does not mean the child should not participate in sports; however, should hematuria repeatedly occur in a child, avoiding contact sports in which blunt trauma to the kidney is possible may be prudent.

### Clinically localized prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO / SUO guideline. part II: recommended approaches and details of specific care options [^7082bc8f]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

This guideline is structured to provide a clinical framework stratified by cancer severity to facilitate care decisions and guide the specifics of implementing the selected management options. The summary presented herein represents Part II of the two-part series dedicated to Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: AUA/ASTRO/SUO Guideline discussing risk stratification and care options by cancer severity. Please refer to Part I for discussion of specific care options and outcome expectations and management.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and through additional supplementation by ECRI Institute. This review included articles published between January 2007 and March 2014 with an update search conducted through August 2016. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. Additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 2 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/).

Results

The AUA (American Urological Association), ASTRO, and SUO (Society of Urologic Oncology) formulated an evidence-based guideline based on a risk stratified clinical framework for the management of localized prostate cancer.

Conclusions

This guideline attempts to improve a clinician's ability to treat patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, but higher quality evidence in future trials will be essential to improve the level of care for these patients. In all cases, patient preferences should be considered when choosing a management strategy.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^be6c22a1]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^258b589d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

5-alpha reductase inhibitors for CP/CPPS with BPH-related voiding symptoms — Clinicians may prescribe 5-alpha reductase inhibitors to patients with CP/CPPS who also have voiding symptoms from BPH or enlarged prostate as determined by imaging or PSA level (Expert Opinion). Evidence is limited; in the REDUCE trial of dutasteride 0.5 mg, after 48 months among patients with prostatitis-like pain, a significant decrease of 6 points or greater in NIH-CPSI total scores occurred compared with placebo (49% versus 37%; p = 0.003), with eligibility including PSA levels of ≥ 2.5 ng/mL (age 50–60 years) or > 3.0 ng/mL (age ≥ 60 years). A meta-analysis of previous trials reported a significant reduction in NIH-CPSI versus placebo (-4.6; 95%CI: -8.7 to -0.5). Overall, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors appear to be effective in some patients, should not be used in all patients to treat pain, and may be best used in those with CP/CPPS who also have voiding symptoms from BPH or enlarged prostate.

Original inclusion criteria were PSA 2.5-10ng/mL, prostate volume ≤ 80g and IPSS < 25; post hoc analyses examined men with IPSS < 8 and prostate volumes 40‑80g. Clinical progression, defined by increase in IPSS of ≥ 4, acute urinary retention, urinary tract infection, or BPH‑related surgery, was less common with dutasteride versus placebo (21% versus 36%; p < 0.001). Absolute risk reductions were reported for AUR (6% risk reduction) and BPH‑related surgery (3.8%).

### American Urological Association and European Association of Urology guidelines in the management of benign prostatic hypertrophy: revisited [^3456342e]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to provide a complete revision of two of the most widely used clinical guidelines in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms induced by benign prostatic hyperplasia and their importance and compliance among urologists.

Recent Findings

Updates of the American Association of Urology and European Association of Urology clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were reviewed and analyzed. Literature concerning compliance and application of these two CPGs in the different working scenarios of practicing has been evaluated.

Summary

Urology has moved to an era in which costs and quality of care are being scrutinized, and compliance to CPGs will be assessed. Practicing urologists do not have the time to keep up to date with the continuous incoming literature and CPGs are a great tool to give the highest quality of care to our patients.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^0ee4f3d3]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion), supported by low diagnostic yield data: in a single-institutional cohort of 163 women, cystoscopy identified only 9 clinically significant cases and only five were uniquely identified, and intravenous urography (IVU) was normal in 91.7% with only 5.5% positive IVUs among 164 female patients without management change; cystoscopy is not necessary for gross hematuria with a positive urine culture and no risk factors for urothelial malignancy, but if any risk factors are present cystoscopy should be performed, and further evaluation for bladder cancer should be performed with gross hematuria without documented infection; higher yield may occur in "high-risk" presentations (gross or persistent microscopic hematuria, pyelonephritis, atypical presentation), and for any patient with suspicion for pyelonephritis, or history of hematuria or renal calculi, upper tract imaging is recommended.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^335ba4be]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to urine cytology, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering urine cytology or validated urine-based tumor markers to appropriately counseled intermediate-risk patients who wish to avoid cystoscopy and accept the risk of forgoing direct visual inspection of the bladder urothelium. Obtain renal and bladder ultrasound in these cases.

### Recommendations of apex health bodies remain localized: not in conformity with international implementation policy for urological disorders [^f8907cec]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Desmopressin/DDAVP (deamino — arginine-vasopressin)

Nocturia is one of the common and early symptoms of BPH that impairs sleep at night, reduces the QoL, leads to daytime sleepiness and increased risk of falls in older adults. Desmopressin (synthetic replacement for vasopressin) is currently approved for the treatment of nocturia along with nocturnal polyuria or multiple sclerosis. This is being used voraciously even though it leads to hyponatremia induced morbidity in older adult patients. Most surprising fact is that STOPP/START and AUA guidelines are silent whereas Beer criteria advocate avoiding its use in said population. As per EAU guidelines cautioned use in people > 75 years of age is recommended as decisive factor not the outcome (hyponatremia). In patients < 75 years of age, low dose is recommended with monitoring of serum sodium levels.

Androgens

Adult male hypogonadism also called (late-onset-hypogonadism (LOH) usually presents with persistent sexual, physical and psychological symptoms and may adversely affect multiple organ functions and QoL in older adult. The prevalence of hypogonadism increases with age. EAU considers serum testosterone < 3.5 ng/ml as cut off value while AUA recommends serum testosterone levels below 300 ng/ml in support of the diagnosis of low testosterone. All these apex bodies recommended androgens in LOH, however there is lack of harmony with regard to their contraindications. AUA guidelines (2018) state that PSA should be measured prior to commencement of testosterone therapy to exclude prostate cancer diagnosis and patient should be informed of inadequate evidence available regarding effect of testosterone therapy on the risk of cardiovascular events.EAU absolutely contraindicated its use in patients with untreated prostate and breast cancer.

Traditional medicines

As per WHO data, 80% of the world population still relies on traditional medicines for health care. Although medicinal plants are widely used and assumed to be safe, they can potentially be toxic. Adults who use herbal supplements in conjunction with prescription drugs are potentially at risk for a variety of serious drug interactions. Herbal supplements are regulated by the USFDA, but not as strictly as prescription or OTC drugs. Dietary supplement market doesn't need FDA approval. In Austria, France and Germany, phytotherapeutic agents are first line treatment for moderate LUTS and comprise roughly 90% of all prescriptions for BPH management. In US about 40% of men opting for non-surgical therapy for BPH use herbal supplements alone or in combination with other medical preparations.EAU guidelines recommend Hexane extracted Serenoa repens to men with LUTS who want to avoid potential adverse effects related to sexual function however Beer criteria, STOPP/START and AUA guidelines keep silent about the use of these traditional medicines in geriatric population.
