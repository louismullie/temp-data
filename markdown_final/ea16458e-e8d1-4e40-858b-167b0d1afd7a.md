## Question

A 23 YO marred complaining from contact bleeding and painful sexual intercourse for 9 months what investigation is recommended in her case:
A- Screening for STIs B- Diagnostic laparoscopy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which initial investigation is recommended for a 23-year-old married woman with 9 months of contact bleeding and painful intercourse, choosing between STI screening and diagnostic laparoscopy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely etiologies given her age and symptoms. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about first-line evaluation for postcoital bleeding and dyspareunia. Next, I will compare the diagnostic yield and invasiveness of STI screening versus laparoscopy. Finally, I will outline the appropriate initial workup and when, if ever, laparoscopy becomes indicated, anchoring to CDC and RCOG guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its implications. Contact bleeding with dyspareunia in a young, sexually active woman raises concern for cervical infection, cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease, and chlamydia is a classic cause of postcoital bleeding and dyspareunia, with PID often presenting subtly and risking fertility if missed, so I need to keep a low threshold for evaluation and treatment while avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures [^116bYWwz] [^115GfmCT].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline-backed first step. The CDC recommends maintaining a low threshold for PID in sexually active young women with pelvic or lower abdominal pain and suggests that more elaborate diagnostics, including laparoscopy, are reserved for cases that fail to improve or when alternative diagnoses are suspected, not as an initial test, which argues against starting with laparoscopy here [^115BrVe1]. I should also confirm screening recommendations: USPSTF recommends routine chlamydia screening in sexually active women aged 24 and younger, and BASHH/IUSTI advise testing for chlamydia when there is cervical discharge with STI risk, acute pelvic pain or suspected PID, or postcoital/intermenstrual bleeding, all of which fit this patient's profile [^1153hjfz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about laparoscopy. Diagnostic laparoscopy is invasive, resource-intensive, and carries surgical risk; it is generally reserved for refractory cases, uncertain diagnoses after noninvasive evaluation, or when surgical management is anticipated, not as a first-line test for common causes of postcoital bleeding and dyspareunia in a young woman, so choosing it upfront would be inappropriate here [^115BrVe1].

> I need to check the differential and the sequence of evaluation. Common causes of contact bleeding and dyspareunia in this age group include chlamydia, gonorrhea, cervical ectopy, cervical polyps, and early cervical dysplasia; initial workup should include STI testing with nucleic acid amplification tests, a pelvic examination to visualize the cervix and vagina, and cervical cytology per screening guidelines, reserving imaging such as transvaginal ultrasound for persistent symptoms or suspected adnexal or uterine pathology, and reserving laparoscopy for refractory diagnostic uncertainty or surgical indications [^115BrVe1] [^113sBaCL] [^112kgdxd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought laparoscopy might help visualize endometriosis if pain is severe, but I should double-check that. RCOG notes that transvaginal ultrasound or MRI are useful to evaluate suspected adenomyosis and that imaging is prioritized for adnexal masses, while laparoscopy is not part of the initial evaluation for chronic pelvic pain; so I should correct that impulse and prioritize noninvasive imaging only if indicated by the exam and symptom pattern, not laparoscopy [^111yYG6z] [^112kgdxd].

> Next, I should review the immediate next steps to ensure completeness. I would obtain NAATs for chlamydia and gonorrhea from the cervix or vagina, perform a speculum exam to assess for cervical friability, discharge, ectopy, or polyps, and ensure cervical cytology is up to date; if pelvic or adnexal tenderness is present, I would apply PID criteria and consider empiric treatment while arranging partner management, and if symptoms persist or masses are suspected, I would add transvaginal ultrasound before contemplating any invasive surgical diagnostics [^115GfmCT] [^113sBaCL] [^112kgdxd].

> In summary, I should confirm that STI screening is the recommended initial investigation here because it addresses the most likely and highest-yield diagnoses with the least harm, aligns with CDC and BASHH/IUSTI guidance, and avoids unnecessary surgery; diagnostic laparoscopy is reserved for refractory or diagnostically uncertain cases after appropriate noninvasive evaluation and should not be the first test in this scenario [^115BrVe1] [^112bycn7].

---

The recommended initial investigation for a 23-year-old woman with contact bleeding and dyspareunia is **STI screening** [^1153hjfz] (chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, and HPV) [^115GfmCT] [^116bYWwz] because these are the most common and treatable causes in this age group [^notfound]. Diagnostic laparoscopy is **not indicated** unless there is persistent suspicion for endometriosis, adenomyosis, or other pelvic pathology after noninvasive evaluation (pelvic exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and STI testing) [^111yYG6z] [^1175hk2o]. STI screening is **first-line** because it is noninvasive, cost-effective, and guides timely treatment; laparoscopy is reserved for refractory cases or when invasive evaluation is unavoidable [^115GfmCT].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for contact bleeding and dyspareunia in a young woman includes:

- **Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)**: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) are common causes of cervical inflammation, friability, and contact bleeding [^notfound].

- **Cervical ectopy**: A benign condition common in young women, causing cervical friability and contact bleeding.

- **Cervical polyps**: Benign growths causing contact bleeding.

- **Endometriosis**: Often presents with dyspareunia and may cause contact bleeding.

- **Adenomyosis**: Associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia [^notfound].

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Often associated with STIs, causing pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and abnormal bleeding [^115GfmCT].

---

## Recommended initial investigation: STI screening

STI screening is the **recommended initial investigation** for a 23-year-old woman with contact bleeding and dyspareunia. This approach aligns with current guidelines and evidence-based practice:

- **Prevalence**: STIs are highly prevalent in sexually active young women, with chlamydia and gonorrhea being the most common causes of cervical inflammation and contact bleeding [^notfound].

- **Guidelines**: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active women aged 24 years and younger, and in older women at increased risk [^1153hjfz].

- **Clinical features**: Chlamydia and gonorrhea infections can cause cervical friability, contact bleeding, and dyspareunia, making them prime suspects in this clinical scenario [^116bYWwz].

- **Non-invasive and cost-effective**: STI screening is non-invasive, cost-effective, and provides rapid results, enabling timely treatment and prevention of complications such as PID and infertility [^115qcJE1].

---

## Diagnostic laparoscopy: when is it indicated?

Diagnostic laparoscopy is an invasive surgical procedure that allows direct visualization of pelvic organs. It is **not recommended as an initial investigation** for contact bleeding and dyspareunia in a young woman. Indications for diagnostic laparoscopy include:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Despite negative STI screening and noninvasive evaluation (pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound) [^notfound].

- **Suspected endometriosis or adenomyosis**: When noninvasive imaging (ultrasound or MRI) suggests these conditions but confirmation is needed [^notfound].

- **Unexplained pelvic pain**: Particularly when associated with infertility or suspected adhesions.

- **Failure of medical management**: When symptoms persist despite appropriate medical therapy.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, beginning with noninvasive evaluations such as STI screening, pelvic examination, and transvaginal ultrasound [^1175hk2o]. Diagnostic laparoscopy is reserved for cases in which noninvasive methods fail to identify the cause or when specific conditions such as endometriosis are strongly suspected.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a 23-year-old woman with contact bleeding and dyspareunia, **STI screening is the recommended initial investigation** [^1153hjfz]. This approach is evidence-based, noninvasive, and cost-effective, and it addresses the most common causes of these symptoms in young women. Diagnostic laparoscopy is reserved for cases in which initial noninvasive evaluations are inconclusive or when specific pelvic pathology is suspected.

If the clinician chooses to perform an evaluation and/or provide a certificate, box 2 provides recommendations for how to conduct an evaluation and document clinical findings.

Box 2
Recommendations for evaluation of women requesting 'virginity' testing

Ensure a safe and confidential setting, with adequate time for examination and counselling.
Obtain informed consent; be aware of the regulations related to consent by and on behalf of minors in the country or state where you practice.
Use a professional interpreter (not family), if needed.
Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment (interpersonal or domestic violence, mental health, self-harm, suicide, forced marriage, risk of honor-based killing).
Use the opportunity to obtain a full health history (gynaecological, menstrual, sexual).
Query the woman about her definition of 'virginity', that is, penile-vaginal penetration, digital-vaginal penetration, penile-anal penetration, penile-oral penetration or other.
Ask about vulvar/vaginal/oral/anal/penile/object or digital sexual contact and assess the need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing. Women may engage in anal intercourse to avoid 'losing virginity'.
Use the opportunity to discuss sexual health issues such as contraception, STIs and sexuality.
Ask about the woman's knowledge about and expectation of bleeding at first intercourse, and dispel any misconception that if bleeding does not occur, the woman is not a 'virgin'.
Use the opportunity to counsel about respectful, consensual and safe relationships and inquire about sexual and gender identity.
Have a robust referral pathway if the patient needs a mental health evaluation or social services referral.
Use a chaperone to serve as an advocate during the examination.
If necessary, visually and gently inspect the external genitalia. Do not insert a speculum or fingers, unless medically necessary.
Describe only what you see (eg, 'normal external genitalia for age'), do not interpret. Never use the term 'virgin' or 'virginity' to describe physical exam findings.
Confirm, based on her history, her marital status, and sexual history. Note clinical observations, that is, normal external genital anatomy for her age, absence of tearing, abrasions, bruising. Do not mention the hymen, its morphology or analyse its appearance and structure.
Write a summary statement correlating her social status (unmarried) with her medical evaluation. Example summary statement: The patient denies a history of vaginal intercourse and examination reveals normal external genitalia consistent with history and age.
Arrange follow-up with the woman for a few days after the visit to ensure that she is safe, to assess further needs and to answer questions.

### Sexual history: its importance in averting detrimental misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis [^117X1EuB]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Two cases where the sexual history proved important in reaching the diagnosis are presented. Case 1 concerns a 37-year-old HIV positive homosexual man, who presented with symptoms of rectal pain associated with bleeding. He was unsuccessfully treated for Crohn disease. A subsequent review of his sexual history led to investigations for venereal infections. A final diagnosis of proctitis secondary to lymphogranuloma venereum was made. The patient was successfully treated with doxycycline and spared an unnecessary colectomy. Case 2 concerns a 22-year-old Caucasian woman under investigation for possible lymphoma. However, the doctor carrying out the biopsy experienced a needle stick injury and the ensuing investigations revealed the patient's HIV positive status and thus the explanation for her hitherto undiagnosed lymphadenopathy. A prior review of her sexual history could have hastened the diagnosis and prevented the need for invasive tests.

Best of five questions

Question 1

A 23-year-old man presented with an 8-week history of bloody diarrhoea, severe anorectal pain and low-grade pyrexia. On further questioning he also complained of malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. He admitted to unprotected receptive anal sexual intercourse with two male partners in the preceding 6 months. Perianal and rectal examination revealed two fluctuant, tender areas of induration adjacent to the anal verge suggestive of abscesses. An urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed inflamed, friable rectal mucosa with several large ulcers and spontaneous bleeding. Rectal swabs sent for NAAT and genotyping revealed the presence of C trachomatis genotype L1.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment regimen:
A — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days
B — Erythromycin 250 mg four times a day for 21 days
C — Olfloxacin 400 mg a day for 7 days
D — Erythromycin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days
E — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days

Question 2

A 32-year-old man presents with a 6-week history of diarrhoea, anorectal pain and maculopapular rash affecting the trunk, hands and feet. Two years previously he had been investigated for possible Crohn's disease after presenting with several perianal and anal verge ulcers. These had resolved spontaneously and no formal diagnosis had been made. On further questioning he admitted to a 4-week history of perianal swelling and several oral ulcers with a snail track distribution on inspection. Perianal inspection is demonstrated in figure 3.

### Postcoital vaginal rupture in a young woman with no prior pelvic surgery [^114mWshV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reports of postcoital vaginal rupture in the literature are limited to cases involving women who are postmenopausal, have recently undergone pelvic surgery, or have suffered genitourinary trauma.

Aim

We report a case of postcoital vaginal rupture in a 23-year-old woman with no prior surgical history who complained of acute onset, severe vaginal pain after consensual intercourse.

Results

Examination under anesthesia revealed a 6-cm laceration of the posterior fornix, which extended into the abdominal cavity. The laceration was repaired using a combined vaginal and laparoscopic approach.

Conclusions

Coitus-induced vaginal rupture in a reproductive aged woman with no prior pelvic surgery or other risk factors is a rare clinical presentation. Prior reports of rupture in premenopausal women have recommended repair via laparotomy. This case documents successful transvaginal and laparoscopic repair, and reviews the etiological mechanisms for coitus-induced injury.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115GfmCT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Episodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g. abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID. The recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for STIs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness.

More specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies indicating pelvic infection (e.g. tubal hyperemia); and laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis is the only sign of PID for certain women.

Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis:

Follow-Up

Women should demonstrate clinical improvement (e.g. defervescence; reduction in direct or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness) < 3 days after therapy initiation. If no clinical improvement has occurred < 72 hours after outpatient IM or oral therapy, then hospitalization, assessment of the antimicrobial regimen, and additional diagnostics, including consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses, are recommended. All women who have received a diagnosis of chlamydial or gonococcal PID should be retested 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex partners have been treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, these women should be retested whenever they next seek medical care < 12 months after treatment.

Management of Sex Partners

Persons who have had sexual contact with a partner with PID during the 60 days preceding symptom onset should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia and gonorrhea, regardless of the PID etiology or pathogens isolated. If the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated. Sex partners of persons who have PID caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. If linkage is delayed or unlikely, EPT is an alternative approach to treating sex partners who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated (i.e. until therapy is completed and symptoms have resolved, if originally present).

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111T7j1U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A physical examination should include an inspection of the vulvovaginal area to identify any visible signs such as lesions, excoriations, skin or tissue changes, or abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, or consistency. Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch. If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary. Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vulvovaginal pruritus, it is essential to consider a broad differential diagnosis, encompassing infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic causes. Given the overlapping presentations of these conditions, a systematic approach is necessary to narrow down the most likely etiology. Of note, if hormonal causes are suspected, referral to a gynecologist is warranted for further workup. If a psychogenic cause is suspected or a psychiatric condition is suspected to be an aggravating factor, psychiatric evaluation is warranted. A detailed discussion on these topics is beyond the scope of this review.

Formation of a differential is led by the timing, absence or presence of lesions, location, absence or presence of abnormal discharge, age, and other risk factors. Medical history, contacts, and other elements of history may increase clinical suspicion for causes of vaginal itch originating from certain domains.

### Women's sexual pain disorders [^114PNLoA]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Women's sexual pain disorders include dyspareunia and vaginismus and there is need for state-of-the-art information in this area.

Aim

To update the scientific evidence published in 2004, from the 2nd International Consultation on Sexual Medicine pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of women's sexual pain disorders.

Methods

An expert committee, invited from six countries by the 3rd International Consultation, was comprised of eight researchers and clinicians from biological and social science disciplines, for the purpose of reviewing and grading the scientific evidence on nosology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of women's sexual pain disorders.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. Results. A comprehensive assessment of medical, sexual, and psychosocial history is recommended for diagnosis and management. Indications for general and focused pelvic genital examination are identified. Evidence-based recommendations for assessment of women's sexual pain disorders are reviewed. An evidence-based approach to management of these disorders is provided.

Conclusions

Continued efforts are warranted to conduct research and scientific reporting on the optimal assessment and management of women's sexual pain disorders, including multidisciplinary approaches.

### Prevention of gynecologic contact bleeding and genital sandy patches by childhood anti-schistosomal treatment [^115GgSGQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2008). Low credibility.

Schistosoma haematobium infection may cause genital mucosal pathology in women with and without urinary schistosomiasis. This report seeks to explore the long-term effect of anti-schistosomal treatment on the clinical manifestations of S. haematobium infection in the lower genital tract. Prior treatment was reported by 248 (47%) of 527 women. Treatment received before the age of 20 years was significantly associated with the absence of sandy patches and contact bleeding, and this association was independent of current waterbody contact. Treatment in the past five years did not influence the prevalence of gynecologic schistosoma-induced lesions. The study indicates that early treatment may be more efficient for gynecologic morbidity control. Findings warrant an exploration into several chemotherapeutic agents administered at an early age, as well as in adults.

### Can the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease be excluded without a bimanual examination? [^115qcJE1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Now that urine-based tests are available for detection of Chlamydia and gonorrhea, we sought to determine whether history alone could be used to exclude pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and thus preclude a bimanual examination. The study design was a retrospective chart review. The study population included females aged 15–24 years diagnosed with PID. Outcome measures were documentation of screening symptoms (abdominal pain, dyspareunia, or abnormal vaginal bleeding) in the medical record. Our primary analysis was sensitivity of screening symptoms for identifying patients with PID. At least 1 of the 3 screening symptoms was reported by 93% of the PID group. If absence of all 3 screening symptoms were used as a screening instrument to exclude a bimanual examination, many women with lower genital tract symptoms could be evaluated noninvasively. However, this approach could result in delayed diagnosis of PID in a small number of patients. Before this strategy is adopted, a large prospective study is needed.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^111yv57r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should focus on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality. Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^114TwpuY]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Infertility history assessment — history elements include current conception attempts (length of time of unprotected intercourse, coital frequency, use of ovulation monitoring, partner status, and presence of sexual dysfunction) and prior fertility history; gynecologic history includes menstrual history (age at menarche; cycle length, duration, and amount of bleeding; intermenstrual bleeding; dysmenorrhea; molimina) and general gynecologic history (cervical screening history, contraceptive use including type and duration, sexually transmitted infections and/or pelvic inflammatory disease, dyspareunia or chronic pelvic pain, and history of abnormal cervical screening). Obstetrical history records total number of pregnancies and outcomes, including biochemical miscarriage, clinical miscarriage, pregnancy of unknown location, terminations, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and live birth, plus whether conception was with current versus prior partner(s), details of any fertility treatment, obstetrical complications (gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, preterm delivery, placental disease, intrauterine growth restriction), and congenital disease or birth defects in offspring. Medical history covers past medical and surgical history — medical disorders with particular attention to endocrine, autoimmune, genetic, psychiatric, or malignant disorders; endocrine history "should include evaluation of the thyroid, and the presence of galactorrhea and hirsutism" — as well as prior hospitalizations, surgical procedures, and medications and allergies (use of gonadotoxic medications or radiotherapy, current medications including supplements, and drug allergies with reaction type). Additional considerations specify that "Patient may incorrectly identify attempts at pregnancy as only conscientious efforts for conception, rather than periods of active sexual activity without contraception", that "Coital frequency may change over time", and to "assess whether patient has been successful in detecting ovulatory surges" if using urine LH kits and to "discuss its limitations in accurately predicting the fertile window" when using a fertility tracking app. For menstrual history, "If menses onset < 8 years of age or > 14 years of age, was evaluation performed and were menses ever achieved spontaneously?" and "If menstrual interval < 21 days or > 35 days or there is a significant variation in range, perform a review of systems including: Thyroid symptoms, Hirsutism, Visual field defects, Galactorrhea, Stressors, Dietary and exercise habits, Vasomotor symptoms". Also ask, "If abnormal menstrual bleeding, were any investigations performed and was a diagnosis made?" and "Have any surgical cervical excision procedures been performed?"; "If outcome other than live birth, inquire about related evaluations"; and "If diagnosed with an endocrine disease, what is the status of the disease, including medications and last hormonal testing?".

Early (dating) ultrasound — The Work Group advises a first-trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date and to confirm the presence of cardiac activity; for pregnant patients who present after the first trimester, we advise performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably before 22 weeks. The estimated due date is initially established by calculating 280 days from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, but only about 50% of patients accurately recall the date of the last menstrual period and menstrual cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, supporting ultrasound confirmation. Beyond dating, early ultrasound indications include evaluation of vaginal bleeding, confirmation of an intrauterine location, presence and chronicity of multiple gestations, presence of uterine anomalies, or presence of other pelvic pathology, and patients with complaints of bleeding or pain should be referred for immediate ultrasound on presentation.

### Prevalence, burden and treatment effects of vaginal bleeding in women with (suspected) congenital platelet disorders throughout life: a cross-sectional study [^116LzHg7]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Bleeding tendency and HMB

Our self‐developed questionnaire to investigate the impact of bleeding tendency on sexuality was returned by 75 women in the analysis group. Some women did not complete one or more questions related to themes that were either not applicable for them or they felt uncomfortable to talk about. Missing data were removed from the analysis. This explains the changing denominator throughout this section. Sexuality and bleeding tendency were discussed during outpatient evaluations in 21% of the consultations: this topic was initiated by doctors in 5% (four of 75) and by women themselves in 16% (12/75) of the study population. Discussing this topic would be appreciated by 21% (16/75) of women, whereas 41% (31/75) were unsure about this and 37% (43/75) were not interested. Menstruations negatively impacted sexual activity in 59% (41/69) of women: 32 women reported this was due to long or heavy menstruations, eight expressed feelings of insecurity and some women indicated feeling unclean. Two women described that intercourse caused heavy bleeding. Four women (15%, 4/27) used tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding during intercourse.

Due to the bleeding tendency, sexual activity was marginally disrupted in 33% (22/67), while 6% (four of 67) reported to be severely restricted in sexual activity. One woman reported that sexual intercourse was impossible considering her bleeding tendency. HMB (25%, 17/67), fatigue (15%, 10/67), pain (10%, seven of 67) and postcoital bleeding (6%, four of 67), were reported as main reasons for restricted sexual activity.

During menstruation, 22% (15/69) of women reported to have sexual intercourse, in which additional protection against blood loss in the form of towels was used by 53% (eight of 15). Blood loss other than menstrual bleeding during sexual intercourse was experienced occasionally in 21% (15/71) of the women, while 3% (two of 71) to 4% (three of 71) of women experienced this frequently to always, respectively.

### Clinical review: prepubertal bleeding [^1118Cx4U]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prepubertal bleeding is a common presentation in the pediatric office and can be distressing for patients and families. A comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management allows clinicians to identify patients at risk for worrisome pathology and arrange timely care.

Objective

We aimed to review the key features of clinical history, physical exam, and diagnostic workup of a child presenting with prepubertal bleeding. We reviewed potential pathologies requiring urgent investigations and management, such as precocious puberty and malignancy, as well as more common etiologies, including foreign bodies and vulvovaginitis.

Conclusion

Clinicians should approach each patient with the goal of excluding diagnoses that require urgent interventions. A thoughtful clinical history and physical exam can inform appropriate investigations to optimize patient care.

### Vaginal bleeding in pre-pubertal females [^1142aP5p]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Puberty is a normal process for adolescents, and the first signs may include change in body odor, breast development, or pubic hair growth. This is then followed by menarche approximately 2 years later. Vaginal bleeding in pre-pubertal female individuals is rare. The aim of this study was to investigate causes of pre-pubertal bleeding in a group of patients.

Design, Setting, Method, and Main Outcome Measures

Seventeen patients who presented with pre-pubertal recurrent vaginal bleeding with no other signs of precocious puberty were investigated, to determine the cause of this symptom.

Results

The mean age for the onset of vaginal bleeding was 7.4 years, ranging from 4 to 9.67 years. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation tests showed a pre-pubertal response in all cases. Pelvic ultrasound scans showed a pre-pubertal uterus in all patients. Two patients were found to have foreign bodies identified during a genital examination under anesthetic, and in both cases removal of the foreign bodies terminated the vaginal bleeding.

Conclusion

In conclusion, recurrent vaginal bleeding was not associated with GnRH response, raised estradiol levels, or abnormal pelvic ultrasound findings. In cases of recurrent vaginal bleeding with normal hormonal investigations in pre-pubertal girls, it is recommended that a genital examination under anesthetic be undertaken to rule out undiagnosed causes of the presenting symptom.

### Female reproductive health after childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers: guidelines for the assessment and management of female reproductive complications [^111NrKfb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

Female cancer survivors — sexual function assessment should be performed annually in adults at risk and include targeted symptom review, medication review, and use of validated tools. Sexual functioning should be assessed annually in adult survivors at risk of sexual dysfunction and should include genital sensation level, dyspareunia, vulvar pain, postcoital bleeding, and difficulty with tampon insertion. Current medications should be listed to identify any that may affect sexual function. Domains of sexual functioning, such as desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain, should be assessed to rule out sexual dysfunction. Standardized questionnaires (eg, the Female Sexual Function Index and Brief Index of Sexual Functioning–Women) can be helpful. Providers should initiate discussions, because patients may be too embarrassed or believe there is no treatment. Sexual evaluation can be complex in survivors who have never had so-called normal sexual function or whose understanding of normal female anatomy and sexual function is limited.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) comprehensive history and gynecologic evaluation — A complete past medical, surgical, obstetric, social, and family history should be documented, as the history may reveal risk factors for POP such as obesity, advancing age, vaginal parity, hysterectomy status, conditions that chronically increase intra-abdominal pressure, and family history of pelvic floor disorders. Gynecologic history is particularly important, especially if removal of the uterus and/or adnexa is being considered. If cervical screening is not current, cervical cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus testing should be performed according to current guidelines. History of adnexal and uterine masses should be elicited, and, if indicated, additional imaging should be obtained. A history of abnormal or postmenopausal uterine bleeding should prompt an appropriate gynecologic evaluation before surgical management of POP can be considered. Previous treatments for prolapse should be noted, including when they occurred, and if a graft was used, and operative reports of previous surgery for prolapse and/or incontinence are useful to help direct management and should be actively sought out, reviewed, and documented.

Purpose Of Review

The ongoing Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa is a major global health challenge. The main mode of transmission is through contact with bodily fluids and skin of those infected or who have died. This review was undertaken to consider the evidence for transmission by contact with bodily fluids occurring through sexual activity.

Recent Findings

No cases in the previous 20 outbreaks or the current outbreak in West Africa have been shown to be sexually transmitted, although other types of viral haemorrhagic fever have had sexual transmission implicated. Ebola virus is found in sites and fluids associated with sexual activity but this occurs at different stages of the disease. Persistence in the convalescent period occurs in rectum, vagina and semen, with persistence in semen being longest of up to at least 101 days. Recommendations based on this data are that those recovering from Ebola virus disease should abstain from all sexual intercourse, or if this is not possible, use condoms, for 3 months after the onset of symptoms.

Summary

There is theoretical plausibility for sexual transmission of Ebola virus but there has been no evidence of this occurring. Further research is needed to consider if sexual activity contributes to the epidemic in order to inform individuals with regard to avoiding acquisition or transmission by those recovering from Ebola virus disease.

Case Presentation

A 47-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for an episode of hemoptysis. She coughed out small amount of clotted blood the morning of admission. She had no other symptoms on further review. Her medical history was unremarkable with the exception of an upper respiratory tract infection 9 months previously. She did not have any significant medical history or recent sick contacts. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and the mother of three teenaged children. She had irregular menses for the past 2 years, and her last menstrual period was 3 months ago. She reliably reported not engaging in any sexual contact for the past 2 years.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^1175FnBY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

4 SYSTEM 1

4.1 Normal and abnormal uterine bleeding definitions and terminology

FIGO System 1 was developed to formalize the nomenclature and definitions of normal and abnormal menstrual bleeding, allowing clinicians, investigators, and patients to align on the description of the bleeding patterns of those complaining of AUB (Figure 1). Each element is considered in the context of a structured history and defines normal and, therefore, abnormal features generally based on the fifth to 95th percentiles from large‐scale clinical studies. System 1 was the product of a rigorous Delphi process that was used to develop simple and translatable definitions while identifying and removing the need for obsolete terminologies such as menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

FIGURE 1
FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 1, defining the nomenclature and definition of AUB (30). *The normal range is age dependent, with shortest to longest days for 18–25 years at ≤ 9 days, 26–41 years at ≤ 7 days, and 42–45 years at ≤ 9 days.

As seen in Figure 1, application of FIGO System 1 in a clinical scenario requires a structured history that allows a description of the four parameters of frequency, duration, regularity, and subjective flow volume, as well as the presence or absence of IMB and unscheduled bleeding for those on progestin‐based gonadal steroid formulations. Of course, cyclical administration of estrogen and progestin‐containing agents, typically for contraception, is expected to result in cyclical withdrawal bleeding from the endometrium. All the metrics are based on the previous 6 months, provided there has been no pregnancy or puerperium.

Frequency

The number of days in an average menstrual cycle from the first day of bleeding in one cycle to the first day of the next cycle. The normal length of a menstrual cycle ranges from 24 to 38 days, whereas abnormal frequency of menstruation is less than 24 days (frequent menses) or more than 38 days (infrequent menses). The absence of menstrual bleeding, without an iatrogenic cause, should be characterized as amenorrhea, as this too is abnormal.

Duration

The number of consecutive bleeding days in each cycle, where the count begins with the onset of bleeding and ends on the last day of blood flow, including the light bleeding, often called spotting. It is normal for women to bleed for up to eight consecutive days, whereas longer than this would be considered prolonged and abnormal.

The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the first visit to the obstetrician-gynecologist take place between the ages of 13 and 15 years. This visits will provide health guidance, screening, and preventive health care services and provide an excellent opportunity for the obstetrician-gynecologist to start a physician-patient relationship. This visit generally does not include an internal pelvic examination.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^115vDNrf]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods — reproductive tract conditions: Irregular vaginal bleeding is Delay for both symptoms-based and calendar-based methods, and because this makes FAB methods unreliable, barrier methods should be recommended until the bleeding pattern is compatible with proper method use, with evaluation and treatment as necessary. Vaginal discharge is Delay for symptoms-based and Accept for calendar-based methods, and because it makes recognition of cervical secretions difficult, the condition should be evaluated and treated if needed before providing methods based on cervical secretions.

### Genital complaints at the extremes of age [^117GQ2Nc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Variations in estrogen levels across a woman's lifetime lead to important changes in genital physiology and pathophysiology. Low estrogen states like menopause and the prepubertal period share important physiologic changes, including more friable, dry, and inelastic mucosa that is prone to irritation, injury, and infection. These and other factors lead to unique gynecologic pathologic conditions encountered at the extremes of age. Age-specific pathologic conditions and differences in examination techniques are discussed.

### Executive summary of the lower anogenital tract cancer evidence review conference [^113sBaCL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Techniques for Evaluation

We found no studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of any lower genital tract evaluation tool in patients with symptoms. The most commonly used tools found in our search were pelvic examination, rectal examination, digital anorectal examination, cytology, vaginal or vulvar colposcopy, or high-resolution anoscopy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pelvic examination when indicated by medical history or symptoms. Symptoms may include, but are not limited to, abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, or vaginal bulge. Detection of vulvar cancers or precancers is limited to visual assessment and confirmation by histopathology. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends performing biopsy for visible lesions when
Lesions are atypical (eg, new pigmentation, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated)
Concern for malignancy exists
Lesions are in a patient who is immunocompromised (including those living with HIV)
The diagnosis is uncertain
Lesions do not respond to standard therapy
The disease worsens during therapy

ASCCP colposcopy standards — procedural decisions and adjunct use: Less than half of respondents routinely performed colposcopy in the face of a mucopurulent discharge (48%), whereas more would proceed in the presence of vaginitis (68%) or after a recently treated gonorrhea or chlamydia infection (74%). Twenty-four percent would decline to perform colposcopy in the event of any vaginal bleeding, increasing to 84% in the presence of heavy bleeding. Use of adjunctive technologies was uncommon, with only 8% indicating that they sometimes or frequently use a colposcopy adjunct.
