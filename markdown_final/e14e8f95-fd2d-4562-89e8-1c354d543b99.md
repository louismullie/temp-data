## Question

male has low testosterone. recommendations?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recommendations for managing low testosterone in a male. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true biochemical hypogonadism with appropriate testing. Then, I should classify the etiology as organic versus functional. Next, I need to screen for contraindications before any therapy. After that, I should prioritize non-testosterone strategies for functional cases. If indicated, I will consider testosterone therapy with formulation and dosing targets. Then, I must outline monitoring and discontinuation criteria. Finally, I will account for special populations such as older men, obesity-related low testosterone, and men with prior prostate cancer.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis carefully, because a single low value is not enough and diurnal variation plus feeding can suppress levels; I should obtain a fasting early-morning total testosterone using a validated, harmonized assay and repeat it on a separate morning if low to ensure persistence, since up to one third of older men normalize on repeat testing [^111zq8AY] [^115LrmTB] [^1124R92x].

> I should also verify that symptoms are compatible and reasonably specific, because nonspecific complaints like fatigue or low mood are poor predictors; sexual symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections carry more diagnostic weight and should align with two unequivocally low morning testosterone values before labeling hypogonadism or proceeding toward therapy [^114XKuPY] [^114tZLyY] [^116QUpQv].

> Next, I need to check gonadotropins to classify primary versus secondary hypogonadism and decide on further work-up; measuring LH and FSH helps differentiate testicular failure from hypothalamic-pituitary causes, and if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is likely altered, I should calculate or measure free testosterone using an appropriate method while avoiding analog immunoassays, though I'll remember the ongoing debate and variability in free T methods as I interpret results [^112UQRiA] [^116yTpN9] [^114mNUJU].

> Now, let me consider etiology, because management diverges; functional hypogonadism from obesity, comorbid illness, sleep apnea, opioids, or depression is common and often reversible, whereas classic organic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon, and weight loss or comorbidity optimization can raise testosterone by roughly 10–30 percent and may resolve the syndrome in a meaningful fraction of men [^1132LYjC] [^113BAEvt] [^114tZLyY].

> Before discussing therapy, hold on, I should verify absolute and relative contraindications; do not initiate testosterone with active or untreated prostate or breast cancer, a PSA above 4 ng/mL, or above 3 ng/mL in high-risk men without urologic evaluation, palpable prostate nodule, recent myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months, uncontrolled heart failure, markedly elevated hematocrit, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, thrombophilia, or untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, and I should counsel that contemporary data do not show increased cardiovascular events with appropriate monitoring in higher-risk patients [^112uJAkp] [^111EwMYk] [^114KgtLi].

> For men with functional or age-related low testosterone, I need to ensure non-testosterone strategies come first; targeted weight loss, exercise, sleep apnea treatment, depression management, diabetes optimization, and first-line PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction often address symptoms and may normalize testosterone, and importantly, testosterone should not be started to improve weight, glycemic control, cardiometabolic status, cognition, or frailty in the absence of true hypogonadism [^114W9Cp4] [^113BAEvt] [^112SfWr7].

> If symptoms persist and testosterone remains unequivocally low despite optimization, I should confirm indications with shared decision-making; therapy is clearly indicated for organic hypogonadism, while in men with age-related low testosterone, benefits are mostly confined to modest sexual function improvements, so we should set expectations and individualize the decision, especially in men 55–69 with life expectancy over 10 years and after discussing prostate monitoring [^112XtTwV] [^111UcpoR] [^11618rAB].

> Wait, let me verify formulation and targets; transdermal gel is often preferred initially for functional hypogonadism due to flexible titration, although intramuscular options can be reasonable when cost is paramount with similar efficacy and safety, and dose adjustments should aim for a mid-normal total testosterone target roughly 15–30 nmol/L or 400–700 ng/dL to balance efficacy and safety [^11592cGr] [^111zXZFJ] [^111HqSMM].

> I should double-check monitoring plans because benefits and risks evolve over time; reassess symptoms and sexual function within 3–12 months and discontinue if there is no meaningful sexual benefit in age-related low testosterone, and monitor testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA at 3–12 months then periodically, with individualized prostate surveillance in line with guideline-based discussions [^114TwRZc] [^11618rAB] [^111SoYaH].

> But wait, what about older age and obesity-related low testosterone; in men 65 and older, I should avoid routine initiation and individualize decisions, and in obesity or diabetes with low SHBG, low total testosterone with normal free testosterone represents pseudohypogonadism and should not be treated with testosterone, reinforcing weight loss and comorbidity management instead [^114PXEUq] [^113oiG16] [^1138udww].

> Hold on, I should verify my earlier prostate threshold statement because I almost misstated it; the general PSA threshold is greater than 4 ng/mL, but it is greater than 3 ng/mL for high-risk men such as African American patients or those with a first-degree relative with prostate cancer, and in carefully selected men with treated low-risk prostate cancer, testosterone may be considered after at least one year with undetectable PSA, normal DRE, and no evidence of disease, under urologic guidance [^112uJAkp] [^115frEKF] [^114WLcGt].

> In summary, I need to ensure two fasting early-morning low total testosterone results with aligned symptoms, classify the cause with LH/FSH and free testosterone when appropriate, rule out contraindications, prioritize lifestyle and disease optimization for functional cases, and only then consider testosterone with shared decision-making, careful selection of formulation and mid-normal targets, and vigilant reassessment with a low threshold to discontinue if benefits do not materialize as expected [^111zq8AY] [^1132LYjC] [^114TwRZc].

In men with low testosterone, **confirm the diagnosis with two separate fasting morning total testosterone measurements**, and measure LH/FSH to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism [^1124R92x] [^112UQRiA]. Address reversible causes (obesity, sleep apnea, medications) and implement lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise, reduced alcohol) [^113BAEvt] [^114W9Cp4]. Reserve testosterone therapy for **symptomatic men with confirmed low levels**, after discussing risks and benefits, and avoid TRT in men with prostate/breast cancer, severe cardiovascular disease, or elevated hematocrit [^111EwMYk] [^112uJAkp]. Monitor hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone at regular intervals, and discontinue TRT if no symptom improvement occurs [^114TwRZc] [^11618rAB].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and evaluation

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Measure fasting morning total testosterone on two separate days; confirm if < 300 ng/dL (10.41 nmol/L) [^1124R92x] [^1126QHXo].

- **Differentiate etiology**: Measure LH and FSH to distinguish primary (testicular) from secondary (pituitary/hypothalamic) hypogonadism [^112UQRiA].

- **Free testosterone**: Assess when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^114mNUJU].

- **Additional tests**: Evaluate prolactin, iron studies, and consider pituitary imaging if secondary hypogonadism is suspected.

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes can **increase testosterone by 10–30%** and may normalize levels in some men [^113BAEvt].

- **Weight loss**: Aim for BMI < 25 kg/m² through caloric restriction and regular exercise [^113BAEvt].

- **Exercise**: Engage in resistance and aerobic training to improve testosterone and overall health.

- **Alcohol**: Limit intake, as excess alcohol lowers testosterone.

- **Sleep**: Treat obstructive sleep apnea and ensure adequate sleep.

---

## Medical management

### Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)

TRT is indicated for **symptomatic men with confirmed low testosterone** after shared decision-making.

- **Indications**: Symptomatic hypogonadism with confirmed low testosterone [^112XtTwV].

- **Contraindications**: Prostate/breast cancer, severe cardiovascular disease, elevated hematocrit, severe LUTS, untreated sleep apnea [^111EwMYk] [^112uJAkp].

- **Formulations**: Intramuscular injections, transdermal gels/patches, subcutaneous pellets; choose based on patient preference and cost [^111zXZFJ] [^112VWYRz].

- **Monitoring**: Check hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone at 3–6 months, then annually; discontinue if no symptom improvement [^114TwRZc].

---

### Alternative pharmacologic options

Alternative pharmacologic options include **Clomiphene citrate** for secondary hypogonadism, especially if fertility is desired, and **Aromatase inhibitors** for select cases with elevated estradiol.

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education and counseling should cover potential **benefits** (sexual function, mood, bone density) and **risks** (erythrocytosis, prostate effects, cardiovascular concerns) [^112XtTwV]. Because TRT can suppress spermatogenesis, discuss fertility goals and consider alternatives if fertility is desired. Emphasize adherence to therapy and regular monitoring.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

For follow-up, **regular monitoring** includes hematocrit, PSA, and testosterone levels at 3–6 months, then annually. Discontinue if ineffective: stop TRT if no **symptom improvement within 12 months** [^114TwRZc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Confirm diagnosis | Two separate fasting morning testosterone measurements; LH/FSH assessment |
| Lifestyle modifications | Weight loss, exercise, limit alcohol, treat sleep apnea |
| TRT indications | Symptomatic hypogonadism with confirmed low testosterone |

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114W9Cp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The decision to treat medical conditions always involves an analysis of the benefits and risks; this analysis is particularly important in the decision to initiate testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years. Although testosterone replacement for men with organic hypogonadism is uncontroversial irrespective of age, men ≥ 50 years old with nonspecific symptoms, reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations, normal serum gonadotropins, and no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease often experience improved health and well-being. They may also achieve normalization of serum testosterone concentrations with weight optimization, management of comorbidities, and the cessation or reduction of medications affecting the HPT axis.

- **Therapies other than testosterone**: For symptoms and signs that might be attributed to hypogonadism, consider treatments such as PDE5-inhibitors for erectile dysfunction; treatment for sleep apnea, depression, obesity, and diabetes mellitus with proven therapies; and medications that reduce fracture risks in osteoporosis.

It is reasonable to add testosterone treatment for men ≥ 50 years with persistent hypogonadism symptoms and reproducibly low serum testosterone (measured fasted in the morning when the individual is at baseline health) alongside normal serum gonadotropin concentrations. This is particularly the case if lifestyle measures over 6–12 months aimed to reduce weight (if BMI > 25 kg/m²) and to optimize the management of comorbidities do not suffice. This decision must be individualized and is not algorithmic; there should be no contraindications.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BAEvt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Thus, in addition to providing general health benefits, there is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30% that might normalize testosterone concentrations in our patient and might improve many of his symptoms that overlap with hypogonadism. However, the data stem mostly from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions, and these studies had small numbers of participants that were typically younger (30–50 years of age), relatively short follow-up (< 1–2 years), and variable methodologies in the assessment of serum testosterone concentrations. Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful in normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older, frailer men. The degree to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for the improvement seen with androgen deficiency-like features (e.g. erectile function, physical performance) is not certain. Whether concomitant testosterone treatment improves the efficacy of lifestyle interventions requires further study, but preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the single most important intervention for our patient and many older men with a high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration might be lifestyle changes (increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet) to reduce weight.

### Clinical practice update on testosterone therapy for male hypogonadism: Contrasting perspectives to optimize care [^111WJUkJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The US Endocrine Society (ES) published a clinical practice guideline on testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism, while the Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) released a position statement on the management of male hypogonadism. Both emphasize the importance of diagnosing men who are androgen deficient due to organic (classical or pathological) hypogonadism arising from disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or testes, highlighting that these individuals assuredly benefit from testosterone therapy.

Both organizations recognize that men with an intact gonadal axis may exhibit low testosterone concentrations, particularly older men or those with obesity and other medical comorbidities.

- **ES guidelines classify symptomatic men as having organic or functional hypogonadism**: ES provides an option for testosterone therapy as a shared decision between clinicians and individual patients.

- **ESA does not recommend testosterone therapy for these men**: The ESA emphasizes different criteria for therapy initiation.

- **Guidance on testosterone levels**: ES offers a reference range for total testosterone based on young men, while ESA cites age-standardized reference ranges. ES recommends using free testosterone, in addition to total testosterone, to identify men with hypogonadism in conditions where sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is altered or when total testosterone levels are borderline. Conversely, ESA recommends confirmatory biochemical testing with total testosterone, particularly noting that levels may be lower than expected if SHBG concentrations are low.

Both ES and ESA stress the importance of identifying pre-existing prostate and cardiovascular diseases before initiating testosterone therapy, with ES providing specific recommendations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency: Recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM 2015) [^115ZjqfJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD), also known as hypogonadism, is a condition affecting a substantial proportion of men as they age. The diagnosis and management of TD can be challenging, and clinicians should be aware of the literature on this condition.

- **Aim**: To review the available literature concerning the diagnosis and management of TD and to provide clinically relevant recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM) meeting.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database for English-language original and review articles published or e-published up to January 2016.

- **Main outcome measures**: Levels of evidence (LoEs) and grades of recommendations are provided based on a thorough analysis of the literature and committee consensus.

- **Results**: Recommendations were given for 12 categories of TD: definition, clinical diagnosis, routine measurement, screening questionnaires, laboratory diagnosis, threshold levels for the biochemical diagnosis of TD, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, fertility, testosterone (T) formulations, alternatives to T therapy, and adverse events and monitoring. A total of 42 recommendations were made: of these, 16 were unchanged from the Third ICSM, and 26 new recommendations were made during this Fourth ICSM. Most of these recommendations were supported by LoEs 2 and 3. Several key new recommendations include the following: the clinical manifestations of TD occur as a result of decreased serum androgen concentrations or activity, regardless of whether there is an ident.

- **Fracture risk reduction**: In patients with high fracture risk.
- **Exercise capacity/physical function improvement**: In frail patients.
- **Anti-aging therapy**: In patients over 65 years old.
- **Depressive symptoms improvement**.
- **Cognitive function improvement**.

### Clinical practice patterns in the assessment and management of low testosterone in men: An international survey of endocrinologists [^113J5ADX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

To document practices in the approach to low testosterone in older men, we hypothesized that there would be a wide variability in clinical practice patterns given that recommendations are based on low-level evidence.

- **Design**: Members of all major endocrine as well as andrological societies were invited to participate in a web-based survey. This survey focused on the diagnostic work-up and management of a hypothetical index case involving a 61-year-old overweight man. This man presented with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, but without evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPT) axis disease.

- **Results**: Nine hundred and forty-three respondents (91.2% adult endocrinologists) from northern America (63.7%), Europe (12.7%), Oceania (8.2%), Latin America and the Caribbean (7.6%), and the Middle East, Asia, or Africa (7.8%) completed the survey. Response rates among participating societies ranged from 4.1 to 20.0%. There was wide variability in clinical practice patterns, especially regarding the biochemical diagnosis of androgen deficiency, exclusion of HPT axis pathology, and monitoring for prostate cancer. In a man with suggestive symptoms, 42.4% of participants would offer testosterone treatment below a serum total testosterone of 10.4 nmol/L (300 ng/dL). A total of 46.0% of participants were, over the last five years, 'less inclined' to prescribe testosterone to men with nonspecific symptoms and borderline testosterone levels, compared to 'no change' (29.3%) or 'more inclined' (24.7%) [P < 0.001].

- **Conclusions**: This large-scale international survey reveals a wide variability in the management of low testosterone in men across different regions and clinical practice patterns.

### International recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy: A consensus-based approach [^113VjzFS]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Gonadal insufficiency is an important consideration in managing patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).

- **Screening for gonadal insufficiency**: Boys and men should not be routinely screened for gonadal insufficiency. If symptoms manifest, such as delayed progression to puberty in boys (testicular volume < 4 mL and/or no signs of puberty by age 14 years), gonadal insufficiency should be evaluated with biochemical testing, including early morning testosterone, LH, and FSH measurements. Abnormal hormone levels indicating gonadal insufficiency have been described in boys and men with ALD; however, the clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear. For instance, erectile dysfunction may reflect primary gonadal insufficiency or can be caused by spinal cord disease. Testing for gonadotrophins and testosterone in the early morning is recommended only if there are symptoms present.

- **Treatment of gonadal insufficiency**: Treatment should be restricted to endocrinologists. Transdermal testosterone or long-acting testosterone ester injections can be utilized if testosterone levels are below normal and symptoms are present.

In terms of dietary therapy, the efficacy of Lorenzo's oil as a disease-modifying treatment in patients with ALD remains insufficiently supported. Lorenzo's oil, which comprises oleic acid (C18:1) and erucic acid (C22:1), in combination with a low-fat diet, can reduce plasma C26:0 levels to near-normal values in most patients; however, controlled clinical trials demonstrating improved outcomes are lacking.

Additional management recommendations emphasize that all patients who are diagnosed with ALD should receive comprehensive care based on current standards and guidelines.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (i.e. 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above, and these experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with the assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism are needed. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases).

### Management of testosterone therapy in adolescents and young men with hypogonadism: Are we following adult clinical practice guidelines [^112XPNjf]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a common disorder associated with low bone density, poor muscle mass, anemia, and sexual dysfunction. The Endocrine Society recently published a Clinical Practice Guideline for testosterone therapy in androgen-deficient men. Because treatment is frequently initiated in adolescence, the goal of this quality improvement initiative was to assess whether pediatric endocrinologists at a large tertiary care center follow these guidelines and to identify opportunities for improvement.

- **Design**: We performed a retrospective chart review at Boston Children's Hospital. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥ 16 years, diagnosis of hypogonadism, and testosterone replacement therapy. Data were collected about age, age at treatment initiation, diagnoses, pre- and on-treatment testosterone levels, route of testosterone administration and dose, bone density, hematocrit levels, and adherence with therapy.

- **Results**: Fifty-nine patients were included. Fourteen (24%) were prescribed lower testosterone doses than those recommended in the Clinical Practice Guideline. Seven (12%) had no pre-treatment testosterone levels, and 10 (17%) had no on-treatment levels. In 49 patients with on-treatment testosterone levels, 36 had at least one value that was lower than the adult reference range. Ten (28%) of the 36 men with low testosterone levels had no dose adjustments. Thirty-seven (63%) of the 59 patients had no dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, and 18 (31%) did not have hematocrit levels.

Pediatric endocrinologists in this review require further adherence to guidelines to improve patient outcomes systematically.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Gaps in patient knowledge about risks and benefits of testosterone replacement therapy [^116SXzHE]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess patient knowledge of the symptoms of testosterone deficiency and the benefits and risks associated with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT).

- **Methods**: An anonymous, 10-question multiple-choice survey was administered to consecutive patients presenting for urologic evaluation at an academic medical center, from December 2015 to April 2016. The survey included questions about perceived symptoms of testosterone deficiency, perceived benefits and risks associated with TRT, whether respondents had a diagnosis of testosterone deficiency, and whether they were interested in receiving TRT.

- **Results**: The survey response rate was 88% (97/110). The median age group was 41–50 years. Although 43% of all respondents reported an interest in TRT, only half of them had a clinical diagnosis of hypogonadism. The most commonly reported symptoms of low testosterone were "low energy" (54%), "decreased libido" (51%), "weak erections" (52%), and "decreased strength" (42%). Of the perceived benefits of TRT, the most commonly reported were "improved sexual function" (54%), "increased energy" (53%), and "feeling better" (51%). Half of the respondents were unsure of the risks of TRT. Of the respondents, 16%, 10%, and 8% acknowledged the association between TRT and heart attack, TRT and stroke, and TRT and blood clots, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: There is disproportionate knowledge about the benefits versus the risks associated with TRT among patients. Although 43% of the respondents were interested in receiving TRT, half of the respondents were unsure of the associated risks.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^114WLcGt]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

For medical management of male hypogonadism, particularly regarding testosterone therapy, the EAU 2025 guidelines offer specific recommendations. Testosterone replacement therapy should be restricted to patients with a history of prostate cancer who have a low risk for recurrence. This is characterized by a preoperative PSA level of less than 10 ng/mL, a Gleason score below 7, and a clinical stage of cT1–2a. Treatment initiation is advised after at least one year of follow-up, ensuring a PSA level of less than 0.01 ng/mL.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism) and can be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns.

Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests; evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids in the determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months. Long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by evidence; however, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

### British society for sexual medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^116AjNSy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD) is an increasingly common problem with significant health implications, but its diagnosis and management can be challenging.

- **Aim**: To review the available literature on TD and provide evidence-based statements for UK clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Evidence was derived from Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, testosterone (T) therapy, and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015. Further searches continued until May 2017.

- **Outcomes**: To provide a guideline on diagnosing and managing TD, with levels of evidence and grades of recommendation, based on a critical review of the literature and consensus of the British Society of Sexual Medicine panel.

- **Results**: Twenty-five statements are provided, relating to five key areas: screening, diagnosis, initiating T therapy, benefits and risks of T therapy, and follow-up. Seven statements are supported by level 1, eight by level 2, five by level 3, and five by level 4 evidence.

- **Clinical implications**: To help guide UK practitioners on effectively diagnosing and managing primary and age-related TD.

- **Strengths and limitations**: A large amount of literature was carefully sourced and reviewed, presenting the best evidence available at the time. However, some statements provided are based on poor-quality evidence. This is a rapidly evolving area of research, and recommendations are subject to change. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients; rather, they help to focus decisions, considering personal values, preferences, and individual circumstances.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

This patient might have had a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after approximately 6 months. Sense of well-being and sexual function are complex and depend upon multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the HPT axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men. The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism, after attempts to treat reversible causes, are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less.

An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by restoration of normal HPT axis function by weight loss. With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit for an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115QEYwb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported an improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit increased by 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. He had lost another 4.3 kg (and now weighs 93.0 kg) with diet and exercise, resulting in a total loss of 6.3 kg (approximately 6% of body weight since his initial evaluation). At 12 months of follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L) and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after discontinuation of testosterone therapy. He enquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label such that women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification, or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus position statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This position statement was developed, by consensus between the participating organizations, to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance as to which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically in relation to testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend measuring total testosterone concentrations on two separate mornings in a fasting state. This is because testosterone concentrations exhibit significant diurnal and day-to-day variations and may be suppressed by food intake or glucose.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The evaluation of a man with low serum testosterone should begin with determining his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap between the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Due to this patient's report of depressed mood and fatigue, he was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool, which screened negative for major depression. Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific to hypogonadism is crucial in the evaluation.

In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were consistently associated with low serum testosterone in a syndromic manner, with diminished libido having the highest odds ratio for low serum testosterone concentration. It is important to note that this epidemiological study cannot establish causality. Since reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations might reflect reverse causation. Notably, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with normal serum testosterone. This patient's symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and possess low diagnostic value, as they may be caused by systemic disease. However, the constellation of symptoms including sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone suggests a need for further evaluation.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^116p4z6a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Testosterone therapy increases serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations in hypogonadal men to that of age-matched controls. Although there is no evidence that testosterone treatment increases the risk of de novo prostate cancer, clinical trials have not had enough participants or a long enough follow-up to be conclusive. Testosterone stimulates metastatic and high-grade prostate cancer, but it is not known whether testosterone treatment stimulates the growth of pre-existing subclinical lower-grade prostate cancer. Testosterone treatment has not been shown to have a significant effect on lower urinary tract symptoms; however, clinical trials have generally excluded men with severe benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Testosterone should generally not be prescribed for men with prostate cancer, with possible exceptions in carefully selected men such as those with a history of treated low-risk, Gleason 4 ng/mL. Follow-up of prostate health during testosterone treatment should be individualized. An individualized prostate cancer screening should be offered with a nuanced discussion of the potential benefits, such as possible early detection of prostate cancer that might improve mortality and decrease the risk of metastatic disease. This should also consider the potential harm of increased prostate biopsies and prostate cancer therapies that may cause erectile dysfunction and incontinence and might not always improve longevity.

### Society for Endocrinology guidelines for testosterone replacement therapy in male hypogonadism [^116pqrx4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Male hypogonadism (MH) is a common endocrine disorder. However, uncertainties and variations exist in its diagnosis and management. There are several guidelines on testosterone replacement therapy predominantly driven by single disciplines. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with MH. This guideline has been compiled using expertise from endocrine (medical and nursing), primary care, clinical biochemistry, urology, and reproductive medicine practices. These guidelines also provide a patient perspective to help clinicians best manage MH.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be characterized as having classic hypogonadism (sometimes called organic hypogonadism) due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis, or they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism. Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function.

Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health is restored, eugonadal sick syndrome or nongonadal illness might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism. These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and not conflating functional with reversible; pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism are also potentially reversible (e.g. hyperprolactinemia, iron overload syndromes). Classic pathologic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon with an estimated lifetime prevalence of < 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men.

### Efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in men: An evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^113esc8W]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Testosterone treatment rates in adult men have increased in the United States over the past two decades.

- **Purpose**: To assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.

- **Data sources**: English-language searches of multiple electronic databases (January 1980 to May 2019) and reference lists from systematic reviews.

- **Study selection**: Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least six months' duration evaluated transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment and reported prespecified patient-centered outcomes. Additionally, 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels reported harms information.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction by a single investigator was confirmed by a second. Two investigators assessed the risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: Studies enrolled mostly older men who varied in age, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. Testosterone therapy improved sexual functioning and quality of life in men with low testosterone levels, although effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Testosterone therapy had little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk.

### Approach to the patient: Low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^114kbPD3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Free testosterone, whether measured or calculated using equilibrium binding or empirical equations, is advocated by some experts to appraise androgen status in certain circumstances. However, such recommendations are based on observational data and received wisdom rather than objective evidence from controlled clinical testing and, therefore, in our opinion, add nothing useful to the clinical evaluation. The free testosterone hypothesis, which asserts that free testosterone is the most biologically active moiety of testosterone, is conceptually flawed. Unbound testosterone is equally accessible to sites of degradation as it is to target tissues, so there is no logical basis to claim it is more (rather than less) biologically active.

In addition, reference laboratory dialysis-based measurements of free testosterone are non-robust, costly, and rarely available. Most laboratories report calculations based on formulae incorporating serum testosterone and SHBG measurements. However, such calculations are consistently inaccurate relative to dialysis-based measurements due to assumptions, such as using SHBG mass as a substitute for SHBG binding capacity, the use of four different non-harmonized SHBG immunoassays, and the use of five different empirical estimates of testosterone-SHBG binding affinity. Furthermore, free testosterone is not a valid analytical variable as it lacks a certified reference standard, violating a fundamental principle of analytical chemistry requiring comparison of like with like. As a result, free testosterone lacks sufficient quality control.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114tZLyY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In the population-based European Male Ageing Study, the prevalence of the syndromic association of symptoms of hypogonadism plus low serum testosterone, without an identifiable classic HPT axis pathology, was determined in men aged 40 to 79 years. Symptoms of hypogonadism were defined as a constellation of low libido, decreased sexual function, and low serum testosterone. The overall prevalence of this syndrome of androgen-deficiency-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone was 2.1%, increasing from 0.6% in men 50 to 59 years of age to 5.1% in men 70 to 79 years. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) was associated with a 13-fold increased prevalence compared with normal weight. Likewise, the presence of ≥ 2 comorbidities was associated with a 9-fold increase in the prevalence of hypogonadism-associated sexual symptoms plus low serum testosterone. In the longitudinal follow-up, weight loss was associated with the resolution of this syndrome in a significant percentage of the men.

The management of older men with low serum testosterone concentrations is hampered by the fact that many clinical features of androgen deficiency are nonspecific and similar to those associated with obesity or comorbid diseases, conditions that are associated with low serum testosterone concentrations. In such men, the conundrum lies in determining the degree to which the (often nonspecific) clinical symptoms are predominantly due to hypogonadism or are instead due to obesity and other chronic systemic disorders that suppress the HPT axis (i.e. reverse causality). Of note, this assessment is complicated by these overlapping symptomatologies.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115LrmTB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 AM) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings of the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs. placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (e.g. specific clinical features such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing rather than overdiagnosing.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ksMPB]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Empirical pharmacological treatment for men with hypogonadism and/or idiopathic infertility has featured in the medical literature for more than five decades. However, evidence on effective and safe treatment strategies remains inconclusive. In contrast to previously published pairwise meta-analyses of observational and randomized evidence, our network meta-analysis showed limited efficacy for all evaluated treatment options over placebo. The decision to start such treatments depends on the underlying cause of infertility, patient characteristics, and overall treatment objectives.

Most of the included trials evaluated these treatments in men with idiopathic infertility. However, it is important to distinguish the perceived benefits among men with hypogonadism compared to those with normal testosterone levels. Specifically, men with a reduced testosterone/estradiol ratio may see more benefits associated with clomiphene and aromatase inhibitor therapy. Similarly, men with high BMI or advanced age may also demonstrate more benefit following SERMs/AIs therapy compared to those with no other predisposing factors.

The magnitude of benefit may also vary depending on the degree of semen abnormality. While most of the included trials in our review demonstrated some improvement in sperm concentration, the magnitude of changes was smaller among men with very low sperm counts. Due to limited reporting, we were unable to further explore the mechanistic effect of evaluated treatments on varied semen abnormalities, such as low versus very low sperm count.

### Characteristics of men undergoing testosterone replacement therapy and adherence to follow-up recommendations in metropolitan multicenter health care system [^111yWEbE]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

To identify the frequencies of treatment and recommended laboratory follow-up for men with low serum testosterone levels, the study queried the Electronic Data Warehouse. It focused on men aged 18–85 years who had serum total testosterone levels tested from 2009 to 2012. Researchers collected data on the frequency of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), patient demographics, and clinical characteristics. The frequency of follow-up with serum total testosterone and complete blood count levels was also documented.

Among 9,176 men tested for low testosterone levels, 3,320 (36%) were hypogonadal, with an average serum total testosterone level of 194.3 ± 64.9 ng/dL. Of these men, 17.7% received TRT. The treatment frequency increased significantly from 8.3% in 2009 to 24% in 2012. Additionally, 4.8% of men of reproductive age (18–35 years) were placed on TRT. Within 180 days of initial testing, only 40% of treated men received follow-up liver function tests and/or complete blood counts, and only 49% had a follow-up serum testosterone level.

Although the frequency of TRT is increasing, only a small percentage of hypogonadal men are actively undergoing treatment. A significant proportion of men of reproductive age are being treated, which has considerable implications for potential fertility. Less than half of the patients treated are being monitored appropriately after testosterone replacement, highlighting the need for further education for providers prescribing testosterone replacement.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116yTpN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend determining free testosterone concentrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations using total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin concentrations. This approach is suggested for patients with conditions altering SHBG, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroids, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, SHBG gene polymorphisms, older age, HIV, cirrhosis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, certain anticonvulsants, and estrogens. It is also recommended for patients with initial total testosterone concentrations at or near the lower limit of the normal range (200–400 ng/dL). Direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays should not be used.

### Testosterone replacement in men with sexual dysfunction [^111cn3Tq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men with sexual dysfunction and testosterone deficiency. However, TRT is commonly promoted in men without testosterone deficiency, and existing trials often do not clearly report participants' testosterone levels or testosterone-related symptoms. This review assesses the potential benefits and harms of TRT in men presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo or other medical treatments in men with sexual dysfunction.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status, up to 29 August 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in men (40 years or over) with sexual dysfunction. We excluded men with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We compared testosterone or testosterone with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5I) to placebo or PDE5I alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened the literature, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADE using a minimally contextualized approach. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to standard Cochrane methodology.

### Update in testosterone therapy for men [^114z4BLz]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a condition characterized by inadequate testicular production of sex steroids and sperms; however, the term is more commonly used to identify testosterone (T) deficiency. When fertility is not desired, T replacement therapy (TRT) is the gold standard.

- **Aim**: To review the pathogenesis of male hypogonadism and the available preparations for TRT, along with the main clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of published evidence was performed using Medline (1969 to September 2010). Data from a consecutive series of subjects attending our Andrology Unit were also provided to stress the clinical correlates of low T. Inventories available for detecting hypogonadism (including ANDROTEST) were overviewed.

- **Main outcome measures**: The most important studies regarding the pathogenesis of male hypogonadism and the preparations for its treatment were reviewed. To review TRT outcomes, only meta-analytic studies were considered.

- **Results**: The goals of TRT are to alleviate clinical symptoms and to restore serum T levels to the mid-normal range, without significant side effects or safety concerns. Different T formulations have been approved. TRT is associated with a reduction of fat mass, an increase of lean mass, and a possible positive effect on lipid profile and glycometabolic control. Bone density and depressive symptoms are improved by TRT, while effects on cardiovascular risk and frailty are more controversial. No increase in prostate cancer and prostate-related problems has been reported so far. TRT, alone or in combination with phosphodieste.

Although most clinical guidelines recommend the measurement of free testosterone in the evaluation for male hypogonadism, especially in men with suspected low serum sex hormone-binding globulin, there remains controversy about the underlying hypothesis that serum free testosterone is a significant contributor to androgen effects. Dr. Anawalt presents evidence to support the free testosterone hypothesis and advocates for the usefulness of accurate assessment of free testosterone in the evaluation of male hypogonadism. Dr. Handelsman argues that the evidence is unconvincing, the hypothesis is flawed and biologically invalid, and free testosterone cannot be accurately assessed in clinical practice.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This uncertainty is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men aged ≥ 50 years, particularly those with a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations.

Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms "male hypogonadism", "testosterone deficiency", "androgen deficiency", "functional hypogonadism", "late onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We will focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency (Fig. 1). Fertility will not be discussed.

Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following:

1. The prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50.
2. Most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old.
3. The diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differs from younger because:
	- Evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men.
	- Infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old.
	- Long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006. The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. **We suggest** the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. **We recommend** confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected, by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone levels using validated assays.

We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. **We recommend against** starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, or a prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1138udww]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected. A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone, except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations. The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (i.e. pseudohypogonadism) are obesity and T2D.

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. Additionally, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### Low free testosterone is associated with hypogonadal signs and symptoms in men with normal total testosterone [^114XFAuG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

During aging, total testosterone (TT) declines and SHBG increases, resulting in a greater decrease in calculated free T (cFT). Currently, guidelines suggest using TT to diagnose androgen deficiency and to reserve cFT only for men with borderline TT.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to investigate if either low cFT or low TT is more strongly associated with androgen-related clinical endpoints.

- **Methods**: A total of 3,334 community-dwelling men, aged 40–79 years, were included in this study. Differences in clinical variables between the referent group of men with both normal TT (≥ 10.5 nmol/liter) and normal cFT (≥ 220 pmol/liter) with those who had normal TT/low cFT, low TT/normal cFT, and low TT/low cFT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, center, body mass index, and comorbidities.

- **Results**: A total of 2,641 men had normal TT (18.4 ± 5.5 [mean ± SD] nmol/liter)/normal cFT (326 ± 74 pmol/liter), 277 men had normal TT (14.2 ± 3.7)/low cFT (194 ± 23), 96 men had low TT (9.6 ± 0.7)/normal cFT (247 ± 20), and 320 men had low TT (7.8 ± 2.5)/low cFT (160 ± 55). Men with normal TT/low cFT were older and in poorer health. They had higher SHBG and LH and reported more sexual and physical symptoms, whereas hemoglobin and bone ultrasound parameters were lower compared to the referent group. Men with low TT/normal cFT were younger and more obese. They had lower SHBG, but LH was normal, whereas features of androgen deficiency were lacking.

- **Conclusions**: Low cFT, even in the presence of normal TT, is associated with androgen deficiency-related symptoms.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^115TWE1i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The international panel concluded that the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of HSDD, with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses, and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

- **Participants**: The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Evidence**: The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. They employed consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and email communications. Drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's website for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test.
