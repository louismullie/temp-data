## Question

Pheochromocytoma diagnostic criteria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about establishing diagnostic criteria for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect PPGL and who to test. Then, I should verify the optimal biochemical tests and preanalytical conditions. Next, I will interpret results and handle borderline elevations. After that, I need to check imaging indications and modality selection. Then, I should confirm when to pursue genetic testing and counseling. Finally, I will review special scenarios, preoperative preparation, and long-term follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with major guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenarios that warrant biochemical testing for PPGL, because missing these is a common source of underdiagnosis and perioperative catastrophe. Testing is indicated for signs and symptoms of catecholamine excess, especially paroxysmal hypertension with headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis, or hypertension provoked by beta-blockers, MAO inhibitors, micturition, anesthesia, or surgery, and for adrenal incidentalomas, particularly when non-contrast CT attenuation is 10 Hounsfield units or higher or imaging features are not typical of a benign adenoma, as well as in patients with hereditary predisposition or syndromic features and in those with a prior history of PPGL or extra-adrenal malignancy with an indeterminate adrenal mass, even if metastasis is suspected, per ESMO/EURACAN, Endocrine Society, AAES, and CUA guidance [^116MV8ZN] [^111AXFyp] [^115ismee] [^113wHbAU] [^112GfhZt].

> Wait, let me verify the best initial biochemical test and the preanalytical conditions, because false positives are frequent and often preventable. Plasma free metanephrines measured by LC-MS/MS or electrochemical detection with the patient supine for at least 15 minutes and using supine reference intervals offers the highest sensitivity and excellent specificity when performed correctly, whereas urinary fractionated metanephrines are a close alternative but slightly less sensitive; urinary vanillylmandelic acid is no longer recommended due to poor sensitivity, and I should double-check that I am not inadvertently suggesting it as a screening test [^117RCsyJ] [^1149aZ5D] [^1157S6R6] [^112HyefK] [^1164qtEo].

> Hold on, I should verify how to interpret results and what thresholds to use, because overcalling mild elevations leads to unnecessary imaging and surgery. Marked elevations of plasma metanephrines or normetanephrine of roughly three times the upper limit of normal or higher are generally considered diagnostic and justify proceeding to imaging, whereas mild elevations between one and three times the upper limit require careful confirmation with repeat testing, review of medications and preanalytical factors, and often a clonidine suppression test to distinguish true from false positives, with modern data supporting age-adapted cutoffs to improve specificity without sacrificing sensitivity [^1152yL3h] [^114sashY] [^1154Az2m] [^116Ppq5d].

> I need to ensure I address medication and physiologic interferences before labeling a result abnormal. Tricyclic antidepressants, phenoxybenzamine, and other sympatholytics can artifactually elevate plasma normetanephrine, and advancing age independently increases normetanephrine levels, contributing to false positives; therefore, I should review the medication list, consider holding interfering agents when safe, and consider age-adjusted interpretation or confirmatory testing to mitigate false positives [^112VAuQg] [^113bRX7S] [^116aDev4].

> Next, I should review imaging indications and modality selection, and I must not jump to imaging before biochemical confirmation. Imaging is indicated only after biochemical evidence of PPGL is established, with CT of the abdomen and pelvis as the initial anatomic modality due to superior spatial resolution, while MRI is preferred for skull base and neck paragangliomas, in patients with contrast allergy, when radiation avoidance is desired such as in pregnancy or pediatrics, or when CT artifacts are problematic; functional imaging with 123I-MIBG or PET tracers is reserved for metastatic or multifocal disease, biochemically silent tumors, or when anatomic imaging fails to localize the tumor [^114jVRgb] [^113ViSX2] [^1136Q37C] [^112hWsuC] [^116vKZvC] [^112iAZV7].

> Let me consider the role of washout CT, because I initially thought washout characteristics might reliably exclude PPGL, but wait, I should double-check that assumption. A meaningful proportion of pheochromocytomas can meet adenoma washout criteria, so washout alone cannot exclude PPGL; instead, non-contrast attenuation greater than 10 Hounsfield units should heighten suspicion and prompt biochemical testing rather than reliance on washout percentages [^112RBrB7] [^112iAZV7].

> I should confirm when to pursue genetic testing and counseling, given the high heritability of PPGL. Universal genetic counseling and testing are recommended for all patients with PPGL, with targeted emphasis on SDHB in metastatic disease and SDHx in paragangliomas, and pre- and post-test counseling should be standard; in children at risk for hereditary PPGL, age-appropriate screening begins in late childhood or adolescence depending on the syndrome, and family cascade testing should follow when a pathogenic variant is identified [^111yR9cn] [^1118NorJ] [^115Jfwk3] [^115rUmaV] [^111uG61M].

> But wait, what if the patient has an adrenal mass in the setting of extra-adrenal malignancy or suspected metastasis; I need to ensure I do not assume metastasis without excluding PPGL. A substantial fraction of resected adrenal masses in patients with a history of cancer are pheochromocytomas, so biochemical exclusion with plasma or urinary metanephrines is mandatory before any invasive procedure, biopsy, or non-blocked surgery to avoid hypertensive crisis [^113W3r4L] [^114ahLVK] [^113WSmvs].

> I will now examine special scenarios that require tailored testing, because missing these nuances can delay diagnosis. In suspected dopaminergic paragangliomas, particularly head and neck tumors, measuring plasma or urinary 3-methoxytyramine improves detection; in pregnancy, MRI without gadolinium and urinary collections are preferred; in children, plasma free metanephrines are highly sensitive and radiation-sparing strategies are prioritized; and in patients with stress cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo syndrome, I should actively exclude pheochromocytoma as a trigger before finalizing the diagnosis [^1152yL3h] [^1136Q37C] [^113w9heP] [^116Skcy4] [^111jNnP2].

> Hold on, I should verify the preoperative preparation requirements, because failure to block can be catastrophic. Once PPGL is biochemically confirmed, alpha-adrenergic blockade for at least 7 days, volume expansion with a liberal salt and fluid intake, and close hemodynamic monitoring are standard to blunt intraoperative catecholamine surges and post-resection hypotension; selective alpha-1 blockers are acceptable, though nonselective phenoxybenzamine may offer more stable blockade at the cost of more postoperative hypotension, and beta-blockade should be added only after adequate alpha blockade to avoid unopposed alpha stimulation [^113FZXd4] [^112fx3bw].

> Next, I should review long-term follow-up, because recurrence or new tumors can occur years after resection. Annual lifelong biochemical surveillance with plasma or urinary metanephrines is recommended for all patients, with intensified imaging and functional studies in those with germline mutations, large tumors, extra-adrenal or multifocal disease, or elevated 3-methoxytyramine, and many authorities extend surveillance to lifetime follow-up for all patients given late recurrences and the possibility of metachronous disease [^117NcUt5] [^115TYfYu] [^1162NkEJ] [^111uDRz2].

> Let me reconsider the overall diagnostic algorithm to ensure internal consistency and alignment with guidelines. Suspect PPGL based on compatible symptoms, hypertension patterns, incidental adrenal findings, or hereditary risk; confirm with high-sensitivity biochemical testing using plasma free metanephrines under strict preanalytical conditions; interpret results using threefold thresholds and confirm borderline elevations with repeat testing and clonidine suppression; localize with CT or MRI only after biochemical confirmation; tailor functional imaging to metastatic or multifocal risk; pursue universal genetic counseling and testing; and prepare all biochemically proven cases with alpha blockade before any invasive intervention, followed by structured lifelong surveillance to detect recurrence or new disease [^111AXFyp] [^117RCsyJ] [^114jVRgb] [^111yR9cn] [^113FZXd4] [^117NcUt5].

The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma requires a **biochemical confirmation of catecholamine excess** using plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines, with plasma testing preferred for its higher sensitivity [^117RCsyJ] [^1164qtEo]. Imaging (CT/MRI) is used **only after biochemical confirmation** to localize the tumor [^114jVRgb] [^11724eYE]. Genetic testing is recommended for all patients given the high prevalence of hereditary forms [^111yR9cn] [^112nBbS9]. Key diagnostic criteria include:

- **Biochemical evidence**: Elevated plasma free metanephrines or urinary fractionated metanephrines (≥ 2–3× upper limit of normal) [^1152yL3h] [^113FZXd4].
- **Imaging**: Adrenal or extra-adrenal mass on CT/MRI, typically > 10 HU on non-contrast CT [^1143jrsx] [^112iAZV7].
- **Clinical context**: Paroxysmal hypertension, palpitations, headache, sweating, or adrenal incidentaloma [^111AXFyp] [^115usEYn].
- **Genetics**: Germline mutations in RET, VHL, SDHB, SDHD, or other PPGL susceptibility genes [^113w9heP] [^117RePvU].

False positives can occur; **repeat testing** or a **clonidine suppression test** is advised for borderline results [^114sashY] [^1154Az2m].

Conclusions

By available data, there is no single clinical finding that has significant value in diagnosis or excluding pheochromocytoma. Combination of certain symptoms, signs and para-clinical exams is more valuable for physicians. Further studies should be done, in order to specify the value of clinical findings –alone or in combination- in favor or against the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma more accurately, to help us distinguish patients who require more evaluation, from those who require no further testing. Until that time the process of diagnosis will be based on clinical suspicion and lab tests followed by related imaging.

### Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112fx3bw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate clinical practice guidelines for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL).

Participants

The Task Force included a chair selected by the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), seven experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force reviewed primary evidence and commissioned two additional systematic reviews.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, and Americal Association for Clinical Chemistry reviewed drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions

The Task Force recommends that initial biochemical testing for PPGLs should include measurements of plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines. Consideration should be given to preanalytical factors leading to false-positive or false-negative results. All positive results require follow-up. Computed tomography is suggested for initial imaging, but magnetic resonance is a better option in patients with metastatic disease or when radiation exposure must be limited. (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy is a useful imaging modality for metastatic PPGLs. We recommend consideration of genetic testing in all patients, with testing by accredited laboratories. Patients with paraganglioma should be tested for SDHx mutations, and those with metastatic disease for SDHB mutations. All patients with functional PPGLs should undergo preoperative blockade to prevent perioperative complications. Preparation should include a high-sodium diet and fluid intake to prevent postoperative hypotension. We recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy for most pheochromocytomas with open resection for most paragangliomas. Partial adrenalectomy is an option for selected patients. Lifelong follow-up is suggested to detect recurrent or metastatic disease. We suggest personalized management with evaluation and treatment by multidisciplinary teams with appropriate expertise to ensure favorable outcomes.

### Pheochromocytoma as a frequent false-positive in adrenal washout CT: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RBrB7]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the proportion of pheochromocytomas meeting the criteria for adenoma on adrenal washout CT and the diagnostic performance of adrenal washout CT for differentiating adenoma from pheochromocytoma.

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to 28 March 2017. We included studies that used adrenal washout CT for characterisation of pheochromocytomas. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Proportions were pooled using an inverse variance method for calculating weights (random-effects). Sensitivity and specificity were pooled using hierarchical logistic regression modelling and plotted in a hierarchical summary receiver-operating-characteristics (HSROC) plot.

Results

Ten studies (114 pheochromocytomas) were included. The pooled proportion of pheochromocytomas meeting the criteria for adenomas was 35% (95% CI 20–51). For eight studies providing information on diagnostic performance, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for differentiating adenoma from pheochromocytoma were 0.97 (95% CI 0.93–0.99) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.44–0.84), respectively. The area under the HSROC curve was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95–0.98).

Conclusions

There was a non-negligible proportion of pheochromocytomas meeting the criteria for adenoma on adrenal washout CT. Although overall diagnostic performance was excellent for differentiating adenoma from pheochromocytoma, specificity was relatively low.

Key Points

- Non-negligible proportion of pheochromocytomas can be mistaken for adenoma.
- Adrenal washout CT showed good sensitivity (97%) but relatively low specificity (67%).
- Findings other than washout percentage should be used when diagnosing pheochromocytomas.

### Biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma: which test is best? [^117RCsyJ]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma depends on biochemical evidence of catecholamine production by the tumor. However, the best test to establish the diagnosis has not been determined.

Objective

To determine the biochemical test or combination of tests that provides the best method for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter cohort study of patients tested for pheochromocytoma at 4 referral centers between 1994 and 2001. The analysis included 214 patients in whom the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed and 644 patients who were determined to not have the tumor.

Main Outcome Measures

Test sensitivity and specificity, receiver operating characteristic curves, and positive and negative predictive values at different pretest prevalences using plasma free metanephrines, plasma catecholamines, urinary catecholamines, urinary total and fractionated metanephrines, and urinary vanillylmandelic acid.

Results

Sensitivities of plasma free metanephrines (99% [95% confidence interval, 96%-100%]) and urinary fractionated metanephrines (97% [95% CI, 92%-99%]) were higher than those for plasma catecholamines (84% [95% CI, 78%-89%]), urinary catecholamines (86% [95% CI, 80%-91%]), urinary total metanephrines (77% [95% CI, 68%-85%]), and urinary vanillylmandelic acid (64% [95% CI, 55%-71%]). Specificity was highest for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (95% [95% CI, 93%-97%]) and urinary total metanephrines (93% [95% CI, 89%-97%]); intermediate for plasma free metanephrines (89% [95% CI, 87%-92%]), urinary catecholamines (88% [95% CI, 85%-91%]), and plasma catecholamines (81% [95% CI, 78%-84%]); and lowest for urinary fractionated metanephrines (69% [95% CI, 64%-72%]). Sensitivity and specificity values at different upper reference limits were highest for plasma free metanephrines using receiver operating characteristic curves. Combining different tests did not improve the diagnostic yield beyond that of a single test of plasma free metanephrines.

Conclusion

Plasma free metanephrines provide the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma and should be the test of first choice for diagnosis of the tumor.

Follow-Up

In general, every patient with any of the following criteria should undergo lifelong follow-up: germline mutation, history of PGL, age < 20 years at initial diagnosis, tumor size ≥ 5 cm, multiple or recurrent PPGLs, or noradrenergic/dopaminergic phenotype. It is common practice that several of these criteria apply to patients with cluster 1A SDHx -related PPGLs, which are associated with an extraordinarily high risk of recurrence, multiplicity, and metastatic disease. Accordingly, an expert consensus on follow-up of asymptomatic children and adults with cluster 1 SDHx mutations has most recently been published:

- Children with an initial diagnosis of SDHx mutation should undergo a clinical examination including measurements of blood pressure, biochemical testing for plasma free normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine (or urinary normetanephrine if the former is not available), and MRI (base of the skull to pelvis).
- After negative initial screening, a clinical follow-up and blood pressure measurement every year, biochemistry every 2 years, and an MRI (base of the skull to pelvis) every 2 to 3 years is recommended. In general, after initial screening, MRI can be performed without gadolinium enhancement, but preferably with diffusion-weighted imaging for maximal sensitivity.
- For adults, the same lifelong follow-up is suggested, apart from more frequent biochemistry every year (plasma is preferred over urine, including plasma measurements of of normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine and no consensus for chromogranin A). Additionally, initial screening should include functional imaging (PET/CT), but there is no consensus on alternating MRI and PET/CT during follow-up in adulthood (Table 4).

Abstract

Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas are unique in their highly variable molecular landscape driven by genetic alterations, either germline or somatic. These mutations translate into different clusters with distinct tumor locations, biochemical/metabolomic features, tumor cell characteristics (eg, receptors, transporters), and disease course. Such tumor heterogeneity calls for different imaging strategies in order to provide proper diagnosis and follow-up. This also warrants selection of the most appropriate and locally available imaging modalities tailored to an individual patient based on consideration of many relevant factors including age, (anticipated) tumor location(s), size, and multifocality, underlying genotype, biochemical phenotype, chance of metastases, as well as the patient's personal preference and treatment goals. Anatomical imaging using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and functional imaging using positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography are currently a cornerstone in the evaluation of patients with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas. In modern nuclear medicine practice, a multitude of radionuclides with relevance to diagnostic work-up and treatment planning (theranostics) is available, including radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine, fluorodeoxyglucose, fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine, and somatostatin analogues. This review amalgamates up-to-date imaging guidelines, expert opinions, and recent discoveries. Based on the rich toolbox for anatomical and functional imaging that is currently available, we aim to define a customized approach in patients with (suspected) pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas from a practical clinical perspective. We provide imaging algorithms for different starting points for initial diagnostic work-up and course of the disease, including adrenal incidentaloma, established biochemical diagnosis, postsurgical follow-up, tumor screening in pathogenic variant carriers, staging and restaging of metastatic disease, theranostics, and response monitoring.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part I): clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and pathophysiology [^11793prG]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
International Takotsubo Diagnostic Criteria (InterTAK Diagnostic Criteria)

(i) Pheochromocytoma is a neuroendocrine tumour derived from enterochromaffin cells of the adrenal gland that may lead to a 'catecholamine storm' with LV dysfunction, ECG abnormalities, and increased biomarkers as well as hypercontraction of sarcomeres and contraction band necrosis indistinguishable from TTS.

Notwithstanding, most of the diagnostic criteria have excluded pheochromocytoma as a specific cause of TTS. The Japanese criteria emphasize that pheochromocytoma is a TTS-like myocardial dysfunction. Pheochromocytoma is also included as a secondary cause of TTS in the diagnostic criteria of the HFA of the ESC.

(ii) Concomitant CAD is reported with a prevalence ranging from 10–29%. In this regard, patients with TTS and obstructive CAD are often misdiagnosed as classical ACS and differentiation can be challenging. Therefore, the presence of CAD should not be considered as an exclusion criterion as acknowledged by the modified Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria. In such patients, the wall motion abnormalities usually extend beyond the territory of the involved coronary artery. Furthermore, TTS may co-exist with ACSand it has been reported that ACS itself may trigger TTS.

(iii) There are rare cases in which the regional wall motion abnormality corresponds to the distribution of a single coronary artery. This holds true for the focal TTS type mostly involving an anterolateral segment. Therefore, the criteria should not exclude cases in which the wall motion abnormalities are restricted to the distribution of a single coronary artery. In this situation, a clear differentiation of TTS, ACS, or myocarditis requires cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating myocardial oedema rather than late gadolinium enhancement in case of TTS.

The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Gland Tumors focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), adrenal tumors, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia. NETs are generally subclassified by site of origin, stage, and histologic characteristics. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of NETs often involves collaboration between specialists in multiple disciplines, using specific biochemical, radiologic, and surgical methods. Specialists include pathologists, endocrinologists, radiologists (including nuclear medicine specialists), and medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists. These guidelines discuss the diagnosis and management of both sporadic and hereditary neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors and are intended to assist with clinical decision-making. This article is focused on the 2021 NCCN Guidelines principles of genetic risk assessment and counseling and recommendations for well-differentiated grade 3 NETs, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, adrenal tumors, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas.

### Low sensitivity of glucagon provocative testing for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma [^1139cSmr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Pheochromocytomas can usually be confirmed or excluded using currently available biochemical tests of catecholamine excess. Follow-up tests are, nevertheless, often required to distinguish false-positive from true-positive results. The glucagon stimulation test represents one such test; its diagnostic utility is, however, unclear.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic power of the glucagon test to exclude or confirm pheochromocytoma.

Design, Setting, and Subjects

Glucagon stimulation tests were carried out at three specialist referral centers in 64 patients with pheochromocytoma, 38 patients in whom the tumor was excluded, and in a reference group of 36 healthy volunteers.

Main Outcome Measures

Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine were measured before and after glucagon administration. Several absolute and relative test criteria were used for calculating diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Expression of the glucagon receptor was examined in pheochromocytoma tumor tissue from a subset of patients.

Results

Larger than 3-fold increases in plasma norepinephrine after glucagon strongly predicted the presence of a pheochromocytoma (100% specificity and positive predictive value). However, irrespective of the various criteria examined, glucagon-provoked increases in plasma catecholamines revealed the presence of the tumor in less than 50% of affected patients. Diagnostic sensitivity was particularly low in patients with pheochromocytomas due to von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Tumors from these patients showed no significant expression of the glucagon receptor.

Conclusion

The glucagon stimulation test offers insufficient diagnostic sensitivity for reliable exclusion or confirmation of pheochromocytoma. Because of this and the risk of hypertensive complications, the test should be abandoned in routine clinical practice.

### Isolated adrenal mass in patients with a history of cancer: remember pheochromocytoma [^113W3r4L]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In a patient with a history of cancer, an isolated adrenal mass is usually thought to be a metastasis. Although a biochemical work-up to rule out pheochromocytoma is recommended, some question its practicality. This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of functional adrenal lesions in patients with a history of cancer and examine predictive factors for the type of lesion.

Methods

At a single institution, 33 patients with an isolated adrenal mass and a history of cancer underwent surgical treatment. Patients' records were retrospectively analyzed for type of adrenal lesion and other diagnostic parameters.

Results

There were 20 males and 13 females with a mean age of 58 ± 2 years. Of these, 20 (61%) had adrenal metastases, 8 (24%) had pheochromocytomas, and 5 (15%) had adrenal adenomas. Usual diagnostic criteria, including presenting symptoms, primary tumor, and other demographic characteristics, did not consistently predict the pathology of the lesion.

Conclusions

Nearly 1 in 4 resected adrenal masses in patients with a history of cancer were pheochromocytomas. The high incidence of pheochromocytoma in this series supports a thorough work-up, irrespective of previous cancer. Therefore, remember one thing in patients with an isolated adrenal mass and a history of cancer: pheochromocytoma.

Biochemical Diagnosis

Biochemical screening for PPGL is indicated in (1) patients with signs and symptoms or cardiovascular events, highly suggestive of acute spells (sometimes called attacks or storms) of catecholamine excess; (2) during follow-up of previous PPGL; (3) patients with the presence of germline pathogenic variants in one of the PPGL susceptibility genes or in those with a family history of PPGL; (4) Patients with syndromic presentations associated with PPGLs; (5) patients with an adrenal incidentaloma. For many years, most PPGLs were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion, while only less than 10% patients were diagnosed based on the findings of an adrenal incidentaloma on various imaging. However, in the recent 2 decades, the latter proportion has increased to 30% and even 61% due to more frequent utilization of cross-sectional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Besides when incidentaloma is the starting point for the diagnosis, imaging usually follows as a next step after an established biochemical diagnosis of PPGL. The exception is biochemically negative PPGLs that occasionally can be detected by elevated chromogranin A. However, it has a low specificity due to interference of drugs, various diseases, and other tumors. Plasma or slightly less optimal 24-hour urinary metanephrines, measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, form the cornerstone for the biochemical diagnosis. By measuring plasma-free metanephrines and 3-methoxytyramine (if available), a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 94%, respectively, can be reached provided that proper preanalytic conditions for blood sampling are applied. Plasma metanephrines (normetanephrine or metanephrine), or methoxytyramine 2 or more times the upper reference limit or increases in 2 or more of all 3 metabolites suggest a high likelihood of a PPGL and patients are usually eligible to proceed to imaging studies. Adrenergic tumors are defined by an elevated plasma metanephrine of > 0.31 nmol/L and by an increase in plasma metanephrine of > 5% of the total increments in plasma normetanephrine and metanephrine beyond their upper reference limits. Tumors that do not satisfy these criteria are defined as noradrenergic or dopaminergic, the latter depending on the presence of a relative increase in methoxytyramine of > 5% of the total increments in plasma normetanephrine, metanephrine, and methoxytyramine beyond their upper reference limits. In most patients, it will however be immediately clear from the actual plasma levels of metanephrines and methoxytyramine whether it is an adrenergic, noradrenergic, or dopaminergic tumor. This applies in particular when 1 metabolite is predominantly elevated and the others only slightly or not at all. In these latter patients, this calculation is redundant. However, in some patients with light to moderate elevations in 2 or 3 catecholamine metabolites, it may not be immediately clear what is the biochemical phenotype and in such patients this calculation might be helpful.

### Ordering pattern and performance of biochemical tests for diagnosing pheochromocytoma between 2000 and 2008 [^111HMvU2]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine what tests are ordered by physicians for pheochromocytoma diagnosis and how those tests perform in modern clinical practice.

Methods

In this case series, electronic medical records of patients seen between January 2000 and July 2008 at a large academic hospital in Los Angeles, California, were queried, and patients older than 15 years who underwent any 1 of 5 tests for pheochromocytoma (measurement of plasma catecholamines, plasma fractionated metanephrines, urinary catecholamines, urinary metanephrines, or urinary vanillylmandelic acid) were identified. Because testing was performed in various reference laboratories, test results were classified into 1 of 3 categories: (a) markedly elevated, (b) moderately elevated, or (c) normal. Patient demographics, clinical history, test results, imaging study findings, and pathology records were reviewed.

Results

A total of 3980 tests were ordered for 1898 patients. Pretest probability was 2.2% (based on 681 patients in whom pheochromocytoma was confirmed or excluded), and hypertension was the most common indication for testing. The number of patients tested and the number of tests ordered increased over the years. The ordering pattern stabilized since 2006 when urinary metanephrines, urinary catecholamines, and plasma metanephrines were ordered more frequently. Sensitivity was highest for urinary metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid, specificity was highest for vanillylmandelic acid and urinary catecholamines, and positive likelihood ratio was highest for vanillylmandelic acid. Positive predictive value for markedly elevated test results was 39% to 83%, while that for moderately elevated test results was only 2% to 14%.

Conclusions

Ordering pattern and test performance differ significantly from those recommended and reported by large centers. The best testing strategy should incorporate local experience. Categorizing test results as markedly elevated, moderately elevated, and normal is important for result interpretation.

### Genetic testing referral rates for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma in an academic tertiary centre [^111h2siE]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) are neuroendocrine tumours arising from the adrenal medulla or extra‐adrenal paraganglia, respectively. Pathogenic germline variants are increasingly recognized as drivers in the development of PPGL. Many clinical criteria have been used to guide risk assessment of underlying genetic predispositions, including age of diagnosis, family history, and tumour characteristics. When we risk stratify patients using clinical criteria, individuals with either extra‐adrenal location, age of diagnosis before 45 years, multifocal tumours, and/or positive family history have the highest likelihood of having a germline mutation. However, genetic screening of large cohorts have consistently demonstrated that individuals lacking this clinical phenotype harbour a high prevalence of germline mutations in known susceptibility genes. Routine genetic testing with expanded gene panels has demonstrated that for patients with PPGL, 30%–40% can have a heritable mutation.

Given that many individuals with PPGL — even those with sporadic presentations — may have an underlying genetic predisposition, societal guidelines and consensus statements have offered recommendations for referring individuals for genetic counselling and germline testing. In 2014, the Endocrine Society published clinical practice guidelines recommending consideration for genetic testing in all patients with PPGL, weighing the individual financial costs and risks against the pretest probability. More contemporary guidelines, including those from the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS), have recommend universal genetic counselling and testing in all patients with PPGL.

The rationale for universal screening is multifactorial. First, the presence of a germline mutation is associated with higher risks of disease recurrence and metastatic disease compared to patients with sporadic disease. Second, early recognition of pathogenic mutations may influence surgical decision‐making in terms of extent of resection, providing an opportunity to improve clinical management and long‐term outcomes. Finally, mutation detection offers valuable information for guiding testing of at‐risk family members. Despite a relatively high prevalence of patients with germline predisposition syndromes and guidelines for universal genetic counselling, there remains considerable variability in the implementation of genetic testing in clinical practice. Several factors, both provider‐ and patient‐related, influence the decision for genetic testing, including provider awareness and decision‐making, access to genetic counsellors, and financial barriers.

Catecholamines and Metanephrines

While pheochromocytomas are less commonly present as adrenal incidentalomas (1.5–14.0%), there is a growing appreciation that these tumors may manifest in a clinically occult fashion, so-called 'silent pheos'. While the 2016 European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) guidelines recommended testing to exclude pheochromocytoma in all patients with adrenal incidentalomas, the updated 2023 guidelines recommend testing only in patients with adrenal lesions with imaging features not typical of a benign adenoma. Initial screening consists of measurement of plasma-free metanephrines, which have the highest sensitivity for diagnosis. Due to high rates of false positive testing, elevations of two to three times the upper limit of normal are typically used to establish a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Indeterminate levels may require further evaluation with plasma catecholamines or 24-h urine metanephrines and catecholamines. Dopamine testing is typically reserved for patients with head and neck paragangliomas, while vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) testing is no longer routinely performed for patients with adrenal lesions.

Aldosterone

The primary clinical manifestation of hyperaldosteronism is hypertension. Up to 50% of patients also present with concomitant hypokalemia due to the effect of aldosterone on the sodium-potassium co-transporter. Biochemical evaluation includes a basic metabolic panel, plasma aldosterone concentration, and plasma renin activity. An aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) of > 20 (ng/dL)/(ng/mL/h) is frequently used for diagnosis.

It is important to note that conventional ARR thresholds likely underestimate the prevalence of renin-independent aldosterone production. The commonly used diagnostic threshold of ARR > 30 (ng/dL)/(ng/mL/h) has a low sensitivity for diagnosis of biochemically overt primary aldosteronism (by oral sodium suppression test) in patients across all blood pressure levels (22.2–50.0%), suggesting significant underdiagnosis of primary aldosteronism. While ARR is considered the standard screening test, these data suggest that liberal use of saline suppression testing might have higher sensitivity for case detection. Current guidelines recommend confirmatory testing for indeterminate cases. Adrenal vein sampling is considered standard of care for subtype differentiation.

### Recent advances in genetics, diagnosis, localization, and treatment of pheochromocytoma [^114EG1Lo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare but important tumor of chromaffin cells that is frequently considered in the evaluation of hypertension, arrhythmias, or panic disorder and in the follow-up of patients with particular genetic diseases. This report provides an update about the genetics, neurochemical diagnosis, localization by imaging, and surgical management of pheochromocytoma. Specific mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause familial predisposition to pheochromocytoma in multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, and mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene cause familial disposition to pheochromocytoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease. Recent findings demonstrating extraordinarily high sensitivity of plasma levels of metanephrines for detecting pheochromocytoma have led to an algorithm for clinical diagnostic steps. Nuclear imaging approaches, such as(123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and 6-[(18) F]fluorodopamine positron emission tomography, enhance both diagnosis and localization of the tumor, as described in an algorithm for patients with positive biochemical test results. Since pheochromocytoma is often benign, surgical resection by laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be curative. Areas requiring further work include determining appropriate follow-up of patients with familial pheochromocytoma, elucidating the bases for phenotypic differences, improving both specificity and sensitivity of biochemical tests, optimizing cost-effectiveness of diagnostic imaging, and testing the risk for tumor recurrence after partial adrenalectomy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma in an academic hospital from 1997 to 2007 [^115y2PQV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma pose a challenge to physicians. Several trends in the presentation, diagnosis, and surgical treatment of pheochromocytoma have emerged in the last 10 years. The diagnostic accuracy and consequences of misdiagnosis of pheochromocytoma are not well known. We aimed to systemically study the diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes of pheochromocytoma and to reveal the causes and consequences of misdiagnosis (including both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis).

Methods

We reviewed the electronic and paper charts of 49 patients who underwent adrenalectomy or adrenal biopsy with either preoperative or pathologic diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in a large academic hospital from 1997 to 2007. Three groups of patients (overdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed, and underdiagnosed) were compared on clinical courses, biochemical tests, imaging studies, and surgical outcomes.

Results

Pheochromocytoma was overdiagnosed in 9 patients, correctly diagnosed in 30 patients, and underdiagnosed in 10 patients. The overdiagnosis rate was 23% (9/39), and the underdiagnosis rate was 25% (10/40). The 3 distinct groups of patients exhibited significant differences in clinical presentation, biochemical tests, and imaging characteristics. The most common causes of overdiagnosis were misinterpretation of borderline biochemical test results and overzealous imaging. Overdiagnosis subjected patients to unnecessary adrenalectomy and its complications. The most common cause of underdiagnosis was failure to consider and test for pheochromocytoma. Underdiagnosis resulted in dangerous adrenal biopsy or adrenalectomy with hypertensive crisis and nearly doubled the length of stay in hospital. Surgical resection of correctly diagnosed pheochromocytoma was largely effective and safe, but intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred in some patients.

Conclusion

We conclude that misdiagnosis of pheochromocytoma is not uncommon and causes serious adverse effects. Correct interpretation of biochemical tests and imaging is crucial to a correct diagnosis, and pheochromocytoma should always be included in the differential diagnosis of any adrenal mass. Our data suggest that physician education is needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116Skcy4]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy — clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and prognosis — typically mimics acute ST-segment–elevation MI while coronary artery disease is usually absent; a usual scenario is that of an older woman with chest pain after psychological or physical stress, and ST-segment elevation can involve precordial, inferior, or lateral leads and can occur in 46% to 100% of patients. Right ventricle (RV) involvement can occur in 30% of patients, and diagnostic criteria for apical ballooning syndrome include: transient hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis of left ventricle (LV) midsegments (with or without apical involvement) with regional wall motion abnormalities beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution and a stressful trigger often but not always present; no obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture; new electrocardiographic abnormalities (ST-segment elevation or T-wave inversion) or modest elevation in cardiac troponin; and no pheochromocytoma or myocarditis. Prognosis is generally favorable, but in-hospital mortality has been reported to be as high as 4.5%, LV dysfunction usually resolves within 6–13 days, and congestive heart failure (HF) has been reported in up to 20% of patients; several cases have been associated with pheochromocytoma, and evaluation of pheochromocytoma should be considered in patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy, with the absence of pheochromocytoma usually required for the diagnosis of transient LV apical ballooning syndrome.

### Biochemical assessment of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^116Ppq5d]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) require prompt consideration and efficient diagnosis and treatment to minimize associated morbidity and mortality. Once considered, appropriate biochemical testing is key to diagnosis. Advances in understanding catecholamine metabolism have clarified why measurements of the O-methylated catecholamine metabolites rather than the catecholamines themselves are important for effective diagnosis. These metabolites, normetanephrine and metanephrine, produced respectively from norepinephrine and epinephrine, can be measured in plasma or urine, with choice according to available methods or presentation of patients. For patients with signs and symptoms of catecholamine excess, either test will invariably establish the diagnosis, whereas the plasma test provides higher sensitivity than urinary metanephrines for patients screened due to an incidentaloma or genetic predisposition, particularly for small tumors or in patients with an asymptomatic presentation. Additional measurements of plasma methoxytyramine can be important for some tumors, such as paragangliomas, and for surveillance of patients at risk of metastatic disease. Avoidance of false-positive test results is best achieved by plasma measurements with appropriate reference intervals and preanalytical precautions, including sampling blood in the fully supine position. Follow-up of positive results, including optimization of preanalytics for repeat tests or whether to proceed directly to anatomic imaging or confirmatory clonidine tests, depends on the test results, which can also suggest likely size, adrenal vs extra-adrenal location, underlying biology, or even metastatic involvement of a suspected tumor. Modern biochemical testing now makes diagnosis of PPGL relatively simple. Integration of artificial intelligence into the process should make it possible to fine-tune these advances.

### 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy for the detection of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma: results of a meta-analysis [^111gtAGE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

(123)I-mIBG scintigraphy has been in clinical use for more than 20 yr for diagnostic assessment of patients with neural crest and neuroendocrine tumors. Prospective validation of the performance characteristics of this method has recently been published.

Objective

A meta-analysis was performed to obtain best estimates of performance characteristics of (123)I-mIBG imaging for the two most common applications, evaluation of patients with neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma.

Data Sources

Articles published between 1980 and 2007 were identified from searches of multiple computer databases, including MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, and SciSearch.

Study Selection

Primary inclusion criteria were: acceptable reference standard(s) for confirming subjects with disease (histopathology and/or a combination of imaging and catecholamine results); reference standards applied to all subjects who received (123)I-mIBG; and data on a minimum of 16 patients confirmed to have or not have the disease(s) under consideration. Two physician reviewers independently evaluated all articles against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Twenty-two of 100 articles reviewed were included in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

The two reviewers extracted the data from eligible articles using a standardized form, capturing both study quality and efficacy information. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Sensitivity of (123)I-mIBG scans for detection of neuroblastoma was 97% [95% confidence interval (CI), 95 to 99%]; data were insufficient to estimate specificity. For pheochromocytoma, with application of the random-effects model, sensitivity and specificity were 94% (95% CI, 91–97%) and 92% (95% CI, 87–98%), respectively.

Conclusion

Based upon the literature, (123)I-mIBG scintigraphy has sensitivity and specificity greater than 90% for detection of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma.

### Approach to the patient with an adrenal incidentaloma [^116MN5Bv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Unsuspected adrenal masses, or incidentalomas, are increasingly found with the widespread use of thoracic and abdominal imaging. These masses may be hormonally active or nonfunctional and malignant or benign. Clinicians must determine the nature of the mass to decide what treatment, if any, is needed. Measurement of precontrast Hounsfield units (HU) and contrast washout on computed tomography scan provide useful diagnostic information. All patients should undergo biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma, either with plasma or urinary catecholamine measurements. This is particularly important before surgical resection, which is routinely recommended for masses larger than 4 cm in diameter without a clear-cut diagnosis and for others with hormonal secretion or ominous imaging characteristics. Hypertensive patients should undergo biochemical testing for hyperaldosteronism. Patients with features consistent with Cushing's syndrome, such as glucose intolerance, weight gain, and unexplained osteopenia, should be evaluated for cortisol excess. Here, the dexamethasone suppression test and late-night salivary cortisol may be preferred over measurement of urine cortisol. The ability of surgical resection to reverse features of mild hypercortisolism is not well established. For masses that appear to be benign (< 10 HU; washout, > 50%), small (< 3 cm), and completely nonfunctioning, imaging and biochemical reevaluation (pheochromocytoma and hypercortisolism only) at 1–2 yr (or more) is appropriate. For more indeterminate lesions, repeat evaluation for growth after 3–12 months is useful, with subsequent testing intervals based on the rate of growth.

VHL clinical diagnosis criteria based on RHs and family history: The clinical diagnosis of VHL disease is made using criteria based on family history and cardinal manifestations such as RH, central nervous system hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma and neuro-endocrine tumors, and clear cell renal carcinoma; relevant to ophthalmic evaluation, diagnosis of one or more RHs in the setting of a family history of VHL disease, or two or more RH even in the absence of a family history of VHL disease is sufficient for the clinical diagnosis of the condition, although ophthalmologists often face diagnostic uncertainty in cases where a solitary RH is present without a family history, where a RH exists alongside additional lesions that are missed or difficult to differentiate, or where an at-risk individual with a family history does not manifest RHs and has not had full evaluation for extraocular manifestations or genetic testing.

### Pheochromocytomas most commonly present as adrenal incidentalomas: a large tertiary center experience [^114LUxfT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors originating from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla that produce excess catecholamines. Unrecognized pheochromocytomas are associated with high mortality, most commonly from cardiovascular disorders. Historically, up to 50% of cases of pheochromocytoma were detected post mortem. With an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of these tumors, the diagnosis has been suspected in patients with clinical features related to catecholamine excess, typically paroxysmal and/or uncontrolled hypertension and adrenergic symptoms including anxiety, dizziness, as well as the classic triad of headaches, profuse sweating, and palpitations. However, these manifestations are highly nonspecific and can mimic a plethora of other disorders. Therefore, it is recognized that the most challenging facet of pheochromocytoma detection is to seriously consider it in the differential diagnosis.

In the last two decades, the list of germline mutation syndromes associated with an increased risk of hereditary pheochromocytoma has expanded. Familial genetic testing is strongly recommended in patients with pheochromocytoma, and surveillance for the development of pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PPGL) is undertaken in affected family members. This has led to the preemptive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in asymptomatic cases discovered on testing of genetically predisposed individuals.

More recently, with the advent of modern imaging modalities and increased access to cross-sectional imaging, incidental adrenal masses are increasingly detected. The proportion of pheochromocytomas in adrenal incidentalomas is relatively small, around 7%. Nevertheless, to avoid the adverse clinical consequences of a missed diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, it is recommended that all patients with adrenal incidentalomas be tested for catecholamine excess by measuring plasma or urinary metanephrines (MNs).

Considering the evolution in the presentation of pheochromocytoma, we aimed to assess the proportion and clinical, biochemical, radiological, genetic, histopathological, and follow-up characteristics of incidental pheochromocytomas in a large UK tertiary care center.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^113bRX7S]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia, which can secrete excessive catecholamines. Signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma may include hypertension, pain (including headache, flank pain, abdominal pain, or chest pain), hyperhidrosis, anxiety or panic attacks, cardiac arrythmias, or sudden death. A pheochromocytoma may also be detected as an asymptomatic incidental adrenal mass seen on abdominal imaging. Metabolites of norepinephrine and epinephrine, specifically normetanephrine and metanephrine, may be measured in the plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, as described by Lenders et al. Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines has been called "the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma" and some investigators have recommended that such measurements "should be the test of first choice". In a recent systematic review of the world literature, we have observed that measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements have a high sensitivity ranging of 96 to100% and a variable specificity ranging from 82% to 100%. The specificity of fractionated plasma metanephrines in excluding pheochromocytoma appears lowest in populations without known genetic predisposition to disease (those in whom sporadic disease is sought), with a false positive rate of up to 18% in such patients. We have previously observed that the normetanephrine fraction is elevated in the majority of false positive test results and that false positives are associated with increasing age. Indeed, investigators from the National Institute of Health have agreed that, "measurements of plasma normetanephrine and metanephrine provide a highly sensitive test for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, but false positive results remain a problem". False positive biochemical test results may result in needless imaging procedures and generate excessive healthcare expenditures in detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^113gqvhj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Economic evaluation (decision analysis)

We investigated whether use of an age-adjusted fractionated plasma metanephrine measurement could result in cost savings in imaging expenditures, compared to use of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements interpreted in a conventional fashion, for detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma in a hypothetical tertiary care hypertensive population. We thus performed a decision analysis, with resource implications defined by costs of confirmatory imaging (CT and MRI), interpreted from a third party payer perspective. In the decision analysis, we compared algorithm "A" in which biochemical testing consisted of measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines with these measurements interpreted relative to the 95% reference range (defined by a normetanephrine fraction above 0.9 nmol/L or a metanephrine fraction above 0.5 nmol/L) to algorithm "B", in which fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements were interpreted by using the age-adjusted metanephrine score. The sensitivity and specificity of biochemical tests was based on data from the validation set. In each algorithm, all patients with positive biochemical testing would undergo confirmatory imaging. The imaging protocol for patients with positive biochemical tests in either strategies began with computerized tomography ([CT] with and without intravenous contrast) of the abdomen, then if negative, I-131 or I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (efficacy for I-131 and costs for I-123 shown). The horizon (endpoint) of the analyses was positive diagnosis or exclusion of pheochromocytoma, for hypothetical hypertensive patients subjected to each strategy. The outcome of the analyses was the number of patients with pheochromocytoma expected to be detected by each strategy. The costs of false positive biochemical tests were reflected only in the costs of subsequent imaging and not in potential costs of needless surgery or its possible complications.

The diagnostic efficacy of imaging studies was based on respective estimates from the literature: The sensitivity of CT imaging of the abdomen was assumed to be 98% with a specificity of 70%. The sensitivity of MIBG in detecting benign sporadic pheochromocytoma was assumed to be 87.4% with a specificity of 98.9%.

All costs were reported in 2002 US dollars. Costs of imaging investigations were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Business Office. For the purpose of the decision analysis model, the prevalence of pheochromocytoma in the hypertensive population that would typically be screened was assumed to be 0.5%.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1152yL3h]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma — initial evaluation recommends plasma free or 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines and normetanephrines, adrenal protocol CT or MRI if not already done, and genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes. If metastatic or multifocal disease is suspected, options include multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI, SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI, FDG-PET/CT (skull base to mid-thigh), chest CT ± contrast, meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan with single-photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT, and consideration of molecular profiling of tumor tissue. Review concurrent medication(s) that may interfere with plasma metanephrines evaluation, and elevations that are 3 times above the upper limit of normal are diagnostic. For cervical PGL, measuring serum and/or 24-hour urine fractionated catecholamines (for dopamine) or methoxytyramine (if available) may be appropriate, and methoxytyramine is helpful as the metabolite of dopamine in cervical tumors but it is not commercially available in many places. Both catecholamines and metanephrines/normetanephrines can represent false-positive results, and some investigators support fractionated urinary and/or plasma catecholamines to differentiate false-positive results and to differentiate epinephrine-secreting PCC. Consider medical alert ID for hormonally secreting PCCs and PGLs in situ or metastatic disease. Multiphasic imaging studies are performed with IV contrast in arterial and portal venous phases, and SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI of skull vertex to mid-thigh with multiphase IV contrast when possible; SSTR-PET tracers include 68Ga-DOTATATE, 64Cu-DOTATATE, and 68Ga-DOTATOC. MIBG scans are less sensitive than FDG-PET and 68Ga-DOTATATE for metastatic and multifocal PCCs/PGLs in patients with von Hippel Lindau [VHL] and succinate dehydrogenase [SDH] syndromes but not patients with MEN1 or NF1 syndromes or some patients with sporadic PCC; SPECT/CT imaging of involved sites is recommended, and obtain MIBG scan if considering treatment with 131I-MIBG. Tumor/somatic molecular profiling should be considered for patients with locoregional unresectable/metastatic disease who are candidates for anticancer therapy to identify actionable alterations, with testing on tumor tissue preferred and liquid biopsy considered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible. Data on the role of functional imaging in PCC/PGL are evolving and the preferred method remains unclear. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^117XLJzX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

We agree with observation by Eisenhofer and colleagues that when it comes to measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma, "false-positive results remain a problem", particularly when attempting to exclude sporadic disease. Originally, it was the hope was that measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines could result in cost savings because of avoidance of multiple biochemical tests. However, investigators from the National Institute of Health have recommended that clonidine-suppression tests need to be done in order to distinguish true positives from false positives. An alternative to clonidine-suppression testing may be measurement of 24-hour urinary metanephrines and catecholamines in patients with mild to moderate elevations of the normetanephrine fraction (for normetanephrine values approximately one to two times the upper limit of the normal range). In our study, we have provided a unique alternative approach for improving specificity of interpretation of measurements of fractionated plasma metanephrines. By adjusting the metanephrine score for age, we have shown that it may be possible to improve specificity of interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrines, with no loss of sensitivity in detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma, and potential savings in imaging expenditures.

### The North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors: pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and medullary thyroid cancer [^114NyrMW]. Pancreas (2010). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytomas, intra-adrenal paraganglioma, and extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors derived from adrenal chromaffin cells or similar cells in extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia, respectively. Serious morbidity and mortality rates associated with these tumors are related to the potent effects of catecholamines on various organs, especially those of the cardiovascular system. Before any surgical procedure is done, preoperative blockade is necessary to protect the patient against significant release of catecholamines due to anesthesia and surgical manipulation of the tumor. Treatment options vary with the extent of the disease, with laparoscopic surgery being the preferred treatment for removal of primary tumors. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a malignancy of the thyroid C cells or parafollicular cells. Thyroid C cells elaborate a number of peptides and hormones, such as calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and chromogranin A. Some or all of these markers are elevated in patients with MTC and can be used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to follow patients longitudinally for recurrence. Medullary thyroid cancer consists of a spectrum of diseases that ranges from extremely indolent tumors that are stable for many years to aggressive types associated with a high mortality rate. Genetic testing for RET mutations has allowed identification of familial cases and prophylactic thyroidectomy for cure. The only curative treatment is complete surgical resection.

### Detecting pheochromocytoma: defining the most sensitive test [^1132h6rG]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the most sensitive biochemical test to establish the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and also to assess the potential role of iodine 131-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy (I-MIBG) in the diagnosis of this tumor.

Summary Background Data

Pheochromocytoma is a rare, catecholamine-producing tumor with preferential localization in the adrenal gland. Despite its importance, the most sensitive test to establish the diagnosis remains to be defined.

Methods

Prospective data collection was done on patients with pheochromocytoma treated at the Duke University Medical Center and the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, NC. All urinary, plasma, and platelet analyses were highly standardized and supervised by one investigator (J.M.F.). I-MIBG scans were independently reviewed by 2 nuclear medicine physicians.

Results

A total of 152 patients (55.3% female) were enrolled in the present analysis. Patients were predominantly white (73.7%). Spells (defined as profuse sweating, tachycardia, and headache) and hypertension at diagnosis were present in 51.4% and 66.6%, respectively. Bilateral disease was found in 12.5%, malignant pheochromocytoma in 29.6%, and hereditary forms in 23.0%. The most sensitive tests were total urinary normetanephrine (96.9%), platelet norepinephrine (93.8%), and I-MIBG scintigraphy (83.7%). In combination with I-MIBG scintigraphy, platelet norepinephrine had a sensitivity of 100%, plasma norepinephrine/MIBG of 97.1%, total urine normetanephrine/MIBG of 96.6%, and urine norepinephrine/MIBG of 95.3%.

Conclusions

The tests of choice to establish the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma are urinary normetanephrine and platelet norepinephrine. A combination of I-MIBG scintigraphy and diagnostic tests in urine, blood, or platelets does further improve the sensitivity. We thus advocate performing an MIBG scan if the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is clinically suspected and catecholamine measurements are within the normal range.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^112JoRNy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The formula for adjustment of age was applied to fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements in the second dataset (validation dataset) for testing of sensitivity and specificity in a population in whom sporadic pheochromocytoma was sought. In the validation set, individuals with known genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma were excluded. Sensitivities were calculated by division of subjects with true positive test results by all the subjects with pheochromocytoma, and specificities were calculated by division of subjects with true negative test results divided by all subjects without pheochromocytoma. For sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios, 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Wilson's method (except the Score Method was used for calculation of 95% CI of likelihood ratios when a zero cell was noted). The specificity of the age-adjusted metanephrine score were compared (at the same level of sensitivity) to traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements using McNemar's test.

### A comparison of plasma-free metanephrines with plasma catecholamines in the investigation of suspected pheochromocytoma [^1152AjcF]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the diagnostic performance of plasma metanephrines by ELISA and plasma catecholamine measurements by HPLC in patients selected for clonidine suppression testing.

Methods

Plasma catecholamines adrenaline (ADR) and noradrenaline (NOR) were measured by HPLC and metanephrine with normetanephrine (NMN) by ELISA (n = 67). The diagnostic performance of metanephrines was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Results

Phaeochromocytoma was confirmed by histological analysis in 14 patients and excluded in 53 patients by a negative clonidine suppression test (CST), abdominal computerized tomography scan and clinical follow-up (median 2.5 years). A sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 96%, respectively, was obtained by using our current CST diagnostic criteria for ADR and NOR values. ROC curve analysis revealed optimum sensitivity and specificity for plasma-free metanephrines using a threshold of 784pmol/l at baseline and 663pmol/l at 180min. Baseline measurements of metanephrine with NMN showed 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity, as assessed by ROC curve analysis-derived criteria or when evaluated against published decision thresholds. A sensitivity and specificity of 100% was obtained for the combined measurements of metanephrine with NMN at 180min.

Conclusion

Plasma metanephrines (metanephrine with NMN) were equally effective as plasma catecholamines during CST. This study supports the use of measuring plasma metanephrines by ELISA as a less labour-intensive and equally effective biochemical test for phaeochromocytoma in patients with a high clinical suspicion. There was still overlap between groups with and without phaeochromocytoma at baseline under controlled conditions and clinically some patients still need to undergo clonidine suppression testing.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^117TPrD4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

Clinical characteristics of subjects in the derivation set who did not have pheochromocytoma but had measurements of the normetanephrine or metanephrine fraction above the upper reference limits (false positive tests using traditional positivity criteria) were compared to those without pheochromocytoma who had true negative tests (χ 2 was used for categorical variables and Student's t-test for independent samples was used for continuous variables). Variables which were different between both groups at a significance level of 0.1 were then entered into a multivariable logistic regression model predicting pheochromocytoma. Age was the only variable of statistical significance distinguishing true positive from false positive fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements in the derivation set. Thus, we forced age with measurement values of normetanephrine and metanephrine fractions in a multivariable logistic regression model predicting pheochromocytoma in the derivation set (SPSS 10.0, Chicago, ILL). The formula for this age-adjusted fractionated plasma metanephrine score is shown below:

-4.188 + -0.07(age) + 4.516(metanephrine) + 3.129(normetanephrine).

Age was in years, metanephrine fraction in nmol/L and normetanephrine fraction in nmol/L in this formula. In the derivation set, the Hosmer and Lemeshow test had χ 2 = 4.73, df = 8, p = 0.79 and the Cox and Snell r 2 = 0.38 showing significant model goodness-of-fit. A positivity cut-off age-adjusted metanephrine value of = -1.4752 was chosen as it carried an acceptable sensitivity of = 90.9% (30/33 patients, 95% CI = 76.4%, 96.9%) and specificity of 96.8% (300/310 patients, 95% CI = 94.2%, 98.2%) in the derivation set. The sensitivity level of over 90% was chosen because such a sensitivity level was believed to be clinically reasonable and at this level, specificity was still acceptable. We were aware that the lower the cut-off, the higher the sensitivity, but this would be at the expense of specificity.

### Improved diagnostic accuracy of clonidine suppression testing using an age-related cutoff for plasma normetanephrine [^1154Az2m]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Moderately elevated plasma normetanephrine (NMN) levels are frequent among patients with suspected pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). Clonidine suppression testing (CST) is recommended to distinguish patients with from those without PPGL. We aimed at evaluating the diagnostic outcome of CST in patients with moderate NMN elevations.

Methods

Data from patients participating in the PMT study (Prospective Monoamine-Producing Tumor) and the ENSAT (European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours) registry in 6 European reference centers were analyzed retrospectively. Eighty-nine patients with suspected PPGL and moderate NMN elevations upon screening were included. During follow-up, PPGL was confirmed in 16 and excluded in 73 cases. Plasma NMN was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before and 180 minutes after oral clonidine. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to identify optimal cutoffs.

Results

If published diagnostic criteria for CST (ie, NMN ≥ 112 ng/L and NMN suppression < 40%) were applied, a sensitivity of 88% (CI, 61%-98%) and a specificity of 97% (CI, 90%-100%) were observed. An improved cutoff for plasma NMN 180 minutes after clonidine was established at 80% of the age-related upper limit of normal, resulting in a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 97%. False-negative CST results occurred in 2 patients with small PPGL.

Conclusions

This study, involving one of the largest cohorts of patients with suspected PPGL and moderately elevated NMN, confirmed the diagnostic accuracy of CST. The application of an adapted cutoff further improved sensitivity.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^116g6aBN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Findings in the derivation set

The derivation set (from which the age-adjusted score was developed) consisted of 349 consecutive subjects (including 33 people with pheochromocytoma) who underwent fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements as well as 24-hour urinary total metanephrine measurements with or without 24-hour urinary catecholamine measurements in testing for pheochromocytoma at Mayo Clinic Rochester. In the derivation set, 8 of the 33 individuals had clinically-diagnosed genetic syndromes predisposing to pheochromocytoma (three familial malignant paraganglioma, two von Hippel-Lindau, one had multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a, one had multiple endocrine neoplasia 2b, and one had familial multiple benign paraganglioma). The 316 individuals in the derivation set who did not have pheochromocytoma underwent such testing the following reasons: refractory hypertension (174, 55%), spells (periodic episodes of symptoms such as palpitations, headache, or sweating, 124, 39%), adrenal mass (45, 14%), previous pheochromocytoma or known genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma (24, 8%). The mean age of subjects with pheochromocytoma was 48 years (SD 18 years, range 16 to 60 years), whereas the mean age of subjects without pheochromocytoma was 52 years (SD 15 years, range 10 to 73 years). Six of the 316 subjects without pheochromocytoma in the derivation set did not have a plasma metanephrine fraction recorded secondary to "interfering substances" and therefore were excluded from the analyses. In the derivation set, the sensitivity of traditionally interpreted fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements (using 95% reference ranges) was 93.9% (95% CI, 80.4, 98.3) (31/33 subjects), with a specificity of 85.2% (95% CI, 80.8, 88.7) (264/310 subjects). Baseline characteristics of individuals in the derivation set without pheochromocytoma were compared for individuals who had true negative fractionated metanephrine measurements (n = 264) to those who had false positive results (n = 46) (Table 1). The individuals with false positive fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements in the derivation set were significantly older than those with true negative measurements (p = 0.007), whereas blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and rates of obstructive sleep apnea were not significantly different between these groups. Thus, age was chosen as an important variable to adjust for in interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrines and an age-adjusted metanephrine score was developed from the derivation set data using logistic regression (as described in the Methods). At a cut-off value of -1.4752, the sensitivity of the age-adjusted metanephrine score was 90.9% (30/33 patients, 95% CI, 76.4%, 96.9%), with a specificity of 96.8% (300/310 patients, 95% CI, 94.2%, 98.2%). In this derivation set, which included individuals genetically predisposed to pheochromocytoma, one individual with a dopamine-secreting paraganglioma, another patient with a von Hippel-Lindau disease (diagnosed clinically), and a third patient with sporadic pheochromocytoma had false-negative age-adjusted metanephrine scores. The efficacy of the age-adjusted metanephrine score was then validated in the validation set.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^116coEKQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Is calculation of an age-adjusted metanephrine score practical for use in daily clinical practice? In this day of palm pilots and desktop computers, we believe that it may be feasible for clinicians to enter the formula for age-adjustment into standard desktop spreadsheet software (such as Excel, Microsoft) and perform such adjustments in the clinic. Alternatively, laboratories can provide age adjusted values to physicians when reporting test results. Thus, we do believe that calculation of an age-adjusted score is feasible to assist physicians in interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements. Indeed, such calculations may be less cumbersome and may generate fewer healthcare expenditures than alternative procedures such as supplemental clonidine-suppression testing or collection of 24-hour urinary measures.

Our observations should, however, be validated in another population outside of Mayo Clinic. Of particular note, our findings are applicable only to the screening of pheochromocytoma in low risk subjects who do not have known genetic predisposition to disease. In high risk, genetically predisposed individuals, mild elevations of normetanephrine or metanephrine measurements may be clinically significant and should prompt imaging.

### Pheochromocytoma in patients suspected of harboring adrenal metastasis: management and clinical predictors [^114ahLVK]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To study clinical management of patients with suspected adrenal metastasis and to assess whether there are clinical predictors of pheochromocytoma in this patient population.

Methods

In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we reviewed medical records of patients who had adrenalectomy for adrenal lesions or had adrenal biopsy performed between January 1997 and July 2007 in a large academic hospital. Patients who harbored adrenal masses that were suspected of being metastases were identified on clinical findings. Pathologic diagnosis, demographic data, clinical history, imaging studies, and laboratory test results were reviewed and compared among patients whose adrenal mass was determined to be metastasis, adenoma, or pheochromocytoma.

Results

One-hundred sixty-three patients had adrenalectomy or had adrenal biopsy during the study period. Thirty patients (18%) had adrenal masses that were suspected of being metastases. Of the adrenal masses, 18 (60%) were metastases, 8 (27%) were benign adenomas, and 4 (13%) were pheochromocytomas. Eleven patients (37%) had biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma. Adrenal biopsy was performed without biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma in 9 patients (30%), including 2 subsequently found to have this tumor. Adrenalectomy was performed in 10 patients (33%) without biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma. Clinical parameters were similar among patients with metastasis, adenoma, or pheochromocytoma. There were no clinical predictors to suggest pheochromocytoma.

Conclusions

Pheochromocytoma occurs frequently in patients suspected of harboring adrenal metastasis, but this tumor is often not considered in clinical practice. The size and imaging characteristics of the adrenal mass and history of known metastasis may help clinicians in decision-making. Biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma should ideally be performed in all patients suspected of having adrenal metastasis.

The most challenging scenario is undoubtably borderline positive results (one–threefold ULRI). These tumors need careful stepwise clinical, biochemical, and imaging approach. Adequate sampling must be ensured in all borderline patients and corrected if necessary. Pre-test prevalence is also a crucial determinant of interpretation, and the need for re-evaluation and follow-up. Clinical suspicion is also a powerful guidance tool; low-suspicion patients should be followed up for at least 6 months, as sustained or elevated levels of free metabolites are highly suggestive of a tumor. Patients with moderate or high clinical probability may benefit from clonidine suppression test (CST). Finally, similar patterns in paired PMets and UMets in borderline cases indicate PPGL and should lead to further investigation.

Besides being significant indicators of PPGL, Pmets and UMets are also valuable in predicting tumor profiles. Tumor size has been positively correlated with MN and NMN levels (r = 0.81 and r = 0.71, respectively, p < 0.001), while higher MN/NMN ratios indicate adrenal tumors. Conversely, elevated 3-MT levels suggest extra-adrenal disease and higher metastatic potential. Figure 2 is a proposed algorithm that outlines a step-by-step approach to plasma and urine free metabolites.

RIs should also account for the means of presentation in PPGL. Statistically significant differences between incidental, symptom-based, and mutation-based diagnosis for PMets, UMets, and isolated plasma free NMN levels are reported in multiple series. These differences should always be considered, particularly in borderline cases (Figure 2).

### European Association of Nuclear Medicine practice guideline / Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging procedure standard 2019 for radionuclide imaging of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^112iAZV7]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). High credibility.

Clinical indications for nuclear imaging — confirmation of a phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) diagnosis — For confirmation of a PPGL diagnosis, elevated plasma or urinary metanephrines must be observed in addition to clinical symptoms that strongly suggest the presence of these tumours. Plasma or urinary metanephrine levels that are four times the upper reference limit are strongly diagnostic and generally preclude the requirement of other confirmatory tests, except in patients taking anti-depressants, which require the clonidine suppression test. If biochemical tests indicate PPGLs, their localisation should follow, generally by anatomical imaging as the first modality, and PPGLs typically show soft tissue attenuation greater than 10 Hounsfield units (HU) on CT. If the metanephrine level is increased, PHEO (an adrenal tumour) should be suspected, whereas if the normetanephrine level is increased, a tumour located in any part of the body should be suspected and whole-body imaging should be performed. Anatomical imaging is sufficient for the confirmation of PHEO only if the adrenal gland is the site of involvement and the metanephrine level is very high, noting that almost 99% of epinephrine and, consequently, metanephrine is derived from the adrenal gland. Because norepinephrine (NE)/normetanephrine is derived from the adrenal gland or sympathetic nerves present anywhere in the body, functional imaging is required to confirm whether the tumour is indeed PPGL.

Follow-up Characteristics

The median duration of follow-up of all patients from adrenalectomy to last follow-up (or from diagnosis to last follow-up if a patient did not undergo surgery) was 36 months (range, 1–179 months). Overall, 17 (10.2%) patients developed metachronous or metastatic disease during follow-up; incidental 4.4% (N = 4, median follow-up 23 months [range, 1–146 months]), symptomatic/uncontrolled hypertension 8.1% (N = 3, median follow-up 36 months [range, 1–179 months]); and screened for genetic susceptibility 40.0% (N = 8, 113 months [range, 2–169 months]). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, no significant difference in disease recurrence was observed between the groups (P = 0.921; Supplementary Fig. 3). The mode of presentation of the first tumor was unknown in 2 patients who developed disease recurrence. Overall, the median time to disease recurrence was 80 months (range, 6–153 months).

Among the 4 patients with incidentally detected pheochromocytoma who developed disease recurrence, 1 underwent genetic testing confirming an NF1 mutation, 1 declined genetic testing, and 2 did not meet the national genetic testing criteria at the diagnosis of first tumor and died after disease recurrence and before genetic testing was undertaken. Regarding the 3 patients in the symptomatic/uncontrolled hypertension group who developed disease recurrence, 1 underwent genetic testing confirming an SDHB mutation, and 2 did not meet the national genetic testing criteria at the diagnosis of the first tumor.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^116aDev4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma by measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines is limited by false positive rates of up to 18% in people without known genetic predisposition to the disease. The plasma normetanephrine fraction is responsible for most false positives and plasma normetanephrine increases with age. The objective of this study was to determine if we could improve the specificity of fractionated plasma measurements, by statistically adjusting for age. METHODS: An age-adjusted metanephrine score was derived using logistic regression from 343 subjects (including 33 people with pheochromocytoma) who underwent fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements as part of investigations for suspected pheochromocytoma at Mayo Clinic Rochester (derivation set). The performance of the age-adjusted score was validated in a dataset of 158 subjects (including patients 23 with pheochromocytoma) that underwent measurements of fractionated plasma metanephrines at Mayo Clinic the following year (validation dataset). None of the participants in the validation dataset had known genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the age-adjusted metanephrine score was the same as that of traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements, yielding a sensitivity of 100% (23/23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 85.7%, 100%). However, the false positive rate with traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements was 16.3% (22/135, 95% CI, 11.0%, 23.4%) and that of the age-adjusted score was significantly lower at 3.0% (4/135, 95% CI, 1.2%, 7.4%) (p < 0.001 using McNemar's test). CONCLUSION: An adjustment for age in the interpretation of results of fractionated plasma metanephrines may significantly decrease false positives when using this test to exclude sporadic pheochromocytoma. Such improvements in false positive rate may result in savings of expenditures related to confirmatory imaging.

SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis

Diagnostic criteria for clinically suspected viral myocarditis, including clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria, are provided in Supplementary Table 2. Clinically suspected myocarditis was indicated if ≥ 1 clinical presentation and ≥ 1 diagnostic criteria from different categories were observed, in the absence of (1) angiographically detectable coronary artery disease (coronary stenosis ≥ 50%) and (2) known pre-existing cardiovascular disease or extra-cardiac causes that could explain the syndrome (for example, valve disease, congenital heart disease or hyperthyroidism). Suspicion is higher with higher number of fulfilled criteria. If the patient is asymptomatic, ≥ 2 diagnostic criteria should be met. This criterion was adopted in the knowledge that endomyocardial biopsy for virology criteria would not be available for logistical reasons related to service provision during the pandemic.

Acute stress cardiomyopathy

Takotsubo syndrome: myocardial injury secondary to myocardial disorders without involvement of the coronary arteries. Takotsubo syndrome is characterized by specific left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (for example, apical ballooning) and the absence of relevant late gadolinium enhancement with edema. The diagnostic criteria are provided in the International Expert Consensus Document on Takotsubo Syndrome (Part I): Clinical Characteristics, Diagnostic Criteria, andPathophysiology:
Patients show transient left ventricular dysfunction (hypokinesia, akinesia or dyskinesia) presenting as apical ballooning or midventricular, basal or focal wall motion abnormalities. Right ventricular involvement can be present. Besides these regional wall motion patterns, transitions between all types can exist. The regional wall motion abnormality usually extends beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution; however, rare cases can exist where the regional wall motion abnormality is present in the subtended myocardial territory of a single coronary artery (focal Takotsubo syndrome).
An emotional, physical or combined trigger can precede the Takotsubo syndrome event, but this is not obligatory.
Neurologic disorders (for example, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke/transient ischemic attack or seizures) as well as pheochromocytoma may serve as triggers for Takotsubo syndrome.
New ECG abnormalities are present (ST segment elevation, ST segment depression, T-wave inversion or QTc prolongation); however, rare cases exist without any ECG changes.
Levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin and creatine kinase) are moderately elevated in most cases; substantial elevation of brain natriuretic peptide is common.
Obstructive coronary artery disease is not a contradiction in Takotsubo syndrome.
Patients have no evidence of infectious myocarditis.
Postmenopausal women are predominantly affected.

### Universal germline panel testing for individuals with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma produces high diagnostic yield [^112nBbS9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, the use of malignancy as a requisite for testing can be counterproductive when results of genetic testing are used to determine the risk for malignancy, as in the case of individuals found to carry SDHB or MAX pathogenic variants, and in many cases, malignancy may not be known for years after a diagnosis is made. In addition, evidence continues to emerge regarding the malignant potential for other genes, such as SDHA. Furthermore, accurate characterization of biochemical phenotype can be influenced by collection method, coexistence of multiple PPGLs, types of biochemical tests used, and drug interactions. In these ways, using clinical features to guide genetic testing decision making may serve as an impediment rather than an aid in identifying individuals with hereditary PPGL. In our sample of positive cases, information regarding malignancy and biochemical expression was only provided in 27.5% and 30.4% of cases, respectively, although we cannot conclude if this is due to unreliability or absence of the information at the time genetic testing was ordered, or if the information was simply omitted from the clinical details provided to our laboratory.

Although the Endocrine Society provides practice guidelines outlining a stepwise testing algorithm, the group acknowledges that broader concurrent panel testing may be more feasible with the adoption of NGS. Since then, several groups have proposed concurrent MGPT as the preferred testing method and more data have emerged about the genomic heterogeneity of PPGL. The NGS in PPGL Study Group developed a consensus statement based on expert opinion regarding appropriate testing platforms, variant interpretation, and genes targeted. Recommendations include use of NGS panel testing options consisting of a basic (11 genes), extended (15 genes), or comprehensive (27 genes) panel. Clinical and genetic overlap amongst hereditary PPGL make such recommendations necessary, and advances in genetic testing technology have now made them practical as well. Guidance from expert panels and robust evaluation of the clinical validity of PPGL predisposition genes is essential when designing MGPT to maximize the clinical utility and reduce limitations of such testing.

### Pheochromocytoma: the expanding genetic differential diagnosis [^117RePvU]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2003). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are tumors of the autonomic nervous system; pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla, and paragangliomas are extra-adrenal tumors arising from either the sympathetic nervous system or parasympathetic ganglia. It has previously been estimated that approximately 10%-15% of pheochromocytomas are due to hereditary causes. However, our increased understanding of the three hereditary syndromes (neurofibromatosis 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome) in which pheochromocytoma is found and the recent discovery that mutations in genes in the succinate dehydrogenase family (SDHB and SDHD) predispose to pheochromocytoma have necessitated a re-evaluation of the genetic basis of pheochromocytoma. These studies indicate that the frequency of germline mutations associated with isolated pheochromocytoma is higher than previously estimated, with both hospital-based series and a large population-based series indicating that the frequency of germline mutations in RET, VHL, SDHB, and SDHD taken together approximates 20%. In all patients with pheochromocytoma, including those with known hereditary syndrome or a positive family history, the frequency of germline mutations in these four genes together approaches 30%. Given the frequency of germline mutations, consideration should be given to genetic counseling for all patients with pheochromocytoma and is particularly important for individuals with a positive family history, multifocal disease, or a diagnosis before age 50. Identification of patients with hereditary pheochromocytoma is important because it can guide medical management in mutation-positive patients and their families. This review provides an overview of the known genetic syndromes that are commonly associated with pheochromocytoma, examines recent data on the association of germline mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase gene family with pheochromocytoma, and suggests guidelines for the genetic evaluation of pheochromocytoma patients.

### Personalized management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^1143jrsx]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging

Cluster 1 PPGLs have high metastatic risk due to (pseudo)hypoxia-induced cellular changes including the generation of oncometabolites; the tumors are characterized by low catecholamine contents, sometimes with a dopaminergic phenotype (an independent risk factor related to poor prognosis). The latter features may contribute to delayed diagnosis (due to lack of clinical signs and symptoms), therefore implying need of various PPGL-specific functional imaging modalities during screening and follow-up; this may be especially important in SDHx -related PPGLs. However, radiation exposure from anatomic and functional imaging must be carefully considered and often limited, especially for genetically predisposed and asymptomatic tumorfree carriers as well as children who will need lifelong follow-up.

Thus, previous and current evidence (including the European Society of Endocrinology Clinical Practice Guideline on pheochromocytoma; the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Practice Guideline/Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Procedure Standard for radionuclide imaging of pheochromocytoma; and most recently, the Working Group on Endocrine Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension) have recommended a specific guide for diagnosis, screening, and follow-up using biochemical evaluation and imaging modalities for cluster 1 mutation PPGLs, including mutation carriers.

In general, computed tomography (CT) imaging has a high sensitivity (around 100%) but a low specificity (50%) for the screening of adrenal tumors (PCCs). Typically, PCCs are of soft tissue attenuation and are generally more than 10 Hounsfield units (HU) and demonstrate a marked enhancement that can be heterogeneous due to cystic or degenerated regions within the lesion. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a PCC is classically described as appearing "light-bulb" bright on T2-weighted imaging and is usually hypointense on T1-weighted imaging, although the presence of fat or hemorrhage could lead to high signal intensity on T1.

PCCs mostly occur in association with cluster 1B VHL/EPAS1 -related (see under "Personalized Management: Molecular Cluster 1" subsection "Penetrance, Epidemiology, and Metastatic Risk") or cluster 2–related disease.

### The utility of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in patients with pheochromocytoma [^11563yJf]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy (MIBG) can be used to image pheochromocytomas. While cross-sectional imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually localize the tumor, MIBG is often obtained to rule out multifocal and metastatic disease, and to corroborate anatomic imaging with functional data. We questioned the utility of MIBG in the diagnosis and management of pheochromocytoma.

Methods

All patients who received MIBG at one academic center from 1999 to 2004 were identified. For the subset of patients who received MIBG in the work-up of possible pheochromocytoma, the following data were reviewed: demographics, symptoms, results of biochemical and imaging studies, histopathological diagnosis, and management.

Results

A total of 60 patients received MIBG, including 27 patients for the evaluation of a possible pheochromocytoma. Biochemical testing was performed in all patients. Fourteen patients received MIBG despite normal biochemistry and an absence of risk factors such as a hereditary syndrome or prior history of pheochromocytoma. None of these 14 low-risk patients with negative biochemistry had a final diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. In the ten patients with pheochromocytoma, all tumors were localized by CT and/or MRI. Importantly, MIBG did not identify any foci of disease not seen on cross sectional imaging, and MIBG did not alter the surgical management of any patient in this series.

Conclusions

In patients with clinical findings suggestive of pheochromocytoma, biochemical testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis, and cross-sectional imaging is sufficient for tumor localization. In the absence of hereditary disease or a past history of pheochromocytoma, MIBG does not alter the treatment plan and therefore should not be routinely performed. Instead, MIBG should be used selectively, such as for the rare patient with a biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and no tumor seen on exhaustive anatomical imaging.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^113FZXd4]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) — testing, preoperative blockade, and surgical considerations include that initial biochemical testing for PPGLs should include measurement of plasma-free or urinary fractionated metanephrines and are typically more than 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal in functional PPGLs, and following the diagnosis, preoperative blockade for at least 7 days is routinely recommended to prevent dangerous perioperative hemodynamic instability. We recommend that either selective or nonselective α blockade be used to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of PPGL, depending on the drug availability/cost, experience, and preference of the care team; while there is no significant difference in morbidity or mortality between selective and nonselective α blockade, selective blockade (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) is associated with more intraoperative hemodynamic instability while nonselective blockade (phenoxybenzamine) results in more postoperative hypotension. Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) have the highest heritability of all adrenal tumors (about 40% are due to germline mutations), and genetic testing is recommended. In the presence of bilateral or familial PCC, cortical-sparing adrenalectomy has been successfully used to preserve adrenal cortical tissue, and studies report steroid dependency rates between 9% and 30% with recurrence rates from 9% to 30%.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis and treatment of a hypertensive patient with unilateral primary aldosteronism and contralateral pheochromocytoma: a case report [^1158FLBM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast, pheochromocytoma is characterized by catecholamine excess symptoms including hypertension, headache, palpitations, and sweating. However, an increasing number of small pheochromocytomas that are asymptomatic and no biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess (pre-biochemical) have been reported due to increased use of CT for abdominal imaging or family screening. Unlike PA, pheochromocytomas are often not biologically active until they have a substantial size (> 1.5 cm in diameter). pheochromocytoma is diagnosed based on the presence of elevated catecholamine and/or their metabolite levels and imaging findings of a tumor. Lipid-poor and vascular adrenal masses with higher CT attenuation (> 10HU) than adrenal adenomas should be considered suspicious for pheochromocytoma and small adrenal cortical cancer. In our case, both adrenal nodules (right:16 × 11 mm, left:13 × 9 mm) were not large enough in tumor size at the time of first discovery. Still, the right lipid-rich adrenal nodule was a florid aldosterone-producing tumor with hypertension, low K, and high aldosterone. On the other hand, the left lipid-poor adrenal nodule was a nonfunctional and pre-biochemical pheochromocytoma. This difference posed a significant challenge for simultaneous diagnosis. However, since the urinary fractionated metanephrines levels were already between the upper limit of the normal range and the diagnostic level and the CT attenuation of the left adrenal nodule was more than 30 HU at the first admission, we should have performed an additional investigation including a clonidine suppression test for adrenal nodules with possible pheochromocytoma. Instead, we decided to do a close follow-up, but unfortunately, she interrupted it. Finally, the growing size of the left adrenal tumor (Fig. 1) and the elevation of 24-h urinary fractionated metanephrines to the diagnostic level (Table 2) during this period enabled us to diagnose the left pheochromocytoma. Our case demonstrated the importance of a long-term follow-up by confirming the elevation of catecholamine metabolites and the growth of the tumor to diagnose an initially small, less biochemically active pheochromocytoma.

### Pheochromocytoma crisis with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Takotsubo syndrome, emergency adrenalectomy, and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in a previously undiagnosed and asymptomatic patient, due to the use of metoclopramide [^113hB32c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytoma can present with TTS. TTS was first named Takotsubo syndrome because the heart shape was similar to that of an octopus fish basket at the time of onset. Later, it was also called stress cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, or apical ballooning syndrome. The 2018 European consensus developed new international diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of TTS. Patients with TTS have transient left ventricular dysfunction. Midventricular, basal, or focal wall motion abnormalities or apical ballooning, and pheochromocytoma may contribute to the arbitrary syndrome. An excess of catecholamines can cause cardiomyopathy. Catecholamines cause direct damage to the myocardium through calcium overload, oxidative stress, induction of apoptosis, promotion of fibrosis, and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Catecholamines can also cause indirect damage to the heart via increasing oxygen consumption and decreasing the myocardial oxygen supply, which causes coronary artery spasms, endothelial injury, arrhythmias, and cardiac dysfunction. The elevated cardiac injury markers in our patient could potentially lead to a misdiagnosis of myocarditis or acute myocardial infarction, but thanks to the discovery of apical ballooning in the heart and the mass in the splenorenal space by ultrasound, it provided an important clue for the final diagnosis.

### Biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma: how to distinguish true-from false-positive test results [^112VAuQg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Measurements of plasma normetanephrine and metanephrine provide a highly sensitive test for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, but false-positive results remain a problem. We therefore assessed medication-associated false-positive results and use of supplementary tests, including plasma normetanephrine responses to clonidine, to distinguish true- from false-positive results. The study included 208 patients with pheochromocytoma and 648 patients in whom pheochromocytoma was excluded. Clonidine-suppression tests were carried out in 48 patients with and 49 patients without the tumor. Tricyclic antidepressants and phenoxybenzamine accounted for 41% of false-positive elevations of plasma normetanephrine and 44–45% those of plasma and urinary norepinephrine. High plasma normetanephrine to norepinephrine or metanephrine to epinephrine ratios were strongly predictive of pheochromocytoma. Lack of decrease and elevated plasma levels of norepinephrine or normetanephrine after clonidine also confirmed pheochromocytoma with high specificity. However, 16 of 48 patients with pheochromocytoma had normal levels or decreases of norepinephrine after clonidine. In contrast, plasma normetanephrine remained elevated in all but 2 patients, indicating more reliable diagnosis using normetanephrine than norepinephrine responses to clonidine. Thus, in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma and positive biochemical results, false-positive elevations due to medications should first be eliminated. Patterns of biochemical test results and responses of plasma normetanephrine to clonidine can then help distinguish true- from false-positive results.

highest for plasma free metanephrines using receiver operating characteristic curves. Combining different tests did not improve the diagnostic yield beyond that of a single test of plasma free metanephrines. Conclusion Plasma free metanephrines provide the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma and should be the test of first choice for diagnosis of the. This study examined the diagnostic utility of several biochemical tests in large populations of patients tested for pheochromocytoma because of suggestive signs and symptoms or a predisposition to develop the tumor. Biochemical tests included measurements of plasma and urinary catecholamines, urinary fractionated metanephrines, urinary total metanephrines, and urinary vanillylmandelic acid. Confirmation of pheochromocytoma required pathological examination of surgically resected or biopsied tumor tissue or a diagnosis of inoperable malignant pheochromocytoma based on findings of metastatic disease by imaging studies.

Exclusion of pheochromocytoma required lack of radiological evidence. of a tumor by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, pathological examination of a surgically resected or biopsied adrenal mass, or lack of pheochromocytoma on patient follow-up 2 or more years after initial testing. Using the above criteria, pheochromocytoma was confirmed in 214 patients and. limits for each analyte. 23 As summary measures of the diagnostic utility of each test, independent of upper reference limits, areas under ROC curves were calculated and differences among tests examined according to the method by Hanley and McNeil. 24 Negative predictive values were calculated from the percentage of true-negative over the total of true-negative plus false-negative test results. Positive. signs. Finally, standard criteria that were independent of the biochemical tests being compared were used to assign patients into groups with and without the tumor.

The present study confirms the findings of several other reports that measurements of plasma free metanephrines or urinary fractionated metanephrines offer higher sensitivity for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma than measurements. of plasma or urinary catecholamines or of urinary total metanephrines or VMA. 8, 9, 11, 14, 16 Our comparisons further establish that among all tests, including urinary fractionated metanephrines, measurements of plasma free metanephrines provide the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma.

### Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treatment (PDQ ®) [^112hqhWZ]. NCI (2010). Low credibility.

Genetic testing is often recommended in the following situations:

- Patients with a personal or family history of clinical features suggestive of a hereditary pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome.
- Patients with bilateral or multifocal tumors.
- Patients with sympathetic or malignant extra-adrenal paragangliomas.
- Patients diagnosed before age 40 years. Genetic testing can be considered when a patient has the following features:

- Patient is between the ages of 40 and 50 years.
- Patients has a history of a unilateral pheochromocytoma.
- Patient does not have a personal or family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome. If a germline variant is identified, predictive genetic testing may be offered to asymptomatic at-risk family members. For more information, see Genetics of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Neoplasias. Genetic testing is not recommended in patients who are older than 50 years.

Diagnostics The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is usually preceded by the presence of an adrenal mass or is discovered incidentally. Biochemical testing is done to document excess catecholamine secretion. Once the biochemical diagnosis of a catecholamine-secreting tumor is confirmed, localization studies should be performed. Controversy exists as to the optimal single test to make the diagnosis. Plasma-free fractionated metanephrines Measurement of plasma-free fractionated metanephrines appears to be an ideal case-detection test for patients at higher baseline risk of pheochromocytoma. Examples of these patients might include:

- Patients with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass.
- Patients with a family history of pheochromocytoma.
- Patients with a known inherited predisposition to pheochromocytoma. The test is associated with a relatively high false-positive rate in patients with a lower baseline risk of pheochromocytoma. Measurement of plasma-free metanephrines has a high sensitivity but a relatively low specificity. In general, it is reasonable to use measurement of plasma-free fractionated metanephrines for initial case detection, which is followed by 24-hour measurement of urine-fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines for confirmation. Test results can be difficult to interpret because of the possibility of false-positive results. False-positive results can be caused by:

The histories of 50 patients who were found to have pheochromocytomas have been analyzed in order to identify factors that might be important in diagnosis and prognosis. The hypertension characteristic of pheochromocytoma was paroxysmal in 26 and persistent in 24. The tumors are usually benign, but eight in this series were malignant, and seven of the malignant type occurred in the cases of persistent hypertension. Tests for pheochromocytoma should be carried out on patients who complain of spells of severe headache of unexplained cause with perspiration, thoracic and abdominal pain, and nervousness and on any hypertensive patient who is thin and young, who has hypermetabolism without other signs of hyperthyroidism, who give a paradoxical reaction to ganglion-blocking agents, and who responds to anesthetics with a blood pressure rise.

The tests consist of the administration of histamine base, tetraethyl-ammonium chloride, phentolamine, or piperoxan and determinations of plasma pressoramines under certain standard conditions. For removal of the tumor a transverse upper abdominal incision is recommended because it gives access to both adrenals and permits the inspection of the abdomen for aberrant masses of adrenal tissue, which are especially likely to occur in the region of the great vessels in the abdomen and about the base of the mesentery of the small intestine. During operation constant attention to the blood pressure is necessary because the pressure often rises sharply when the tumor is handled and falls to dangerously low levels when the tumor is removed. When recurrences or metastases are encountered, it is still possible to prolong the life of the patient by surgery or roentgenotherapy. Kvale WF, Roth GM, Manger WM, Priestley JT.

### Sensitivity of diagnostic and localization tests for pheochromocytoma in clinical practice… [^1167YDqW]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Thirty-five patients with complete medical records who had pathologically confirmed pheochromocytomas between 1962 and 1997 at the University of Chicago Hospitals were identified. Sensitivity and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for 12 laboratory diagnostic tests and 5 imaging studies. Results. The most sensitive laboratory diagnostic tests in our study were plasma total catecholamines and urine total metanephrines. Testing for urine vanillylmandelic acid, while less expensive and easier to perform than many other tests, had a slightly lower sensitivity. The most sensitive imaging tests in the study were magnetic resonance imaging and iodine I-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. The more often used computed tomography had only 88% sensitivity. Localization was safely and successfully performed on two pregnant patients using magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound.

Conclusions By properly choosing from the wide array of laboratory diagnostic and imaging tests, pheochromocytomas can be identified and localized with nearly 100% sensitivity. These tests should be performed in any patient for whom the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is being considered. Biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is traditionally performed by examining plasma and total urinary levels of catecholamines and their metabolites over 24 hours. 1, 5–10 Recent studies have indicated that urine total metanephrines is the most sensitive laboratory test for pheochromocytoma. 1, 6, 7, 10, 11. In our study utilizing commercial laboratory assays, however, plasma total catecholamines proved to be one of the most sensitive tests, with a sensitivity of 95%, representing the highest lower confidence limit value in our study.

Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine values were relatively comparable in sensitivity with urine epinephrine and norepinephrine values. Because pheochromocytomas are life-threatening without treatment, it is important that a diagnostic test exclude false-negative results as efficiently as possible. False positives are relatively less important because additional testing can be performed to rule out the disease. 7, 21 We found that urine total metanephrines, serum total catecholamines, and urine VMA were the most sensitive laboratory diagnostic tests, and that MRI scans and MIBG scintigraphy were the most sensitive imaging tests.
