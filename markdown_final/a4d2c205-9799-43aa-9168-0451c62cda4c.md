how shold be tapered prednisone 5 mg/day in chronic users during desprescription?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to taper prednisone 5 mg/day in chronic users during deprescription. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the underlying disease is controlled and whether glucocorticoids are still required. Then, I should verify the current dose relative to physiologic replacement and the risk of HPA axis suppression. Next, I will outline a practical taper cadence, monitoring strategy, and how to distinguish withdrawal syndrome from adrenal insufficiency. After that, I should consider whether to use biochemical testing and how to interpret morning cortisol. Finally, I will address special populations, stress dosing, and what to do if symptoms emerge during the taper, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and safety considerations [^112xM1E2] [^114DSdhQ] [^111ewkiM].

> Let me first confirm the prerequisite: tapering should only be attempted if the underlying condition is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required for disease control; otherwise, tapering risks disease flare and confounds interpretation of withdrawal symptoms, so I need to ensure remission or low disease activity is stable before proceeding [^112xM1E2] [^117Cq7fW].

> I need to check the dose context next; 5 mg/day prednisone sits at the upper end of physiologic replacement, so the patient is at meaningful risk of HPA axis suppression and warrants a cautious, slow taper with close monitoring rather than abrupt discontinuation, even though the absolute risk of adrenal crisis is low at this dose range [^1171fF7m] [^113Eguj6].

> Now, for the taper cadence, I should confirm the decrement and interval; the most consistently supported approach at 5 mg/day is to reduce by 1 mg every 4 weeks, with flexibility to extend intervals if withdrawal symptoms or disease activity emerge, and to pause or temporarily increase the dose if needed; this aligns with endocrine guidance and rheumatology practice patterns for low-dose tapers [^114DSdhQ] [^114kF4bm] [^111ewkiM].

> Wait, let me verify the practical steps; from 5 mg/day, I will reduce to 4 mg/day for 4 weeks, then 3 mg/day for 4 weeks, then 2 mg/day for 4 weeks, then 1 mg/day for 4 weeks, and then reassess for readiness to stop; if symptoms occur, I should hold or increase to the last tolerated dose and extend the taper interval, consistent with individualized, symptom-guided strategies endorsed by endocrine and rheumatology guidelines [^114DSdhQ] [^113REYhV] [^111ewkiM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing; I initially thought dynamic testing might be necessary at 5 mg, but I should double-check the current guidance, which recommends against routine dynamic testing during taper and instead supports either clinical monitoring alone or a single morning cortisol measured at least 24 hours after the last dose once the patient is at or near physiologic replacement; dynamic tests are generally unnecessary unless there is diagnostic uncertainty or atypical features [^113rP5jg] [^113uLZzA] [^117JUADt].

> I will now examine symptom monitoring and differentiation; I need to ensure we distinguish glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, which can occur at supraphysiologic doses and overlaps with inflammatory symptoms, from true adrenal insufficiency, which becomes more likely as doses approach physiologic levels; features like orthostasis, hyponatremia, or hypoglycemia favor adrenal insufficiency, whereas myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and mood changes are more typical of withdrawal; if withdrawal symptoms are severe, I should temporarily increase to the last tolerated dose and slow the taper, and if adrenal insufficiency is suspected, I should provide physiologic replacement and reassess [^114h7pGF] [^113REYhV] [^113uLZzA].

> Next, I should review the optional biochemical pathway; if we choose to test, I need to ensure a morning serum cortisol is drawn between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding prednisone for at least 24 hours, then interpret as a continuum: values above about 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) suggest HPA recovery and support discontinuation, 150–300 nmol/L warrants continuation and retesting in weeks to months, and less than 150 nmol/L suggests persistent suppression requiring continued replacement and retesting in a few months; I should confirm that assay-specific cutoffs and clinical context are considered, especially outside major stress or in abnormal CBG states [^113uLZzA] [^117JUADt] [^112RBXX5].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate 1 mg decrements; I need to ensure flexibility, including using 0.5 mg steps if available, alternating-day microtapers, or even switching temporarily to hydrocortisone to allow finer titration; evidence and guidance support individualized, slower tapers when withdrawal emerges, and switching from long-acting to shorter-acting agents can facilitate smoother tapering when applicable [^1117Dpyy] [^113NbYxg] [^114kF4bm].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts; in older adults, those with high cumulative exposure, or significant comorbidity, I will favor slower tapers and a lower threshold for biochemical confirmation; in patients with SLE or RA, I must balance disease flare risk against steroid toxicity, often coordinating with immunosuppressive optimization to enable tapering; in severe asthma, OCS stewardship and biologic use can enable tapering, but I must still monitor for adrenal insufficiency during and after withdrawal [^111ewkiM] [^112dwZWq] [^111Vkt1Y].

> Next, I should review stress dosing and crisis prevention; during the taper and for up to a year after discontinuation, patients should have clear sick-day rules and access to emergency hydrocortisone, with oral stress dosing for minor illness and parenteral dosing for major stress or inability to take oral medications; I need to ensure education is documented and that patients know when to seek urgent care [^115NiiPm] [^112de5Ha] [^114fmMsD].

> Let me reconsider the overall timeline; a 1 mg every 4 weeks taper from 5 mg to 1 mg typically spans about 16 weeks, after which I should either stop if clinically well and, if using testing, the morning cortisol is reassuring, or continue 1 mg/day for an additional 4 weeks before stopping; total taper duration commonly ranges 4–6 months, but I should individualize based on symptoms, disease control, and, if used, cortisol recovery [^114DSdhQ] [^113uLZzA] [^111ewkiM].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety netting; after discontinuation, I should reassess clinically at 4–6 weeks and again at 3 months for withdrawal or adrenal symptoms, and if there is no biochemical or clinical recovery by 12 months while on physiologic replacement, I should refer to endocrinology for further evaluation; I should also document education on stress dosing and provide an emergency action plan to mitigate adrenal crisis risk [^117GZKB6] [^111CsU3e] [^114fmMsD].

Taper prednisone 5 mg/day in chronic users by reducing the dose by **1 mg every 2–4 weeks** [^114DSdhQ] [^111ewkiM] while monitoring for withdrawal and disease flare. If symptoms occur, **return to the last tolerated dose** and taper more slowly [^113REYhV]. At 1 mg/day, consider holding for 2–4 weeks before stopping, and monitor for adrenal insufficiency for 6–12 months after discontinuation [^notfound]. Educate patients on stress dosing and provide an emergency steroid card [^1169wuaM].

---

## Recommended tapering schedule

- **Initial taper**: Reduce by 1 mg every 2–4 weeks [^114DSdhQ] (e.g. 5 mg → 4 mg → 3 mg → 2 mg → 1 mg).

- **Final taper**: Hold at 1 mg/day for 2–4 weeks before stopping [^notfound].

- **Total duration**: Typically 3–6 months, individualized to response and tolerability [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for withdrawal (fatigue, arthralgia, mood changes) [^113REYhV] and disease flare during each decrement [^114h7pGF].

- **Dose adjustment**: If symptoms occur, return to the last tolerated dose and taper more slowly [^113REYhV].

- **Biochemical monitoring**: Morning cortisol can guide taper at low doses; > 10 μg/dL suggests HPA recovery [^113uLZzA] [^117JUADt].

---

## Patient education and safety measures

Patient education should cover **stress dosing** during illness, surgery, or trauma, and patients should carry an **emergency steroid card** indicating chronic steroid use and taper status [^1169wuaM]. After discontinuation, monitor for adrenal insufficiency for 6–12 months [^notfound].

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^1154nETE]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Conventional content analysis

Each of the 316 deprescribing recommendations were individually coded to seven categories, with subcategories. These categories were mapped to two overarching language concepts; (1) content and (2) form (figure 2). The content concept comprised categories relating to the recommendation's subject matter, specifically whether a recommendation indicated for who, what, when/why or how to deprescribe. The form concept related to the presentation of the recommendation and the terminology used.

Figure 2
Language framework of deprescribing recommendations.

Content

Most guidelines contained recommendations about who may be eligible for deprescribing (ie, identifying the population of interest), what to deprescribe (ie, the medicine/drug class) and when or why to deprescribe (table 2). When and why were grouped due to significant overlap between these concepts (eg, a recommendation suggesting medication cessation when a person was in disease remission encompassed both when and why to trial deprescribing). Although 91% of guidelines contained one or more recommendations about when or why to deprescribe, clarity was often lacking. For example, one recommendation stated '… should be minimised to less than 7.5 mg/day (prednisone equivalent) and, when possible, withdrawn', alluding to when to deprescribe, yet not providing clear directives in terms of duration of use.

Table 2
Content characteristics of deprescribing recommendations identified through conventional content analysis

The how category was dichotomised into two subcategories to convey the difference in detail provided by recommendations. A brief process described recommendations that had some information about how to deprescribe (eg, 'reduce the dose gradually'), whereas detailed process recommendations provided additional guidance on dose reduction (eg, 'Reduce to 75%, 50%, and 25% of the original dose on a biweekly basis before stopping') monitoring, counselling or the implementation of co-interventions to facilitate deprescribing. Although 68% of the 80 guidelines contained one or more recommendations about how to deprescribe, only 58% provided detailed guidance.

When comparing deprescribing-focused guidelines and treatment guidelines, deprescribing-focused guidelines consistently addressed each content category of Bloom and Lahey's framework to a greater extent than their treatment counterparts (table 2).

US recommendations

The 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for early and established RA recommend adding GCs to DMARDs during disease flares, at the lowest dose and for the shortest period possible. In contrast to the European recommendations, adding GCs when a csDMARD is initiated depends on disease activity.

Taken together, these international recommendations agree on the use of GCs for disease flare and possibly at the start of a new csDMARD. Specific advice concerning dosage, duration, route of administration and strategies is limited and less consensual, because reliable and detailed evidence is scarce. For US recommendations, a dose < 10 mg/day is considered a low dose, and GCs should be tapered in less than 3 months, whereas for European recommendations, the threshold is 7.5 mg/day, and GCs could be prescribed in combination with csDMARDs for up to 6 months maximum, knowing that this duration is mainly expert-driven. Despite these differences, international guidelines underline the importance of GCs but also advocate the use of GCs at the lowest cumulative dose possible because of the high awareness of potentially associated adverse effects.

In these sets of recommendations as well as in this review, GCs dosages are expressed in prednisone equivalent.

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

Recommendation R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice).

### Glucocorticoid withdrawal schemes in chronic medical disorders. A systematic review [^114w1U6T]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This systematic review highlights the uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of glucocorticoid withdrawal in many chronic diseases, elucidating the need for further research in this area. The problem of glucocorticoid withdrawal seems to be good example for wide variation in physicians' approaches to weaning patients off glucocorticoids. This practice variation appears justified, given the well known extraordinary array of individual reactions to systemic glucocorticoid therapy [44], the obligation to individualize treatment, and scientific uncertainty. Moreover, only sparse information concerning health-related quality of life, well-being and symptoms, and socioeconomic sequelae after glucocorticoid withdrawal is available from published randomized trials. In conclusion, clinicians and patients need many more — and in a number of conditions, initial — high quality studies to assess the safety and efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid withdrawal schedules in chronic diseases.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — tapering and discontinuation strategies are described with limited evidence: "There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering", and "Once glucocorticoids are targeted down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy". One approach is "a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (e.g., 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps", whereas others "prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated". Evidence generation is ongoing as "An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOAST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved (87)". During taper, "Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency", and "If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented".

European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society guideline — clinical scope and tapering principles: Chronic glucocorticoid therapy results in "at least 1% of the population" using it and "being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency", and this risk "is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility". Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it "necessitates careful education and management of affected patients". Tapering "can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency", and "in general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly with a supraphysiological dosage range, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing". The "degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure" and "recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals".

Systemic glucocorticoid taper for non-endocrine conditions — short-term versus long-term, withdrawal, and transition: We suggest not to taper in short-term therapy of < 3–4 weeks and state glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing; for long-term therapy, taper only if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required, aiming toward a physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with temporary dose increase and prolongation of taper if severe. We recommend against routine adrenal insufficiency testing on supraphysiologic doses or when glucocorticoids are still needed. We suggest switching from long-acting (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting agents are no longer needed. We suggest that at a physiologic daily dose equivalent, patients either continue gradual taper with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or be tested with a morning serum cortisol.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during taper — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper; when glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is present, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome, and in a recent study symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — non-biochemical tapering and monitoring: In Scenario 1, biochemical confirmation of normal cortisol production is not desired/feasible; the steps are to gradually taper down glucocorticoids and eventually stop, and to closely monitor the patient for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency/glucocorticoid withdrawal throughout the tapering period and after glucocorticoid discontinuation. If there are clinical concerns, options are to move to Scenario 2 or temporarily increase the glucocorticoid dose and taper down over a longer period.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

Abstract

Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. This results in at least 1% of the population using chronic glucocorticoid therapy, being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. This risk is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility. Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it necessitates careful education and management of affected patients. Tapering glucocorticoids can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency. In general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly within a supraphysiological range, followed by a slower taper when on physiological glucocorticoid dosing. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. This first European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society joint clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid clinicians involved in the care of patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to take into account the possibility of corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during corticosteroid taper. Consider increasing the corticosteroid dose temporarily to the most recent one that was tolerated if corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome is severe, and extending the duration of corticosteroid taper.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid tapering corticosteroids in patients on short-term corticosteroid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, regardless of the dose. Consider discontinuing corticosteroids in these cases without testing due to low concern for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression.

A 76-year-old woman was admitted to hospital from the rheumatology outpatient clinic for investigation of fatigue, malaise, emotional lability, muscle weakness, productive cough and postural hypotension. She had been taking prednisone 60–40mg daily for 6weeks for suspected giant cell arteritis, along with six other regular medications, and had recently finished a course of antibiotics. During her admission she underwent many investigations (mostly negative) and treatments (largely harmful). When the diagnosis of adverse drug reaction was eventually reached, her medications were withdrawn and her symptoms gradually resolved. She was discharged home 1month after admission, vowing never to return following her 'stormy course'. Adverse drug reactions are a common cause of avoidable hospital admissions in the elderly, estimated to cost billions every year. The single greatest risk factor for adverse drug reactions is the number of medications a person takes. Deprescribing to reduce potentially inappropriate medication is a possible way forward.

Glucocorticoid tapering and persistent adrenal insufficiency — patients with a history of glucocorticoid treatment/exposure presenting with manifestations of Cushing syndrome should be assumed to have a fully suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and managed accordingly, and we suggest evaluation by an endocrinology specialist if there is no recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent and also for patients on glucocorticoids with a history of adrenal crisis. Adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after cessation, and persistent impairment beyond four years suggests recovery is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued, with additional testing beyond four years considered case-by-case. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone, and education is necessary on adjusting substitution doses during stressful situations to prevent or manage adrenal crises.

7 Stewardship and Tapering of OCS

Given the evidence of OCS dose‐sparing effects of add‐on biologics and the acceptable safety profiles of these treatments, biologics can play a key role in OCS stewardship and reducing OCS dependence. As the use of biologics has become more common, tapering and cessation of OCS, even for long‐term users, has become more feasible, although clear guidance on how best to reduce OCS has been lacking.

OCS doses must be reduced gradually because abrupt discontinuation can result in adrenal insufficiency or a life‐threatening adrenal crisis. Use of OCS, even short term and at low doses, suppresses the natural production of glucocorticoids by preventing the release of corticotropin‐releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary gland. Over time, hypoplasia and atrophy of the adrenal glands can occur, reducing their capacity to produce hormones such as cortisol. After discontinuation of external glucocorticoids, adrenal insufficiency, when the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol, can occur. The estimated absolute risk of adrenal insufficiency in patients with asthma taking any OCS is 49%. The risk of adrenal insufficiency or a life‐threatening adrenal crisis is highest for patients abruptly discontinuing OCS and those who have received OCS for 3–4 weeks or more. However, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should also be considered in patients withdrawing from a short course of OCS. For example, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving a 14‐day course of OCS (40 mg), adrenal suppression was noted in 8 of the 9 patients by the last day of therapy, with 3 patients still experiencing adrenal dysfunction 21 days after discontinuation.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.)

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to attempt tapering corticosteroids in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy only if the underlying disease for which corticosteroids were prescribed is controlled, and corticosteroids are no longer required. Taper corticosteroids in these cases until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (4–6 mg prednisone).

### New guidelines on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency: the end of short synacthen test in rheumatology? [^113oKEDG]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of GIAI were recently published for the first time by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the Endocrine Society (ES). The experts recommend that the risk for adrenal insufficiency should be considered for GC treatment durations exceeding 3–4 weeks and doses greater than the physiological levels (ie, equivalent of 15–25 mg/day hydrocortisone or 4–6 mg/day prednisone). Figure 1 summarises the two proposed approaches for managing the risk of adrenal insufficiency during the discontinuation of GC therapy. The initial step in both approaches involves tapering GC doses to physiological replacement levels, following a switch from long-acting GCs (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to short-acting GCs (eg, prednisone or hydrocortisone) when applicable. Interestingly, the recent STAR study demonstrated that tapering prednisone by 1 mg/day each month or replacing prednisone with 20 mg/day of hydrocortisone for 3 months, followed by a reduction to 10 mg/day for an additional 3 months, resulted in comparable rates of successful GC withdrawal at 1 year in patients with RA. Once tapering of GC doses to physiological levels has been achieved, the ESE/ES experts propose two options: either gradually tapering GCs while monitoring for clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency (option 1), or, more cautiously, assessing morning serum cortisol levels at least 24 hours after the last GC dose (option 2). To date, no studies have shown the superiority of either approach. Physicians must keep in mind that, in addition to implementing an appropriate GC discontinuation scheme, preventing adrenal crises necessitates patient education on sick-day rules, emphasising the importance of temporarily increasing GC doses during periods of physiological stress or surgical procedures.

### Tapering of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: an overview for daily practice [^114jPjUm]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

In this Review, we discuss the possibility of drug tapering in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission or low disease activity, for glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We review international guidelines and recommendations, as well as remaining uncertainties, and provide an overview of the current literature. Three strategies of tapering are discussed: (1) tapering by discontinuation of one of the drugs in combination therapy regimens, (2) tapering by reducing the dose of one of the drugs in combination therapy regimens, and (3) tapering by dose reduction of monotherapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We discuss the outcomes and robustness of evidence of trials and observational cohorts, and we give a trajectory for further research and drug tapering in daily practice.

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

Clinical Question II: What Is the Optimal Tapering Scheme in Patients no Longer Requiring Chronic Glucocorticoid Treatment for the Underlying Condition?

Four randomized-controlled trials were included, and one single-arm study. The GRADE table is shown in Supplementary Table S5, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S6 (see section on Supplementary Material). Three studies compared the effects of a tapering scheme of glucocorticoids vs placebo after short-term use of high dose glucocorticoids in a total of 135 patients with multiple sclerosis, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. One study compared the effects of tapering vs continuing glucocorticoids after long-term use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who achieved remission or low disease activity, so only data of the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131) were considered. The last study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after beralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma. Although adrenal function was not the primary endpoint of included studies, Burmester et al predefined symptomatic adrenal insufficiency as one of their secondary outcomes, and Menzies-Gow et al as a safety outcome, and from the three other studies data on (serious) adverse events and hospital readmission were used as a proxy for symptomatic adrenal insufficiency/adrenal crisis. The data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency and no clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up in all five studies.

Although the total number of included patients is relatively small and there is heterogeneity due to various underlying diseases, results from the included studies suggest that it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term use of high dose glucocorticoids. After long-term use of glucocorticoids, more rapid tapering of glucocorticoids when on a supraphysiologic dosing, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing, appears to be a safe strategy. There were no studies identified comparing different tapering schemes.

Summary of Recommendations

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

1. General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

Rationale

Clinicians prescribing long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy should actively educate their patients about the potential development of adverse manifestations associated with exogenous Cushing syndrome during extended use. Furthermore, patients need to be informed about the risks of adrenal insufficiency, especially when tapering glucocorticoid medication below the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see Definitions section). Clinicians should also provide comprehensive guidance on the importance of stress dosing with glucocorticoids. (see recommendation 3.1). Informing patients of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids and methods to monitor and mitigate these outcomes is crucial to enhancing the beneficial aspects of glucocorticoid therapy while minimizing the undesired adverse events and risks thereof. Education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crises. Lastly, all patients initiating a glucocorticoid taper should be educated on the possibility of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal have substantial overlap with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and in some cases a disease flare, and can impede the tapering of glucocorticoids (see recommendation 2.3). Anticipation of these potential symptoms can increase awareness and minimize the need for urgent care.

R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

Recommendations

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112yXkR9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5–7 or 10–14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

Definitions

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency, is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — 3–4 weeks, or greater
Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

Physiologic daily dose equivalent: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above)
Short-term glucocorticoid therapy: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration
Long-term glucocorticoid therapy: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)
Glucocorticoid taper: Taper of glucocorticoid therapy dose, initially guided by the management of the underlying disease (= therapeutic taper), and later by the management of glucocorticoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency (= endocrine taper)
Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome: Symptoms experienced when lowering glucocorticoid dose within the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dose range, that are not due to the underlying disease for which the glucocorticoids were initially prescribed for and per definition not due to untreated adrenal insufficiency, as the total glucocorticoid daily dose is still supraphysiologic

Glucocorticoid doses vary based on glucocorticoid agent and are defined as physiologic within the lower and upper ranges to illustrate the inter-individual differences. In the recommendations, prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably.

Results

From the whole cohort (n = 310), GC-free patients at the cohort entry (n = 47), patients with incomplete follow-up (n = 53) and patients with incomplete data (n = 30) have been excluded from this analysis. A total of 148 patients have been included. Their epidemiological and clinical characteristics at study entry are summarised in table 1. In short, patients were predominantly Caucasians (98.6%), at study entry the mean age was 42.2 ± 12.5 and disease duration was 13.9 ± 9.1 years; as expected, musculoskeletal manifestations (76.3%) were the most prevalent manifestations during the disease course and approximately half the patients had a history of haematological, cutaneous or renal manifestations (57.5%, 56.2% and 53.4%, respectively).

Table 1
Characteristics of the cohort

Clinical characteristics at GC withdrawal

GC withdrawal was attempted in 91 patients (61.5%) during the 6 years of follow-up; the median daily dosage of GC in use when GC tapering was started was 5 mg/prednisone equivalent (IQR 2.5–5), and the median time required to completely withdrawn GC resulted 11 months (IQR 6–15).

GCs were successfully stopped in 77 patients (84.6%), while 14 (15.4%) patients were not able to discontinue treatment due to symptom flares during the period of reduction (mainly arthralgias and fatigue). The mean yearly rate of GC discontinuation therefore resulted in 8.7%.

Table 2 reports the characteristics of patients for whom GC withdrawal was attempted at the time of the physician's decision. Patients who attempted GC withdrawal were slightly younger (mean 40.7 ± 12 years vs 44.6 ± 13, p = 0.06) with less organ damage (mean SLICC 0 0–1) vs 1 0–2), p = 0.033), while disease duration was similar to the group who had never attempted GC withdrawal.

Rationale

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods to taper the dose, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose (Table 2). In the vast majority of cases, glucocorticoid taper does not cause any clinical endocrine concerns. In rare cases, however, when long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy has resulted in prolonged suppression of HPA axis (greater than 1 year), or when patients experience adrenal crises, referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered (see recommendation 2.11). However, it should be recognized that endocrinology providers have no specialized diagnostic approaches or therapies to facilitate unique care of glucocorticoid tapering. In this regard, the education and approach to stopping glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical process that every clinician who prescribes glucocorticoids should be familiar with.

R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

### Dexamethasone in the era of COVID-19: friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^111TYdVQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

According to Axelrod et al. for patients who used corticosteroids for a period of less than or equal to 7 days, medication withdrawal can be done abruptly, without risk of adrenal suppression. More recent references suggest that, when used for less than 14 days, there would be a low risk of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression. We suggest that the time for abrupt suspension should be assessed individually, and can be considered for patients who used low doses of corticosteroids for a period of less than or equal to 14 days. For those who used higher doses (greater than or equal to the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisone per day) for more than 7 days, we suggest a gradual dose reduction. When treatment is carried out for a longer period than 14 days, a gradual reduction according to the total dose administered is usually recommended. We suggest, for patients using a daily dose greater than 40 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), to start with a reduction of 5 to 10 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is between 20 and 40 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest a reduction of 5 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is between 10 and 20 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest a reduction of 2.5 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is less than 10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest reducing 2.5 mg every 2 to 4 weeks and then administer 2.5 mg of prednisone on alternate days during 2 to 4 weeks until complete suspension. It is important to remember that, for patients using insulin, dose adjustment should be performed during the corticosteroid removal. Wallace et al. recommends reducing insulin dose by 0.1 units/kg for every 10-mg reduction in the prednisone dose. A summary of the suggested approach is shown in Fig. 2.

Clinical context

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use. Other causes are outlined in Table 1.

Causes of central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis e.g. pituitary apoplexy. In other situations a low morning cortisol level in an at risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed (see below).

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones with GH being the most common pituitary hormone affected followed by gonadotrophins and culminating in loss of ACTH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). ACTH however can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids.

Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism is important as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Testing for central hypoadrenalism

Interrogation of the HPA axis is performed as part of a formal screening process for hypopituitarism in patients with organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease such as those with sellar/parasellar tumours, post pituitary surgery or apoplexy, history of cranial irradiation or traumatic brain injury. In other situations the assessment may be triggered by suggestive symptoms such as fatigue, unexplained weight loss, spontaneous hypoglycaemia or hyponatraemia.

Timing of assessment

ACTH suppression from exogenous steroids

ACTH suppression and subsequent cortisol deficiency can result from chronic glucocorticoid use, can be unpredictable regardless of dose and duration of glucocorticoid and recovery can take weeks to years. Patients on long-term glucocorticoids for inflammatory conditions are frequently referred to specialist endocrine services for assessment of possible ACTH suppression. As prednisone can cross-react with the cortisol assay we suggest waiting until the patient is tapered to a dose of 5 mg at which point they are switched to an equivalent dose hydrocortisone 10 mg twice daily and a dynamic test can be carried out with the dose held the afternoon before and morning of the test.

Glucocorticoid tapering safety — Evidence from included studies: One study considered only the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131), and another evaluated a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after benralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma; across all five studies, the data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency or clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up. The authors note that these results suggest it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term high-dose use, and that after long-term use, more rapid tapering at supraphysiologic dosing followed by a slower taper at physiologic dosing appears safe; no studies compared different tapering schemes.

### Viewpoint: glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: points to (re) consider [^117GjZAK]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent studies on GCs have strongly advanced our understanding of bridging and chronic add-on GC therapy, including the pros and cons of stopping. The double-blind SEMIRA trial showed that RA patients with stable low disease on tocilizumab and prednisone 5 mg/day can taper and stop GCs in 16 weeks, with substantial risk of flare but no signs of adrenal insufficiency. The double-blind GLORIA trial in senior patients with established RA demonstrated that add-on prednisolone 5 mg/day for 2 years is effective on inflammation and damage without undue harm. After successful completion, blinded tapering of GCs was feasible in 3 months, associated with trends of increasing disease activity and flares but no signs of adrenal insufficiency. Further, even the EULAR recommendations review group reported that in RCTs with a bridging schedule, the large majority of patients were able to taper and stop GCs. This suggests that judicious use is possible if such protocols are properly implemented in the clinic. Finally, the recent CORRA trial showed that GC bridging with an initial dose of 60 mg/day, tapered to zero in 3 months, briefly suppressed disease activity but had no effect on damage progression at 1 year compared with MTX monotherapy. In other words, bridging protocols with a maximum period of 3 months as recommended by the EULAR are suboptimal.

To sum up, I offer some points for (re)consideration (Table 1). Regardless of the importance one places on the various sources of information on GCs, it is clear that there is often a trade-off between immediate benefit (on disease activity and damage) and the risk of harm, where a potentially increased risk of major clinical events in the long term is most feared. In view of the most recent evidence, I hope guideline committees can turn the page, (re)consider all available evidence and improve guidance on bridging and long-term GC treatment of RA with both benefits and harms in mind.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of HPA axis and subsequent adrenocortical function impairment. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically (Table 1).

Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even in physiologic daily dose equivalent, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. HPA axis recovery is impossible in the setting of continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids — which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency — are more likely to allow HPA recovery, provided that they are not administered at nighttime, when they can more pronouncedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer needed, we recommend changing to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to promote recovery of the HPA axis. For patients on non-oral glucocorticoids, eg, inhaled steroids, in whom there is a concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids or no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements, thus potentially enabling HPA axis to recover. For replacement of adrenal insufficiency, prednisone is usually provided as single morning dose, whereas due to shorter half-life hydrocortisone and cortisone acetate are divided into 2–3 doses with higher doses given in the morning and subsequent doses given at lunch and late afternoon if applicable.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zPiSU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4.
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

### Prednisone for the treatment of withdrawal headache in patients with medication overuse headache: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1127PKkS]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the efficacy of prednisone for treatment of withdrawal headache in patients with medication overuse headache (MOH).

Patients and Methods

In this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel designed multicentre trial, 96 consecutive patients with MOH were randomized to withdrawal treatment with either 100 mg prednisone or placebo over 5 days. Patients were enrolled if they met the International Headache Society criteria for MOH and were diagnosed with migraine or episodic tension-type headache as primary headache. Exclusion criteria comprised significant neurological or psychiatric disorders. Withdrawal symptoms, including headache severity and intake of rescue medication, were documented for 14 days after randomization.

Results

Patients treated with prednisone did not experience fewer hours of moderate or severe headache than patients receiving placebo. However, patients requested less rescue medication within the first 5 days.

Conclusions

During withdrawal in MOH, prednisone reduces rescue medication without decreasing the severity and duration of withdrawal headache.

Rationale

Due to the ease/convenience of testing, experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy (see also results of Clinical Question III). The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (eg, prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose, see Definitions). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, overnight metyrapone test and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes (see section 3). Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even amongst those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency following a glucocorticoid taper, testing can provide a safeguard in identifying those less at risk but is not a prerequisite for continued tapering.

Although proposing a serum cortisol cut-off of 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a guide, the panel suggests that the value of serum cortisol is considered as a continuum, rather than an arbitrary cut-off, with higher values more likely to indicate HPA axis recovery. Patients with very low morning cortisol levels (as a guide: < 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL)) are very likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency. In such cases, dynamic testing is unlikely to be useful. We recommend that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement aiming for the lowest safe dose and undergo repeat morning cortisol testing until recovery occurs. As a general guide, the glucocorticoid dose should provide sufficient replacement, but also a sufficient stimulus for recovery (meaning avoiding any over-replacement). Frequency of repeat measuring may range between 1 to 6 months, depending on the dose and length of glucocorticoid therapy and the prior trajectory of cortisol values.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome — this table contrasts overlapping presentations: glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome includes general malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and mood change, with signs such as Cushingoid features common, especially earlier in the glucocorticoid taper; adrenal insufficiency shows signs including weight loss, hypotension, and orthostasis, and the risk of adrenal crisis is present if not optimally treated with glucocorticoid therapy; timing differs, with withdrawal symptoms occurring at any point during glucocorticoid taper and with higher risk after long-term supraphysiologic exposure, whereas adrenal insufficiency appears only when not treated with optimal glucocorticoid therapy; biochemistry in withdrawal shows normal electrolytes with possible glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, while adrenal insufficiency shows hyponatremia and hypoglycemia; HPA axis testing is not recommended in withdrawal, and in adrenal insufficiency there are initially low ACTH and cortisol with later normal-elevated ACTH and low cortisol; general remarks note that patients may be asymptomatic at baseline but can develop symptoms — from mild to life-threatening adrenal crisis — after triggers, and recurrence of underlying autoimmune diseases can occur during tapering, with symptom overlap between adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

### Glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency [^116uT6rM]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Synthetic glucocorticoids are widely used for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. A possible unwanted effect of glucocorticoid treatment is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Factors affecting the risk of glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency (GI-AI) include the duration of glucocorticoid therapy, mode of administration, glucocorticoid dose and potency, concomitant drugs that interfere with glucocorticoid metabolism, and individual susceptibility. Patients with exogenous glucocorticoid use may develop features of Cushing's syndrome and, subsequently, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when the treatment is tapered down. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal can overlap with those of the underlying disorder, as well as of GI-AI. A careful approach to the glucocorticoid taper and appropriate patient counseling are needed to assure a successful taper. Glucocorticoid therapy should not be completely stopped until recovery of adrenal function is achieved. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting the risk of GI-AI, propose a regimen for the glucocorticoid taper, and make suggestions for assessment of adrenal function recovery. We also describe current gaps in the management of patients with GI-AI and make suggestions for an approach to the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, chronic management of glucocorticoid therapy, and education on GI-AI for patients and providers.

Response to steroids

Acute GvHD steroid refractoriness or resistance is most often referred to as either (1) progression in any organ within 3, 4, or 5 days of therapy onset with ≥ 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent, (2) failure to improve within 5 to 7 days of treatment initiation or (3) incomplete response after more than 28 days of immunosuppressive treatment including steroids. For the determination of eligibility in prospective clinical trials, alternative definitions for aGvHD steroid refractoriness may include other aspects such as: incomplete response after 14 days of therapy or use of an additional immunosuppressive agent. Chronic GvHD steroid refractoriness or resistance is typically referred to as either: (1) progression of GvHD while on prednisone at ≥ 1 mg/kg/day for 1 to 2 weeks; or (2) stable GvHD on ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day (or 1 mg/kg every other day) of prednisone for 1 to 2 months.

Steroid dependence has been defined for aGvHD as the inability to taper prednisone under 2 mg/kg/day after an initially successful treatment of at least 7 days or as the recurrence of aGvHD activity during steroid taper. The relevance of this term was shown by Martin and colleagues who demonstrated that the highest CR rates with secondary therapy were seen when aGvHD recurred during the taper phase of the primary glucocorticoid treatment, thereby distinguishing it from steroid refractory aGvHD. In cGvHD, steroid dependence refers to the inability to control GvHD symptoms while tapering prednisone below 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) in at least two individual attempts, separated by at least 8 weeks.

Finally, the term "steroid intolerance" has not been formally validated but refers to the emergence of unacceptable toxicity (e.g. uncontrolled infections, avascular necrosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myopathy, osteoporosis, etc.) attributed to corticosteroids, as evaluated by a healthcare professional.

Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

HPA axis recovery following exogenous corticosteroid exposure

Recovery of HPA axis function is unpredictable, and there are little data that accurately describe an expected time course for the recovery of adrenal function. Following discontinuation of exogenous corticosteroids, HPA axis suppression may resolve quickly (within hours or days) or persist, in some cases for up to 1 year or longer. Moreover, in some patients, endogenous cortisol secretion remains permanently suppressed. Although even a single dose of corticosteroid can cause HPA axis suppression (this is the basis for the overnight dexamethasone suppression test used to screen for Cushing syndrome), recovery is usually rapid with no adverse clinical sequelae.

Longer courses (e.g. 4 weeks or more) have been linked with longer recovery times, and, as a general rule, slow tapering after long‐term OCS usage is almost always necessary to support the recovery of normal HPA axis function. In this context, complete HPA axis recovery is unlikely to be observed until at least 4 weeks after cessation of corticosteroids. In a systematic review of systemic glucocorticoid therapy and AI in adults, 75% of patients had persistent AI 10 weeks after discontinuation of OCS (≥ 4 weeks of use), whereas 15% still had AI 3 years beyond discontinuation. Glucocorticoid exposure varied significantly across studies, but no obvious correlations were noted when AI cases were stratified by dosage or duration of corticosteroid use. Across all groups, 14% of patients who received a medium cumulative dosage (0.5–5.0 g) and 50% of those who received a high cumulative dosage (> 5.0 g) developed AI.

Currently, there is little consensus as to the optimum approach for safely tapering corticosteroids. The decision of when and how to taper corticosteroids, and when and how to monitor for AI, is usually at the clinician's discretion and based on signs and symptoms of disease control. The fear of underlying AI may actually hinder a clinician's confidence in tapering OCS. Ideally, tapering should be individualized, with continuous monitoring of the disease and AEs.

### Continuing versus tapering glucocorticoids after achievement of low disease activity or remission in rheumatoid arthritis (SEMIRA): a double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^1138zgSy]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, often receive glucocorticoids, but long-term use can produce adverse effects. Evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide tapering of oral glucocorticoids is scarce. We investigated a scheme for tapering oral glucocorticoids compared with continuing low-dose oral glucocorticoids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

The Steroid EliMination In Rheumatoid Arthritis (SEMIRA) trial was a double-blind, multicentre, two parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial done at 39 centres from six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Serbia, and Tunisia). Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving tocilizumab and glucocorticoids 5–15 mg per day for 24 weeks or more were eligible for inclusion if they had received prednisone 5 mg per day for 4 weeks or more and had stable low disease activaity, confirmed by a Disease Activity Score for 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) of 3·2 or less 4–6 weeks before and on the day of randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to either continue masked prednisone 5 mg per day for 24 weeks or to taper masked prednisone reaching 0 mg per day at week 16. All patients received tocilizumab (162 mg subcutaneously every week or 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks) with or without csDMARDs maintained at stable doses during the entire 24-week study. The primary outcome was the difference in mean DAS28-ESR change from baseline to week 24, with a difference of more than 0·6 defined as clinically relevant between the continued-prednisone group and the tapered-prednisone group. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02573012.

Findings

Between Oct 21, 2015, and June 9, 2017, 421 patients were screened and 259 (200 [77%] women and 59 [23%] men) were recruited onto the trial. In all 128 patients assigned to the continued-prednisone regimen, disease activity control was superior to that in all 131 patients assigned to the tapered-prednisone regimen; the estimated mean change in DAS28-ESR from baseline to week 24 was 0·54 (95% CI 0·35–0·73) with tapered prednisone and -0·08 (-0·27 to 0·12) with continued prednisone (difference 0·61 [0·35–0·88]; p < 0·0001), favouring continuing prednisone 5 mg per day for 24 weeks. Treatment was regarded as successful (defined as low disease activity at week 24, plus absence of rheumatoid arthritis flare for 24 weeks and no confirmed adrenal insufficiency) in 99 (77%) patients in the continued-prednisone group versus 85 (65%) patients in the tapered-prednisone group (relative risk 0·83; 95% CI 0·71–0·97). Serious adverse events occurred in seven (5%) patients in the tapered-prednisone group and four (3%) patients in the continued-prednisone group; no patients had symptomatic adrenal insufficiency.

Interpretation

In patients who achieved low disease activity with tocilizumab and at least 24 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment, continuing glucocorticoids at 5 mg per day for 24 weeks provided safe and better disease control than tapering glucocorticoids, although two-thirds of patients were able to safely taper their glucocorticoid dose.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses > 30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — biochemical confirmation pathway: In patients receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses and at high risk of adrenal insufficiency, taper down glucocorticoids to physiologic replacement doses (avoid dexamethasone), then in Scenario 2 measure early-morning serum cortisol 24 hours after the last glucocorticoid dose. A likelihood bar from HIGH to LOW displays cortisol thresholds at 150 nmol/L 5.0 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L 10.0 μg/dL. Actions presented are to continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few months, continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few weeks and consider dynamic testing, or stop glucocorticoid replacement. Separately, we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

Pathophysiology of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency emphasizes that any glucocorticoid dose above the physiologic daily dose equivalent can potentially lead to suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, that any route of administration has the potential of HPA axis suppression including oral, topical, inhaled, intra-nasal, intravenous and intra-articular administration, that immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory doses invariably result in HPA axis suppression, and that during taper within the supraphysiologic dose range patients can develop glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with clinical features similar to adrenal insufficiency.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1159BDJJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome occurs due to dependence on supraphysiologic glucocorticoids while decreasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Patients should be informed that glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms are expected to occur during the glucocorticoid dose reduction and what the differences are between glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and underlying disease flare. It should be emphasized that an insufficient glucocorticoid supply is not expected to occur when the glucocorticoid dose is greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent. As exceptions, it should be noted that the glucocorticoid requirement may be significantly higher in the case of critical illness or that glucocorticoid absorption is not guaranteed in gastroenteritis. Many of the symptoms of the withdrawal syndrome are nonspecific and overlap with symptoms of the underlying disease, especially in inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders. Managing glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and glucocorticoid taper in these patients may be especially challenging. Patients should be educated on symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal to avoid anxiety related to unexpected symptoms or reactive, unnecessary, or excessive increase in glucocorticoids.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome. Duration of exogenous glucocorticoid use, glucocorticoid dose and type, and individual susceptibility likely impact the severity and duration of glucocorticoid withdrawal, but systematic studies are lacking. In a recent study investigating glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome in patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. Symptoms are thought to occur due to an abrupt decrease in glucocorticoid exposure leading to an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome overlap with those seen in patients with untreated or not optimally treated adrenal insufficiency (Table 5), and most patients with glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome do have concomitant adrenal insufficiency. Since symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal significantly overlap, good clinical guidance to differentiate between those is to consider the total daily dose of glucocorticoids with high doses making adrenal insufficiency less likely. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — systemic glucocorticoid guidance and evidence: Summary Statement 26 states "Consider a short course of oral steroids for treatment of CRSwNP (C)", and Summary Statement 27 states "Use short-term treatment with oral steroids in CRSwNP because it decreases polyp size and alleviates symptoms. (StrRec, A)". For CRS without nasal polyps, a retrospective pediatric series noted that "oral glucocorticosteroids alone, but not antibiotics alone, led to significant radiologic improvement", and a systematic review "reported symptom resolution in 54% of patients with CRSsNP vs 51% of patients with CRS in general". In CRSwNP, one randomized trial in "60 adult patients with severe nasal polyps" used a prednisone taper "starting at 30 mg/d for 4 days with a 5-mg decrease every 2 days" versus "no steroid treatment for 2 weeks". Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial had "20 subjects per group", with prednisolone "50 mg/d for 14 days", and was "associated with improvement in rhinosinusitis outcome measurement scores, a decrease in polyp size". Other reports describe prednisone given "over a 2-week period (30 mg/d for 4 days followed by a 2-day decrease of 5 mg) followed by INSs for 10 weeks".

Use of glucocorticoids — patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target: Addition of/switching to DMARDs is conditionally recommended over continuation of glucocorticoids for patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target. This recommendation assumes that improved disease control with DMARDs should allow less use of glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because the continued use of glucocorticoids may be required for patients who do not respond to DMARDs even after maximizing methotrexate dosage and switching DMARD classes.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111Vkt1Y]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, there is no established dosage or duration of OCS that is determined to control asthma symptoms without causing AEs. Experts are calling for 'OCS stewardship' to reduce the risks, including AI, related to OCS use. To mitigate the potential for AEs, OCS use should be minimized by optimizing inhaled and biologic therapies for asthma. The availability of newer biologics has allowed for the advent of OCS‐sparing therapies in asthma, although the process by which long‐term corticosteroids should be tapered and/or discontinued has not been established. Consideration should be given to the risk of symptom recurrence and withdrawal‐induced AI.

In 2020, a consensus statement on the use of OCS was issued by 131 practitioners of specialties who frequently use OCS (mostly pulmonologists, respiratory disease specialists and allergists). Of the participating experts, more than 95% concurred that, ultimately, the goal in asthma should be to avoid the use of OCS. When OCS are required, the dosage and duration should be minimized as much as possible. Experts also agreed that individualized tapering to a minimally effective dosage (or complete discontinuation) should be attempted in all patients receiving OCS for maintenance therapy regardless of comorbid conditions. For AI risk, the experts agreed that AI is insufficiently assessed and that patients on long‐term OCS therapy should be assessed for the risk and presence of AI. This includes patients receiving OCS dosages in excess of 2.0 g per year or more than 4 repeat courses of short‐term OCS in 1 year.

### Glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus: are remission and low disease activity reliable starting points for stopping treatment? A real-life experience [^1161VaLR]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Overall, the patients at study entry were young, with a long disease duration and a full-blown disease history making this cohort well representative of the disease in Caucasian patients.

Data on the frequency of GC withdrawal in SLE are scarce and extremely heterogeneous; the main literature is summarised in table 4. The prevalence of GC-free patients in SLE cohorts is highly variable in the literature; one of the lowest frequencies is reported by Steiman et al, who described prolonged remission lasting for ≥ 5 years while taking no medications in less than 3% of the cohort; similarly, Zen et al and Urowitz et al reported a frequency of GC-free patients of less than 10%.

Table 4
Frequency of GCs-free patients in the cohorts reported in the literature

In 2013, Zahr et al reported that the dose of prednisone was reduced to < 5 mg/day in 11% of the visits of the Hopkins Lupus cohort and 55% of patients successfully remained below 5 mg for at least 1 year; ongoing cutaneous or arthritis activity were associated with unsuccessful reduction, while lack of disease activity was the only major clinical variable that significantly predicted successful reduction.

A greater experience can be found in LN, where GC withdrawal seems to be more common; the first successful experience of GC withdrawal in LN was reported by Ponticelli et al in 1988; thereafter, the same group confirmed the results in a larger study with long-term follow-up where 32% of patients were able to completely withdraw GCs and immunosuppressive drugs. Interestingly, Moroni et al did not find significant differences in the clinical presentation, histological characteristics or the type of induction therapy between patients who were able to stop treatment and those who were not, with the exception of a higher activity index in the latter.

In this cohort, we observed a higher percentage of patients in whom GC withdrawal is attempted, which may reflect the increasing knowledge of the long-term harm of even low-dose chronic GC use; this is in line with observations by Zahr et al on the increase of the successful tapering of GCs since the year 2000.

### Deflazacort (Pyquvi) [^112Gt33S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as PYQUVI, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving PYQUVI for Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after PYQUVI withdrawal. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal

Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly, and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. The risk is reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.

### Out-patient detoxification in chronic migraine: comparison of strategies [^114iULk2]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic migraine (CM) patients frequently overuse symptomatic medications (SM). These medications may create a cycle of rebound, worsening of headache and withdrawal symptoms that perpetuate the headache itself. In addition, the overuse of such substances is believed to counteract the efficacy of preventive treatments. We conducted a prospective randomized open-label trial comparing approaches to out-patient management in 150 CM patients (125 women, 25 men; ages 18–80 years, mean 40.3 ± 13.8) with overuse of SM. In each group, 50 patients received education and orientation and were then abruptly withdrawn from all SM. Immediately following withdrawal, the first group took prednisone (60 mg/ day 2 days, 40 mg/day 2 days and 20 mg/day 2 days) for 6 days, the second group did not have any regular medications to take and the third group took naratriptan (2.5 mg twice a day) during this initial period. All patients had similar profiles of headache characteristics and consumption (quality and quantity) of SM before initiation of the treatment, but most were not severe headache sufferers, heavy SM overusers or were overusing opioids. After 5 weeks the headache frequency and intensity, the prevalence and frequency of withdrawal symptoms and consumption of rescue medications during the first 6 days were compared between groups. In addition, adherence to treatment (who returned or not and for which reasons, between groups) and headache frequency, week by week, among the groups of patients were also compared. Forty-four (88%) patients from the prednisone group, 41 (82%) from the 'nothing' group and 35 (70%) from the naratriptan group adhered to the treatment and returned. The were no differences between groups with regard to treatment adherence (P = 0.072), headache frequency as well as intensity (P = 0.311) and decreasing of days with headache after 5 weeks and weekly (P = 0.275). However, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms and consumption of rescue drugs was higher among the patients who did not take regular medications during the first 6 days (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.006). We concluded that CM patients with moderate overuse of SM other than opioids may be detoxified on an out-patient basis regardless of the strategy adopted with regard to the use of regular drugs during the initial days of withdrawal, but prednisone and naratriptan may be useful for reducing withdrawal symptoms and rescue medication consumption. Further controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.

Table 5.
Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and common underlying conditions

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration of time are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (Table 5).

Slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following a curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal, and symptoms worsened once total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (eg, 7.5 prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess, and may also be applied in patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper, with slower taper in patients with high clinical severity score, and a more rapid taper in patients with lower clinical severity score. In a patient with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily to the most recent dose prior to onset of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome will usually alleviate the symptoms.

R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice)

Rationale

If the glucocorticoid dose is in the supraphysiologic range, suppression of the HPA axis is expected and it is unnecessary to test adrenal function. Similarly, testing is unnecessary in patients unable to stop glucocorticoid treatment, for example patients with organ transplants and in cases of polymyalgia rheumatica. These patients should be educated on management of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (see section R.3).

R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○)

### A different look at corticosteroids… [^1176iZBL]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Based on the benefits and risks of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, the current recommendations are not intended for all patients but only for those with confirmed or suspected HIV and PCP infection who are at high risk of respiratory failure and death. Patients at risk include those with an arterial oxygen pressure of less than 70 mm Hg or an arterial-alveolar gradient of more than 35 mm Hg. 14, 16, 19 The recommended dosing regimen is oral prednisone, 40 mg twice daily for five days, then 40 mg once daily for five days, then 20 mg daily for the duration of the anti-pneumocystis therapy. Methylprednisolone, given at 75 percent of the oral prednisone dosage, can be substituted if parenteral therapy is necessary.

Further investigation is required to determine the appropriate use and benefits of steroid therapy when the patient has concomitant life-threatening infections and when the patient has already received more than three days of anti-pneumocystis therapy and has developed significant hypoxia. 22, 26 Dexamethasone can be used for that purpose, at a dosage of 2 mg intravenously every six hours, and can eventually can be switched to an oral dosage of 2 mg every six hours.
28. Pain Management Corticosteroids are used as adjuvant analgesics for pain in cancer patients and patients with neuropathic pain such as herpes zoster–related neuropathy, spinal cord compression and pain following oral surgery. Prednisone, at a dosage of 7. 5 to 10 mg per day, may be useful in decreasing pain in some patients with advanced prostate cancer. Perioperative use of corticosteroids has been advocated to reduce pain and decrease edema and trismus following oral surgical procedures.

The most significant improvement occurs in the treatment of postoperative edema. Dosages of prednisone between 40 and 80 mg per day can be used. Maximal benefit has been achieved after third-molar extraction, although some benefit has been reported after other surgeries. 55 involving 47 patients in India, dexamethasone was found to be useful as an adjunct treatment in cases of tuberculous meningitis, especially in patients with severe disease. A more recent randomized trial 56 using prednisone in children with tuberculous meningitis showed that prednisone in a dosage of 2 to 4 mg per kg per day for one month improved survival rate and intellectual outcome.
