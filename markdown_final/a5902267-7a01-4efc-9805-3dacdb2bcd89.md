## Question

Aspirin monotherapy for massive pulmonary embolism lysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether aspirin alone can lyse a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and be used as primary treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how massive (high-risk) PE is defined and what its immediate management priorities are. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for high-risk PE. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic mechanisms of aspirin versus thrombolytics to ensure we aren't conflating antiplatelet and fibrinolytic effects. After that, I need to review the actual role of aspirin in venous thromboembolism (VTE) care, especially for secondary prevention. Finally, I will synthesize the risks of using aspirin alone, check evidence for appropriate reperfusion strategies, and confirm the bottom-line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the definition and acuity of massive PE, because if I misclassify the risk, I could pick the wrong therapy. Massive, or high-risk, PE is characterized by hemodynamic instability such as sustained hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest, and it represents a life-threatening emergency where rapid reperfusion is prioritized over routine anticoagulation alone [^115uSEkd] [^115uSEkd].

> I should now verify guideline-directed therapy for high-risk PE. Multiple high-quality guidelines recommend systemic thrombolysis for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, with anticoagulation as a backbone; ASH 2020 suggests offering thrombolytic therapy followed by anticoagulation rather than anticoagulation alone for PE with hemodynamic compromise, and CHEST 2016 similarly recommends systemic thrombolysis in hypotensive PE when bleeding risk is acceptable, while ESC 2019 recommends systemic thrombolysis for high-risk PE, all underscoring reperfusion as standard of care in this setting [^114prENX] [^113vYhaW] [^115uSEkd].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacology so I don't over-interpret aspirin's actions. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation; it does not lyse existing thrombi, whereas fibrinolytics like alteplase or tenecteplase actively break down fibrin and are the agents used for reperfusion in high-risk PE, with alteplase carrying an FDA indication for PE treatment; major guidelines do not endorse aspirin for acute PE treatment, precisely because it lacks thrombolytic activity [^115RyEey] [^112cwcM9] [^113snL8X].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about aspirin's role without checking the secondary prevention literature. I need to ensure I separate acute management from post-anticoagulation prevention. In unprovoked VTE after completing standard anticoagulation, trials like WARFASA and ASPIRE show aspirin reduces recurrent VTE modestly, and CHEST 2021/2016 and ASH 2020 discuss aspirin as an option after stopping anticoagulation or even suspending it during active anticoagulation for stable cardiovascular disease; none of these data support aspirin as monotherapy for acute massive PE [^115wvdUE] [^112UEpPj] [^113udtMh] [^11539VMv].

> Next, I should review efficacy and safety data for thrombolysis so I don't overstate or understate its benefits. Meta-analyses and trials show thrombolysis accelerates reperfusion and reduces death or hemodynamic decompensation and PE recurrence, though at the cost of increased major bleeding; this risk-benefit profile is most favorable in high-risk PE, which is why guidelines recommend it there, while in intermediate-risk PE its routine use is not advised due to bleeding concerns despite reduced decompensation in trials like PEITHO [^114CJu1K] [^1177PUjw] [^114CJu1K].

> I should double-check the harms of substituting aspirin for reperfusion in massive PE. Using aspirin alone would delay definitive reperfusion, fail to reverse right ventricular failure physiology, and increase mortality risk; even DOAC labels caution against initiating certain agents like rivaroxaban as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in hemodynamically unstable PE or when thrombolysis or embolectomy is anticipated, reinforcing that high-risk PE requires a reperfusion-first strategy rather than antiplatelet monotherapy [^115vzmNs] [^113HRHDR].

> Let me consider what to do when bleeding risk is high or thrombolysis is contraindicated, because I need to ensure completeness. Alternatives include catheter-directed reperfusion strategies and surgical embolectomy, sometimes with ECMO as a bridge in circulatory collapse; operational details around systemic alteplase dosing and peri-lytic anticoagulation management are well described and help balance efficacy with bleeding risk while still prioritizing reperfusion in massive PE [^111CWynp] [^116EvZCT] [^111yWkqL].

> In summary, I need to be explicit. Aspirin monotherapy has no role in the acute management of massive PE because it has no thrombolytic effect and would inappropriately delay life-saving reperfusion; evidence-based care is systemic thrombolysis with anticoagulation for those without prohibitive bleeding risk, or catheter-directed or surgical reperfusion when indicated, whereas aspirin is reserved, if used at all, for secondary prevention after completion of standard anticoagulation in select patients with unprovoked VTE, not for treating massive PE [^114prENX] [^113vYhaW] [^115uSEkd] [^113snL8X].

Aspirin monotherapy is **not effective** for clot lysis in massive pulmonary embolism (PE) because it neither dissolves fibrin-rich clots nor improves hemodynamics or survival. Current guidelines recommend **systemic thrombolysis** with agents such as alteplase or tenecteplase for massive PE because these therapies reduce mortality and recurrence despite an increased bleeding risk [^114prENX] [^114CJu1K]. Aspirin may be considered only for secondary prevention after completing anticoagulation — not for acute treatment [^113snL8X].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of aspirin

Aspirin **irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)**, reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation. This antiplatelet effect is useful in arterial thrombosis; however, **venous clots are fibrin-rich and relatively platelet-poor**, so aspirin does not lyse them.

---

## Clinical evidence for aspirin in massive pulmonary embolism

There is **no evidence** supporting aspirin monotherapy for massive PE; available data show only a modest benefit for **secondary prevention after anticoagulation**, not for acute treatment. The **WARFASA trial** evaluated aspirin 100 mg daily after anticoagulation and reduced recurrent VTE (6.6% vs 11.2%; HR 0.58) in secondary prevention, not acute PE [^115wvdUE]. The **ASPIRE trial** similarly tested aspirin 100 mg daily after anticoagulation and showed a non-significant reduction in recurrent VTE (4.8% vs 6.5%; HR 0.74) [^112UEpPj]. These trials excluded patients with massive PE and did not assess acute lysis or hemodynamic outcomes.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines consistently recommend **systemic thrombolysis** for massive PE — not aspirin:

- **ASH 2020**: Thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation for PE with hemodynamic compromise [^114prENX].
- **ESC 2019**: Systemic thrombolysis for high-risk (massive) PE [^115uSEkd].
- **ACCP 2016**: Systemic thrombolysis for acute PE with hypotension if bleeding risk is acceptable [^113vYhaW].

Aspirin is **not recommended** for acute PE; it may be considered only for **secondary prevention** after completing anticoagulation [^113snL8X].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of aspirin versus thrombolytic therapy

Thrombolytics (alteplase, tenecteplase) are effective for **clot lysis** and **hemodynamic improvement** in massive PE, though with increased bleeding risk. In the **PEITHO trial**, tenecteplase reduced death or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days (2.6% vs 5.6%; OR 0.44) but increased major bleeding (11.5% vs 2.4%) [^1125PLxj]. A **meta-analysis** likewise found that thrombolysis reduced early mortality (OR 0.59) and PE recurrence (OR 0.50) but increased major bleeding (OR 2.91) [^114CJu1K]. Aspirin does not provide **comparable efficacy** for acute PE lysis or hemodynamic stabilization.

---

## Safety profile of aspirin compared to thrombolytic agents

Aspirin has a **lower bleeding risk** than thrombolytics; however, this does not offset its **lack of efficacy** in massive PE. Thrombolytics increase major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, and are indicated when benefits outweigh risks [^1125PLxj].

---

## Clinical scenarios where aspirin might be considered

Aspirin may be considered only for **secondary prevention** in patients with unprovoked VTE who are stopping anticoagulation and have no contraindications [^113snL8X]. It is **not appropriate** for acute massive PE.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Aspirin monotherapy is **not effective** for clot lysis in massive PE and is not recommended for acute treatment. Systemic thrombolysis remains the **standard of care** for massive PE; catheter-directed thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy are alternatives if systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or unavailable. Aspirin may be used only for **secondary prevention** after anticoagulation.

### Fibrinolysis for patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^1125PLxj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The PEITHO study, published by Meyer G and colleagues in 2014 in The New England Journal of Medicine, investigates fibrinolysis in the context of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The trial focused on the role of tenecteplase in normotensive patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 1,005 patients (532 female, 473 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Significant bleeding risk, coagulation disorders, administration of thrombolytic agents within the previous 4 days, uncontrolled hypertension, hypersensitivity to tenecteplase, alteplase, unfractionated heparin (UFH), or conditions such as pregnancy, lactation, or parturition within the previous 30 days.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Tenecteplase group (n = 506)**: Received fibrinolysis as a single weight-based intravenous bolus of 30–50 mg tenecteplase over 5–10 seconds.
	- **Placebo group (n = 499)**: Received a single intravenous bolus matching the volume and appearance of the tenecteplase bolus.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in death or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days (2.6% vs. 5.6%; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in mortality at 7 days (1.2% vs. 1.8%; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85).
	- A significant decrease in the rate of hemodynamic compensation within 7 days (1.6% vs. 5%; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.68).
	- No significant difference in death.

This study provides valuable insights into the use of tenecteplase for managing intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism in normotensive patients.

### Revisiting ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: insights from new data [^115sKuZf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Catheter‐directed thrombolysis has historically been a primary treatment for intermediate‐high‐ and high‐risk pulmonary embolism (PE), but the past decade has seen a paradigm shift toward mechanical thrombectomy. This shift is driven by advancing technology, emerging clinical trial data, and a focus on reducing bleeding risks, particularly in high‐risk patients. However, recent data from the ERASE PE (Bern Acute Pulmonary Embolism Registry) study in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) revisits the role of ultrasound‐assisted catheter‐directed thrombolysis (USAT), providing a contemporary perspective on its efficacy and safety in managing PE.

The study highlights USAT's ability to significantly reduce right ventricular (RV) overload and pulmonary artery pressure, with an 88% success rate. The mean reduction in the RV/left ventricular ratio by 0.37 and an 8.5 mm Hg drop in pulmonary artery pressure supports USAT as an effective intervention for improving cardiac function, which is critical for stabilizing patients who are hemodynamically compromised. These findings are consistent with prior studies like ULTIMA (Ultrasound Accelerated Thrombolysis of Pulmonary Embolism) and SEATTLE II (A Prospective, Single‐Arm, Multicentre Trial of Ultrasound‐Facilitated, Low‐Dose Fibrinolysis for Acute Massive and Submassive Pulmonary Embolism), reinforcing USAT's role in reducing mortality risk by alleviating RV strain.

### Xarelto [^115vzmNs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Acute pulmonary embolism in hemodynamically unstable patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy**: Initiation of Xarelto is not recommended acutely as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.

- **Increased risk of thrombosis in patients with triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome**: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including Xarelto, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS, especially those who are triple positive (positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177PUjw]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

All 15 studies, including 2057 patients, reported early (≤ 30 days) all-cause mortality. The reported mortality was 2.3% (24/1033) in the thrombolysis group and 3.9% (40/1024) in the control group. Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in early mortality (pooled OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36–0.96, P = 0.03; Figure 2). No heterogeneity was observed among studies (I² = 0%).

After exclusion of studies including high-risk PE, the treatment effect was similar, but statistical significance was lost (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.35–1.17). The pooled ORs were similar in studies including high-risk PE (OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.2–1.15) and studies including only intermediate-risk PE (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.17–1.03), whereas the pooled OR was close to one in studies including both low- and intermediate-risk PE (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.41–2.24).

- **Efficacy outcomes, subgroup analyses**: Subgroup analysis based on the thrombolytic regimen did not show any significant differences between alteplase (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.29–1.41), tenecteplase (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26–1.64), or older thrombolytics (OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.20–1.15) (P = 0.86).

### Possible gender-related differences in the risk-to-benefit ratio of thrombolysis for acute submassive pulmonary embolism [^113NT5uS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The indications for thrombolytic treatment in normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) are still the subject of debate, and it also remains questionable whether the efficacy and safety of thrombolysis are similar in men and women. To address this issue, the present study analyzed a large population of 428 women and 291 men with acute submassive PE, derived from a prospective multicenter registry. Initial treatment consisted either of thrombolysis (< 24 hours after diagnosis) or heparin alone.

Thirty-day overall mortality was almost identical (11%) in heparin-treated men and women. Early thrombolysis was associated with drastically reduced death rates (2.7% vs. 11% in the heparin group, p = 0.033) in men, whereas the reduction was nonsignificant (p = 0.181) in women. Multivariate analysis revealed that early thrombolysis was independently associated with reduced mortality rates in men (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.96). In comparison, its favorable effect in women was marginal (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 1.97).

Gender-specific differences were also observed with regard to the reduction of symptomatic PE recurrence (in men, from 21.6% to 8.2%, p = 0.009; in women, from 16.9% to 8.3%, p = 0.049). In contrast, thrombolysis resulted in a more than threefold increase in major bleeding in women (from 8.4% to 27.1%, p < 0.001), a more pronounced effect than in men (from 6.9% to 15.1%, p = 0.055).

In conclusion, the present study generated the hypothesis that women with submassive PE might benefit less from thrombolytic treatment.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^116EvZCT]. Thorax (2014). High credibility.

What is the optimal type and dose of thrombolytic agent, and what should I do if a patient is already on low molecular weight heparin?

Thrombolytic agents for PE should be administered peripherally. Several thrombolytic agents have been studied: urokinase, streptokinase, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (alteplase, reteplase, desmoteplase, and tenecteplase). Alteplase is the most widely used thrombolytic agent for PE. Recommended dosing in patients weighing ≥ 65 kg is a loading bolus of 10 mg over 1–2 minutes, followed by 90 mg infused over 2 hours. In patients weighing < 65 kg, the total dose administered is 1.5 mg/kg; for example, a patient weighing 60 kg should receive a 10 mg loading bolus followed by 80 mg over 2 hours.

In patients already receiving intravenous heparin, we stop the infusion prior to administration of alteplase, check activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 2 hours following completion of administration, and restart heparin when the APTT ratio is < 2× the upper limit of normal. If there is a good clinical response to thrombolysis, we would convert to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 24 hours following thrombolysis. If therapeutic LMWH had been administered prior to thrombolysis, we would usually start heparin infusion as above but delay commencement to 18 hours following the last dose of LMWH if once-daily dosing and 8–10 hours if twice-daily dosing had been used.

Two RCTs have investigated the efficacy and side effects of half-dose alteplase in predominantly submassive PE. Superior efficacy with no increase in bleeding risk was observed when compared to anticoagulation alone, and equal efficacy was demonstrated.

### Catheter-directed therapies for the treatment of high risk (massive) and intermediate risk (submassive) acute pulmonary embolism [^111CWynp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a major cause of acute morbidity and mortality and can lead to long-term morbidity in up to 50% of survivors, a condition known as post-pulmonary embolism (post-PE) syndrome. APE is classified according to the short-term (30-day) risk of mortality, based on various clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings. The highest rates of mortality and morbidity are observed in high-risk (massive) and intermediate-risk (submassive) APE cases.

The first-line treatment for APE is systemic anticoagulation. High-risk (massive) APE accounts for less than 10% of all APE cases and is a life-threatening medical emergency requiring immediate reperfusion treatment to prevent death. Systemic thrombolysis is recommended for managing high-risk APE. However, systemic thrombolysis is administered to a minority of affected individuals due to comorbidities or the 10% risk of major haemorrhagic side effects, with 8% of patients not responding promptly. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy serves as an alternative reperfusion treatment but is not widely available.

Intermediate-risk (submassive) APE accounts for 45% to 65% of cases, with a short-term mortality rate of about 3%. Systemic thrombolysis is not recommended for this group, as the risk of major haemorrhagic complications outweighs the potential benefits. However, individuals at the higher risk end of the intermediate-risk category experience a short-term mortality rate of around 12%, indicating that anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient. Identifying and providing more aggressive treatment for those at intermediate to high risk is critical.

### Catheter-directed therapy for the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis of modern techniques [^112mCgxh]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Systemic thrombolysis for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) carries an estimated 20% risk of major hemorrhage, including a 3%–5% risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The authors used evidence-based methods to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of modern catheter-directed therapy (CDT) as an alternative treatment for massive PE.

- **Materials and methods**: The systematic review was initiated by electronic literature searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE) for studies published from January 1990 through September 2008. Inclusion criteria were applied to select patients with acute massive PE treated with modern CDT. Modern techniques were defined as the use of low-profile devices (≤ 10 F), mechanical fragmentation and/or aspiration of emboli including rheolytic thrombectomy, and intraclot thrombolytic injection if a local drug was infused. Relevant non-English language articles were translated into English. Paired reviewers assessed study quality and abstracted data. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects models to calculate pooled estimates for complications and clinical success rates across studies. Clinical success was defined as stabilization of hemodynamics, resolution of hypoxia, and survival to hospital discharge.

- **Results**: Five hundred ninety-four patients from 35 studies (six prospective, 29 retrospective) met the criteria for inclusion. The pooled clinical success rate from CDT was 86.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.1%, 90.2%). Pooled risks of minor and major procedural complications were 7.9% (95% CI: 5.0%, 11.3%) and 2.4% (95% CI: 1.9%, 4.3%) respectively.

### Paradoxical embolus illustrating speed of action of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in massive pulmonary embolism [^115tyGrv]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

A case of a patient who presented with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring thrombolysis with alteplase is reported. The subsequent presence of a patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolism clinically demonstrated the speed of action of the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The advantage of this class of medication when considering the treatment options for a PE in an acute setting is highlighted.

### Safety and efficacy of reduced-dose versus full-dose alteplase for acute pulmonary embolism: A multicenter observational comparative effectiveness study [^112ZfSor]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Systemic thrombolysis improves outcomes in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) but is associated with the risk of hemorrhage. The data on the efficacy and safety of reduced-dose alteplase are limited. The study objective was to compare the characteristics, outcomes, and complications of patients with PE treated with full- or reduced-dose alteplase regimens.

- **Design**: Multicenter retrospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care hospital and 15 community and academic centers of a large healthcare system.

- **Patients**: Hospitalized patients with PE treated with systemic alteplase.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Pre- and post-alteplase hemodynamic and respiratory variables, patient outcomes, and complications were compared. Propensity score (PS) weighting was used to adjust for imbalances of baseline characteristics between reduced- and full-dose patients. Separate analyses were performed using the unweighted and weighted cohorts. Ninety-eight patients were treated with full-dose (100mg) and 186 with reduced-dose (50mg) regimens. Following alteplase, significant improvements in shock index, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and supplemental oxygen requirements were observed in both groups. Hemorrhagic complications were lower with the reduced-dose compared with the full-dose regimen (13% vs. 24.5%, p = 0.014), and most were minor. Major extracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% versus 6.1%, respectively (p = 0.022). Complications were associated with supratherapeutic levels of heparin anticoagulation in 37.5% of cases.

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis with the Endowave system in the treatment of acute massive pulmonary embolism: A retrospective multicenter case series [^115suZPb]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolysis with the EndoWave peripheral infusion system in the treatment of patients with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) as compared to patients treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis.

Ten patients (five men and five women; age range, 31–85 years; mean age, 54.20 years) with massive acute PE (17 lesions) were treated with ultrasonography (US)-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis using the EndoWave system. All patients experienced hypoxia and dyspnea. There were no contraindications for thrombolysis. The angiographic findings, duration of lysis, dose of thrombolytics used, and procedural complications were recorded. The thrombolytics administered included urokinase, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and Reteplase.

Results showed that complete thrombus removal was achieved in 76% of the lesions (13 of 17), near complete thrombolysis was realized in 18% of the lesions (3 lesions), and partial thrombolysis was observed in 6% of the lesions (1 lesion). The mean time for thrombolysis was 24.76 hours ± 8.44 hours (median, 24 hours). The mean dose of tPA used for the EndoWave group was 0.88 mg/h ± 0.19 mg/h (13 lesions).

Conclusions indicate that US-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis is an effective method for treating massive PE. It has the potential to shorten the time of lysis and reduce the dose of thrombolytics required.

### Impact of the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy on the mortality of patients with acute submassive pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^111jKAEQ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

The efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unclear. Previous meta-analyses have not separately reported the proportion of patients with submassive PE.

- **Objective**: We assessed the effect of thrombolytic therapy on mortality, recurrent PE (rePE), clinical deterioration requiring treatment escalation, and bleeding in patients with submassive PE.

- **Methods**: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify all relevant randomized controlled trials comparing adjunctive thrombolytic therapy with heparin alone as initial treatments in patients with acute submassive PE. These trials reported 30-day mortality or in-hospital clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 1510 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. No significant differences were apparent in the composite endpoint of all-cause death or rePE between the adjunctive thrombolytic therapy arm and the heparin-alone arm (3.1% vs. 5.4%; RR, 0.64 [0.32–1.28]; P = 0.2). Adjunctive thrombolytic therapy significantly reduced the incidence of the composite endpoint of all-cause death or clinical deterioration (3.9% vs. 9.4%; RR, 0.44; P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant associations for major bleeding when adjunctive thrombolytic therapy was compared with heparin therapy alone (6.6% vs. 1.9%; P = 0.2).

- **Conclusions**: This meta-analysis shows that adjunctive thrombolytic therapy does not significantly reduce the risk of mortality or rePE in patients with acute submassive PE. However, adjunctive thrombolytic therapy prevents clinical deterioration.

### Tenecteplase: expanding horizons in thrombolytic therapy across various clinical indications [^112eE52F]. Heart (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous thrombolytics remain the mainstay of treatment for ischaemic stroke and retain importance for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacological and practical advantages of the fibrinolytic tenecteplase have recently led to a widespread shift in ischaemic stroke management. Meta-analysis of randomised trials demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in achieving excellent functional outcome after stroke (no disability). Trials have also extended the time window for thrombolytics in stroke to 24 hours, provided imaging demonstrates salvageable brain tissue.

Although endovascular therapy is the most effective treatment for large vessel occlusion stroke, access remains limited to major metropolitan centres in developed nations. Trials suggest that thrombolytics add value, even in patients receiving endovascular therapy, and for many patients globally, intravenous thrombolytics are the only accessible reperfusion treatment. Tenecteplase is established as the preferred thrombolytic for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, generally reserved for patients who cannot rapidly access percutaneous intervention following first medical contact. Notably, the dose used is twice that for stroke.

Pre-hospital delivery of tenecteplase by paramedics is an important strategy in rural and remote areas. While patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism benefit from systemic thrombolysis, adjunctive tenecteplase in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism has been associated with increased risk of major bleed.

### Mortality outcomes with tenecteplase versus alteplase in the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism [^112sYndE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) leads to many emergency department visits annually. Thrombolytic agents, such as alteplase, are currently recommended for massive PE, but genetically modified tenecteplase (TNK) presents advantages. Limited comparative studies exist between TNK and alteplase in PE treatment.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and mortality of TNK compared with alteplase in patients with PE using real-world evidence obtained from a large multicenter registry. Primary outcomes included mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX Global Health Research Network. Patients aged 18 years or older with a PE diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification code I26) were included. The following two cohorts were defined: TNK-treated (29 organizations, 266 cases) and alteplase-treated (22,864 cases). Propensity matching controlled for demographic characteristics, anticoagulant use, pre-existing conditions, and vital sign abnormalities associated with PE severity. Patients received TNK or alteplase within 7 days of diagnosis, and outcomes were measured at 30 days post thrombolysis.

- **Results**: Two hundred eighty-three patients in each cohort were comparable in demographic characteristics and pre-existing conditions. Mortality rates at 30 days post thrombolysis were similar between TNK and alteplase cohorts (19.4% vs. 19.8%; risk ratio 0.982; 95% CI 0.704–1.371). Rates of intracerebral hemorrhage and transfusion were too infrequent to evaluate adequately.

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^115BpxEG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for people with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and may reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor haemorrhage. This is the fourth update of the Cochrane review first published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 17 August 2020. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thrombolytic therapy followed by heparin versus heparin alone, heparin plus placebo, or surgical intervention for people with acute PE (massive/submassive). We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors (ZZ, QH) assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials and extracted data. We calculated effect estimates using the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. The primary outcomes of interest were…

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^115fMXxQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

For the management of acute intermediate pulmonary embolism (PE), systemic thrombolytic therapy was compared to anticoagulant (AC) therapy alone. Analyzing seven studies, the results showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the systemic thrombolytic therapy group and the AC group (p = 0.1851, OR = −0.40, 95% CI [−1.00 to 0.19]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%). Additionally, nine studies indicated no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two groups (p = 0.4336, OR = −0.26, 95% CI [−0.92 to 0.40]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%).

In terms of bleeding events, four studies revealed a significant increase in minor bleeding incidents with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.63, 95% CI [1.29 to 1.97]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0002%). Conversely, nine studies showed no significant difference in major bleeding between the two groups (p = 0.1142, OR = 0.71, 95% CI [−0.17 to 1.58]), although there was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 33.5%).

The analysis also examined the recurrence of PE. Six studies indicated a significant reduction in recurrent PE (rePE) with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = −1.97, 95% CI [−2.77 to −1.17]), with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%). Moreover, seven studies demonstrated a significant reduction in clinical deterioration with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = −1.30, 95% CI [−1.70 to −0.90]), also with negligible heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%).

### Effectiveness and cost effectiveness of thrombolysis in patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^111gsBs9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism is a common, life-threatening cardiopulmonary disorder with a high mortality rate within the first three months of diagnosis. Prompt anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy in patients with pulmonary embolism; thus, the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of systemic thrombolysis remains debated.

- **Recent findings**: Pulmonary embolism with cardiogenic shock and hypotension is characterized as 'massive' and is an accepted indication for thrombolysis. However, catheter-directed embolectomy, with or without local lytic therapy, is preferred in centers with appropriate experience. Acute right ventricular dysfunction is a poor prognostic indicator in patients with pulmonary embolism. The most recent randomized controlled trial of systemic thrombolysis in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction found that, compared with heparin alone, alteplase and heparin reduced the risk of clinical deterioration requiring treatment escalation, but did not reduce the risk of death. A formal cost-effectiveness analysis concluded that alteplase and heparin was slightly less effective and marginally more expensive than heparin alone in this patient population.

- **Summary**: Evidence does not support the use of thrombolytic agents in most hemodynamically stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction. However, improved methods of risk stratification may help identify subgroups of patients at high risk of death who might benefit from systemic thrombolysis.

### Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis in submassive and massive pulmonary embolism: Assessment of lung obstruction before and after catheter-directed therapy [^1141JcBv]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of ultrasound-accelerated (UA) thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism (PE), with new treatment guidelines supporting catheter-directed therapy for both massive and submassive cases. Prompt treatment is critical to rapidly resolve thrombus and restore cardiopulmonary function.

Materials and methods include a retrospective review of ten consecutive acute submassive/massive PE patients. All patients exhibited acute symptoms with CT evidence of large thrombus burden and right-ventricular (RV) dysfunction and/or failure. Post-treatment evaluation involved echocardiography (n = 7) and CT (n = 9) to assess right heart dysfunction and thrombus burden. Thrombolytic treatment using the EkoSonic Endovascular system was conducted on all patients. Clinical outcomes, complications, RV pressures, and thrombus removal were evaluated with paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, considering p < 0.05 as significant.

Results show a median thrombolytic dose of 18.0 mg tissue plasminogen activator infused over 20.8 hours. Significant decreases in RV pressures (52.0–30.0; p < 0.01) and Mastora obstructive indices (74–43; p < 0.01) were observed pretreatment and posttreatment. All patients demonstrated clinical improvement shortly after the onset of treatment. All ten patients survived to discharge, with a median ICU stay of 4 days and total hospital stay of 14 days.

In conclusion, UA thrombolysis demonstrated its potential effectiveness and safety profile in treating submassive and massive PE.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^111XoShE]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Cao et al. determined that thrombolysis, when used for acute sPE, did not result in a decrease in mortality or rePE, nor did it lead to an increase in bleeding hazards. Nevertheless, their research was constrained by a small sample size of only 594 patients and did not include the most recent clinical trial discoveries. Chatterjee et al. discovered that the use of thrombolytic treatment for acute PE was associated with reduced overall mortality. However, it also carried an increased risk of significant bleeding and brain hemorrhage. Thrombolysis in intermediate-risk PE patients resulted in a decrease in fatality rates, but it also led to an increase in the occurrence of significant bleeding episodes. Although our meta-analysis validated their findings on death, it presented contrasting results on the hazards of bleeding. The reason for this difference could be that we did not include data from the ULTIMA trial, which used catheter-directed alteplase, and Goldhaber et al.'s study, which did not provide clear information about significant bleeding events in the subgroup with right-ventricular hypokinesis. These factors probably influenced the variability in the assessment of significant bleeding incidents.

Overall, these findings underscore the importance of individualized patient assessment and risk stratification in the management of PE. The use of CDT plus AC in sPE offers significant mortality benefits but comes with increased bleeding risks, necessitating a balanced consideration of benefits and risks.

### Current controversies in thrombolytic use in acute pulmonary embolism [^1139oRAt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) has an annual incidence of 100,000 cases in the United States and is divided into three categories: nonmassive, submassive, and massive. Several studies have evaluated the use of thrombolytics in submassive and massive PE.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an updated review of the controversy about the use of thrombolytics in submassive and massive PE.

- **Discussion**: Nonmassive PE is defined as PE in the setting of no signs of right ventricular strain (echocardiogram or biomarker) and hemodynamic stability. Submassive PE is defined as evidence of right ventricular strain with lack of hemodynamic instability. Massive PE occurs with occlusive thromboembolism that causes hemodynamic instability. Thrombolysis is warranted in patients with massive PE. Thrombolytic use in submassive PE with signs of right ventricular strain or damage presents a quandary for physicians. Several recent studies have evaluated the use of thrombolytics in patients with submassive PE. These studies have inconsistent definitions of submassive PE, evaluate differing primary outcomes, and use different treatment protocols with thrombolytics and anticoagulation agents. Although significant study heterogeneity exists, thrombolytics can improve long-term outcomes, with decreased bleeding risk with half-dose thrombolytics and catheter-directed treatments. Major bleeding significantly increases in patients over age 65 years. The risks and benefits of thrombolytic treatment — primarily improved long-term outcomes — should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^116r6Un1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and might reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor hemorrhages.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute PE.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were sought through the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group's Specialised Register (January 18, 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and SCISEARCH (all November 2004). Individual trial collections and private databases were also searched, along with bibliographies of relevant articles. Relevant medical journals were hand-searched. The most recent search was on February 6, 2006.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials were included if they compared thrombolytic therapy with placebo, heparin, or surgical intervention in patients with acute PE. Trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug were not included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors (DB and WQ) assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Results were similar between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or with placebo and heparin in terms of: death rate (odds ratio and further results were not provided).

### Simultaneous thrombolysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute massive pulmonary emboli [^111yWkqL]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used in patients with circulatory collapse or extremely unstable hemodynamics caused by acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The effectiveness of simultaneous thrombolytic therapy has been rarely investigated in these patients after being stabilized with ECMO.

- **Methods**: From January 2008 to December 2018, consecutive patients with acute massive PE requiring ECMO support in a tertiary medical center were included for retrospective analysis.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients with PE underwent ECMO implantation and received subsequent thrombolytic therapy as a definitive treatment for PE. All patients survived their ECMO courses to a successful decannulation, with a mean ECMO support duration of 6.23 ± 4.69 days. Eleven patients (84.62%) survived to hospital discharge. All survivors were alive during follow-up, although 2 patients (18.2%) had permanent dysfunctional neurologic complications. Major bleeding complications occurred in 4 patients (30.77%), whereas no patient had intracranial hemorrhage. Systemic thrombolysis showed comparable outcomes to catheter-directed thrombolysis in our patients who underwent ECMO.

- **Conclusions**: A thrombolysis-based therapeutic strategy under ECMO could be a relatively safe and effective definitive treatment for patients with acute massive PE, even for those who were resuscitated. Bleeding complications remain a major concern and should be monitored and managed immediately.

### Aspirin for preventing the recurrence of venous thromboembolism [^115wvdUE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The study WARFASA was published by Becattini C and colleagues in 2012 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. In the WARFASA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of aspirin for the prevention of recurrent VTE? The study design was multicenter, double-blinded, RCT. The population included 402 patients (145 female, 257 male).

The inclusion criteria were patients with first-ever unprovoked VTE who had completed 6 to 18 months of oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment. The key exclusion criteria were cancer, major thrombophilia, an indication for long-term anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF) or prosthetic heart valve, active bleeding or high risk for bleeding, allergy or intolerance to aspirin, and life expectancy of less than 6 months.

The interventions were:

- **Aspirin group**: n = 205 received aspirin (100 mg daily for 2 years)
- **Placebo group**: n = 197 received a matching placebo daily for 2 years

The primary outcome was a significant decrease in recurrence of VTE (6.6% vs. 11.2%; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.93). Secondary outcomes included a significant decrease in recurrence due to pulmonary embolism (6.7% vs. 13.5%; HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.88), but no significant difference in recurrence due to deep vein thrombosis (6.5% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.2) or death (1.4% vs. 1.3%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.42). Safety outcomes showed no significant difference in adverse events and major bleeding episodes.

The conclusion was that in patients with first-ever unprovoked VTE who had completed OAC treatment, aspirin reduced the recurrence of VTE without an increase in major bleeding.

### Fibrinolytic therapy in pulmonary embolism: An evidence-based treatment algorithm [^116kAfbp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with pulmonary embolism (PE) exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical severity. While some may present with frank hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest, others might have an asymptomatic PE discovered incidentally during the workup of another condition. Fibrinolytic therapy is an option in treating PE due to its ability to rapidly dissolve thromboembolic clots. However, the use of fibrinolytics in treating PE is a controversial topic, leaving many physicians unsure about the best treatment approach.

A rational decision on whether fibrinolytic therapy is indicated should be based on assessing the potential benefit for each patient, weighed against the risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. There is a clear benefit-risk ratio for fibrinolytic therapy in patients with PE who present with cardiac arrest and those who are hemodynamically unstable due to a massive PE. With proper risk assessment, select patients with stable hemodynamics and right ventricular dysfunction may also benefit from fibrinolytic therapy. Conversely, there is no benefit to fibrinolytic treatment in patients with stable hemodynamics and normal right ventricular function. This article reviews the literature on fibrinolytic therapy for PE treatment and proposes an evidence-based treatment algorithm.

### Eliquis [^113w3q2p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Eliquis, a factor Xa inhibitor, is indicated for several critical uses:

- **Reduce risk of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation**: Eliquis is specifically indicated to minimize the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

- **Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery**: It is also prescribed for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery.

- **Treatment of deep vein thrombosis**: Eliquis is approved for the treatment of DVT.

- **Treatment of pulmonary embolism**: It is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE).

- **Reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE**: Eliquis is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy.

### Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism [^111cwgSF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among cardiovascular diseases, following coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi-detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE by visualizing the peripheral pulmonary arteries, thus increasing its rate of diagnosis. Consequently, more cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have been identified.

These conditions are usually found in patients with few or none of the classic PE symptoms, such as hemoptysis, pleuritic pain, acute dyspnea, or circulatory collapse. However, in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary (C/P) reserve, classic PE symptoms can be associated with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is often discovered in asymptomatic patients through diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons, such as routine CTs for cancer staging in oncologic patients.

Traditionally, all PEs are treated with anticoagulation therapy in a similar manner, irrespective of the thrombi's location, number, and size. It has been suggested that many patients with SSPE may receive treatment without benefit, potentially increasing adverse events due to unnecessary use of anticoagulants. Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may present a more benign clinical profile compared with those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis of these patients must be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

### Midterm prognosis of patients with pulmonary embolism receiving catheter-directed thrombolysis or systemic thrombolysis: A nationwide population-based study [^114EjFHd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In our analysis, we found that for patients with PE, CDT might be more effective than ST in terms of reducing in‐hospital mortality, all‐cause mortality, and rePE, whereas the bleeding risk of both forms of treatment is essentially equal. This result should be cautiously validated in further randomized trials to confirm our findings and guide clinical practice.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^11195fkm]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis has some limitations. There was variability among the included studies regarding design, patient populations, intervention protocols, and outcome measures, which could be resolved using a random-effects model. Publication bias remains a possibility, especially since studies with negative or inconclusive results are less likely to be published. Inconsistent reporting of outcomes and the focus on short-term outcomes posed challenges, providing limited information on long-term effects. In addition, the study did not discuss the impact of differences in anticoagulant dosages or timing of thrombolysis. Only English-language studies were included, potentially excluding relevant research in other languages and affecting the comprehensiveness of the findings.

### Thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^112LeLUo]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The role of thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials to assess the effect of thrombolysis in these patients.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized studies comparing thrombolysis and heparin for the initial treatment of hemodynamically stable PE patients. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The number needed to harm (NNH) to cause a major bleeding (MB) or an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid one death were also calculated.

- **Results**: Eleven studies (1833 patients) were included: seven with rt-PA, three with tenecteplase, and one with urokinase. Patients randomized to thrombolysis had a significantly increased risk for MB (5.9% vs. 1.9%; OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.68–4.76, I2 18.7%), and an increased risk for ICH (1.74% vs. 0.6%; OR 2.36, 95% CI 0.98–5.71, I2 0%) and for fatal bleeding (1.3% vs. 0.54%; OR 1.84, 95% CI 0.73–4.61, I2 0%). A non-significant reduction for all-cause death (1.74% vs. 2.51%; OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37–1.26, I2 0%) and a significant reduction for recurrent PE (rePE) (1.1% vs. 2.5%; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21–0.92, I2 0%) in favor of thrombolysis compared with heparin was found. The NNH to cause a MB or an ICH was 27 and 91 patients, respectively. The NNT to avoid one death was 125 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Due to increased risk for MB and ICH with no evidence of reduction in mortality, thrombolysis should not be used for most normotensive PE patients.

### Efficacy of alteplase thrombolysis for ED treatment of pulmonary embolism with shock [^111mP8Wy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Our objective was to assess the efficacy and tolerance of thrombolysis using 0.6 mg/kg of Alteplase in patients with massive pulmonary embolism, defined as the association of a pulmonary embolism with shock. We retrospectively included 21 patients presenting with a massive pulmonary embolism confirmed by either scintigraphy or spiral computed tomography. Patients were treated based on a standard rationale, followed by thrombolysis with 0.6 mg/kg Alteplase over a period of 15 minutes. Hospital mortality, vital signs before and 2 hours after thrombolysis, and incidence of hemorrhagic events were recorded. Five patients (23.8%) died; four of these deaths occurred during the first 4 hours after hospital admission. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SpO2) were significantly improved 2 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis. Five minor hemorrhagic events occurred. This study demonstrates that for patients with pulmonary embolism and shock, a bolus treatment with Alteplase is potentially effective and well tolerated.

### Successful surgical treatment of clot in transit with impending paradoxical embolism: A case report [^116kWVik]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). High credibility.

A clot in transit (CIT) with massive pulmonary embolism is an almost uniformly fatal condition, necessitating surgical management in high-risk patients where thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed. Impending paradoxical embolism (IPDE) is an additional poor prognostic indicator, making a multidisciplinary approach and surgery the treatment of choice.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is usually the study of choice, providing essential data such as ventricular function, pulmonary artery pressure, other septal defects, and the identification of thrombi in the systemic circulation. In a systematic review by Seo and colleagues, TEE was found to be superior to transthoracic echocardiography for direct thrombus visualization and should be considered in patients who develop pulmonary embolism with a paradoxical embolic event. It should be noted that in our case, computed tomography played a crucial role in the diagnosis, documenting not only the characteristics of the pulmonary embolism but also the presence of thrombogenic obstruction of the left subclavian artery, which enhanced the diagnosis and efficiency of the intervention.

The association of CIT and IPDE is a rare condition, with limited reports in the literature. The only two systematic reviews of IPDE conclude that surgical thromboembolectomy is associated with lower mortality from systemic embolism compared with anticoagulation and thrombolysis. Seo and colleagues suggest that surgery is the most appropriate treatment option for a hemodynamically stable patient with a thrombus trapped in a patent foramen ovale (PFO), whereas thrombolysis should be reserved for other scenarios.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^116CgzFF]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical condition requiring effective management strategies. Several options are available, including thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants.

- **Objectives**: To assess the impact of thrombolytic therapy either combined with anticoagulant (AC) or alone versus AC alone on mortality, recurrence, clinical deterioration, bleeding, and hospital stay.

- **Method**: This study included 25 previously published studies from 1990 to 2023, with a total of 12,836 participants. Dichotomous and continuous analysis models were used to evaluate outcomes, with heterogeneity and publication bias tests applied. A random model was used for data analysis. Several databases were searched for the identification and inclusion of studies, such as Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Embase.

- **Results**: For sub-massive PE, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) plus AC significantly reduced in-hospital, 30-day, and 12-month mortality compared to AC alone, with an odds ratio (OR) of -0.99 (95% CI [-1.32 to -0.66]). There was an increased major bleeding risk but no difference in minor bleeding or hospital stay, OR = 0.46 (95% CI [-0.03 to 0.96]). For acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy did not affect all-cause or in-hospital mortality but increased minor bleeding, reduced recurrence of PE, and prevented clinical deterioration. The heterogeneity of different models in the study varied from 0% to 37.9%.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of CDT to AC improves mortality outcomes for sub-massive PE but raises the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy reduces recurrence and prevents clinical deterioration.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^112CxCQu]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Which patients with submassive PE should I thrombolyse? The pro–con debate published in this issue of Thorax highlights the controversy regarding systemic thrombolytics in normotensive patients with PE. Clinical trials have demonstrated more rapid, immediate haemodynamic improvement and clot resolution following thrombolysis, but not clear mortality benefits. Recent data from a large unselected national registry demonstrated that thrombolysis in normotensive patients with acute PE was associated with increased mortality. Consideration for thrombolysis therefore requires risk stratification. Validated severity scoring systems, such as the PE Severity Index (PESI), can identify clinical features at the time of presentation associated with poorer outcomes.

European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines suggest assessing for RV dysfunction (using echocardiography, CT, or B-type natriuretic peptide) or ischaemia (troponin) to aid risk stratification. The presence of lower limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has also been associated with poorer survival. By combining these factors, it is possible to identify a higher risk population with 30-day mortality > 20%.

A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of thrombolysis in massive and submassive PE published prior to 2004 reported a risk of major bleeding of 9.1% and intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) of 0.5% while a recent large RCT of tenecteplase in submassive PE (PEITHO) observed rates of major bleeding of 6.3% and ICH of 2% compared with 1.5% and 0.2% respectively for heparin alone.

### Advanced management of intermediate- and high-risk pulmonary embolism: JACC focus seminar [^113HRHDR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Intermediate-risk (submassive) pulmonary embolism (PE) describes normotensive patients with evidence of right ventricular compromise, whereas high-risk (massive) PE comprises those who have experienced hemodynamic decompensation with hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest. Together, these two syndromes represent the most clinically challenging manifestations of the PE spectrum. Prompt therapeutic anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of therapy for both intermediate- and high-risk PE. Patients with intermediate-risk PE who subsequently deteriorate despite anticoagulation and those with high-risk PE require additional advanced therapies, typically focused on pulmonary artery reperfusion.

Strategies for reperfusion therapy include systemic fibrinolysis, surgical pulmonary embolectomy, and a growing number of options for catheter-based therapy. Multidisciplinary PE response teams can aid in the selection of appropriate management strategies, especially where gaps in evidence exist and guideline recommendations are sparse.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dAsX9]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence from currently available randomized trials suggests that thrombolytic treatment reduces overall mortality of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Although the estimated treatment effect corresponded to a 41% relative risk reduction of overall mortality, the benefit of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute PE could not be definitively established. This observation deserves several comments:

- **Robustness of primary result**: The robustness of our primary result was limited, as statistical significance was lost after exclusion of the study by Jerjes-Sanchez et al. This small-size, open-label trial included only patients with high-risk PE and was limited by gross imbalance between groups, with the four patients allocated to heparin treatment having been admitted for an acute episode of unstable PE despite previous therapeutic anticoagulation. Nevertheless, even after exclusion of this trial, a trend towards decreased all-cause mortality was observed (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.39–1.08).

- **Early mortality**: Early mortality is relatively uncommon among patients with acute PE, particularly those with non-high-risk PE. Therefore, considering a mortality of 3.9% in the control group, a 41% relative risk reduction would lead to an absolute mortality risk reduction of only 1.6% in our overall population.

Our subgroup analyses suggest a possible correlation between PE severity and treatment effect. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) were similar in studies including (but not exclusively limited to) high-risk PE and studies restricted to intermediate-risk PE, with an estimated mortality risk reduction of approximately 55%, whereas the OR was suggestive of an absence of benefit.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zqJoK]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism recurrence was reported in 11 studies involving 1928 patients. The reported incidence of PE recurrence was 1.3% (13/966) among patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 2.9% (28/962) in the control group. Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in PE recurrence (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27–0.94, P = 0.03). No heterogeneity was detected (I² = 0%). No significant difference was found according to the thrombolytic regimen (P = 0.39) or the severity of PE (P = 0.33).

- **Major bleeding**: Major bleeding was reported in 12 studies (1935 patients) and was present in 9.9% (96/974) of patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy and 3.6% (35/961) of the control group. Thrombolytic treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of major bleeding (OR: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.95–4.36, P < 0.0001). A low amount of heterogeneity was detected (I² = 25%). Subgroup analysis did not show any differences between studies using invasive vs. non-invasive diagnostic procedures. Subgroup analysis based on the thrombolytic agent suggested a lower risk of major bleeding in studies using alteplase compared with tenecteplase. Nevertheless, this subgroup difference was not significant after exclusion of the study by Konstantinides et al, which used a more restrictive definition of major hemorrhage. Finally, the association between thrombolytic therapy and the risk of major bleeding was lower in studies using an upper age limit (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.47–2.71) than in studies including older patients.

### Midterm prognosis of patients with pulmonary embolism receiving catheter-directed thrombolysis or systemic thrombolysis: A nationwide population-based study [^11335pe5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. We conducted a prospective open cohort study by using data collected retrospectively from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) for 2001 through 2013. Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program is a single‐payer system that was established in March 1995 and currently provides coverage to > 99.8% of the population of Taiwan (approximately 23.7 million people at present). Moreover, the NHIRD contains data on the patients covered by the NHI program from 1995 through 2013. Because enrollment in the NHI program is mandatory and affordable, the vast majority of patients receive appropriate long‐term follow‐up care and evaluations. To protect privacy, all personal information contained in the NHIRD is deidentified and anonymized, so a full review by the Ethics Institutional Review Board of Taiwan University Hospital was not needed for the present study. Further information on the NHI program and the NHIRD has been provided in previous publications.

Patients who were first admitted for PE (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD‐9‐CM], code 415.1) between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2013, were identified. We then excluded any patients who (1) had missing demographical data (< 0.1%), (2) were aged < 20 years, or (3) were not treated by thrombolysis during the index PE admission. Those patients who were ultimately included were separated into 2 groups: the ST.

### Successful resuscitation of a patient with acute massive pulmonary embolism using emergent embolectomy [^111oTQQ4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism is associated with a high mortality rate. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are mandatory for a successful outcome. Although thrombolysis is effective, it is associated with a high rate of bleeding complications. This report describes the use of emergent pulmonary embolectomy as an effective and aggressive therapeutic approach to a massive saddle pulmonary embolism in a 66-year-old woman. With the application of specific surgical techniques and good interdisciplinary cooperation, pulmonary embolectomy may serve as more than a last resort for the management of this clinically unstable and dangerous condition.

### Aspirin in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism [^113xkYT6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

This review summarizes available evidence on the effects of aspirin on the incidence and outcomes of venous thromboembolism (VTE). From a pathophysiological point of view, inhibition of platelet aggregation is associated with impaired thrombus formation in both an experimental model of venous thrombosis and in vivo. Epidemiological evidence supporting a beneficial effect of acetylsalicylic acid on VTE incidence is provided by the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of studies on the use of antiplatelet agents in cardiovascular risk reduction, showing a significant 25% risk reduction of pulmonary embolism. Moreover, a meta-analysis of older trials of antiplatelet agents in postsurgical VTE prevention and the large Pulmonary Embolism Prevention trial demonstrate a protective effect of the same magnitude: 25–30%.

However, as low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have shown superior efficacy and safety profiles, and no direct comparisons have been made between aspirin, LMWH, and VKA in prolonged use, the most recent guidelines advise against aspirin monotherapy for thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support a role for aspirin in air travel-related VTE. Regarding the prevention of recurrent VTE (reVTE), studies are ongoing to determine the potential role of aspirin following a first unprovoked VTE.

### All contraindications to thrombolysis for life-threatening pulmonary embolus should be considered relative [^1137M9zX]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal; however, timely thrombolytic therapy can be life-saving. Guidelines advocate the use of thrombolysis for massive PE in patients with an acceptable bleeding-risk profile. Nonetheless, estimating what constitutes an acceptable bleeding risk in those with life-threatening PE is a clinical challenge, and even contraindications considered 'absolute' may present lesser risk than leaving PE untreated.

We discuss the case of a 77-year-old man who received thrombolysis for a massive PE 4 weeks following admission with a significant intracerebral bleed. There was a rapid resolution of hypotension and hypoxia, and he survived to be discharged home. This case is used to illustrate that no potential therapy should be discounted in patients faced with acute life-threatening PE. Decisions to thrombolyse patients with traditional contraindications — even those considered absolute — must be taken by clinicians able to weigh relative risks.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, particularly with respect to thrombolytic therapy, the ASH 2020 guidelines recommend considering offering anticoagulation alone over the routine use of thrombolysis in addition to anticoagulation. This applies to patients with PE who have echocardiography and/or biomarkers indicating RV dysfunction but without hemodynamic compromise (submassive PE).

### Fibrinolytic uses in the emergency department: A narrative review [^115RyEey]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Several life-threatening conditions associated with thrombosis include acute ischemic stroke (AIS), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Fibrinolytics are among the treatment algorithms for these conditions.

This narrative review provides emergency clinicians with an overview of fibrinolytics for AIS, AMI, and PE in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Pathologic thrombosis can result in vascular occlusion and embolism, ultimately leading to end-organ injury. Fibrinolytics are medications utilized to lyse a blood clot, improving vascular flow. One of the first agents utilized was streptokinase, though this is not as often used with the availability of fibrin-specific agents including alteplase (tPA), tenecteplase (TNK), and reteplase (rPA). These agents are integral components in the management of several conditions, including AIS, AMI, and PE.

- **Acute ischemic stroke (AIS)**: Patients with AIS who present within 3–4.5 hours of measurable neurologic deficit with no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or other contraindications may be eligible to receive tPA or TNK.

- **Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)**: In the absence of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), fibrinolytics should be considered in patients with AMI presenting with chest pain for at least 30 minutes but less than 12 hours, though it may be considered up to 24 hours. Unlike in AIS and PE, anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications should be administered in those with AMI receiving fibrinolytics. Following fibrinolytics, PCI is typically necessary.

- **Acute pulmonary embolism (PE)**: Fibrinolytics are recommended in patients with high-risk PE.

The information provided assists emergency clinicians in optimizing the use of fibrinolytics within these critical settings.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^1128ZbiK]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimens are used in individual research, each with its own distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan.

There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research. Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions. The rates of PE diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods.

A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility. The analysis identified several significant risk factors, including:

- **Having undergone major surgery within the past 3 weeks**: OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01−79.99.
- **Having an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7**: OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54−113.52.
- **Weighing less than 100 kg**: OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01−1.37.
- **Having at least one of the following characteristics**: OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78−18.55; internal bleeding in the previous 4 weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra‐aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous 3 months, aortic dissection, acute pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Low-dose aspirin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism [^112UEpPj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The ASPIRE study, published by Brighton TA and colleagues in 2012 in the New England Journal of Medicine, explores pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The main question addressed was the role of low-dose aspirin in patients who have experienced a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) and have a high risk of recurrence after discontinuation of anticoagulants.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 822 patients (375 female, 447 male). Participants included had completed initial anticoagulant therapy following a first episode of unprovoked VTE. Key exclusion criteria consisted of a first unprovoked episode of VTE occurring more than two years before enrollment, any indication or contraindication for aspirin, other antiplatelet therapy, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and indications for continuing oral anticoagulation therapy. Additionally, any medical problem interfering with trial participation or limiting life expectancy was grounds for exclusion.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Aspirin**: n = 411 (100 mg orally once daily, for up to four years)
	- **Placebo**: n = 411 (matching placebo orally once daily, for up to four years)

- **Primary outcome**:
	- **No significant difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE**: 4.8% per year vs. 6.5% per year (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.52 to 1.05)

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- **Significant decrease in the incidence of major vascular events**: 5.2% per year vs. 8% per year (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92)

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^116kNqEP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and might reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor haemorrhages. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute PE.

- **Search strategy**: For this update, the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched April 2009) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (last searched Issue 2, 2009). We also searched individual trial collections, private databases, and bibliographies of relevant articles. Relevant medical journals were handsearched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thrombolytic therapy with placebo, heparin, or surgical intervention in patients with acute PE were included. Trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug were not included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors (DB and WQ) assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included eight trials, with a total of 679 patients, in this review. Results between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or placebo and heparin were similar.

### Electronic cardiac arrest triage score best predicts mortality after intervention in patients with massive and submassive pulmonary embolism [^115KsiHP]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

To determine if the cardiac arrest triage (CART) score would better predict poor outcomes after pharmacomechanical therapy (PMT) for massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) than traditional risk scores, PMT for massive and submassive PE allows for clot lysis with minimal doses of fibrinolytics. Although PMT results in improved right ventricular function and reduced pulmonary pressures and thrombus burden, predictors of poor outcome are not well-studied.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent PMT for massive or submassive PE at a single institution from 2010 to 2016. The CART score and electronic CART (eCART) score, derived previously as early warning scores for hospitalized patients, were compared to the pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) by comparing the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting 30-day mortality.

We studied 61 patients (56 ± 17 years, 44.0% male, 29.5% massive PE, mean PESI 114.6 ± 42.7, mean CART 13.5 ± 1.39, mean eCART 108.5 ± 28.6). Thirty-day mortality was 24.6%. Treatments included rheolytic thrombectomy (32.7%), catheter-directed thrombolysis (50.8%), ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis (32.7%), and mechanical thrombectomy (4.9%). There were no differences in outcomes based on technique. The eCART and CART scores had higher AUCs compared to PESI in predicting 30-day mortality (0.84 vs. 0.72 vs. 0.69, P = 0.010). We found troponin I and pro-BNP levels were higher in higher eCART tertiles; however, AUCs were 0.51 and 0.63, respectively, for 30-day mortality when used.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with acute pulmonary embolism undergoing ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis [^111o8V27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Among unstable patients with massive (high-risk) acute pulmonary embolism (PE), immediate reperfusion is commonly achieved with thrombolytic therapy by intravenous injection of a plasminogen activator (e.g. recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [rt-PA]). Systemic thrombolysis, however, is associated with a significant risk of bleeding in up to 20% of treated individuals, including rates of intracranial hemorrhage between 2% and 5%. Appropriate therapy is often withheld due to the anticipated risk of bleeding. Submassive (intermediate risk) PE is characterized by right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or cardiac ischemia. Although early mortality rates are as high as 10.9% in this patient population, clinical practice guidelines recommend anticoagulation rather than thrombolytic reperfusion therapy in stable patients due to the associated hazard of life-threatening bleeding.

Catheter-directed therapies for PE were mainly studied in hemodynamically stable patients and may avert the risk of RV overload in intermediate-risk patients and minimize the risk of major bleeding. Upon interventional techniques, catheter-directed thrombolysis using ultrasound-enhanced technology, the EkoSonic Endovascular System (EKOS) provides most of the evidence supporting an early treatment strategy for PE. Although numerous single-arm studies have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this device, overall patient numbers are still low.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the benefits and risks of ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis (USAT) in a large patient cohort.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159wdT8]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The search strategy, study selection, data extraction, and analysis were conducted according to a pre-defined protocol.

- **Search strategy**: Two authors (C.M. and G.J.) systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials registry using the following keywords: pulmonary embolism AND (thrombolysis OR thrombolytic therapy OR streptokinase OR urokinase OR tenecteplase OR desmoteplase OR reteplase OR tissue plasminogen activator). The detailed search strategy is available and was last updated on 16 February 2014. To ensure a comprehensive literature search, we examined reference lists from retrieved articles and reference literature (guidelines and systematic reviews) and consulted experts in PE for any published or unpublished studies that might be missing.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing a thrombolytic agent — streptokinase, urokinase, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase), desmoteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase — administered systemically by the intravenous route, and heparin (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin) with heparin alone in patients with acute PE. Studies comparing two regimens of thrombolytic therapy, and those using mechanical thrombectomy along with thrombolytic treatment or local catheter-delivered thrombolysis, were excluded. Two investigators (C.M. and G.J.) independently evaluated studies for inclusion. Non-relevant studies were excluded based on the title and abstract. For potentially relevant studies, full text was obtained and evaluated independently by two investigators (C.M. and G.J.).

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^115yPMvv]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical condition requiring effective management strategies, including thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants. This study aims to assess the impact of thrombolytic therapy, either combined with anticoagulant (AC) or alone, versus AC alone on mortality, recurrence, clinical deterioration, bleeding, and hospital stay.

This study included 25 previously published studies from 1990 to 2023, with a total of 12,836 participants. Dichotomous and continuous analysis models were used to evaluate outcomes, with heterogeneity and publication bias tests applied. A random model was used for data analysis. Several databases, such as Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Embase, were searched for the identification and inclusion of studies.

- **Results**: For sub-massive PE, CDT plus AC significantly reduced in-hospital, 30-day, and 12-month mortality compared to AC alone, with an odds ratio (OR) of -0.99 (95% CI [-1.32 to -0.66]), and increased major bleeding risk but no difference in minor bleeding or hospital stay (OR = 0.46, 95% CI [-0.03 to 0.96]). For acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy did not affect all-cause or in-hospital mortality but increased minor bleeding, reduced rePE, and prevented clinical deterioration. The heterogeneity of different models in the study varied from 0% to 37.9%.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of CDT to AC improves mortality outcomes for sub-massive PE but raises the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy reduces recurrence and clinical deterioration but does not affect mortality.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CJu1K]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy induces faster clot dissolution than anticoagulation in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) but is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhage. We reviewed the risks and benefits of thrombolytic therapy in the management of patients with acute PE.

- **Methods and results**: We systematically reviewed randomized controlled studies comparing systemic thrombolytic therapy plus anticoagulation with anticoagulation alone in patients with acute PE. Fifteen trials involving 2,057 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with heparin, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36–0.96). This reduction was not statistically significant after exclusion of studies including high-risk PE (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.35–1.17). Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the combined endpoint of death or treatment escalation (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22–0.53), PE-related mortality (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14–0.60), and PE recurrence (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27–0.94). Major haemorrhage (OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.95–4.36) and fatal or intracranial bleeding (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.25–8.11) were significantly more frequent among patients receiving thrombolysis.

Thrombolytic therapy reduces total mortality, PE recurrence, and PE-related mortality in patients with acute PE. The decrease in overall mortality is, however, not significant in haemodynamically stable patients with acute PE. Thrombolytic therapy is associated with an increase of major and fatal or intracranial haemorrhage.
