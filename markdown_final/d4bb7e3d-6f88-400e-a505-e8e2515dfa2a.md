## Question

lenvatinib association with vasculitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lenvatinib is associated with vasculitis and how to interpret that risk clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what vasculitis means clinically and pathologically. Then, I should verify what the lenvatinib label and postmarketing sections say about vasculitis. Next, I will review the provided literature for any direct signals or case reports. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility given lenvatinib's pharmacology. Finally, I will synthesize a risk assessment and outline practical clinical implications for monitoring and management, making sure I distinguish vasculitis from related vascular toxicities like thrombosis and hemorrhage [^116pwDVm].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Vasculitis refers to inflammation of blood vessel walls and can be primary or drug-induced; it spans small-, medium-, and large-vessel disease and often requires tissue confirmation when suspected, with management principles guided by disease severity and etiology, including withdrawal of the offending agent when drug-induced disease is suspected.

> I need to check the regulatory sources next. Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling for lenvatinib. The current U.S. prescribing information lists common vascular adverse reactions such as hypertension and arterial thromboembolic events, and in postmarketing it notes arterial aneurysms, dissections, and rupture; however, I do not see vasculitis listed among labeled adverse reactions or in the postmarketing vasculature section, which argues against a recognized association in the regulatory safety profile at this time [^116pwDVm] [^111i7EBg].

> Next, I should review the provided literature for direct signals. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I will now examine the documents for explicit vasculitis reports. I find no case reports, case series, or observational cohorts in the supplied materials that directly link lenvatinib to vasculitis, whereas robust data exist for hypertension and proteinuria, including dose-dependent risks and renal pathology such as secondary FSGS, which reflect endothelial injury rather than vasculitic inflammation per se [^111tUU9Y] [^114evKc1] [^1116RoB8] [^111xSUE4].

> But wait, what if there is mechanistic plausibility that could imply vasculitis risk even if it is not reported. Lenvatinib potently inhibits VEGFR1/2/3 and other kinases, causing endothelial dysfunction that manifests as hypertension, proteinuria, and occasionally thrombotic or hemorrhagic events; however, this pattern is distinct from immune-mediated vasculitis, which typically involves inflammatory infiltrates and immune complex deposition rather than pure endothelial injury or thrombosis, so the pharmacology does not strongly predict a vasculitic phenotype [^115iAGY7] [^116pwDVm] [^1143xhYP].

> I should double-check for confounders. Combination regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce immune-related adverse events including vasculitis, and several reports and guidelines document ICI-associated vasculitis; in such combinations, attributing vasculitis to lenvatinib alone would be inappropriate without careful temporal correlation and exclusion of immune etiologies, so I need to ensure that any suspected vasculitis in a patient on lenvatinib plus an ICI is evaluated as a potential irAE rather than a direct TKI toxicity [^112zDw2z] [^111JvS6J] [^1143xhYP].

> Let me synthesize the risk signal. Based on the absence from FDA labeling, the lack of case reports in the provided corpus, and the mechanistic distinction between VEGF-pathway endothelial injury and immune vasculitis, the current evidence does not support a causal association between lenvatinib monotherapy and vasculitis; by contrast, the well-characterized vascular toxicities are hypertension, proteinuria, arterial thromboembolism, and hemorrhagic events, which should be the focus of vigilance and management during therapy [^116pwDVm] [^111tUU9Y] [^114yAGMV].

> I will now translate this into clinical implications. I need to ensure baseline and on-treatment monitoring emphasizes blood pressure control, urine protein assessment, and symptom surveillance for thrombotic or bleeding events, with prompt dose interruption or reduction for grade 3 hypertension or significant proteinuria per label and trial-derived management frameworks; if vasculitis-like symptoms occur, I should confirm the drug exposure timeline, consider concomitant immunotherapies, and pursue appropriate serologies, imaging, and tissue diagnosis to distinguish drug-induced vasculitis from TKI-related vascular injury or thrombosis [^115i8aT6] [^1167itQQ] [^116sPxTG] [^111JvS6J].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. There is no evidence in the provided materials that lenvatinib monotherapy is associated with vasculitis, whereas hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage are the principal vascular toxicities requiring proactive monitoring and dose management; if vasculitis is suspected, especially in combination regimens, evaluate for immune-mediated etiologies and manage per vasculitis guidelines rather than assuming a direct TKI effect [^116pwDVm] [^111tUU9Y] [^111JvS6J].

Lenvatinib is **not associated with vasculitis** in the provided literature. The most relevant vascular adverse effects are hypertension [^114evKc1], proteinuria [^111bfLSB], and arterial thromboembolic events [^116pwDVm]; vasculitis is not listed among lenvatinib's adverse reactions or warnings [^116pwDVm]. If vasculitis-like symptoms occur, evaluate for other causes and manage per standard care [^111JvS6J].

## Vascular adverse effects of lenvatinib

Lenvatinib is associated with several vascular adverse effects, including:

- **Hypertension**: Very common, occurring in approximately 50% of patients, with grade ≥ 3 hypertension in 14% [^114evKc1] [^113b75mn].

- **Proteinuria**: Common, occurring in approximately 32% of patients, with grade ≥ 3 proteinuria in 6% [^114evKc1] [^111tUU9Y].

- **Arterial thromboembolic events**: Less common but significant, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attacks [^115i8aT6] [^112zuYCa].

These effects are **well-documented** in clinical trials and postmarketing reports, and lenvatinib's prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for these events [^116pwDVm].

---

## Evidence regarding vasculitis

A comprehensive review of the provided literature reveals **no documented association** between lenvatinib and vasculitis. Vasculitis is not listed among the adverse reactions or warnings in the prescribing information, and no case reports or studies in the provided documents specifically link lenvatinib to vasculitis.

---

## Mechanistic considerations

Lenvatinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), and others [^115iAGY7]. This broad inhibition underlies its efficacy and contributes to vascular adverse effects such as hypertension and proteinuria [^113tUrDn]. However, there is **no clear mechanistic pathway** by which lenvatinib would induce vasculitis, which typically involves immune-mediated inflammation of blood vessel walls. The absence of vasculitis in clinical trials and postmarketing reports further supports the lack of association.

---

## Clinical implications and management

Given the absence of evidence linking lenvatinib to vasculitis, clinicians should:

- **Monitor for known vascular adverse effects**: Regularly monitor blood pressure, renal function, and proteinuria during lenvatinib therapy [^115i8aT6].

- **Manage hypertension and proteinuria**: Follow established guidelines for managing hypertension and proteinuria, including dose adjustments and temporary discontinuation of lenvatinib if necessary [^116sPxTG].

- **Evaluate alternative causes**: If vasculitis-like symptoms occur, evaluate for other etiologies, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and other medications [^114wtdKY].

---

## Conclusion

Lenvatinib is **not associated with vasculitis** based on the available literature. The primary vascular adverse effects are hypertension, proteinuria, and arterial thromboembolic events. Clinicians should remain vigilant for these known adverse effects and manage them according to established guidelines.

Conclusion

Lenvatinib treatment increases the risk of hypertension and proteinuria, particularly at high doses. Close monitoring and effective management of these adverse effects may play a vital role in the broader and safer use of lenvatinib in clinical settings. Furthermore, future studies are strongly encouraged to elucidate the mechanisms of lenvatinib-induced hypertension and proteinuria to guide therapy for these adverse effects.

Discussion and conclusions

This is the first report of renal histopathological findings associated with secondary FSGS due to a vascular endothelial disorder and podocyte damage induced by lenvatinib treatment. Nephrotic syndrome developed at approximately 3 months following initiation of lenvatinib treatment for metastatic thyroid cancer in our patient. The development of lesions with complete hyalinization caused irreversible renal failure.

Results of the international cooperative phase III trials identified the following adverse side effects as risk factors for lenvatinib treatment: hypertension (incidence rate, 67.8%); urinary protein (32.6%); hematuria (5%); and nephrotic syndrome (0.4%; a single case). Of these, hypertension (10%) and urinary protein (10%) were included in the main toxicity criteria with a grade ≥ 3. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider that dose adjustment might be necessary to lower the risk of toxicity.

The period between initiation of lenvatinib treatment and the advent of renal impairment was 43 (range, 5–799) days, with a mean of 43 (range, 13–560) days in Japan.

Side effects of lenvatinib can be observed at any time following lenvatinib initiation, and these side effects are caused by the effects of lenvatinib on VEGF inhibition. There might be an opportunity to perform dose modification to lower the risk of these renal events; however, it takes an average of 8.8 weeks to resolve proteinuria after dose modification of lenvatinib.

Effects of VEGF inhibition on blood pressure should be considered. VEGF regulates blood pressure through its effect on vascular tone; specifically, VEGF inhibitors suppress nitric oxide (NO) and phospholipase A2 activation, which decrease the production of prostacyclin (PGI 2) and increase the release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) as a vasoexcitor, thus causing vasoconstriction. Oxidative stress due to VEGF inhibition results in endothelial cell injury, a decrease in microvessel network density, and increased vascular resistance. Furthermore, the reduction of NO leads to increased vascular volume via reabsorption of sodium. Increased vascular resistance and increased vascular volume due to these mechanisms result in hypertension.

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114evKc1]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to investigate the risks and incidence of hypertension and proteinuria associated with lenvatinib among patients with different cancers. The main findings are as follows: (1) a significant proportion of patients treated with lenvatinib experienced hypertension and proteinuria, with an incidence of 50%, 14%, 32%, and 6% for all-grade hypertension, grade ≥ 3 hypertension, all-grade proteinuria, and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria, respectively; (2) compared with controls, lenvatinib significantly increased the risk of hypertension and proteinuria; (3) compared to low-dose lenvatinib, high-dose lenvatinib treatment significantly increased the risks of hypertension and proteinuria.

Lenvatinib has been clinically validated as a targeted agent against various cancers and may result in a range of adverse effects. Given that hypertension and proteinuria are major risk factors for cardiovascular and renal events, it is particularly essential to recognize, monitor, and manage these risks promptly and appropriately. Our study is the largest meta-analysis investigating the risks and incidence of hypertension and proteinuria associated with lenvatinib, and is the first meta-analysis to examine the differences in the development of hypertension and proteinuria based on lenvatinib dosage.

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113df1L9]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines(Tables S1 and S2).

Search strategy

A search for published studies indexed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception of the study to April 24, 2023 was conducted using the following terms: ("lenvatinib" OR "lenvima" OR "E-7080" OR "E 7080" OR "E7080") AND ("cancer" OR "carcinoma" OR "neoplasm s" OR "neoplasms" OR "neoplasm" OR "tumoral" OR "tumour" OR "tumor" OR "tumors" OR "tumoural" OR "tumourous" OR "malignancy" OR "oncology").

Study selection

Studies that met the following criteria were selected for analysis: (1) prospective and retrospective studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib as monotherapy, and (2) studies that provided sufficient data on hypertension and proteinuria. We excluded articles not written in English, review articles, case reports, commentaries, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and conference abstracts.

Outcome definition

The primary outcomes included the incidence of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 hypertension and proteinuria, as defined by the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The secondary outcome included the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including cerebrovascular accident, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation.

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117F8Rx7]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Lenvatinib frequently causes hypertension and proteinuria, with severe cases leading to cardiovascular damage and renal failure. Our meta-analysis found that lenvatinib-treated patients showed high incidences of hypertension (50% for all-grade, 14% for grade ≥ 3) and proteinuria (30% for all-grade, 6% for grade ≥ 3) relative to controls. Notably, high-dose lenvatinib treatment presented greater risks than low-dose treatment. These results underscore the necessity for careful blood pressure monitoring, especially at high doses, to help prevent severe complications and enhance patient outcomes during lenvatinib therapy.

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tUU9Y]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Published data regarding the overall risks and incidence of hypertension and proteinuria associated with lenvatinib remain unclear.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the precise risks and incidence of lenvatinib-associated hypertension and proteinuria. We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for studies on the incidence of hypertension and proteinuria, which were published until April 24, 2023.

Results

A total of 10,443 patients were included in the 64 studies identified from the literature. The incidence of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 hypertension was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43–58%) and 14% (95% CI: 10–18%) for patients treated with lenvatinib. The incidence of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria was 32% (95% CI: 26–38%) and 6% (95% CI: 4–7%), respectively. Compared with controls, lenvatinib significantly increased the risk of all-grade hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.4–4.1), grade ≥ 3 hypertension (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2–6.0), all-grade proteinuria (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.9–6.6), and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (OR: 2.85, 95% CI: 1.5–5.3). Compared to low-dose lenvatinib (≤ 12mg/day), high-dose lenvatinib (≥ 20mg/day) treatment significantly increased the risks of all-grade hypertension (OR: 4.7, 95% CI: 4.2–5.2), grade ≥ 3 hypertension (OR: 7.7, 95% CI: 6.8–8.7), all-grade proteinuria (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.6–2.0), and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5–2.1).

Conclusion

Our review revealed that lenvatinib treatment increases the risks of hypertension and proteinuria, particularly with high-dose lenvatinib.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors and vasculitis [^112zDw2z]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of cancer. By activating the immune system using monoclonal anti-CTLA-4 and PD(L)-1 antibodies, remission can be induced in previously terminal cancers. However, these breakthroughs come at a price. Multiple de-novo autoimmune illnesses, termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs), have been reported with patients increasingly being referred to rheumatologists with varying diagnoses. Among these are vasculitic syndromes, which may be limited to an organ or systemic and potentially-life threatening. Relatively little is known about the prevalence, mechanisms, and phenotypes of vasculitis occurring in response to ICIs. Here, we review the literature and describe the frequency and patterns of presentation.

Recent Findings

Vasculitis, while infrequent, has been described as an irAE in patients treated with ICI therapy with resultant morbidity and mortality.

Summary

Recognizing the risk and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor induced vasculitis in patients with cancer is important in the daily practice of rheumatology.

Further stratified analyses based on lenvatinib dosage were conducted to investigate the relationship between the increased risk of hypertension and lenvatinib dose. The incidence of hypertension was analyzed separately for high-dose (≥ 20 mg/day) and low-dose (≤ 12 mg/day) lenvatinib. For the high dose (≥ 20 mg/day), which included 1815 patients across 22 studies, the pooled prevalence of all-grade hypertension was 74% (95% CI, 67%-79%), and that of grade ≥ 3 hypertension was 36% (95% CI, 28%-45%) (Figure 1B, Table S5, Figure S3B). In contrast, for the low dose (≤ 12 mg/day) with 6300 patients across 42 studies, the prevalence of all-grade hypertension was 37% (95% CI, 30%-45%), and that of grade ≥ 3 hypertension was 8% (95% CI, 6%-11%) (Figure 1C, Table S5, Figure S3C). The OR for all-grade hypertension with high-dose lenvatinib compared to that of controls was 13.2 (95% CI, 5.9–29.2), whereas the OR for low-dose was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.93–1.96), as shown in Figure S4. Similarly, the OR for grade ≥ 3 hypertension with high-dose lenvatinib was 15.0 (95% CI, 6.0–37.6), whereas the OR for low-dose was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.86–2.40), as shown in Figure 2. Overall, the ORs comparing high-dose lenvatinib to low-dose lenvatinib were 4.7 (95% CI, 4.2–5.2) for all-grade hypertension and 7.7 (95% CI, 6.8–8.7) for grade ≥ 3 hypertension (Figure 3), suggesting that the risk of hypertension may be dose-dependent.

### Practical recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of kinase inhibitors in oncology [^116Fz3rc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Lenvatinib

An increase in the incidence of Grade 3 or higher hypertension, Grade 3 or higher proteinuria, nausea, and vomiting with higher lenvatinib dose intensity has been observed. 51 Analyses of the pivotal study in thyroid cancer indicated similar PFS across the full range of exposures (AUC 0‐24 between 1,410 and 10,700 ng*h/mL). 52 However, a model‐based PK/PD analysis indicated that lenvatinib AUC 0‐24 was correlated with reduction in tumor size. 52

As no exposure–response and exposure–toxicity thresholds are established yet for lenvatinib, TDM could target the mean C min of 51.5 ng/mL. 51

Nintedanib

Nintedanib has only shown modest relationships between exposure and safety and efficacy. 53 In exploratory analyses, higher nintedanib concentrations have been associated with hepatotoxicity, but not with gastrointestinal AEs. Exposure–response analyses are currently not available for clinical endpoints, except for a statistically significant association between nintedanib exposure and dynamic contrast‐enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) response 54 and a decrease in soluble VEGFR levels with increasing C min in a phase I study (r = –0.46, n = 15). 55

As no specific threshold for nintedanib has been proposed, TDM should focus on targeting the mean C min value of the approved dose (calculated for a 200 mg dose, based on the dose‐normalized C min value of 0.0654 ng/mL/mg) of 13.1 ng/mL. 56

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits (see Data). There are no available human data informing the drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

In an embryofetal development study, daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate at doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg [approximately 0.14 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on body surface area (BSA)] to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in dose-related decreases in mean fetal body weight, delayed fetal ossifications, and dose-related increases in fetal external (parietal edema and tail abnormalities), visceral, and skeletal anomalies. Greater than 80% post-implantation loss was observed at 1.0 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA).

Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetal external (short tail), visceral (retroesophageal subclavian artery), and skeletal anomalies at doses greater than or equal to 0.03 mg/kg (approximately 0.03 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA). At the 0.03 mg/kg dose, increased post-implantation loss, including 1 fetal death, was also observed. Lenvatinib was abortifacient in rabbits, resulting in late abortions in approximately one-third of the rabbits treated at a dose level of 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA).

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1124qqvj]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. First, although we made a considerable effort to use multiple databases to include relevant studies in our analysis, it is possible that some studies were not excluded. Nevertheless, we conducted a thorough literature search, selected studies, and extracted data to minimize risk. Second, retrospective studies may not have evaluated hypertension and proteinuria according to a defined protocol; therefore, the assessment of these adverse events may be subject to detection bias. Furthermore, due to the high heterogeneity in the prevalence of hypertension and proteinuria, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. Finally, certain publication bias was observed, which may limit the persuasiveness of the results. Nevertheless, we believe that the findings of this study are clinically important as they may contribute to improved management of hypertension and proteinuria in patients receiving lenvatinib.

### Prospective cardiovascular surveillance of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapy in patients with advanced renal cell cancer: data from the phase III JAVELIN renal 101 trial [^1143xhYP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs; anti–programmed death ligand 1 or anti–programmed death 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors is an effective treatment for several tumor types, including advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). - Cardiovascular (CV) adverse events (AEs), including hypertension, cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, and thromboembolic events, are a well-characterized occurrence with VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor monotherapy. - ICIs can cause inflammatory CV AEs, including myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis, and arrhythmias. - Although ICI-related myocarditis occurs in only approximately 1% of ICI-treated patients, it has a high fatality rate (46%) and almost 80% of events occur within six weeks of treatment initiation, highlighting a need for early detection. ICI combination therapy involving an anticytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 antibody and an anti–programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 antibody is associated with a higher risk of myocarditis compared with monotherapy. Whether the risk of CV AEs is increased when ICIs are combined with VEGFR inhibitors is unknown. The role of serum cardiac biomarkers in patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic anticancer treatments, including ICIs, has been explored. However, the impact of comorbidities, complete clinical features and characteristics, timing, and outcomes of immune-mediated CV AEs remain unclear.

In the JAVELIN Renal 101 phase III trial, avelumab plus axitinib significantly improved progression-free survival and the objective response rate versus sunitinib in previously untreated patients with aRCC. Unlike other phase III trials of ICI plus VEGFR inhibitor treatment, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and serum cardiac biomarkers were assessed prospectively. Here, we analyzed the incidence of major adverse CV events (MACE) in patients with aRCC receiving avelumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib in this trial, including the association between MACE and changes in LVEF or baseline levels of serum cardiac biomarkers.

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118NQJk]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Major adverse cardiac events

Major adverse cardiac events was reported in 10 studies, with a pooled incidence of 2% (95% CI, 1%-5%) (Figure S8A). For the high dose, MACE was reported in 8 of 22 studies, resulting in a pooled incidence of 4% (95% CI, 2%-7%) (Figure S8B). The low dose exhibited MACE in 2 of 42 studies, yielding a pooled incidence of 1% (95% CI, 0%-2%) (Figure S8C). Although a trend toward a higher incidence of MACE at higher doses than lower doses was observed, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.098).

Nephrotoxicity

Treatment-related nephrotoxicity, including elevated serum creatinine levels, renal impairment, and renal failure, was reported in 7 studies, with a pooled incidence of 4% (95% CI, 1%-14%) (Figure S9A). In high-dose lenvatinib treatments, renal impairment and renal failure were each reported in 3 of 22 studies each, resulting in a pooled incidence of 1% (95% CI, 0%-5%) and 1% (95% CI, 0%-1%), respectively (Figure S9B and S9C). Additionally, elevated serum creatinine levels were reported in 1 of 22 studies, with an incidence rate of 20%. For low doses, elevated serum creatinine levels were reported in 2 of 42 studies, with a pooled incidence of 17% (95% CI, 12%-24%) (Figure S9D).

Publication bias

Publication bias was found in funnel plots depicting the association between lenvatinib and all-grade hypertension, grade ≥ 3 hypertension, or grade ≥ 3 proteinuria, and the association between high-dose lenvatinib and grade ≥ 3 hypertension or grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (Figure S10).

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115LbUEb]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Lenvatinib is reportedly associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular toxicity than other VEGFR-TKIs, such as sorafenib and sunitinib. In this study, the pooled incidence of MACE was 2%, with 4% and 1% at high and low doses, respectively. The lack of a statistically significant difference between the high and low doses with respect to the occurrence of MACE may be attributed to a lack of statistical power or a short observation period.

Our meta-analysis showed that the incidence of any-grade renal impairment or renal failure was quite low, at 1%. Additionally, in our previous retrospective study of 76 patients treated with lenvatinib, we observed a significant decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from 2 years after treatment initiation; however, eGFR improved after the end of treatment. Based on these findings, lenvatinib treatment frequently causes proteinuria but rarely leads to irreversible renal dysfunction. The evidence regarding the relationship between lenvatinib-associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction is limited and conflicting. In our previous retrospective study, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction, defined as eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², was similar between patients with and without grade ≥ 3 proteinuria. Additionally, no patients in either group permanently discontinued treatment due to renal dysfunction. Fukuda et al. also reported that no significant deterioration in eGFR was observed in patients with grade 3 proteinuria compared with patients with grades 0–2 proteinuria. Conversely, Masaki et al. reported that patients with decreased eGFR after lenvatinib treatment experienced a higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 proteinuria compared to those without a decrease in eGFR. In this way, the relationship between lenvatinib-associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction remains unclear, and long-term studies with larger sample sizes are necessary.

### Severe small-vessel vasculitis temporally associated with administration of ustekinumab [^114wtdKY]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Vasculitis may be caused by infection, medications, systemic diseases, malignancy, or occur as an idiopathic condition. In cases of drug-induced vasculitis, it is essential to identify and discontinue the culprit medication. As novel agents are approved through clinical trials, some rare events, including vasculitis, may not become apparent until wider use, and rigorous post-marketing surveillance for new medications is important. Physicians should consider drug-induced vasculitis on the differential for all new vasculitis diagnoses, and if the potential triggering medication is a novel medication, it is essential to rigorously investigate the potential for emerging cases of medication-associated vasculitis in all available scientific literature.

Further stratified analyses based on lenvatinib dosage were conducted to investigate the relationship between the increased risk of proteinuria and lenvatinib dose. For the high dose (≥ 20 mg/day), the pooled prevalence of all-grade proteinuria was 43% (95% CI, 33%-54%), and that of grade ≥ 3 proteinuria was 7% (95% CI, 4%-11%) (Figure 4B, Table S6, Figure S5B). For the low dose (≤ 12 mg/day), the prevalence of all-grade proteinuria was 27% (95% CI, 21%-33%), and that of grade ≥ 3 proteinuria was 5% (95% CI, 4%-7%) (Figure 4C, Table S6, Figure S5C). The OR for all-grade proteinuria with high-dose lenvatinib compared to the control was 38.1 (95% CI, 15.2–95.9), whereas the OR for low-dose was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.06–2.84), as shown in Figure S6. Similarly, the OR for grade ≥ 3 proteinuria with high-dose lenvatinib compared to that of the control was 25.9 (95% CI, 4.6–144.3), whereas the OR for low-dose was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.30–2.19), as shown in Figure 5. Overall, the ORs comparing high-dose lenvatinib to low-dose lenvatinib were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6–2.0) and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.5–2.1) for all-grade and grade ≥ 3 proteinuria, respectively (Figure S7).

5.1 2 Hemorrhagic E vents

Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. Across SELECT (DTC), Study 205 (RCC) and REFLECT (HCC), hemorrhagic events of any grade occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria.

In SELECT, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients receiving LENVIMA, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In Study 205, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In REFLECT, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients receiving LENVIMA, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Serious tumor related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in patients treated with LENVIMA in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting. In post-marketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in other tumor types. The safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.

Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Data extraction and quality assessment

After eliminating duplicates, Y.S. and K.T. independently reviewed the abstracts. Any differences in the results between the two investigators were resolved by discussion. If the abstract was deemed potentially relevant, the full text of the publication was reviewed by the same investigators. We extracted data, including study details (such as first author, year of publication, country, number of patients, and patient characteristics), starting dose of lenvatinib, and data on the incidence of hypertension, proteinuria, and MACE. To assess the quality of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we used the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. The RoB 2 assesses the risk of bias from five domains in randomized trials: the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of the reported result. For each of these domains, we reached a risk of bias judgement (low risk, some concerns, or high risk) and then made a final judgment about the entire study based on the ratings for each domain. To evaluate the quality of non-RCTs, we employed the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), which consists of a 9-point rating scale for selection, comparability, and exposure. We rated articles with a score > 6 as "high" quality, ≤ 6 but > 4 as "moderate" quality, and ≤ 4 as "low" quality; low quality articles were not included as previously described.

In total, 21 deaths occurred in the study. Two were deemed treatment related: 1 patient with NSCLC (pulmonary hemorrhage) and 1 patient with urothelial cancer (gastrointestinal hemorrhage).

Prespecified AEs of special interest (ie, previously associated with drug exposure) were recorded also. For pembrolizumab, these were considered to be immune mediated. Potentially immune related, TRAEs occurred in 52% (71/137) of patients; grade 3 or 4 immune-related AEs occurred in 8% (11/137) and 2% (2/137) of patients, respectively (Table 3). The most common immune-related grade 3 and 4 TRAEs of special interest for pembrolizumab were adrenal insufficiency and colitis (1.5% each).

5.6 Thrombosis

Another JAK-inhibitor has increased the risk of thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis (compared to those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which VONJO is not indicated.

Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately.

5.7 Secondary Malignancies

Another JAK-inhibitor has increased the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (compared to those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which VONJO is not indicated. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with VONJO, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.

5.8 Risk of Infection

Another JAK-inhibitor increased the risk of serious infections (compared to best available therapy) in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections may occur in patients treated with VONJO. Delay starting therapy with VONJO until active serious infections have resolved. Observe patients receiving VONJO for signs and symptoms of infection and manage promptly. Use active surveillance and prophylactic antibiotics according to clinical guidelines.

5.9 Interactions With CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers

Co-administration of VONJO with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers is contraindicated. Monitor for increased adverse reactions of VONJO when administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Risk factors for immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated cardiovascular toxicities [^112MXsZ6]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved the field of cancer, especially in patients with advanced malignancies. Nevertheless, cardiovascular immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with high mortality and morbidity have been observed, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and vasculitis. To date, only a few clinical risk factors have been described and are currently being investigated.

Recent Findings

In this review, we address the four most prevailing risk factors for cardiovascular irAEs. ICI combination therapy is a predominant risk factor for developing ICI-mediated myocarditis. Additionally, ICI combined with other anti-cancer treatments (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors, radiation, chemotherapy) seems to increase the risk of developing cardiovascular irAEs. Other risk factors include female sex, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and specific tumors, on which we will further elaborate in this review. An a priori risk strategy to determine who is at risk to develop these cardiovascular irAEs is needed. Insights into the impact of risk factors are therefore warranted to help clinicians improve care and disease management in these patients.

Conclusions

Close monitoring of patients treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is critical because ARs can occur at any time and can be managed with additional medical therapy if they are diagnosed promptly. The clinical team plays a critical role in the identification and management of ARs in patients with aRCC treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab. Prompt management of ARs may potentially reduce treatment interruption(s) and/or lenvatinib dose reduction and allow patients to continue receiving therapy.

Proteinuria

Any-grade proteinuria occurred in 29.6% (n = 120) of patients and the median time to first onset was 4.9 weeks (Figs. 2 and 3).

Monitoring proteinuria prior to initiation of treatment and periodic monitoring during treatment are recommended(Supplementary Fig. S7; Fig. 4). Lenvatinib should be withheld for ≥ 2g of proteinuria/24 h and then resumed at a lower dose when proteinuria is < 2g/24 h. Treatment should be discontinued for nephrotic syndrome(Fig. 4).

Overlapping Toxicities

In Study-309/KEYNOTE-775, the safety profile observed for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was generally consistent with the known safety profiles of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab when used as monotherapies and as a combination in patients with endometrial cancer and other solid tumors, with no new safety signals identified.

In instances where both agents could cause an AR (eg, diarrhea, liver enzyme elevations), the timing of AR onset and AR resolution with treatment interruption can be evaluated in the context of the shorter half-life of lenvatinib. If dose interruption of lenvatinib does not lead to clinical improvement, an imAR may be considered (Supplementary Fig. 8). Severe ARs may sometimes require interruption of both drugs and prompt initiation of treatment.

In cases where diarrhea persists despite medical management, lenvatinib should be withheld and resumed at a lower dose or discontinued, based on severity. If colitis is suspected, adequate evaluation should be used to confirm etiology or exclude other causes such as bacterial or viral infections. If determined to be immune-mediated, management guidelines should be followed. In cases of elevated liver enzymes, other offending agents (such as paracetamol), infection (eg, viral hepatitis), or metastatic disease should be ruled out, while following advice from the prescribing information.

### Rapidly progressing dyspnea and retiform purpura [^112LKLZJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is true regarding AVEs and other cardiovascular irAEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors?
A. Venous thromboembolic events represent approximately 10% of AVEs in the setting of ICI therapy.
B. In lung adenocarcinoma, the risk of AVE is higher in patients treated with chemotherapy compared to those treated with ICIs.
C. Prior to initiation of ICI therapy, routine baseline electrocardiogram should be obtained.
D. AVEs typically occur after 6 months of ICI therapy.
E. Combination immunotherapy with 2 ICIs of different mechanisms (ie, anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 inhibitors) reduces the risk of cardiovascular irAEs as versus treatment with a single immunotherapy agent.

Answer:

A. Correct – Venous thromboembolism represents about 10% of AVEs associated with ICI therapy and may lead to pulmonary embolism, cardiac mural thrombus, arterial insufficiency, or cerebrovascular events. Vasculitis and vasculopathy are far less common AVEs in the setting of ICI treatment. Durvalumab-associated acral vasculitis has previously been reported. Cardiovascular irAEs other than AVEs include those that primarily affect the heart, such as myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and heart block. Though cardiovascular irAEs are overall rare, they can quickly cause severe morbidity and mortality, often due to arrhythmia or shock. Cardiovascular irAEs have been reported with all currently approved ICIs.
B. Incorrect – In a single-center retrospective study, the rate of AVEs was similar in lung adenocarcinoma patients treated with either chemotherapy or an ICI. Chemotherapy is a known risk factor for AVE in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and ICIs appear to carry a similar risk.
C. Incorrect – There is no evidence to support that baseline or serial electrocardiograms should be obtained in asymptomatic patients undergoing ICI therapy.
D. Incorrect – Time of onset is not a useful predictor for cardiovascular irAEs, including AVEs. AVEs may occur later than other irAEs, but often present within the first 6 months of treatment.
E. Incorrect – Combination immunotherapy may be used to improve anti-tumor activity and survival in the treatment of certain cancers (eg, melanoma). However, patients on combination therapy also appear to be at increased risk of irAEs, including cardiovascular complications. Many patients are unable to tolerate combination immunotherapy.

### Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesion associated with inhibition of tyrosine kinases by lenvatinib: a case report [^111xSUE4]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Lenvatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with novel binding ability. It is considered the standard of care for metastatic thyroid cancer; moreover, whether it is indicated for other malignant tumors has been examined. Lenvatinib increases the risk of kidney injury in some patients. In comparison with sorafenib, which is a conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), lenvatinib results in more side effects, including hypertension and proteinuria. We describe a case of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that developed following treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer with lenvatinib and reviewed the mechanisms of renal impairment.

Case Presentation

We describe a patient with metastatic thyroid cancer who developed hypertension, nephrotic syndrome, and acute kidney injury after 3 months of lenvatinib treatment. Renal biopsy results revealed that 7 of 16 glomeruli indicated complete hyalinization, and that the glomeruli with incomplete hyalinization showed FSGS due to a vascular endothelial disorder and podocyte damage, which seemed to have been induced by lenvatinib treatment. These findings were similar to those of renal impairment treated with conventional TKIs. Although lenvatinib treatment was discontinued, up to 15 months were required to achieve remission of proteinuria, thus leading to chronic kidney disease with hyalinized lesions.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of secondary FSGS by lenvatinib treatment. Renal impairment treated with TKIs is commonly associated with minimal change nephrotic syndrome/FSGS findings, and it is suggested that renal involvement with TKI is different from that with the vascular endothelial growth factor ligand. Overexpression of c-mip due to TKI causes disorders such as podocyte dysregulation and promotion of apoptosis, which cause FSGS. Lenvatinib may result in FSGS by a similar mechanism with another TKI and could cause irreversible renal impairment; therefore caution must be used. It is essential to monitor blood pressure, urinary findings, and the renal function.

Choice of Second-Line Treatment

For a patient who progresses on first-line therapy, multiple options exist. The regimen of lenvatinib with everolimus was first assessed in a randomized, phase II study, comparing this agent to lenvatinib monotherapy and everolimus monotherapy. The combination demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival (14.6 months vs 5.5 months with everolimus monotherapy; P = 0.0005), leading to FDA approval. For those patients not exposed to prior cabozantinib (as in the current case), cabozantinib would also be an appropriate choice for second-line treatment. This agent has demonstrated benefit in a phase III trial comparing cabozantinib to everolimus in the second-line setting and beyond. Most recently, the agent tivozanib (a potent and specific VEGFR inhibitor) has shown benefit in a phase III trial in which the agent was compared with sorafenib, with specific attention given to the role of this agent in the third- and fourth-line settings.

In the current case, the patient developed shortness of breath after initiating therapy with lenvatinib/everolimus. Although there is a possibility of a cardiac etiology (depressed LVEF with lenvatinib), patients receiving mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus are also susceptible to interstitial pneumonitis. If detected early, these toxicities are potentially reversible. mTOR inhibitors have been associated with hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia, and thus, long-term use could affect cumulative cardiovascular risk.

Conclusions

In Study-309/KEYNOTE-775, successful AR management strategies included educating and preparing the patients, preventative measures, monitoring, dose modifications, and concomitant medications. The safety profile of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was generally consistent with that of each monotherapy and of the combination in patients with EC and other solid tumor types. The clinical team plays a critical role in prompt identification and management of ARs and should follow AR-management guidelines from the respective product labels to improve tolerance for the combination with the aim of maximizing efficacy while prioritizing safety and quality of life for patients.

Hypertension

The pooled incidence of all-grade hypertension among patients treated with lenvatinib was 50% (95% CI, 43%-58%), and that of grade ≥ 3 hypertension was 14% (95% CI, 10%-18%) (Figure 1A and Figure S3A). A significant degree of heterogeneity was observed among the included studies for both all-grade and grade ≥ 3 hypertension (both I² = 95%). Subgroup analyses were performed to assess potential sources of this heterogeneity (Table S5). The prevalence of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 hypertension in prospective studies was significantly higher than that reported in retrospective studies (both P < .001). Additionally, subgroup analysis by cancer type showed significant differences in the prevalence of all-grade and grade ≥ 3 hypertension among patients with thyroid cancer, HCC, and other cancers (both P < .001). The summary OR for hypertension associated with lenvatinib, compared to the control group, was calculated among the 5183 patients from 14 studies. As controls, 6 studies used atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, 6 studies used sorafenib, and the rest used placebo. The ORs for all-grade and grade ≥ 3 hypertension were 2.40 (95% CI, 1.41–4.09) and 2.73 (95% CI, 1.24–6.04), respectively, compared to those of the controls (Figure 2 and Figure S4), indicating a significantly increased risk of hypertension associated with lenvatinib.

Lenvatinib with pembrolizumab — The ongoing phase II KEYNOTE-146 trial included three groups of patients: treatment-naïve; those who had previously received at least one line of treatment that did not include anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 ICIs; and those who had previously received at least one anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 ICI. The median DOR was 24.2 months, 9 months, and 14.1 months, respectively, with hypertension, fatigue, and diarrhea the most frequent treatment-related AEs and hypothyroidism the most frequent immune-related AE. Based on these data, the Panel considers lenvatinib/pembrolizumab a category 2A, other recommended option for patients who are IO therapy naïve and useful in certain circumstances option for patients with prior IO therapy.

### Characterization and management of adverse reactions in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab [^113pMuXg]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The safety profile of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in EC that was not MSI‐H or dMMR in Study 111/KEYNOTE‐146 is generally consistent with the established profiles of each agent as monotherapy.

In this analysis of ARs, one important difference noted with the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy was that hypothyroidism occurred at a higher frequency (51%) than with either monotherapy (8% with pembrolizumab monotherapy across multiple indications; 21% of grade ≤ 2 in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who received lenvatinib monotherapy [Keytruda PI, Lenvima PI]). However, the severity of hypothyroidism remained low (1% incidence of grade 3, no grade 4 or 5) and no dose reductions (lenvatinib) or discontinuations (either study drug) were needed because of hypothyroidism.

Hypertension is one of the most frequently occurring ARs with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab treatment (Table 1). Cardiovascular events, including hypertension, are widely associated with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), likely as a result of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling inhibition. Although guidance from Study 111/KEYNOTE‐146 and the lenvatinib PI is informative, clinicians should ideally ensure that optimal BP control has been achieved before initiating lenvatinib therapy, as is the case for any anti‐VEGF targeting therapy. A panel composed of members of the Angiogenesis Task Force of the National Cancer Institute and experts in management of hypertension and cardiovascular toxicities in patients with cancer provided five specific recommendations for the recognition and management of hypertension associated with VEGF‐targeted therapies: (a) a risk assessment of patients to determine those potentially likely to develop hypertension, (b) addressing potential hypertension before onset of VEGF‐targeted therapy, (c) active monitoring throughout treatment but particularly within the first cycle, (d) setting goals for hypertension control, and (e) aggressive management through carefully chosen antihypertensive therapies. It has also been suggested that patients with a high risk for hypertension, such as those on lenvatinib treatment, perform at‐home BP monitoring with clear education regarding BP levels that warrant clinician notification. Such active BP home‐monitoring is encouraged for patients on lenvatinib therapy. Regarding the initial antihypertensive choice, prior studies have reported that VEGF inhibitor‐induced hypertension can be effectively managed with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and/or calcium channel blockers.

Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab — first-line therapy across all risk groups in ccRCC — was approved after the phase III CLEAR trial including favorable-, intermediate-, or poor-risk RCC randomized to lenvatinib/pembrolizumab, lenvatinib/everolimus, or sunitinib; lenvatinib/pembrolizumab produced significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and a higher objective response rate (ORR) than sunitinib, maintained in follow-up. At median 49-month follow-up, overall survival (OS) was favorable for lenvatinib/pembrolizumab versus sunitinib, whereas OS was not significantly different between lenvatinib/everolimus and sunitinib. Final analysis safety showed ~85% treatment-emergent adverse events (grade 3 or higher) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus ~75% with sunitinib, including hypertension and diarrhea. Based on these data, the Panel recommends first-line lenvatinib/pembrolizumab as a category 1, preferred option for patients with ccRCC across all risk groups.

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ssG7T]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

For all the selected studies, the number of patients who developed all-grade and grade ≥ 3 hypertension or proteinuria, as well as the number of patients who received lenvatinib, were pooled. For the calculation of incidence, the number of patients who developed adverse events — such as hypertension and proteinuria — and the total number of patients treated with lenvatinib were extracted from the selected studies. The proportion of event incidence rates and their 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs) were then calculated for each study. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were also calculated for studies that included a control group. All the statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan), a graphical user interface for R. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I² statistics (low: 25%-50%, moderate: 50%-75%, and high: > 75%). If I² was ≥ 50%, a random effects model was selected; otherwise, a fixed effects model was chosen. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Statistically significant differences, except for the Egger's test, were set at P -values < .05. For the Egger's test, P < .1 was considered statistically significant.

Ethics approval

Ethical approval was not required for this study because it involved the retrieval and synthesis of data from previously published studies.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LENVIMA as a single agent in 261 patients with DTC (SELECT) and 476 patients with HCC (REFLECT), LENVIMA with pembrolizumab in 406 patients with endometrial carcinoma (Study 309), LENVIMA with everolimus in 62 patients with RCC (Study 205), and LENVIMA with pembrolizumab in 352 patients with RCC (CLEAR). Safety data obtained in 1823 patients with advanced solid tumors who received LENVIMA as a single agent across multiple clinical studies was used to further characterize the risks of serious adverse reactions. Among the 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, the median age was 61 years (20 to 89 years), the dose range was 0.2 mg to 32 mg daily, and the median duration of exposure was 5.6 months.

The data below reflect exposure to LENVIMA in 1557 patients enrolled in randomized, active-controlled trials (REFLECT; Study 205; CLEAR; Study 309), and a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (SELECT). The median duration of exposure to LENVIMA across these five studies ranged from 6 to 16 months. The demographic and exposure data for each clinical trial population are described in the subsections below.

### Incidence and risk of hypertension and proteinuria in cancer patients treated with lenvatinib: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tUrDn]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tumor cells induce angiogenesis through the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which leads to tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, in recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on therapies targeting VEGF; many molecular-targeted agents have been used, such as monoclonal antibodies against VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR), as well as VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Lenvatinib is one of the VEGFR-TKIs that demonstrates strong inhibitory activity against VEGFR2. It is indicated for the treatment of various cancers, including thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thymic carcinoma, and endometrial cancer.

Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets VEGFRs and other angiogenic and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. The most common adverse effects of lenvatinib include hypertension and proteinuria, which are the primary factors responsible for dose interruption or reduction. Studies have shown that lenvatinib is associated with a higher risk of developing hypertension and proteinuria than other VEGFR-TKIs. High-grade (grade ≥ 3) hypertension and proteinuria, especially hypertensive crisis and nephrotic syndrome, may cause significant cardiovascular damage and renal failure. These life-threatening consequences can lead to treatment interruption or discontinuation, consequently worsening cancer outcomes.

The incidence of grade ≥ 3 hypertension in patients treated with lenvatinib varies considerably, ranging from 0% in an HCC study to 74% in a thyroid cancer study. A similar variation exists for the incidence of high-grade proteinuria, with reports ranging from 0% in an HCC study to 33% in a thyroid cancer study. Owing to the limited number of patients in each study, the overall risk magnitude of developing hypertension and proteinuria in patients treated with lenvatinib remains unclear. Moreover, while hypertension and proteinuria are considered dose-limiting toxicities of lenvatinib, no reports have definitively verified this, and the frequency of these adverse effects across different therapeutic doses remains unknown. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall risks and incidence of hypertension and proteinuria associated with lenvatinib, with a particular focus on the dosage.

Results

Search results

Figure S1 shows the flow diagram used to extract the studies for analysis in this study. A total of 5154 studies were extracted from databases based on search terms. Of these, 1800 articles were excluded because they were duplicates. Of the remaining 3354 studies, 3192 were excluded because they were review articles, case reports, and systematic reviews. Of the remaining 162 studies, 16 could not be retrieved in full text. The remaining 146 studies then underwent full-text review. Finally, 64 eligible studies were included in the analysis.

Characteristics of the included studies

The characteristics of each study included in the analysis are shown in Table S3. A total of 64 eligible studies were identified for analysis, which contained 8115 patients treated with lenvatinib and 2328 control patients. Regarding the study design, 22 studies were prospective (including four RCTs), and the remaining 42 were retrospective. Underlying malignancies included HCC (41 studies), thyroid cancer (15 studies), biliary tract (1 study), solid tumor (1 study), renal cell carcinoma (1 study), lung cancer (1 study), thymic carcinoma (1 study), neuroendocrine neoplasm (1 study), endometrial cancer (1 study), and colorectal cancer (1 study). The starting treatment dose was classified as high-dose (≥ 20 mg/day) for 22 studies and as low-dose (≤ 12 mg/day) for 42 studies.

Risk of bias assessment

Observational studies underwent evaluation using the NOS scale. Two of the included studies were of "moderate" quality and the remainder were "high" (Table S4). The Rob 2 tool revealed no high risk of bias in the RCTs (Figure S2).

### Risk factors for immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated cardiovascular toxicities [^116K4MBi]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Pericardial disease, including pericarditis and pericardial effusion, can lead to life-threatening cardiac tamponade. In a retrospective single-center study, an incidence rate of 1.57% has been reported for pericardial disease with threefold increase in pericarditis incidence in ICI-treated patients compared to non-ICI-treated patients. This study showed a more than fourfold increased risk for development of pericarditis and pericardial effusion, even when adjusted for potential confounders (hazard ratio HR) 4.37 [2.09–9.14, p < 0.001]. Additionally, ICI-mediated pericardial disease was associated with a 1.5-fold mortality risk. In a recent systematic review of case studies, anti-PD-1 therapy was used in all patients that presented with ICI-mediated pericarditis. As with myocarditis, pericarditis due to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy occurred more frequently than with anti-CTLA-4 (0.36% and 0.16%, respectively) with a ROR of 2.28 [1.27–4.12].

ICI treatment was found to be associated with higher reporting of vasculitis, ROR 1.56 [1.25–1.94]. A case study linked myocardial injury to myocardial vasculitis with the use of pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1). Researchers observed enhanced T cell infiltration and production of proinflammatory cytokines in the hearts of LAG-3/PD-1 deficient mice, suggesting that inhibition of both ICs in patients presumably will be associated with enhanced risk of developing myocarditis, pericarditis, and vasculitis. Contrarily, cardiotoxicity risk due to ICI combination therapy was not found with neither pericarditis (or pericardial disease in general) nor vasculitis, with RORs of 1.1 [0.53–2.24] and 1.3 [0.62–2.67], respectively. While this could be due to underreporting of these irAEs, it also suggests that cardiovascular irAEs can be specific to certain affected ICs.

Hypertension

The median time to first onset of any-grade hypertension was 3.0 weeks and for grade ≥ 3 severity hypertension, 3.1 weeks (Figs. 1 and 2). Patient incidences of hypertension by worst-grade severity were: any grade, 56.3%; grade 1, 6.5%; grade 2, 21.0%; grade 3, 28.1%; grades 4 and 5, 0.3% each (Table 2). The CLEAR study protocol required eligible patients to have a blood pressure (BP) of ≤ 150/90 mm Hg at the time of study entry and, if known to be hypertensive, patients should have been on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before cycle 1/day 1. Hypertension was graded based only on BP measurements and not on the number of antihypertensive medications; per protocol, BP was monitored before beginning treatment (screening and baseline) and on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1 and 2. Thereafter, BP was monitored on day 1 of each cycle; patients with systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mm Hg had their BP monitored on day 15 (or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP was ≤ 150 mm Hg and diastolic BP was ≤ 95 mm Hg for 2 consecutive treatment cycles. Dose modifications were used as necessary to treat hypertension, with 9.1% of patients experiencing lenvatinib interruptions, 3.1% experiencing pembrolizumab interruptions, and 11.9% experiencing lenvatinib dose reductions, while 0.9% of patients discontinued lenvatinib and 0.3% discontinued pembrolizumab (Fig. 1). Per the lenvatinib label, BP should be controlled prior to treatment and monitored during treatment; lenvatinib should be withheld for patients experiencing grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy, but treatment can be resumed at a reduced dose when hypertension is controlled at grade 2 or lower severity. Lenvatinib should be withheld in any instance where a patient is at imminent risk of developing a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complications of uncontrolled hypertensionand should be permanently discontinued if hypertension reaches grade 4 severity. Further details regarding management of hypertension are included in the Supplementary Appendix.

### Characterization and management of adverse reactions from the CLEAR study in advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab [^116sPxTG]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Data from recent clinical trials emphasize the importance of combination therapies (TKI + ICI, ICI + ICI), which have shown notably improved efficacy outcomes in patients with renal cell carcinoma; these therapies are also associated with distinct safety profiles. ICI + ICI combination therapies are associated with specific immune-mediated adverse events that include gastrointestinal, endocrine, dermatologic, and pulmonary adverse events. TKIs are known to be associated with certain adverse events (eg, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, rash, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension) when used in the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Treatment with TKI + ICI combination therapies also may be associated with a higher risk of diarrhea and decreased appetite.

To ensure patient safety, healthcare providers should educate themselves on the patient management modalities for ARs associated with each treatment program. Also, for lenvatinib therapy, several studies have indicated that the optimal dosing strategy across indications is to start treatment at the recommended doses, and then interrupt or dose reduce, as necessary, to optimally manage ARs while supporting continuation of treatment. For this strategy to be successful, active engagement of the multidisciplinary clinical team is crucial to ensure proactive and prompt identification and management of ARs. Specifically, baseline monitoring of blood pressure, urine protein levels, and thyroid and liver function prior to lenvatinib treatment are recommended; moreover, regular monitoring of blood pressure, proteinuria, electrolytes, blood calcium levels, and thyroid and liver function are also recommended during treatment with lenvatinib. For most of the key ARs, the management adviceis to withhold lenvatinib treatment for persistent or intolerable grade 2 and all grade 3 severity. Upon resolution to grade ≤ 1 or baseline severity (or to tolerable grade 2 per the CLEAR study protocol), lenvatinib treatment can be resumed at a lower dose. For most ARs, if the severity reaches grade 4, it is recommended to permanently discontinue lenvatinib; in general, pembrolizumab should be discontinued for grade 4 immune-mediated ARs. Optimal medical management should be used when available and applicable prior to lenvatinib dose reduction (eg, for nausea, hypertension, diarrhea, hypothyroidism); lenvatinib and/or pembrolizumab dose interruptions or lenvatinib dose reductions should be initiated according to the respective product prescribing information. Dosing interventions, including dosing interruptions for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab and dose reductions for lenvatinib, are important management strategies for ARs, and lenvatinib dose modifications were judiciously used in the CLEAR trial to manage ARs as appropriate.

### Checkpoint inhibitor-associated cutaneous small vessel vasculitis [^116G4kqc]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A strong temporal relationship existed in our case with the onset of vasculitis and the administration of checkpoint inhibitors and with the resolution of vasculitis with the discontinuation of the implicated drugs and initiation of appropriate medical management (Naranjo score of 7). Furthermore, the biopsy specimen showed eosinophils, which suggest a drug-induced reaction. We hypothesize that the combinatorial effect of dual checkpoint inhibition, with the therapeutic addition of ipilimumab to pembrolizumab in our patient, resulted in drug-induced cutaneous small vessel vasculitis. The pathogenesis has yet to be elucidated; however, we hope this addition to the literature will spur curiosity in the medical community to delve deeper into the rare vasculitic complications of checkpoint inhibitors and, more broadly, monoclonal antibodies.

First-line systemic therapy — sorafenib and lenvatinib monotherapy is characterized by sorafenib's modest absolute survival benefit of approximately 3 months (10.7 vs. 7.9 mo) over placebo in SHARP, while lenvatinib met its primary endpoint of noninferiority versus sorafenib with no significant difference in overall survival (OS) but improvements in time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life, and objective response rate (ORR). Hypertension, proteinuria, dysphonia, and hypothyroidism were more common with lenvatinib, whereas hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia, and diarrhea were more common with sorafenib, and both agents remain first-line options for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not candidates for newer first-line combination therapies; nivolumab failed to improve OS compared with sorafenib.

2021 American College of Rheumatology/Vasculitis Foundation guideline — systemic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) scope, methods, and key recommendations are as follows: The guideline provides evidence-based recommendations and expert guidance for systemic PAN, addressing Twenty-one clinical questions in population, intervention, comparator, and outcome format for systemic, non–hepatitis B–related PAN, with systematic literature reviews and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology; each recommendation required ≥ 70% consensus among the Voting Panel. The results include 16 recommendations and 1 ungraded position statement, with most recommendations graded as conditional due to the paucity of evidence. The recommendations support early treatment of severe PAN with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids, limiting toxicity through minimizing long-term exposure to both treatments, and the use of imaging and tissue biopsy for disease diagnosis, and they endorse minimizing risk by using established therapy at disease onset and identify areas where adjunctive therapy may be warranted. The recommendations provide guidance regarding diagnostic strategies, use of pharmacologic agents, and imaging for patients with PAN.

Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.

Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus standard of care for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer: final analysis of the randomized, open-label, phase III LEAP-017 study [^113af7S3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety

The median duration of treatment exposure was 4.2 months (range, 0.1–21.6) versus 2.1 months (range, 0.0–20.0) for patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC groups, respectively. Adverse events of any cause occurred in 237 (100%) patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 230 (98%) patients in the SOC group (Table 2). The most common (≥ 30% in any group) were hypertension (58% v 24%), proteinuria (45% v 12%), diarrhea (42% v 25%), hypothyroidism (38% v 7%), decreased appetite (30% v 26%), fatigue (30% v 25%), and nausea (26% v 30%). Events of grade 3 or greater occurred in 183 (77%) versus 138 (59%) patients, respectively, most commonly hypertension (28% v 9%), proteinuria (11% v 1%), and diarrhea (9% v 4%). There were two treatment-related deaths in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group, one due to cerebral hemorrhage and one due to pneumonitis (Table 2).

TABLE 2.
Summary of Adverse Events in all Treated Patients

As expected, there were more potentially immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions, which occurred in 115 (48%) patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 23 (10%) patients in the SOC group, the most common of which were hypothyroidism (38% v 7%) and hyperthyroidism (5% v 1%). Grade 3 or greater events occurred in 18 (8%) and five (2%) patients, respectively. One grade 5 event because of pneumonitis occurred with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Table 2).

When adjusted for exposure duration, the rates of adverse events were similar between both treatment groups (Appendix Table A 3), including for grade 3 or greater adverse events (26.63 events per 100 person-months in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group v 31.56 in the SOC group) and for grade 3 or greater drug-related adverse events (16.59 v 17.89).

Takayasu arteritis (TAK) refractory to glucocorticoids: For patients with TAK that is refractory to treatment with glucocorticoids alone, we conditionally recommend adding a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor over adding tocilizumab. The Voting Panel favored tumor necrosis factor inhibitors over tocilizumab due to greater clinical experience and data, although tocilizumab may also be considered, especially when tumor necrosis factor inhibitor use is contraindicated.

### Characterization and management of adverse reactions in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab [^113gXtdt]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Certain ARs, including diarrhea and liver enzyme elevation, may be initially considered attributable to either study drug. As management strategies differ, it is important to determine the causative agent, versus an alternative etiology, that is most likely inciting the toxicity. Timing of AR onset and AR resolution with treatment interruption can be evaluated in the context of the shorter half‐life of lenvatinib. In instances in which both agents could incite an AR, if dose interruption of lenvatinib does not lead to clinical improvement, an immune‐mediated AR should be considered. In the case of diarrhea, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (i.e. diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blood or mucus in stool with or without fever). Patients with grade ≥ 2 diarrhea who are suspected of colitis should undergo further evaluation and consider consultation with a gastrointestinal specialist. In the case of liver enzyme elevation, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis (i.e. jaundice and malaise with or without fever), and elevated liver enzymes should be monitored frequently.

Patients should be educated before treatment onset regarding the common ARs and should be well versed in the management plan of these reactions. Prophylactic prescriptions for supportive care therapies (e.g. antihypertensives, antiemetics) with clear instructions regarding initiation parameters could be considered. Teams should monitor potential ARs closely and consider weekly visits for the first two to three cycles of treatment; however, continued vigilance is important. Attention to emergent ARs should not wane over time, as late‐onset ARs (particularly immune‐mediated events) can arise.

This exploratory post hoc analysis of ARs in the EC cohort of Study 111/KEYNOTE‐146 had several limitations. The study population was small. Moreover, as very few analyses were prespecified, results were descriptive in nature. Despite these limitations, this study indicated that ARs in patients treated with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination therapy are consistent with the known profiles of each monotherapy.

### Characterization and management of adverse reactions from the CLEAR study in advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab [^1158PPF9]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

The adverse event profile of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was considered manageable and generally consistent with the established profiles of each monotherapy. This post hoc analysis characterizes adverse reactions (ARs) that were observed in patients treated with the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in the CLEAR study. Per the FDA, ARs are grouped terms of adverse events that are reasonably associated with the use of a drug. Factors used in determining the association of adverse events with the use of a drug include: frequency of reporting, comparison of adverse-event rate with drug versus placebo, extent of dose–response, extent to which an adverse event is consistent with the pharmacology of the drug, timing of the adverse event relative to time of drug exposure, existence of challenge and dechallenge experience, and whether the adverse event is known to be caused by related drugs in the same class. Notably, adverse events that are reported under different terms but represent the same phenomena are grouped together as a single AR, to avoid diluting or obscuring the true effect. The ARs associated with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab from the CLEAR study are listed in the respective lenvatinib and pembrolizumab prescribing information, and specific information regarding immune-related ARs (irARs) related to pembrolizumab are discussed in the pembrolizumab prescribing information and prior publications. It is critical for a clinical team to promptly recognize and manage ARs for patient safety and to foster dose adjustment and supportive measures to extend time on therapy and resulting treatment benefits. The objective of the analyses presented here is to specifically characterize common ARs in previously untreated patients with aRCC who were treated with the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumabin the CLEAR study. We also discuss optimal management strategies for patients with selected ARs treated with this combination.

### Large-vessel vasculitis possibly induced by BRAF and MEK inhibitors for BRAF V600E positive lung adenocarcinoma [^1118i97x]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The combination therapy of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors is approved for treating patients with BRAF V600E-positive tumours, including melanoma and lung cancer. Several case reports indicated autoimmune side effects associated with the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Still, the effects of these drugs on the immune system were not fully elucidated. Here, we report a patient with large-vessel vasculitis diagnosed after initiation of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF V600E-positive metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. She was a never-smoker woman in her early 70s who presented with a chronic cough and was diagnosed with BRAF V600E-positive metastatic lung adenocarcinoma by transbronchial lung biopsy. She was successfully treated with prednisolone and methotrexate while BRAF and MEK inhibitors were continued. We should be careful about autoimmune diseases using BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

### Implementation of regulatory guidance for JAK inhibitors use in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: an international appropriateness study [^111Ubemq]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) proposed measures to address severe side effects linked to Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). Use of these medications in individuals aged 65 and older, those at high cardiovascular risk, active or former long-term smokers, and those with increased cancer risk should be considered only if no alternatives exist. Caution is advised when administering JAKi to patients at risk of venous thromboembolism. We aim to implement recommendations from regulatory guidelines based on areas of uncertainty identified.

Methods

A two-round modified Research and Development/University of California Los Angeles appropriateness methodology study was conducted. A panel of 21 gastroenterologists, dermatologists and rheumatologists used a 9-point Likert scale to rate the appropriateness of administering a JAKi for each proposed clinical scenario. Scores for appropriateness were categorized as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate. Two rounds were performed, each with online surveys and a virtual meeting to enable discussion and rating of each best practice.

Results

Round 1 involved participants rating JAKi appropriateness and suggesting descriptors to reduce uncertainty. Survey results were discussed in a virtual meeting, identifying areas of disagreement. In round 2, participants rated their agreement with descriptors from round 1, and the level of uncertainty and disagreement reduced. Age flexibility is recommended in the absence of other risk factors. Active counseling on modifiable risks (e.g., overweight, mild hyperlipidemia and hypertension) and smoking cessation is advised. Uncertainty persists regarding cancer risk due to various factors.

Conclusions

We outlined regulatory guidance without a personalized evaluation of the patient's risk profile might lead to uncertainty and become an arid technicality. Therefore, we identified gaps and implemented PRAC recommendations to help health professionals in clinical practice.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma [^114Yuhqb]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

First-line systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — lenvatinib versus sorafenib (REFLECT): In a randomized trial powered for noninferiority, lenvatinib showed equal efficacy to sorafenib with median overall survival 13.6 vs 12.3 months and longer median progression-free survival with lenvatinib at 7.4 vs 3.7 months; nearly all participants had preserved liver function (99% CTP A) with good functional status (63% ECOG PS 0 and 37% ECOG PS 1), and patients with > 50% liver involvement and main portal vein invasion were explicitly excluded. Safety signals included more SAEs and a higher rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the lenvatinib arm, with a tendency for more hypertension with lenvatinib and more skin toxicity with sorafenib. Quality of life scores declined in both groups, with earlier time to decline in the sorafenib arm and no significant between-group difference in summary scores.

### Large vessel vasculitis associated with atezolizumab [^114iuUjc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become the cornerstone in the management of a variety of cancers and have been implicated in immune-related rheumatological adverse events, including inflammatory myositis, polyarthritis and vasculitis. Existing literature has documented large vessel vasculitis in association with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab therapy. Although large vessel vasculitis was reported in one patient who had received both atezolizumab and pegfilgrastim, our patient represents the first instance of large vessel vasculitis associated with atezolizumab alone. Discontinuation of atezolizumab and tapered glucocorticoid therapy resulted in clinical and radiographic resolution.

### Newer therapeutic approaches to the vasculitides: biologic agents [^111M6CVB]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Biologic therapies have emerged as important treatments in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and are now garnering more attention in the vasculitides. These agents, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, B-cell-depleting agents, interferon-alpha, and some antiviral treatments, target specific components of the immune system and may have lower side effect risk profiles than the conventional immunosuppressives and cytotoxic agents. This article addresses the encouraging data and the possible pitfalls of these new therapeutic options, thus far evaluated mostly by case reports, small series, and open-label trials. Confirming the efficacy of existing and newer therapies will require further clinical investigation through randomized placebo-controlled studies to identify the proper doses and treatment schedules and single out those drugs that may expose patients to dangers that outweigh the potential benefits.

### Deuruxolitinib phosphate (Leqselvi) [^113UHUcE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of deuruxolitinib PO (also known as Leqselvi):

- **Increased risk of mortality**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as another JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients aged ≥ 50 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor.
- **Major cardiovascular events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as another JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients aged ≥ 50 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Weigh the risks against benefits in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, including current or past smoking status.
- **Malignancy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as another JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with an increased risk of malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). Non-melanoma skin cancers have also been reported in patients treated with deuruxolitinib. Obtain periodic skin examinations in patients at risk for skin cancer.
- **Serious infections**: avoid using deuruxolitinib in patients with active serious infections, including localized infections, active hepatitis B or C, or tuberculosis. Evaluate for tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, and treat latent tuberculosis before initiating treatment. Monitor all patients for active tuberculosis during treatment. Weigh the risks against benefits of deuruxolitinib treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infections, a history of serious or opportunistic infections, underlying conditions increasing the risk of infections, and patients exposed to tuberculosis or residing in or recently traveled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or mycoses. Complete all necessary immunizations, including herpes zoster, according to the current immunization schedule. Avoid using live vaccines during or immediately before treatment.
- **Thrombosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as deuruxolitinib has been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, including DVT, PE, and arterial thrombosis. Avoid using deuruxolitinib in patients at increased risk for thrombosis.

### Baricitinib (Olumiant) [^1151BSbw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Thrombosis

Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with OLUMIANT compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers.

If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, patients should discontinue OLUMIANT and be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. Avoid OLUMIANT in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis.

5.6 Hypersensitivity

Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving OLUMIANT, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue OLUMIANT while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Gastrointestinal Perforations

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT.

Monitor OLUMIANT-treated patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Evaluate promptly patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

Neutropenia – Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3.

In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with COVID-19 and an ANC less than 500 cells/mm3.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on ANC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Postmarketing cases consistent with erythema multiforme major (EMM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Withhold TAGRISSO if EMM, SJS, or TEN is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed.

5.6 Cutaneous Vasculitis

Postmarketing cases of cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and IgA vasculitis have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Withhold TAGRISSO if cutaneous vasculitis is suspected, evaluate for systemic involvement, and consider dermatology consultation. If no other etiology can be identified, consider permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO based on severity.

5.7 Aplastic Anemia

Aplastic anemia has been reported in patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials (0.06% of 1813) and postmarketing [see Postmarketing (6.2)]. Some cases had a fatal outcome. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia including but not limited to, new or persistent fevers, bruising, bleeding, and pallor. If aplastic anemia is suspected, withhold TAGRISSO and obtain a hematology consultation. If aplastic anemia is confirmed, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Perform complete blood count with differential before starting TAGRISSO, periodically throughout treatment, and more frequently if indicated.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology / vasculitis foundation guideline for the management of giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis [^115y95aW]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Recommendation interpretation — strength and certainty: A strong recommendation is typically supported by moderate- to high-quality evidence and for a strong recommendation, the recommended course of action would apply to all or almost all patients; only a small proportion of clinicians/patients would not want to follow the recommendation, and in rare instances, a strong recommendation may be based on very low- to low-certainty evidence. A conditional recommendation is generally supported by lower-quality evidence or a close balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes; for a conditional recommendation, the recommended course of action would apply to the majority of patients, but the alternative is a reasonable consideration, conditional recommendations always warrant a shared decision-making approach, and the guideline specifies conditions under which the alternative may be considered. When a commonly encountered clinical question had not been fully clarified and required further investigation, the panel felt that providing guidance was warranted and for these situations, the guideline presents "ungraded position statements", which reflect general views of the Voting Panel.

First-Line T reatment of P atients with RCC in C ombination with Pembrolizumab CLEAR

The efficacy of LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in CLEAR (NCT02811861), a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial that enrolled 1069 patients with advanced RCC in the first-line setting. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus "Rest of the World") and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic groups (favorable, intermediate and poor risk).

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to one of the following treatment arms:

LENVIMA 20 mg orally once daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months.
LENVIMA 18 mg orally once daily in combination with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily.
Sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then off treatment for 2 weeks.

Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Administration of LENVIMA with pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. Pembrolizumab dosing was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with LENVIMA could be continued beyond 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks.
