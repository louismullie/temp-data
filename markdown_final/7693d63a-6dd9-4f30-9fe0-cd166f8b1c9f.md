## Question

Resume sexual activity after gonorrhea treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when it is safe to resume sexual activity after treatment for gonorrhea, and what conditions must be met to avoid reinfection and transmission. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core CDC abstinence rule and its timing. Then, I should verify whether symptom resolution is required in addition to the 7-day clock. Next, I will examine the partner-treatment requirement and how that interacts with the 7-day rule. After that, I should consider special situations like pharyngeal infection and test-of-cure. Finally, I will review evidence on reinfection risk and practical counseling points to ensure the guidance is actionable and safe.

> Let me first confirm the core rule. The CDC instructs that persons treated for gonorrhea should abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners have been treated, which means the earliest safe date is 7 days after the index patient's treatment only if all partners have completed treatment by that point, otherwise abstinence continues until partners are treated [^113F25zJ] [^116eHook].

> Wait, let me verify whether symptom resolution is also required. The CDC language says "7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated", and it further notes "and resolution of symptoms, if present", which implies that even after 7 days, patients with ongoing symptoms should continue to abstain until symptoms resolve, so I should not jump to conclusions and assume sex is okay at day 7 if symptoms persist [^113F25zJ] [^116eHook].

> Hold on, I should verify the partner-treatment condition because that is often the bottleneck. Partners should be notified, evaluated, and presumptively treated, and if linkage to care is delayed or unlikely, expedited partner therapy (EPT) should be offered where legal, with partners instructed to abstain for 7 days after their own treatment and until their symptoms resolve, which means the index patient cannot safely resume sex until those partner conditions are met [^111xGJje] [^116eHook].

> I need to check special circumstances. For pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended 7–14 days after treatment, and although the abstinence clock still starts at treatment day, many clinicians advise waiting until after the test-of-cure window or a negative result before resuming sexual contact to avoid transmission or missing treatment failure, so I should counsel patients accordingly and coordinate timing with partner treatment [^111JhmdE] [^113F25zJ].

> Next, I should review why these rules matter. Reinfection within 3 months is common, with rates around 7–12% nationally, and modeling suggests that delays in partner treatment meaningfully increase reinfection risk, which is why the 7-day plus partner-treated rule and the 3-month retesting recommendation are emphasized in guidelines and primary care summaries [^111JhmdE] [^115GqhS5] [^116eHook].

> Let me consider practical counseling so patients can operationalize this. I should confirm that patients understand to count 7 full days from the treatment date, ensure all partners from the prior 60 days are treated or receive EPT, and avoid sex until 7 days after their own treatment and until partners complete treatment and symptoms resolve. I should also schedule the 3-month retest at the time of treatment and discuss condom use after resumption to reduce reinfection risk, aligning with CDC partner services and follow-up guidance [^113F25zJ] [^1114FTh5] [^116eHook].

> But wait, what if symptoms are slow to resolve. I should double-check expected symptom timelines. Most uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea symptoms resolve within about 1 week, with a median time to resolution around 2 days, though coinfection and being female can prolong symptom resolution, so persistent symptoms beyond a week warrant reassessment for treatment failure, reinfection, or alternative diagnoses before clearing the patient for sex [^114vLz5L].

> Putting this together, the bottom line is that sexual activity can resume no sooner than 7 days after the index patient's treatment and only when all sex partners have completed treatment and all parties' symptoms have resolved. If partners have not yet been treated by day 7, abstinence must continue until they are treated, and for pharyngeal infection many clinicians extend abstinence through the test-of-cure window, with a planned retest at 3 months to detect reinfection early [^113F25zJ] [^111JhmdE] [^111SgVdL].

---

Resume sexual activity **7 days after completing treatment** [^113F25zJ] and once all partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved [^114x7Q6P]. If symptoms persist or new symptoms appear, **delay sex and seek re-evaluation** [^114wKYsZ]. Retest at **3 months** [^111JhmdE] to detect reinfection, and use condoms consistently thereafter to reduce transmission risk [^117KWRP4].

---

## Recommended timeline for resuming sexual activity

The CDC advises abstaining from sexual activity for **7 days after completing treatment** [^113F25zJ] and until all sexual partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved [^116eHook]. This interval ensures adequate antibiotic exposure and reduces the risk of transmission and reinfection [^116eHook].

---

## Factors influencing the timing of resumption

Several factors influence when sexual activity can safely resume:

- **Resolution of symptoms**: Symptoms such as discharge, dysuria, or pelvic pain should resolve before resuming sexual activity [^113F25zJ].

- **Partner treatment**: All sexual partners must be treated to prevent reinfection and further transmission [^1114FTh5].

- **Test of cure**: Not routinely required for uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea [^111JhmdE], but recommended for pharyngeal infections 7–14 days after treatment [^113F25zJ].

---

## Risks associated with early resumption

Resuming sexual activity before the recommended 7-day period or before symptoms resolve increases the risk of:

- **Reinfection**: Untreated partners can reinfect the treated individual, leading to persistent or recurrent infection [^115GqhS5].

- **Transmission**: Early resumption can facilitate the spread of gonorrhea to new partners [^113F25zJ].

- **Complications**: Persistent infection can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and ectopic pregnancy [^112Lqvwz].

---

## Importance of partner treatment

Partner treatment is critical to preventing reinfection and further transmission. The CDC recommends that all sexual partners within the past 60 days be **notified, tested, and treated** [^116eHook]. If partners cannot access timely care, **expedited partner therapy (EPT)** [^111xGJje] is recommended in jurisdictions where it is legal [^114s2YpM].

---

## Follow-up testing and retesting

Follow-up testing is essential to ensure successful treatment and detect reinfection. The CDC recommends **retesting at 3 months** [^111JhmdE] after treatment because reinfection is common [^113F25zJ]. If retesting at 3 months is not feasible, retesting should occur at the next healthcare visit within 12 months [^113F25zJ].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Effective counseling and education are essential to ensure adherence to abstinence recommendations and prevent reinfection. Patients should be informed about:

- **Abstinence period**: The importance of abstaining from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all partners are treated and symptoms resolve [^113F25zJ].

- **Partner notification**: The necessity of notifying and treating all sexual partners to prevent reinfection [^1114FTh5].

- **Condom use**: The importance of consistent and correct condom use after resuming sexual activity [^117KWRP4].

- **Retesting**: The need for retesting at 3 months to detect reinfection [^111JhmdE].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require additional considerations:

- **Pregnant women**: Gonorrhea infection during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and neonatal infection. Pregnant women should be treated promptly and retested in the third trimester if risk remains high [^115xrHcc].

- **Men who have sex with men (MSM)**: MSM are at increased risk for gonorrhea and other STIs. Regular screening and retesting are recommended [^11652TaU].

- **Individuals with HIV**: Co-infection with gonorrhea and HIV increases the risk of HIV transmission. Regular screening and retesting are recommended [^114o2o3u].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Abstinence period | 7 days after treatment and until all partners are treated and symptoms resolve [^113F25zJ] |
| Partner treatment | Notify, test, and treat all sexual partners within the past 60 days [^116eHook] |
| Test of cure | Recommended for pharyngeal infections 7–14 days after treatment [^111JhmdE] |
| Retesting | 3 months after treatment [^111JhmdE] |
| Condom use | Consistent and correct use after resuming sexual activity [^117KWRP4] |

---

Patients should **abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after completing treatment** [^113F25zJ], ensure all partners are treated, and confirm symptom resolution before resuming sex. Retesting at **3 months** [^111JhmdE] and consistent condom use are essential to prevent reinfection and transmission.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States and is associated with serious health sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Treatment for gonorrhea has been complicated by antimicrobial resistance. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to each of the antimicrobials that were previously recommended as first-line treatment regimens, and current treatment options are severely limited. This article summarizes the key questions and data that were discussed at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines Expert Consultation meeting in April 2013, and the rationale for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in adolescents and adults. Key issues addressed include whether to change the dosage of ceftriaxone and azithromycin used in the recommended dual treatment regimen, whether to continue to list dual treatment with cefixime and azithromycin as an alternative treatment regimen, and management of gonococcal infections in persons with severe cephalosporin allergy or suspected treatment failure.

### The interpretation of repeat positive results for gonorrhea and Chlamydia in children [^1145VL7F]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia in a prepubertal child beyond the neonatal period is confirmatory of mucosal contact with infective bodily secretions and therefore highly concerning for sexual abuse. When such a diagnosis is made, a report to protective authorities is warranted so that safety and potential criminal activity may be evaluated concurrent with the medical management. Occasionally, despite perceived adequate medical management and protective safety plans, a child may present with a repeat positive result for sexually transmitted infections. In this scenario, it is important for medical providers to carefully consider and be aware of the possible reasons for the repeat positive result: (1) treatment failure, (2) a new infection from repeated abuse, or (3) a false-positive result due to the limitations of nonculture testing.

Case

Prepubertal sisters were diagnosed with gonorrhea and Chlamydia and treated with antibiotics, and the individual identified as having sexually abused them was removed from the home.

Summary and Conclusion

Over a 4-month period, both children continued to have positive testing for chlamydia via the nucleic acid amplification test and/or culture. Concurrent with using alternate antibiotic treatment options, protective authorities were alerted to the fact that this was likely a reinfection. The investigative team later determined that a second adult, who tested positive for gonorrhea and chlamydia, was also sexually abusing both girls. Disclosures of abuse regarding both adult individuals were deemed credible by authorities and supported with collateral information.

Expedited Partner Therapy

Expedited partner therapy (EPT) is a harm-reduction strategy and the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of persons with diagnosed chlamydia or gonorrhea, who are unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, by providing medications or prescriptions to the patient as allowable by law. Patients then provide partners with these therapies without the health care provider having examined the partner. Unless prohibited by law or other regulations, medical providers should routinely offer EPT to patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure that all of a patient's sex partners from the previous 60 days will seek timely treatment. If the patient has not had sex during the 60 days before diagnosis, providers should offer EPT for the patient's most recent sex partner. Because EPT must be an oral regimen and current gonorrhea treatment involves an injection, EPT for gonorrhea should be offered to partners unlikely to access timely evaluation after linkage is explored. EPT is legal in the majority of states but varies by chlamydial or gonococcal infection. Providers should visitto obtain updated information for their state. Providing patients with packaged oral medication is the preferred approach because the efficacy of EPT using prescriptions has not been evaluated, obstacles to EPT can exist at the pharmacy level, and many persons (especially adolescents) do not fill the prescriptions provided to them by a sex partner. Medication or prescriptions provided for EPT should be accompanied by educational materials for the partner, including treatment instructions, warnings about taking medications (e.g. if the partner is pregnant or has an allergy to the medication), general health counseling, and a statement advising that partners seek medical evaluation as soon as possible for HIV infection and any symptoms of STIs, particularly PID.

Regarding preventative measures for gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to counsel MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months that doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

### Update on the management of gonorrhea in adults in the United States [^117UoagT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea, the second most commonly reported notifiable disease, is an important cause of cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The selection of appropriate therapy for gonorrhea (i.e., safe, highly effective, single dose, and affordable) is complicated by the ability of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobial therapies. This article reviews the key questions and data that informed the 2006 gonorrhea treatment recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Key areas addressed include the criteria used to select effective treatment for gonorrhea, the level of antimicrobial resistance at which changing treatment regimens is recommended, the epidemiology of resistance, and the use of quinolones, cephalosporins, and other classes of antimicrobials for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117RhsXY]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician implementation — screening intervals and treatment notes that in the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach is to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result, and that chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics; because treatment varies by patient and antibiotic resistance for gonorrhea is increasing, clinicians are encouraged to consult the most up-to-date guidance on treatment from the CDC.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^116ePU91]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) patients — expedited partner therapy (EPT) and partner services guidance states that heterosexually-active adults and adolescents evaluated for or prescribed PrEP in whom gonorrhea or chlamydia infection is detected should be offered EPT, especially when partners are unlikely to access timely evaluation and treatment. EPT is legal in most states but varies by infection; providers should visit http://www.cdc.gov/std/ept for updated state information. For men who have sex with men, in light of limited data and the potential for other bacterial sexually transmitted infections in partners, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended. Patients with syphilis or HIV diagnosed should be referred for partner services.

### Evaluation of the performance of a point-of-care test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^116cuUfY]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the last several years, there have been sustained increases in rates of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/NG) in the United States as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since 2013, the rate of chlamydia infection has increased by 25%, while the rate of gonococcal infection has increased by 74% despite the availability of highly sensitive and specific laboratory-based molecular diagnostic tools for detection of these sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This increase is concerning because these STIs can increase HIV transmissionand have the potential to increase rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and tubal factor infertilityamong untreated women. These preventable sequelae of untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea infections are estimated to cost the US health care system billions of dollars per year.

These increases in rates, despite national recommendations, for at least annual screening of women younger than 25 years, men who have sex with men, and people taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis, coincide with reductions in funding for STI control programs and specialized STI clinical services. As a result of the reduced capacity of STI clinics to provide services that include screening, primary care professionals are expected to cover the gap in services. However, according to the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, at least one-half of women in the eligible age range who have an encounter with the health care system are not screened per CDC guidelines.

Further exacerbating our inability to control these STIs is the current reliance on either patients returning to receive treatment after laboratory test results are available or patients receiving treatment based on epidemiologic prediction of the best treatment based on clinical signs and patient-reported symptoms. In the first case, there are delays of usually 7 to 10 days between the initial office visit and treatment based on laboratory test results, which introduces the potential during that interval for infections to be transmitted to sexual partners and provides an opportunity for the development of PID. To avoid these outcomes, many practices, including STI clinics and emergency departments, provide epidemiologic treatment, or syndromic management, for chlamydia and gonorrhea. This practice can lead to undertreatment and overtreatment of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Treating for chlamydia or gonorrhea when the organisms may not be present should be discouraged for good antibiotic stewardship.

### Post-treatment sexual and prevention behaviours of adolescents with sexually transmitted infections [^115z6kLR]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate sexual behaviour (including abstinence), sex partner change, and condom use during the 3 month period following treatment for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, or non-gonococcal urethritis.

Methods

251 14–21 year old participants (83% female; 83% African-American) diagnosed with gonorrhoea, chlamydia, trichomonas, or non-gonococcal urethritis or sexual contacts of infected partners. Participants were clients of a public sexually transmitted diseases clinic or primary care adolescent clinics. Data were collected by structured interview at treatment, 1 month post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment. At each visit, participants were asked about coital frequency and condom use for each recent partner. At 1 month, participants were asked when coitus occurred following treatment. At each follow up visit, sex partners were compared to partners named at treatment and classified as "same partner(s)", "new partner(s)", or both "same and new partner(s)".

Results

Post-treatment abstinence was reported by 26% and 19% for the 1 month and 3 month visits, respectively. Abstinence was associated with greater likelihood of infection at enrolment although abstainers reported fewer lifetime STI and fewer lifetime sex partners. A substantial proportion of participants reported additional sexual contact with a previous partner. The average proportion of condom protected coital events increased from about 45% at enrolment to 64% at 1 month and 58% at 3 months (p < 0.05). Higher levels were sustained for the 3 months following treatment.

Conclusions

Many adolescents adopt, at least temporarily, risk reduction behaviours such as abstinence or increased condom use. Sexual re-exposure to potentially untreated previous partners may increase risk of subsequent reinfection.

### Update on the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases [^112eQZ43]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published updated guidelines that provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Patient education is the first important step in reducing the number of persons who engage in risky sexual behaviors. Information on STD prevention should be individualized on the basis of the patient's stage of development and understanding of sexual issues. Other preventive strategies include administering the hepatitis B vaccine series to unimmunized patients who present for STD evaluation and administering hepatitis A vaccine to illegal drug users and men who have sex with men. The CDC recommends against using any form of nonoxynol 9 for STD prevention. New treatment strategies include avoiding the use of quinolone therapy in patients who contract gonorrhea in California or Hawaii. Testing for cure is not necessary if chlamydial infection is treated with a first-line antibiotic (azithromycin or doxycycline). However, all women should be retested three to four months after treatment for chlamydial infection, because of the high incidence of reinfection. Testing for herpes simplex virus serotype is advised in patients with genital infection, because recurrent infection is less likely with the type 1 serotype than with the type 2 serotype. The CDC guidelines also include new information on the treatment of diseases characterized by vaginal discharge.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^114eF2uW]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — sexual history and risk indicators — Clinicians should ask all sexually-active patients about any diagnoses of bacterial STIs (chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea) during the past 6 months because they provide evidence of sexual activity that could result in HIV exposure; for heterosexual women and men, risk of HIV exposure during condomless sex may also be indicated by recent pregnancy of a female patient or a female sexual partner of a male patient, and a scored risk index predicting incident HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) is also available.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117PGF9D]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF chlamydia and gonorrhea screening — implementation states that although prevalences differ, risk factors overlap and the USPSTF recommends screening for both simultaneously; the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in persons living with HIV or taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis, and the CDC provides recommendations for these groups and describes ways to increase adherence to treatment and interventions to decrease the likelihood of reinfection.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115aJ53G]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Prevention of sexually transmitted infections — doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) should be integrated with tailored prevention and shared decision-making: Individuals with recurrent STIs and ongoing sexual activities at high likelihood of acquisition should receive tailored HIV and STI prevention messages; clinicians should discuss the potential benefits and harms of doxyPEP, and doxyPEP should be discussed with and offered to cisgender gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with cisgender men; transgender women; and people with HIV meeting stated risk criteria; the dose of doxycycline is 200 mg as a single dose (maximum 200 mg in 24 hours) ideally as soon as possible after sex but no later than 72 hours afterward; data are inadequate to support efficacy in cisgender women, cisgender heterosexual men, transgender men, and gender-diverse persons assigned female at birth, so shared decision-making should be used; persons who actively use doxyPEP should be screened for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea at 3- to 6-month intervals depending on sexual practices.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^116eHook]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of Sex Partners

Recent sex partners (i.e. persons having sexual contact with the infected patient < 60 days preceding onset of symptoms or gonorrhea diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment. If the patient's last potential sexual exposure was > 60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated.

If health department partner-management strategies (e.g. disease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable for persons with gonorrhea and partners' access to prompt clinical evaluation and treatment is limited, EPT can be delivered to the partner by the patient or a collaborating pharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). Treatment of the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose is recommended, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection has been excluded. If a chlamydia test result has not been documented, the partner may be treated with a single dose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. If adherence with multiday dosing is a considerable concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered but has lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections). Provision of medication by EPT should be accompanied by written materials for educating partners about gonorrhea, their exposure to gonorrhea, and the importance of therapy. These materials should also educate partners about seeking clinical evaluation for adverse reactions or complications and general follow-up when able. Educational materials for female partners should include information about the importance of seeking medical evaluation for PID, especially if symptomatic; undertreatment of PID among female partners and missed opportunities for diagnosing other STIs among women are of concern. MSM with gonorrhea have a high risk for coexisting infections (especially undiagnosed HIV) among their partners, and they might have partners without HIV who could benefit from PrEP. Data are also limited regarding the effectiveness of EPT in reducing persistent or recurrent gonorrhea among MSM; thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of symptoms, if present.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^111LNrxx]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation — sexually transmitted infection screening and timing — states: We recommend clinicians (1) test and treat patients empirically for gonorrhea and chlamydia when (a) they are at increased risk of infection, (b) present with a known diagnosis of gonorrhea or chlamydia but have not received treatment, or (3) provide routine annual screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia for patients under 25 years and others at increased risk based on the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations; clinicians should not delay abortion while awaiting diagnosis or treatment (GRADE 1C). We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis before abortion (GRADE 1C).

### Assessment of the potential of vaccination to combat antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea: a modeling analysis to determine preferred product characteristics [^1151u2X9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Model structure flow diagram. The population is divided into compartments representing different states, with changes of state occurring due to various processes. Individuals enter the sexually active population (arrow 1) at age 15 years. They are initially uninfected (U), and belong to a sexual activity group g (low or high). Individuals become infected with either the antibiotic-sensitive (ABS) strain (2) or antibiotic-resistant (ABR) strain (3). Infected individuals pass through an incubating state (I), before either developing symptoms (4) and entering the symptomatic infection state (S), or remaining asymptomatic (5) and entering the asymptomatic infection state (A). Symptomatic individuals seek treatment (6) and enter the treatment state (T). Asymptomatic infections can be identified through screening and treatment (7), with individuals entering the treatment state (T), or there can be natural recovery (8), returning individuals to the uninfected state (U). All treated infections are cured (9), with the exception of a proportion of ABR infections for which treatment fails, resulting in persistent infection (10). Depending on the vaccination strategy, individuals are vaccinated before entry into the sexually active population (in which case all vaccinees are uninfected), upon gonorrhea diagnosis (with vaccination given to those who are treated), or upon clinic attendance for gonorrhea screening (with all individuals attending clinics being eligible). Upon vaccination, individuals enter corresponding compartments indicated with a circumflex (^). Vaccine protection eventually wanes (11), with individuals moving into the corresponding compartments (without a circumflex). Individuals leave the sexually active population at age 65 years, regardless of infection or vaccination status (12).

### High incidence of new sexually transmitted infections in the year following a sexually transmitted infection: a case for rescreening [^115Vb7a6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Studies show 11% to 15% of women treated for Chlamydia trachomatis are reinfected 3 to 4 months after treatment, suggesting the need for rescreening. There is little information on infections among men, infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Trichomonas vaginalis, or long-term follow-up.

Objective

To determine the incidence of new sexually transmitted infections during the year after a visit to a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and associated risk factors.

Design

Secondary analysis of data from a randomized, controlled trial (RESPECT-2).

Setting

3 urban STD clinics.

Patients

Sexually active patients enrolled in an HIV prevention counseling trial.

Measurements

Patient characteristics at the initial visit; behaviors during follow-up; and new infections with C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or T. vaginalis (women only) detected during 4 scheduled return visits and any other interim visits.

Results

2419 persons had 8129 three-month follow-up intervals. Among 1236 women, 25.8% had 1 or more new infections (11.9% acquired C. trachomatis, 6.3% acquired N. gonorrhoeae, and 12.8% acquired T. vaginalis); among 1183 men, 14.7% had 1 or more new infections (9.4% acquired C. trachomatis, and 7.1% acquired N. gonorrhoeae). Black persons and those with sexually transmitted infections at baseline were at highest risk for recurrent infection (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5 and 2.4, respectively). For persons infected at baseline, the risk for infection was high at 3 and 6 months (16.3 per 100 three-month intervals) and remained high at 9 and 12 months (12.0 per 100 three-month intervals). Most (67.2%) infections were diagnosed during study-related visits, and 66.2% of these patients reported no symptoms.

Limitations

Because patients were recruited from STD clinics, results may not be generalizable.

Conclusions

Men and women who receive diagnoses of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or T. vaginalis infections should return in 3 months for rescreening because they are at high risk for new asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections. Although single-dose therapy may adequately treat the infection, it often does not adequately treat the patient.

### Rebound of gonorrhea after lifting of COVID-19 preventive measures, england [^114MoNnj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the increase in gonorrhea diagnoses was widespread in England after removal of all COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. It remains to be seen whether increases in gonorrhea diagnoses will be short-lived because of restrictions removal, whether pre–COVID-19 pandemic diagnoses levels will resume, or whether another trend will be observed. Continued close surveillance, a better understanding of the factors leading to the increase in gonorrhea diagnoses, and public health messaging (particularly to young persons) are needed to focus efforts on gonorrhea transmission control and prevention.

### Modeling gonorrhea vaccination to find optimal targeting strategies that balance impact with cost-effectiveness [^112J9XD2]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Model structure

We developed a new model of gonorrhea transmission and vaccination, building on previous work, which represents England's sexually active MSM population, stratified by sexual behavior, current infection status, history of gonorrhea diagnosis, and vaccination status/vaccine sentiment. The model accounts for rates of SHC attendance due to partner notification.

Within the model, individuals who are uninfected (U) can become infected through sexual contact with a contagious individual. Newly-infected individuals pass through an incubating state (I), before developing symptoms (S), or remaining asymptomatic (A). Infected individuals who attend an SHC (either due to care-seeking for symptoms or asymptomatic screening) are treated and enter a treatment state (T). Treated individuals are cured, returning to the U state; infection does not confer natural immunity, and previously-infected individuals are as susceptible as those never infected.

Heterogeneity in sexual behavior is represented by low (L) and high (H) sexual activity groups; high-activity MSM have more partners and attend SHCs for screening more frequently.

The population is stratified by vaccination status/sentiment. Individuals who are fully-vaccinated (V i, V e) or revaccinated (R i, R e) have lower rates of acquisition than partially-vaccinated individuals (P), who have lower rates of acquisition than those who are unvaccinated (X) and those whose vaccine protection has waned (W). We also consider, in supplementary analysis, a scenario in which a proportion of individuals are unwilling to be vaccinated (H).

In order to consider vaccination strategies in which vaccination is offered to those with a clinical history of gonorrhea, the model distinguishes between individuals diagnosed in the last D years (represented by d = 1) from those with no previous diagnosis or who were last diagnosed more than D years ago (represented by d = 0). All treated individuals move into the U state in the "Diagnosed in the last D years" (d = 1) stratum. Over time, individuals in the "Diagnosed in the last D years" stratum move into the corresponding infection state in the "Not diagnosed in the last D years" (d = 0) stratum.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116m2b3q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

Update of previous U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening for chlamydia (2007) and gonorrhea (2005).

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections in asymptomatic patients from studies published since its last reviews. The USPSTF also considered evidence from its previous recommendations and reviews.

Population

This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant women.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. (I statement).

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^112boCTm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Tests of Cure

Tests of cure are undertaken to confirm pathogen eradication, preventing transmission and reinfection. Because NAATs detect both viable and nonviable DNA/RNA, explicit time frames for tests of cure have been outlined, ranging from 7–14 days after therapy for pharyngeal gonorrhea to ≈28 days for chlamydia in pregnant persons. Macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium infections are cleared relatively quickly after azithromycin therapy; when tests of cure are performed, the timeframe is similar to that for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Australian guidelines recommend a test of cure 14–21 days after treatment.

Benefits of Tests of Cure

The primary benefit of tests of cure is verifying that the organism has been successfully eradicated, which is key for pathogens that cause serious sequelae, particularly during asymptomatic infection. Because M. genitalium sometimes recrudesces after symptoms resolve, a test of cure would identify the need for additional therapy earlier, in turn reducing the risk of infecting sex partners, potentially with resistant strains not detected initially or selected during treatment. Finally, patients might appreciate confirmation that they are cured and not contagious.

Harms of Tests of Cure

A positive test of cure indicates either treatment failure or reinfection. Cases of reinfection are usually retreated with the same antibiotic, whereas cases of treatment failure are typically treated with an alternative antibiotic. When the risk for long-term sequelae is high, the benefit of assuring eradication outweighs the harm of additional antibiotic pressure. When the risk for sequelae is low or uncertain, the potential harm of additional antibiotics might outweigh the benefit of confirming eradication. Despite some evidence that M. genitalium can result in adverse sequelae in women, numerous outstanding questions about natural history remain. These questions include uncertainty over the frequency of upper reproductive tract sequelae, frequency of spontaneous clearance, clinical significance of asymptomatic infections, and transmission risk with low organism load that persists after treatment. Given these outstanding questions, the benefit of tests of cure is currently unknown. The 2021 CDC treatment guidelines only recommend tests of cure when resistance testing is not available and moxifloxacin cannot be used.

Which Antimicrobial Therapies Should Be Used against M. genitalium?

Azithromycin (1 g, 1 dose) was recommended over doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d for 7 days) for M. genitalium in the 2015 treatment guidelines. Moxifloxacin was recommended for azithromycin treatment failures. The 2021 guidelines removed single-dose azithromycin from recommended therapies, primarily because of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

Treatment

Compliance with follow-up visits is poor among survivors of sexual assault. Consequently, the following routine presumptive treatments after a sexual assault are recommended:

An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas for women and chlamydia and gonorrhea for men.
Emergency contraception should be considered when the assault could result in pregnancy (see Emergency Contraception).
Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination (without HBIG) if the hepatitis status of the assailant is unknown and the survivor has not been previously vaccinated. If the assailant is known to be HBsAg positive, unvaccinated survivors should receive both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. The vaccine and HBIG, if indicated, should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1–2 and 4–6 months after the first dose. Survivors who were previously vaccinated but did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a single vaccine booster dose (see Hepatitis B Virus Infection).
HPV vaccination for female and male survivors aged 9–26 years who have not been vaccinated or are incompletely vaccinated. The vaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses should be administered at 1–2 months and 6 months after the first dose. A 2-dose schedule (0 and 6–12 months) is recommended for persons initiating vaccination before age 15 years.
Recommendations for HIV PEP are made on a case-by-case basis according to risk (see Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection; Recommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk Assessment of Adolescents and Adults < 72 Hours After Sexual Assault). Recommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Female Sexual Assault Survivors Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose plus Doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days plus Metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days * For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered. Recommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Male Sexual Assault Survivors Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose plus Doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days * For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Clinicians should counsel persons regarding the possible benefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; gastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination. The efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after sexual assault has not been evaluated. For those requiring alternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this report relevant to the specific organisms.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^11136L1x]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — scope and accuracy findings state that the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review that evaluated the benefits and harms of screening in all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons; key differences from the prior review were combining all populations into a single analytic framework, evaluating the accuracy of risk stratification and screening strategies for identifying persons at increased risk, and focusing diagnostic accuracy on anatomical site-specific testing; because treatments were previously determined effective and well established, the review did not include a review of treatments. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections; convincing evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active women at increased risk; and inadequate evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active men at increased risk. In asymptomatic individuals, 3 studies with 76 136 participants using a risk score reported an area under the curve of 0.64 to 0.73, and one study showed that age (younger than 22 years) alone had accuracy similar to that for the use of more extensive risk criteria.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^117Bbwfc]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — Doxycycline (Doxy-PEP) taken after condomless anal or oral sex is recommended for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women and nonbinary people at risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis within the past 12 months (evidence rating: AIa), and doxyPEP is also recommended, using a shared decision-making approach, for MSM and transgender women who have not had a bacterial STI during the previous year but have a high likelihood of condomless exposure to STIs (evidence rating: AIII). Initiating oral doxyPEP is recommended as quickly as possible (but certainly within 72 hours) after condomless sexual exposure for cisgender MSM and transgender women (evidence rating: AIa). This intervention reduces the incidence of chlamydia by 70% to 88% and early syphilis by 73% to 87%, while effects on gonorrhea are less consistent. Dosing may be taken as frequently as daily (evidence rating: BIa). One study of doxyPEP for cisgender women in Kenya did not show a protective effect, but pharmacologic modeling suggests that doxyPEP should be effective for vaginal exposures and should be considered on a case-by-case basis among individuals with likelihood of STI acquisition via vaginal exposure (evidence rating: BIII). DoxyPEP prescriptions are recommended in quantities of 30 doses at a time (evidence rating: CIII), and screening of sites/orifices with sexual contact as well as blood testing for syphilis is recommended quarterly (evidence rating: AIa).

### Routine treatment versus selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with Chlamydia: a before-and-after study [^114BqrQC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Apart from the benefits, we did not see any significant harm after changing this treatment approach to manage chlamydia contacts. There was no significant difference in the proportion of contacts who were lost to follow-up for treatment between the 2 periods (ie, contacts who did not receive treatment before the results but subsequently tested positive for chlamydia and did not return for treatment). However, the role of selective treatment in contacts becomes more complex in cases of coinfection with other STIs, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and M genitalium. While this analysis excluded contacts with multiple STIs, addressing selective treatment in the presence of coinfection and associated complications is critical in clinical practice. Untreated STIs can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Managing coinfections often requires broader diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ensure comprehensive pathogen coverage. Thus, clinical judgment is crucial in these situations to balance effective treatment with minimizing resistance and complications.

There are several limitations in this study. First, this was a before-and-after study using retrospective routinely collected clinical data at a single sexual health clinic. Due to the nature of routinely collected clinical data, some information, especially regarding the reasons for initiating treatment before test results in the selective period, had not been consistently documented. Second, we included the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in our analysis. Victoria had several lockdown restrictions in 2020; however, our service was still open during lockdowns. It is possible that clients who attended MSHC during the COVID-19 pandemic may be different, although we did not see any significant difference in chlamydia positivity between the 2 periods. Some clients in 2020 might request medication to avoid additional travel during the pandemic. Overall, we saw a decrease in the total number of contacts in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019, and this may be due to the reduction in casual sexual partners. However, our previous study shows that there was an increase in STI contacts straight after the COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting individuals resumed sexual activity when the lockdown was ceased. Finally, our study did not assess the potential inconveniences for patients associated with the selective treatment approach, particularly the added costs and logistical burdens of follow-up for contacts receiving positive chlamydia test results.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemiology and harms — United States: Approximately 20 million new cases of bacterial or viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs) occur each year in the US, and about one-half of these cases occur in persons aged 15 to 24 years. Rates of chlamydial, gonococcal, and syphilis infection continue to increase in all regions. Sexually transmitted infections are frequently asymptomatic, which may delay diagnosis and treatment and lead persons to unknowingly transmit STIs to others. Serious consequences of STIs include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, cancer, and AIDS.

Gonorrhea and Chlamydia

The following testing is recommended for MSM:

A test for urethral infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had insertive intercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT is preferred).
A test for rectal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal intercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT is preferred).
A test for pharyngeal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae among men who have had receptive oral intercourse during the preceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred).
Testing for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not recommended.

Basing screening practices solely on history might be suboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable taking a detailed sexual history, men might also feel uncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with their provider, and rectal and pharyngeal infections can be identified even in the absence of reported risk behaviors. Furthermore, the role of saliva, kissing, and rimming (i.e. oral-rectal contact) in the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis has not been well studied.

Rectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or self-collected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who report exposure at these sites. Testing can be offered to MSM who do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed explanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. All MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of exposure as well as for syphilis.

More frequent STI screening (i.e. for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) at 3- to 6-month intervals is indicated for MSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV infection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners. In addition, providers can consider the benefits of offering more frequent HIV screening (e.g. every 3–6 months) to MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection.

Hepatitis B Virus

All MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core antibody, and HBV surface antibody testing to detect HBV infection. Vaccination against both HAV and HBV is recommended for all MSM for whom previous infection or vaccination cannot be documented. Serologic testing can be considered before vaccinating if the patient's vaccination history is unknown; however, vaccination should not be delayed. Vaccinating persons who have had previous infection or vaccination does not increase the risk for vaccine-related adverse events (see Hepatitis A Virus; Hepatitis B Virus).

What Public Health Agencies and Partners Can Do

Several steps taken now might delay the emergence of cephalosporin-resistant strains, mitigate the public health consequences of expanded resistance, and prevent a return to the era of untreatable gonorrhea. Local and state STD control programs are encouraged to use local surveillance data to prioritize high-prevalence areas and populations for enhanced primary prevention, screening, or partner services. Clinicians can help prevent sequelae and spread of gonorrhea by eliciting sexual histories from their patients, screening sexually active MSM and high-risk sexually active women for gonorrhea at least annually at exposed anatomic sites, and treating appropriately. Clinicians also can counsel sexually active adults, particularly those living in high prevalence areas, to engage in mutually monogamous partnerships with uninfected partners and to consistently and correctly use latex condoms, which can reduce transmission.

Ensuring effective treatment is critical. Based on surveillance trends, CDC recently updated its treatment recommendations: gonorrhea at any anatomic site should be treated with a single 250 mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus either 1 g of azithromycin as a single oral dose or 100 mg of doxycycline orally twice daily for 7 days. If this recommended regimen cannot be used, two alternative treatment options exist for urogenital or rectal gonorrhea: 1) if ceftriaxone is not available, clinicians can consider cefixime 400 mg as a single oral dose and either azithromycin 1 g as a single oral dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, or 2) if the patient is cephalosporin-allergic, clinicians can consider azithromycin 2 g as a single oral dose. If either of these two alternative regimens is prescribed, the patient should return in 1 week for a test of cure. CDC will continue to update treatment recommendations based on surveillance data and clinical research.

Suspected Cephalosporin Treatment Failure

Cephalosporin treatment failure is the persistence of N. gonorrhoeae infection despite recommended cephalosporin treatment; such failure is indicative of infection with cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea among persons whose partners were treated and whose risk for reinfection is low. Suspected treatment failure has been reported among persons receiving oral and injectable cephalosporins. Treatment failure should be considered for persons whose symptoms do not resolve within 3–5 days after recommended treatment and report no sexual contact during the posttreatment follow-up period and persons with a positive test of cure (i.e. positive culture > 72 hours or positive NAAT > 7 days after receiving recommended treatment) when no sexual contact is reported during the posttreatment follow-up period. Treatment failure should also be considered for persons who have a positive culture on test of cure, if obtained, if evidence exists of decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, regardless of whether sexual contact is reported during the posttreatment follow-up period.

The majority of suspected treatment failures in the United States are likely to be reinfections rather than actual treatment failures. However, in cases in which reinfection is unlikely and treatment failure is suspected, before retreatment, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture (preferably with simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing if N. gonorrhoeae is isolated. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed by using Etest or agar dilution. All isolates of suspected treatment failures should be sent to CDC for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution; local laboratories should store isolates for possible further testing if needed. Testing or storage of specimens or isolates should be facilitated by the state or local health department according to local public health protocol. Instructions for shipping isolates to CDC are available at.

For persons with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, the treating clinician should consult an infectious disease specialist, the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Center clinical consultation line, the local or state health department STI program, or CDC (telephone: 800–232–4636) for advice about obtaining cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and treatment. Suspected treatment failure should be reported to CDC through the local or state health department < 24 hours after diagnosis.

### Routine treatment versus selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with Chlamydia: a before-and-after study [^113Hysc3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are increasing in many regions around the world, highlighting their continued significance as a global public health challenge. Each year, there are 374 million new cases of STIs, with an estimated 128.5 million cases of Chlamydia trachomatis, making it the most common bacterial STI globally. International guidelines on managing chlamydia contacts vary. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment for sexual partners within 60 days of symptom onset or chlamydia diagnosis, and even beyond 60 days for the most recent partner. British guidelines recommend empirical treatment for male cases with urethral symptoms and for contacts within 4 weeks; for all other cases, contacts within the last 6 months should be treated. Although many international guidelines emphasize the importance of testing and confirmatory diagnostics for chlamydia contacts, they continue to recommend presumptive treatment.

Concerns over antimicrobial resistance in STIs have been increasing. Although antibiotic resistance in chlamydia is relatively uncommon, the overprescription and misuse of antibiotics such as doxycycline and azithromycin may foster resistance in other pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium, as well as non-STI bacteria. Recent studies have shown that N gonorrhoeae has developed significant resistance to azithromycin, leading to treatment challenges. Similarly, M genitalium demonstrates increasing resistance to azithromycin, complicating treatment options. The widespread use of these antibiotics in non-STI cases, such as respiratory infections, may further contribute to resistance in non-STI bacteria. Considering that antimicrobial resistance is one of the top global public health threats, driven largely by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, the selective treatment approach aimed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Thus, there is a need to revisit the management of contacts to optimize the use of antibiotics and support antimicrobial stewardship.

Gonorrhea

All pregnant women aged < 25 years as well as women aged ≥ 25 years at increased risk for gonorrhea (e.g. those with other STIs during pregnancy or those with a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI or is exchanging sex for money or drugs) should be screened for Neisseria gonorrhoeae at the first prenatal visit. Pregnant women who remain at high risk for gonococcal infection also should be retested during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and gonococcal infection in the neonate. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and might choose to consult local public health authorities for guidance on identifying groups that are more vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis of local disease prevalence. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated among specific geographic locations and communities. Pregnant women identified as having gonorrhea should be treated immediately. All persons diagnosed with gonorrhea should be rescreened 3 months after treatment.

Hepatitis C Virus

The rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has increased among pregnant women in recent years. HCV screening should be performed for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the HCV infection (HCV positivity) rate is < 0.1%. The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injecting drug use. Additional risk factors include having had a blood transfusion or organ transplantation before July 1992, having received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987, having received an unregulated tattoo, having been on long-term hemodialysis, having other percutaneous exposures, or having HIV infection. All women with HCV infection should receive counseling, supportive care, and linkage to care. No vaccine is available for preventing HCV transmission.

Cervical Cancer

Pregnant women should undergo cervical cancer screening and at the same frequency as nonpregnant women; however, management differs slightly during pregnancy. Colposcopy is recommended for the same indications during pregnancy as for nonpregnant women. However, biopsies may be deferred, and endocervical sampling should not be performed. Treatment should not be performed during pregnancy unless cancer is detected.

STI Testing, PEP, and Presumptive Treatment

Any sexual exposure that presents a risk for HIV infection also might place a person at risk for acquiring other STIs. CDC STI Treatment Guidelines, 2021, recommend presumptive STI treatment after sexual assault because clinical follow-up often is challenging for survivors. Presumptive STI treatment and PEP must be tailored to the clinical situation and might include an empiric antimicrobial regimen effective against chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas for women and chlamydia and gonorrhea for men; postexposure hepatitis B vaccination with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (as indicated by the hepatitis B immune status of the exposed person and the hepatitis B infection status of the source); and human papillomavirus or mpox vaccination (see relevant guidelines for specific indications). Certain health care professionals, in shared decision-making with a sexual assault survivor, might await STI test results rather than provide presumptive STI treatment. If the initial STI tests are negative and presumptive STI treatment was not provided, STI testing can be repeated 1–2 weeks after the exposure. For GBMSM, a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline taken within 72 hours of condomless sex (doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis, or "doxy-PEP") might be considered as part of a comprehensive approach to STI care. Health care professionals who provide nPEP should remain up to date with relevant guidelines for STI diagnosis and treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117CthMA]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in people with HIV — In a pilot study, 30 MSM with HIV with previous syphilis were randomly assigned to doxycycline 100 mg daily for 48 weeks versus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention; doxycycline was associated with a lower incidence of syphilis, but this did not reach statistical significance due to small sample size. Post-exposure prophylaxis (doxycycline 200 mg after unprotected anal sex) has been studied among MSM and transgender women, with a reduction in incident syphilis by 73%. Several recent randomized open-label clinical trials have found that doxycycline 200 mg after condomless sex among MSM or transgender women with HIV or on HIV PrEP significantly reduced chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis acquisition; however, a randomized trial of cisgender women on HIV PrEP administered doxycycline 200 mg within 72 hours after sex did not reduce chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis acquisition. There is ongoing evaluation regarding the potential impact of STI postexposure prophylaxis on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome, and other studies are underway or in development regarding doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial STIs.

Other Management Considerations

To minimize disease transmission to sex partners, persons treated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen and resolution of symptoms if present. To minimize risk for reinfection, patients also should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their sex partners have been treated. Persons who receive a diagnosis of chlamydia should be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. MSM who are HIV negative with a rectal chlamydia diagnosis should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

Test of cure to detect therapeutic failure (i.e. repeat testing 4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for nonpregnant persons treated with the recommended or alternative regimens, unless therapeutic adherence is in question, symptoms persist, or reinfection is suspected. Moreover, using chlamydial NAATs at < 4 weeks after completion of therapy is not recommended because the continued presence of nonviable organisms can lead to false-positive results.

A high prevalence of C. trachomatis infection has been observed among women and men who were treated for chlamydial infection during the preceding months (,–). The majority of posttreatment infections do not result from treatment failure but rather from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved education and treatment of sex partners. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID and other complications among women. Men and women who have been treated for chlamydia should be retested approximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment.

### Effectiveness of a behavioural intervention delivered by text messages (safetxt) on sexually transmitted reinfections in people aged 16–24 years: randomised controlled trial [^112s6dRb]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the incidence of chlamydia or gonorrhoea reinfection at one year. Secondary outcomes at four weeks were informing the last sexual partner before the test to seek treatment, clinic attendance by partner for treatment, taking prescribed antibiotics and avoiding sex for seven days after treatment, and condom use at last sexual encounter. Intermediate outcomes at four weeks were knowledge related to STIs (the consequences of behaviour and how to avoid infection), attitude towards notification of partners, and self-efficacy about correct condom use, negotiating condom use, and telling a partner about an infection. Secondary outcomes at one year were STI diagnosis after joining the trial (self-report confirmed by postal test results and clinic records), condom use at last sexual encounter, STI self-testing before sex with most recent new partner (self-reported and confirmed by clinic record of a test), sex with someone new since joining the trial, condom use at first sexual encounter with someone new, participants' report that the last new partner was tested for STI before having sex with them, and number of sexual partners since joining the trial. Process outcomes at one year were reading and sharing of intervention content, number of text messages read, whether anyone else read the messages, and, if yes, how the participant felt about the messages being read, and reading someone else's messages in the trial (control group) and someone else in the trial reading the participant's messages (intervention group). Data on adverse events were collected on experience of partner violence and road traffic incidents when the participant was the driver in the past year (as road traffic incidents are a known harm of mobile phone use if used whilst driving).

Statistical analyses

Assuming an event rate for the cumulative incidence of chlamydia or gonorrhoea of 20%, the trial was designed to detect a reduction in chlamydia or gonorrhoea reinfection from 20% to 16% (relative risk 0.8). To detect this difference a trial with 5000 participants would have 90% power using an α level of 0.05. The sample size calculation allows for 2% of participants in the control arm viewing the intervention messages (as seen in the pilot study) and up to 20% losses to follow-up. The trial steering committee reviewed the (masked) event rate after 546 patients had completed 12 months' follow-up, and it recommended an increase in the sample size to 6250 because of a lower than expected event rate of 15.6%.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for sexually transmitted infections — efficacy, resistance, and use recommendations are detailed as follows: The final analysis confirmed preventative effects of doxyPEP against first episodes of chlamydia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.14; 95% CI, .09–.23; P < .0001), syphilis (aHR, 0.21; 95% CI, .11–.41; P < .001), and gonorrhea (aHR, 0.67; 95% CI, .52–.87; p = 0.003). Consistent with local epidemiology, high-level tetracycline resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration > 8 mg/L) was more common in incident samples from the doxyPEP arm than the control arm (36% vs 13%). In a randomized, open-label trial among transgender women and men who have sex with men in Kenya, there was no difference between the doxyPEP arm and the standard-of-care arm in the incidence of chlamydia or gonorrhea, and in a subset of the doxyPEP arm, doxycycline was present in only 29% of hair samples, while high-level tetracycline resistance was seen in 100% of gonorrhea samples identified at baseline and at study end. DoxyPEP is recommended for cisgender gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with cisgender men and for transgender women who have a history of at least 1 diagnosis of syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea within the last 12 months or who anticipate sexual activities associated with increased likelihood of STI acquisition; no recommendations can be made at this time for cisgender women, cisgender heterosexual men, transgender men, and other gender-diverse persons, and use in these populations should be based on shared decision-making. Those who receive doxyPEP should continue to receive routine screening for asymptomatic STIs and ongoing evaluation of the need for continuing doxyPEP, and the main concern for doxyPEP implementation is the risk of antimicrobial resistance; providing doxyPEP to all PrEP users or people with HIV prevented more STIs but was less efficient and exposed more people to doxycycline (higher number needed to treat to prevent 1 STI).

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111JhmdE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

A test-of-cure is unnecessary for persons with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens; however, for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended, using culture or nucleic acid amplification tests 7–14 days after initial treatment, regardless of the treatment regimen. Because reinfection within 12 months ranges from 7% to 12% among persons previously treated for gonorrhea, persons who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest within 12 months after initial treatment.

Partner Services

Treatment of sex partners prevents reinfection and is essential to interrupting transmission of STDs. Partner services consist of various strategies with differing levels of time and effort to enable persons who are exposed to an STD to be identified, tested, and treated. These strategies include 1) guidance regarding notification and care of sex partners, 2) interactive counseling for partner notification, 3) EPT, and 4) health department disease intervention specialist (DIS) elicitation of sex partner information to identify those who might be infected and to identify patient follow-up needs (, –).

Guidance regarding notification and care of sex partners is described as providers giving how-to information to their patients about the need to notify their sex partner or partners of the exposure, the need for sex partners to seek care and treatment even if they do not have symptoms, and where a partner could go for STD care. This strategy typically does not require extensive staff training. Guidance might be verbal or written. When notifying patients of an STD diagnosis and need to return for treatment, providers can advise patients to bring their sex partner with them, at which time the provider should treat both persons concurrently.

In interactive counseling, the provider and patient both actively participate in an individualized plan to notify the patient's sex partner or partners. Interactive counseling typically is conducted by staff with specific training or skills in communication, interviewing, or counseling. The patient provides information about their sex partner or partners and develops a plan with the counselor to notify partners. Notification might involve the patient, the provider, or the health department. Efforts to notify partners can be documented and assessed.

EPT typically is recommended for sex partners of patients who have received a diagnosis of chlamydia or gonorrhea, or both, and who are unlikely to access timely care. This is a method that provides medications or prescriptions to the patient to take to a partner without the partner first being examined by a health care provider. EPT is legislated or regulated at the state level, and what each state allows can vary by STD, age group, and sexual orientation. Details about EPT are available. For these methods, treatment and infection status of the partner can be verified and documented along with any co-occurring conditions (e.g. HIV infection or pregnancy) and health care access.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing exposure and disease in persons with HIV infection — primary prevention should begin with a behavioral risk assessment and routine discussion of sexual behaviors, and health care providers should discuss client-centered risk reduction messages and provide specific actions that reduce sexually transmitted disease acquisition and HIV transmission. Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all sexually active persons with HIV infection, with more frequent screening (i.e., every 3–6 months) for those with multiple or anonymous partners; the occurrence of syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infection should prompt intensified risk assessment, counseling, and strong consideration of referral for behavioral intervention. Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea at anatomic sites of exposure in men and for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in women. Frequent serologic screening can identify persons recently infected, sometimes before infectious lesions, and treatment can prevent disease progression and transmission; historically, approximately one-third of sex partners of persons with primary syphilis will develop syphilis within 30 days of exposure.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113JtcbE]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gonorrhea screening effectiveness and target populations — The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in its current or previous reviews. Based on indirect evidence, early detection and treatment of gonorrhea in pregnant women at increased risk for infection may decrease morbidity from infection-related obstetric complications, whereas in women not at increased risk there is a low prevalence of infection and universal ocular prophylaxis in newborns is effective and well established; accordingly, the USPSTF concluded that the net benefit of screening for gonorrhea in pregnant women who are not at increased risk for infection is small. The USPSTF found little evidence on the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in men or low-risk women, noting prevalence in these groups is low and the majority of genital gonococcal infections in men are symptomatic, and it found no studies comparing the effectiveness of testing for concurrent STIs or using different screening approaches.

### Control of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the era of evolving antimicrobial resistance [^116JNVMT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all previous first-line antimicrobial therapies over the past 75 years. Today the cephalosporins, the last available antibiotic class that is sufficiently effective, are also threatened by evolving resistance. Screening for asymptomatic gonorrhea in women and men who have sex with men, treating with a dual antibiotic regimen, ensuring effective partner therapy, and remaining vigilant for treatment failures constitute critical activities for clinicians in responding to evolving antimicrobial resistance. This article reviews the epidemiology, history of antimicrobial resistance, current screening and treatment guidelines, and future treatment options for gonorrhea.

Persons being assessed due to a known or possible exposure to HIV should be tested for HIV. Routine laboratory testing recommended for persons starting nPEP includes serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and pregnancy (when indicated) testing, and testing and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, other STIs including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, and other medical treatment should be tailored to the clinical situation.

### Effect of expedited treatment of sex partners on recurrent or persistent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection [^1157dZhw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Many sex partners of persons with gonorrhea or chlamydial infections are not treated, which leads to frequent reinfections and further transmission.

Methods

We randomly assigned women and heterosexual men with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection to have their partners receive expedited treatment or standard referral. Patients in the expedited-treatment group were offered medication to give to their sex partners, or if they preferred, study staff members contacted partners and provided them with medication without a clinical examination. Patients assigned to standard partner referral were advised to refer their partners for treatment and were offered assistance notifying partners. The primary outcome was persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection in patients 3 to 19 weeks after treatment.

Results

Persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection occurred in 121 of 931 patients (13 percent) assigned to standard partner referral and 92 of 929 (10 percent) assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98). Expedited treatment was more effective than standard referral of partners in reducing persistent or recurrent infection among patients with gonorrhea (3 percent vs. 11 percent, P = 0.01) than in those with chlamydial infection (11 percent vs. 13 percent, P = 0.17) (P = 0.05 for the comparison of treatment effects) and remained independently associated with a reduced risk of persistent or recurrent infection after adjustment for other predictors of infection at follow-up (relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.97). Patients assigned to expedited treatment of sexual partners were significantly more likely than those assigned to standard referral of partners to report that all of their partners were treated and significantly less likely to report having sex with an untreated partner.

Conclusions

Expedited treatment of sex partners reduces the rates of persistent or recurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection.

### Sexual exposure and sexual behaviour in the interval between gonorrhoea treatment and test of cure: a cross-sectional cohort study [^115a9JUE]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We explored sexual contact in the interval between the treatment for gonorrhoea and attending for a test of cure (ToC) and identified factors associated with sexual contact in this period.

Methods

Multivariable analysis of demographic, behavioural and clinical data with self-reported sexual contact prior to attending for a gonorrhoea ToC evaluation among participants recruited into the 'Gentamicin for the Treatment of Gonorrhoea' trial in England, between October 2014 and November 2016. Associations with sexual contact were expressed as prevalence ratios (PR) and their corresponding 95% CI.

Results

The median time to ToC was 15 days (interquartile range 14–20 days). 197/540 (37%) participants reported sexual contact in the time between treatment and ToC. Of these, 173/197 (88%) participants reported inconsistent condom use, including with previous partners (133/197 (68%)). A history of gonorrhoea (adjusted PR (aPR) 1.32 (1.03 to 1.69)) or syphilis (aPR 1.19 (1.08 to 1.32)), being in regular (aPR 1.71 (1.41 to 2.09)) sexual relationships, high number of partners in the last 3 months (aPR 1.77 (1.25 to 2.51))-'more than 5 partners' vs '0 to 1 partner', and attending for a ToC more than 14 days after treatment (aPR 1.40 (1.08 to 1. 81)) were associated with reporting sexual contact before the ToC appointment. However, age (aPR (1.00 (0.99 to 1.01)) and presenting with specific symptoms at baseline (aPR 1.17 (0.95 to 1.44)) were not associated with sexual contact by the ToC attendance.

Conclusion

Sexual activity after receiving treatment for gonorrhoea and prior to a ToC evaluation was common. This was associated with previous infection history and specific behavioural characteristics. Knowledge of these factors can help guide safe sex counselling at the time of treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114s2YpM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence supporting EPT is based on three U.S. clinical trials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia or gonorrhea. All three trials reported that more partners were treated when patients were offered EPT. Two reported statistically significant decreases in the rate of reinfection, and one observed a lower risk for persistent or recurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant. A fourth trial in the United Kingdom did not demonstrate a difference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of partners treated between persons offered EPT and those advised to notify their sex partners. U.S. trials and a meta-analysis of EPT revealed that the magnitude of reduction in reinfection of index patients, compared with patient referral, differed according to the STI and the sex of the index patient (,–). However, across trials, reductions in chlamydia prevalence at follow-up were approximately 20%, and reductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50% at follow-up.

Existing data indicate that EPT also might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis; however, no partner management intervention has been reported to be more effective than any other in reducing trichomoniasis reinfection rates. No data support use of EPT in the routine management of patients with syphilis.

Data are limited regarding use of EPT for gonococcal or chlamydial infections among MSM, compared with heterosexuals. Published studies, including recent data regarding extragenital testing, indicated that male partners of MSM with diagnosed gonorrhea or chlamydia might have other bacterial STIs (gonorrhea or syphilis) or HIV. Studies have reported that 5% of MSM have a new diagnosis of HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal or chlamydial infections; however, more recent data indicate that, in certain settings, the frequency of HIV infection is much lower. Considering limited data and potential for other bacterial STIs among MSM partners, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended. All persons who receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, particularly MSM, should be tested for HIV, and those at risk for HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP.

### Impact of rapid susceptibility testing and antibiotic selection strategy on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea [^117Qibxy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Model Overview

We developed a dynamic compartmental model that describes gonorrhea transmission in a single sex population stratified by sexual risk. This model represented a population of men who have sex with men (MSM), who experience a significant burden of gonorrhea in the United States and in whom emergence of resistance is of concern. The model population was divided into 3 groups based on levels of sexual activity (low, intermediate, and high), characterized by rates of partner change, as informed by data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System. We assumed that individuals remained in their assigned risk group for the duration of their time in the model. We used the approach of Garnett and Anderson to describe mixing within and between risk groups. The natural history of gonorrhea infection was described by the following states: susceptible, symptomatic infection, and asymptomatic infection (Figure 1). Each of the infectious states was further subdivided to represent the resistance profile of the infecting strain. Model parameters are presented in Table 1, and additional model details are provided in the Technical Appendix.

Figure 1.
Overview of gonorrhea transmission model. (A) The model includes 3 states: susceptible, symptomatic infectious, and asymptomatic infectious. Infected individuals can return to the susceptible state via treatment or natural clearance of infection. (B) Expanded view of the different possible infected states, where subscripts indicate resistance to antibiotics A, B, and/or C. I 0 indicates infection with a completely drug susceptible strain. Note that the same series of infectious states and transitions exist for symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. The model is further stratified by 3 sexual activity classes.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to offer the following options in patients with gonococcal infection after a failed treatment:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|If treatment failure occurred after a non-recommended treatment|- Consider offering retreating with a recommended therapy|
|If reinfection is suspected|- Consider retreating with a recommended therapy, reinforcing the need for sexual abstinence, condom use and partner treatment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty in evidence of effects)|
|If treatment failure occurred and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are available|- Consider retreating according to susceptibility profile (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty in evidence of effects)|
|If treatment failure occurred after a recommended therapy and reinfection is assessed to be unlikely|- Consider retreating with a regimen not used previously from one of the following options and performing test of cure - ceftriaxone 1 g IM as a single dose plus azithromycin 2 g PO (only if ceftriaxone was not used previously), spectinomycin 2 g IM as a single dose plus azithromycin 2 g PO, or gentamicin 240 mg IM as a single dose plus azithromycin 2 g PO.

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^111nqwby]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for syphilis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to counsel MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months that doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

Treatment

Multiple factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g. those aged < 25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if follow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected (see Bacterial Vaginosis; Trichomoniasis). For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered.

Recommended Regimen for Cervicitis*
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
* Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).
Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

Other Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated for cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen or for 7 days after single-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved. Women who receive a cervicitis diagnosis should be tested for syphilis and HIV in addition to other recommended diagnostic tests.

Follow-Up

Women receiving treatment should return to their provider for a follow-up visit to determine whether cervicitis has resolved. For women who are untreated, a follow-up visit gives providers an opportunity to communicate test results obtained as part of the cervicitis evaluation. Providers should treat on the basis of any positive test results and determine whether cervicitis has resolved. Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return in 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated. If symptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to return for reevaluation.

### An update on gonorrhea and Chlamydia [^1142aigs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia infections remain a significant public health concern with most cases occurring in adults younger than 25 years old. Diagnosis relies on nucleic acid amplification testing as this is the most sensitive and specific test. Treatment with doxycycline or ceftriaxone is recommended for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively. Expedited partner therapy is cost-effective and acceptable by patients as a means to reduce transmission. Test of cure is indicated in persons at risk for reinfection or during pregnancy. Future directions include identifying effective strategies for prevention.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^1162avoy]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment — CDC STI Treatment Guidelines should guide treatment of all STIs. In settings where same-day treatment is available, treatment for persons with STI symptoms and their partners can be offered while awaiting results of diagnostic tests, and when possible, STI treatment should be provided on-site rather than called into a pharmacy to reduce barriers and ensure access to medication. To limit possible complications, pregnant people diagnosed with an STI should be treated immediately in accordance with CDC STI Treatment Guidelines; treatment does not need to be initiated by an obstetrician/gynecologist or other specialist. Because the presence of an STI is a biological marker of risk for acquiring other STIs, people diagnosed with an STI should be offered testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and syphilis unless already done at initial screening, and individuals with HIV infection should be linked to ongoing HIV care and treatment.

### Committee opinion no. 645 summary: dual therapy for gonococcal infections [^117LhZLV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with an estimated 820,000 new Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections occurring each year. Antimicrobial resistance limits treatment success, heightens the risk of complications, and may facilitate the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to the sulfonamides, the tetracyclines, and penicillin. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin remains the only recommended first-line regimen for the treatment of gonorrhea in the United States. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be administered together on the same day, preferably simultaneously, and under direct observation. Pregnant women who are infected with N gonorrhoeae should be treated with the recommended dual therapy. A test-of-cure is not needed for individuals diagnosed with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with the recommended or alternative regimens. Repeat N gonorrhoeae infection is prevalent among patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for gonorrhea in the preceding several months. Most of these infections result from reinfection; therefore, clinicians should advise patients with gonorrhea to be retested 3 months after treatment. Pregnant women with antenatal gonococcal infection should be retested in the third trimester unless recently treated.

### Assessment of the potential of vaccination to combat antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea: a modeling analysis to determine preferred product characteristics [^113kuFyE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Model Structure

We developed a stochastic compartmental transmission-dynamic model to project the future course of a gonorrhea epidemic under different vaccination scenarios, considering antibiotic-sensitive and ABR strains. We used data from England, which has a comprehensive, consistent, nationwide surveillance system. We considered transmission within MSM as they have the highest per-capita rate of infection. We simulated gonorrhea transmission from 2008 to 2030, using surveillance data from the period 2008–2017 for calibration and then projecting scenarios to 2030. We extended a previous model to incorporate heterogeneity in sexual risk behavior by dividing the population into low- and high-risk groups with characteristic rates of sexual partner change, based on the Natsal-3 survey.

Following acquisition of gonorrhea, individuals initially pass through a short incubation period, after which they either develop symptoms or remain asymptomatically infected (Figure 1). Surveillance data are not stratified by infection site (rectum, pharynx, urethra); hence, estimated parameters can be interpreted as an average across infection sites. Infected individuals are treated after seeking care due to symptoms or after testing positive in sexual health screening. Treated individuals become uninfected, except for a proportion of those infected with the ABR strain for whom treatment fails, leading to persistent infection for which the same dynamics are assumed as for asymptomatic cases. Recovery from untreated infection also occurs naturally over time. Infection does not confer natural immunity. We consider a situation in which the ABR strain emerges globally in 2020 and is imported into the highly sexually active group.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^117Q6o29]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

During 2018, CDC staff members and subject matter experts identified essential questions regarding gonorrhea treatment to update the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases conducted for January 2013–May 2019 using the parameters (gonorrhea[MeSH]) OR (gonococcal[all fields] OR gonorrhea[all fields] OR " Neisseria gonorrhoeae "[all fields]) AND (treatment[MeSH] OR antibiotic[MeSH] OR therapy) generated > 2,200 abstracts. Titles and abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were reviewed. Abstracts from STD conferences held during 2015–2018 and on the National Institutes of Health clinical trials website were also reviewed.

GISP susceptibility data from January 2013 to May 2019 were reviewed. GISP monitors gonorrhea antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the United States through monthly testing of urethral isolates from 25 symptomatic men in each of 25–30 STD specialty care clinics. Regional laboratories conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution to determine MICs for selected antimicrobials. Although the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has not established N. gonorrhoeae resistance breakpoints for ceftriaxone, cefixime, or azithromycin, CLSI categorizes isolates with MICs of ≤ 0.25 μ g/mL as susceptible for ceftriaxone and cefixime, and those with MICs of ≤ 1.00 μ g/mL as susceptible for azithromycin. To identify isolates with elevated MICs, GISP uses the following "alert values" to identify potential emerging resistance: MIC ≥ 0.125 μ g/mL for ceftriaxone, ≥ 0.25 μ g/mL for cefixime, and ≥ 2 μ g/mL for azithromycin.

In 2019, during an in-person meeting of governmental and nongovernmental participants, CDC staff members and subject matter experts reviewed data and presented their individual expert opinions. Each essential question was discussed, and applicable published articles were reviewed for their strengths, weaknesses, and relevance. Individual participants evaluated the quality of evidence, provided their input, and discussed findings in the context of the modified rating system used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. † CDC staff members independently reviewed tables of evidence, § individual comments from the participants and professional organizations, and existing guidelines from other organizations to determine if revisions to the 2015 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines were warranted.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^116rktsn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfections, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved or for 7 days after single-dose therapy). Men with NGU should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

Follow-Up

Men should be provided their testing results obtained as part of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Trichomoniasis).

If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis. Symptoms alone, without documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing persistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; voiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or new-onset premature ejaculation lasting for > 3 months. Men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

Management of Sex Partners

All sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding 60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and presumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against chlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated according to the management section for their respective pathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is unable to access timely care. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

### Reinfection by untreated partners of people treated for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: mathematical modelling study [^115GqhS5]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reinfection after treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae reduces the effect of control interventions. We explored the impact of delays in treatment of current partners on the expected probability of reinfection of index cases using a mathematical model.

Methods

We used previously reported parameter distributions to calculate the probability that index cases would be reinfected by their untreated partners. We then assumed different delays between index case and partner treatment to calculate the probabilities of reinfection.

Results

In the absence of partner treatment, the medians of the expected reinfection probabilities are 19.4% (IQR 9.2–31.6%) for C trachomatis and 12.5% (IQR 5.6–22.2%) for N gonorrhoeae. If all current partners receive treatment 3 days after the index case, the expected reinfection probabilities are 4.2% (IQR 2.1–6.9%) for C trachomatis and 5.5% (IQR 2.6–9.5%) for N gonorrhoeae.

Conclusions

Quicker partner referral and treatment can substantially reduce reinfection rates for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae by untreated partners. The formula we used to calculate reinfection rates can be used to inform the design of randomised controlled trials of novel partner notification technologies like accelerated partner therapy.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — biological understanding and clinical presentation: Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women, untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility, and infection may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children; accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea. In men, gonococcal infections are more commonly symptomatic compared with women, and serious complications from infection are less common in men.

Gonococcal Infections

Gonococcal Infection Among Adolescents and Adults

In the United States, an estimated 1,568,000 new N. gonorrhoeae infections occur each year, and gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial communicable disease. Urethral infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause them to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent sequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission to others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly asymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms until complications (e.g. PID) have occurred. PID can result in tubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.

Annual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended for all sexually active women aged < 25 years and for older women at increased risk for infection (e.g. those aged ≥ 25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include inconsistent condom use among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships, previous or coexisting STIs, and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and consult local public health authorities for guidance regarding identifying groups at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in specific geographic locations and communities. MSM at high risk for gonococcal infection (e.g. those with multiple anonymous partners or substance abuse) or those at risk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic sites of exposure every 3–6 months (see Men Who Have Sex with Men). At least annual screening is recommended for all MSM. Screening for gonorrhea among heterosexual men and women aged > 25 years who are at low risk for infection is not recommended. A recent travel history with sexual contacts outside the United States should be part of any gonorrhea evaluation.

Gonorrhea is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111sWp1x]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV — these recommendations advise use of sensitive, specific commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to detect gonorrhea in rectal and oropharyngeal specimens and chlamydial infection in rectal specimens, although use of these tests with rectal or oropharyngeal specimens is not cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); several state public health and national commercial laboratories have met all CLIA regulatory requirements for off-label procedures and billing codes have been assigned. STD treatment is generally safe and effective and rarely results in adverse reactions, but emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens may impair the effectiveness of some treatments over time, and in 2012 CDC recommended treating N. gonorrhoeae with two antimicrobial drugs (at least one requiring injection) that are more effective against antimicrobial-resistant strains. Poor adherence to STD treatment can impair effectiveness, and persons with HIV can become reinfected with STD if partners are not treated or do not take their treatment as prescribed; it is therefore important to offer partner services so that partners can be notified and offered testing and presumptive treatment. Some health departments integrate or routinely match HIV and STD surveillance data to identify persons with HIV who warrant being offered preventive services, and innovations in information technology and increased use of electronic medical information under the Affordable Care Act may expedite confidential, electronic reporting of surveillance data and support assessment and assurance functions of public health programs.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^112dvmQM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Continued support of gonorrhea prevention and control efforts remains fundamental, and preventing antibiotic resistance is crucial. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ceftriaxone indicate that a 500 mg dose in an average-weight U.S. adult achieves sufficiently high serum levels for an adequate duration to eradicate infection, even with wide pharmacokinetic variability. The high frequency of pharyngeal gonorrhea with substantial underscreening and the increased understanding of wide individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability has contributed to the recommendation for the increased ceftriaxone dose. These recommendations also include a test-of-cure for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea to ensure eradication or detection of a possible treatment failure.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance affects gonorrhea treatment recommendations and other STIs. CDC recommends ceftriaxone monotherapy for treatment because N. gonorrhoeae remains highly susceptible to ceftriaxone, azithromycin resistance is increasing, and prudent use of antimicrobial agents supports limiting their use. Continuing to monitor for emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures will be essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens.

### Preventing recurrent sexually transmitted diseases in minority adolescents: a randomized controlled trial [^116NEe23]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of a randomized controlled trial of the Sexual Awareness For Everyone (SAFE) behavioral intervention on teenagers (aged 14 to 18 years) compared with adult rates of reinfection with Neiserria gonorrhea or Chlamydia trachomatis cervicitis, and to identify behaviors associated with recurrent infection.

Methods

Mexican-American and African-American females with a nonviral sexually transmitted disease (STD) were enrolled in SAFE or assigned to the control group. All participants were interviewed and examined at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome variable was reinfection with N. gonorrhea or C. trachomatis. Secondary outcomes were changes in risky sexual behavior.

Results

Teens randomized to participation in SAFE had a statistically lower incidence of recurrent N. gonorrhea and C. trachomatis at 0 to 6 months (52%, P = 0.04) and cumulatively (39%, P = 0.04) compared with teens in the control group. Cumulatively, teens as a group had higher rates of reinfection (33.1%) than adults (14.4%) (P < .001). Adolescent reinfection was explained by unprotected sex with untreated partners (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.58), nonmonogamy (adjusted OR 5.14), and rapid partner turnover (adjusted OR 2.02). In adults, reinfection was predicted by unprotected sex with untreated partners (adjusted OR 4.90), unsafe sex (adjusted OR 2.18), rapid partner turnover (adjusted OR 3.13), and douching after sex (adjusted OR 2.14).

Conclusion

Sexual Awareness for Everyone significantly reduced recurrent STDs in teenagers. Adults and teens randomized to the SAFE intervention had significant decreases in high-risk sexual behaviors as compared with those in the control group. Although not specifically designed for teens, the SAFE intervention worked very well in this high-risk population.

### Chlamydial and gonococcal infections: screening, diagnosis, and treatment [^111SgVdL]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are increasing in the United States. Because most infections are asymptomatic, screening is key to preventing complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility and decreasing community and vertical neonatal transmission. All sexually active people with a cervix who are younger than 25 years and older people with a cervix who have risk factors should be screened annually for chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Sexually active men who have sex with men should be screened at least annually. Physicians should obtain a sexual history free from assumptions about sex partners or practices. Acceptable specimen types for testing include vaginal, endocervical, rectal, pharyngeal, and urethral swabs, and first-stream urine samples. Uncomplicated gonococcal infection should be treated with a single 500-mg dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone in people weighing less than 331 lb (150 kg). Preferred chlamydia treatment is a seven-day course of doxycycline, 100 mg taken by mouth twice per day. All nonpregnant people should be tested for reinfection approximately three months after treatment or at the first visit in the 12 months after treatment. Pregnant patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea should have a test of cure four weeks after treatment.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^116BbPV7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

No vaccines and few chemoprophylaxis options exist for the prevention of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea). These infections have increased in the United States and disproportionately affect gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). In three large randomized controlled trials, 200 mg of doxycycline taken within 72 hours after sex has been shown to reduce syphilis and chlamydia infections by > 70% and gonococcal infections by approximately 50%. This report outlines CDC's recommendation for the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxy PEP), a novel, ongoing, patient-managed biomedical STI prevention strategy for a selected population. CDC recommends that MSM and TGW who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) diagnosed in the past 12 months should receive counseling that doxy PEP can be used as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Following shared decision-making with their provider, CDC recommends that providers offer persons in this group a prescription for doxy PEP to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex. The recommended dose of doxy PEP is 200 mg and should not exceed a maximum dose of 200 mg every 24 hours. Doxy PEP, when offered, should be implemented in the context of a comprehensive sexual health approach, including risk reduction counseling, STI screening and treatment, recommended vaccination and linkage to HIV PrEP, HIV care, or other services as appropriate. Persons who are prescribed doxy PEP should undergo bacterial STI testing at anatomic sites of exposure at baseline and every 3–6 months thereafter. Ongoing need for doxy PEP should be assessed every 3–6 months as well. HIV screening should be performed for HIV-negative MSM and TGW according to current recommendations.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113F25zJ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Other Management Considerations

To maximize adherence with recommended therapies and reduce complications and transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on-site and directly observed. If medications are unavailable when treatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility should be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated (7 days after receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present). All persons who receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

Follow-Up

A test of cure (i.e. repeat testing after completion of therapy) is unnecessary for persons who receive a diagnosis of uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens. Any person with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return 7–14 days after initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or NAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased likelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort should be made to perform a confirmatory culture before retreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All positive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment should be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or without simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused by other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).

A high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection has been observed among men and women previously treated for gonorrhea. The majority of these infections result from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient education and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment.

### Time to resolution of genital symptoms for uncomplicated gonorrhoea: a prospective cohort study [^114vLz5L]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the time to resolution of symptoms (TTR) following treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea and to identify factors associated with TTR in a cohort of sexual health clinic attendees.

Methods

Participants were recruited from 14 clinics across England into the 'Gentamicin for the Treatment of Gonorrhoea (GToG)' trial between October 2014 and November 2016. We analysed demographic, behavioural and clinical data in a subset of the GToG study cohort presenting with genital discharge and/or dysuria, who subsequently experienced microbiological clearance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae 2weeks after treatment. Testing for gonorrhoea was performed using a nucleic acid amplification test. The results were expressed as median TTR (IQR) and HRs with 95%CIs for resolution of symptoms.

Results

216 participants (89% male) with a mean age of 32 years reported genital discharge (204/216 (94%)) or dysuria (173/216 (80%)) at their baseline visit. Symptom resolution occurred in 202/216 (94%) at the 2-week follow-up appointment. The median TTR was 2 days (IQR 1–3 days). 50/216 (23%) patients presented with gonorrhoea-chlamydia coinfection at their baseline attendance and in this group symptom resolution was slower (3 days for gonorrhoea-chlamydia coinfection compared with 2 days for gonorrhoea only, HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95)). TTR was also longer in women (4 days for females compared with 2 days for males, HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.77)).

Conclusions

The time to resolution of genital symptoms following effective treatment of gonorrhoea is variable, but 90% of patients report symptom resolution within 1week. Concurrent chlamydia infection and being female were associated with prolonged TTR.

Regarding patient education for gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to general counseling, IUSTI/WHO 2020 guidelines recommend to advise patients with gonococcal infection to abstain from sexual contact for 14 days, or 7 days if using ceftriaxone monotherapy, after they and their sexual partners have completed ceftriaxone plus azithromycin dual treatment and their symptoms have resolved. Advise consistent use of barrier contraception if abstinence is not possible.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1157rG5a]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidance is as follows: The CDC recommends annual chlamydia and gonorrhea testing in all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women at increased risk of infection, and it also recommends screening for both infections in pregnant women younger than 25 years and in older pregnant women at increased risk for infection during their first prenatal visit and again during their third trimester if risk remains high. The CDC recommends that clinicians consider screening for chlamydia in sexually active young men in high-prevalence areas and populations, recommends annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at appropriate anatomical sites of exposure in men who have sex with men with more frequent screening if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners, and recommends screening transgender individuals on the basis of their sexual practices and anatomy. Because of high rates of STIs in persons entering correctional facilities, the CDC recommends chlamydia and gonorrhea screening at intake in correctional facilities in women 35 years or younger and in men younger than 30 years, and because of the high likelihood of reinfection it recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infections 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated. ACOG endorses the CDC's recommendations that clinicians annually screen all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women at risk for chlamydia and gonorrhea, recommends that all pregnant women be tested for chlamydia early in pregnancy with a repeat test in the third trimester for women with risk factors, and recommends testing for gonorrhea in pregnant women 25 years or younger or for women living in an area where gonorrhea is common. The AAFP follows the 2014 USPSTF chlamydia and gonorrhea screening recommendations, and AAP recommendations align with the CDC guidelines.

Follow-Up

Women should demonstrate clinical improvement (e.g. defervescence; reduction in direct or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness) < 3 days after therapy initiation. If no clinical improvement has occurred < 72 hours after outpatient IM or oral therapy, then hospitalization, assessment of the antimicrobial regimen, and additional diagnostics, including consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses, are recommended. All women who have received a diagnosis of chlamydial or gonococcal PID should be retested 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex partners have been treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, these women should be retested whenever they next seek medical care < 12 months after treatment.

Management of Sex Partners

Persons who have had sexual contact with a partner with PID during the 60 days preceding symptom onset should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia and gonorrhea, regardless of the PID etiology or pathogens isolated. If the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated. Sex partners of persons who have PID caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. If linkage is delayed or unlikely, EPT is an alternative approach to treating sex partners who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated (i.e. until therapy is completed and symptoms have resolved, if originally present).
