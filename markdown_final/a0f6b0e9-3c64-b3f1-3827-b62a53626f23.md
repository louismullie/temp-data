## Question

tumor lysis syndrome management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tumor lysis syndrome management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining TLS and its diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify risk stratification and prophylaxis by risk tier. Next, I will examine hydration, electrolyte management, and uric acid–lowering strategies, including rasburicase dosing and G6PD considerations. After that, I need to check monitoring cadence and when to escalate to dialysis. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework so I don't miss the basics. TLS is a metabolic oncologic emergency characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hypocalcemia, with laboratory TLS defined by a 25% change in two or more of these parameters and clinical TLS defined by laboratory TLS plus clinical sequelae such as arrhythmia, seizure, or AKI requiring intervention, typically within 12–72 hours of therapy initiation [^185d0c5d] [^e52ddbae] [^827ef473].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management without stratifying risk. I need to check the risk factors and tiers. High-risk features include Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, bulky chemosensitive disease, high WBC or LDH, preexisting renal disease or elevated uric acid, and certain targeted agents like venetoclax; intermediate risk includes DLBCL with bulky disease or renal impairment; low risk includes indolent lymphomas or CLL with modest tumor burden and preserved renal function, and this stratification guides prophylaxis intensity [^ae1282d7] [^e71d5969] [^ec8de441].

> Next, I should review prophylaxis by risk tier, and I need to ensure I'm aligning with major guidelines. For high-risk patients, rasburicase plus aggressive hydration is recommended; for intermediate risk, allopurinol or febuxostat plus increased hydration is advised, with rasburicase considered if uric acid is elevated or renal function is impaired; for low risk, careful monitoring with oral hydration and consideration of allopurinol is reasonable, and I should confirm that alkalinization is not recommended prophylactically because it can precipitate calcium phosphate crystals [^e8be3009] [^e1c8db7a] [^0246446e] [^2675b935].

> Wait, let me verify the hydration specifics so I don't gloss over details. Isotonic crystalloids should be used to maintain urine output above 100 mL/m²/h in children or about 2–4 mL/kg/h, with potassium avoided in fluids and loop diuretics used if oliguria persists despite adequate volume, and I should double-check that urine alkalinization is discouraged in modern practice due to calcium phosphate precipitation risk [^f9cfbd86] [^8e794193] [^63b10d0a].

> I will now examine uric acid–lowering therapy, and I need to be precise about dosing and safety. Rasburicase 0.1–0.2 mg/kg IV once is effective, with many adults managed with a single fixed 3–6 mg dose; repeat dosing is reserved for persistent hyperuricemia, and I must screen for G6PD deficiency because rasburicase can cause hemolysis and methemoglobinemia in deficient patients, in whom allopurinol should be used instead [^55117e93] [^a673cc40] [^a5421d3f] [^17b2d624].

> Let me consider allopurinol and febuxostat carefully. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase and should be started 2–3 days before therapy when feasible; febuxostat is an alternative when allopurinol is not tolerated or contraindicated, but I should confirm that allopurinol is not used as treatment for established TLS when rasburicase is available, except in G6PD deficiency or cost constraints [^a5421d3f] [^3942d20b].

> Next, I should review electrolyte management and make sure I'm not overcorrecting. For hyperkalemia, I need to check for exogenous potassium sources, use insulin with dextrose, beta-agonists, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate as temporizing measures, and give IV calcium gluconate if there are ECG changes; for hyperphosphatemia, restrict dietary phosphate and use sevelamer, avoiding calcium-based binders when the calcium-phosphate product is high; for hypocalcemia, I should avoid treating asymptomatic cases to prevent calcium phosphate precipitation and treat only if symptomatic with tetany or arrhythmias [^da349ead] [^3067df1e] [^4a08a658].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence and thresholds for escalation. High-risk patients warrant frequent labs every 4–6 hours initially, intermediate-risk every 8–12 hours, and low-risk daily, with ECG monitoring when potassium is 6.0 mmol/L or rises by 25% from baseline; if electrolyte abnormalities are refractory or AKI worsens, I need to escalate to hemodialysis or CRRT for intractable fluid overload, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatemia, and continue RRT until renal function recovers and electrolytes stabilize [^6c5bc287] [^4aca3cfb] [^49509fec] [^2563d3e4].

> But wait, what about special populations and scenarios where standard pathways differ. In venetoclax-treated CLL, I should follow the 5-week ramp-up with pre-dose, 6–8 hour, and 24-hour labs at each new dose, consider hospitalization for high tumor burden or CrCl less than 80 mL/min, and hold or reduce doses if TLS criteria emerge; in pediatrics, hyperhydration without potassium and judicious rasburicase use are standard, with low-intensity cytoreduction upfront for very high WBC; in neonates, rasburicase can be effective but immature renal function may necessitate earlier dialysis; in solid tumors, TLS is rare but can be catastrophic, so early recognition and aggressive supportive care are key [^a540951b] [^ec8de441] [^6ea45c6d] [^b8ad35d1] [^14acc3f2] [^9564436e].

> Hold on, I should verify a few nuances so I don't propagate outdated practices. Urine alkalinization is no longer recommended for TLS prophylaxis or treatment because it increases calcium phosphate precipitation and may worsen AKI; rasburicase is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency and should be avoided in combination with allopurinol because allopurinol may blunt rasburicase's effect by increasing xanthine substrate; and while single-dose rasburicase is often sufficient, a subset of high-risk patients may require a second dose based on uric acid response [^63b10d0a] [^4a9ad7d8] [^a673cc40].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Pre-treatment: assess tumor burden, renal function, LDH, uric acid, and G6PD status; stratify risk; correct preexisting abnormalities. Prophylaxis: high risk gets rasburicase plus aggressive IV hydration; intermediate risk gets allopurinol or febuxostat plus increased hydration; low risk gets oral hydration and consider allopurinol. Monitoring: high risk every 4–6 hours, intermediate every 8–12 hours, low risk daily, with ECG if potassium thresholds are met. Established TLS: aggressive hydration, rasburicase if hyperuricemic, electrolyte management per above, and escalate to dialysis if refractory. Throughout, avoid urine alkalinization, avoid rasburicase in G6PD deficiency, and coordinate multidisciplinary care for severe cases [^e8be3009] [^e1c8db7a] [^0246446e] [^55117e93] [^49509fec] [^81092b91].

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a **life-threatening oncologic emergency** characterized by rapid tumor cell lysis causing hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, which can lead to acute kidney injury, arrhythmias, seizures, and death [^185d0c5d]. Management centers on **prevention through risk stratification** [^d91970a8], aggressive hydration [^f9cfbd86], and uric acid control with allopurinol or rasburicase [^a5421d3f]; rasburicase is preferred in high-risk patients or when uric acid is elevated [^e8be3009]. Avoid urine alkalinization [^63b10d0a] and treat electrolyte emergencies promptly: hyperkalemia with insulin/glucose, calcium gluconate, and beta-agonists [^da349ead]; hyperphosphatemia with phosphate binders; and symptomatic hypocalcemia with cautious calcium supplementation [^4a08a658]. Monitor electrolytes and renal function every 4–6 hours in high-risk patients [^6c5bc287], and initiate dialysis for refractory hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, or acute kidney injury [^49509fec]. Early recognition and protocolized care are essential to prevent morbidity and mortality [^865777ab].

---

## Risk stratification and prevention

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate tumor burden, proliferation rate, renal function, and baseline electrolytes [^d91970a8] [^fa64c4e8].
- **Hydration**: Aggressive IV hydration with isotonic fluids (no potassium) to maintain urine output > 100 mL/m²/h [^f9cfbd86] [^8e794193].
- **Uric acid control**: Allopurinol for low/intermediate risk; rasburicase for high risk or elevated uric acid [^e8be3009] [^a5421d3f].
- **Avoid alkalinization**: Urine alkalinization is not recommended due to calcium phosphate precipitation risk [^63b10d0a] [^2675b935].

---

## Management of established TLS

### General supportive measures

General supportive measures include **continuous cardiac monitoring** for hyperkalemia or arrhythmias [^4aca3cfb] and **frequent laboratory monitoring** of electrolytes, uric acid, and renal function every 4–6 hours in high-risk patients [^6c5bc287].

---

### Electrolyte management

| **Electrolyte abnormality** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Hyperkalemia | - Insulin + glucose <br/> - Calcium gluconate <br/> - Beta-agonists <br/> - Sodium polystyrene sulfonate <br/> - Dialysis if refractory [^da349ead] [^49509fec] |
| Hyperphosphatemia | - Phosphate binders (sevelamer, aluminum hydroxide) <br/> - Dietary phosphate restriction [^da349ead] |
| Hypocalcemia | - Treat only if symptomatic (tetany, seizures, arrhythmias) <br/> - Calcium gluconate infusion with close monitoring [^4a08a658] [^3067df1e] |

---

### Renal management

Renal management includes **dialysis indications** for refractory hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, or acute kidney injury [^49509fec] [^2563d3d4]. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **G6PD deficiency**: Avoid rasburicase; use allopurinol and hydration [^17b2d624] [^0d12d25a].
- **Pediatric patients**: Use weight-based rasburicase dosing (0.1–0.2 mg/kg) and avoid urine alkalinization [^da349ead] [^b8ad35d1].
- **Venetoclax-associated TLS**: Follow dose ramp-up, monitor closely, and use prophylactic rasburicase in high-risk patients [^a540951b] [^ec8de441].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **daily electrolytes and renal function** until stable, then weekly for 2–4 weeks after therapy initiation. Continue to reassess TLS risk with each new treatment cycle or dose escalation [^6c5bc287].

---

TLS management requires **early recognition, risk stratification, and protocolized care** with aggressive hydration, uric acid control, and electrolyte monitoring; rasburicase is the cornerstone for high-risk patients, and dialysis is reserved for refractory cases [^a5421d3f] [^49509fec].

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric and adult tumor lysis syndrome: an evidence-based review [^470015cc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has recently been subclassified into either laboratory TLS or clinical TLS, and a grading system has been established. Standardized guidelines, however, are needed to aid in the stratification of patients according to risk and to establish prophylaxis and treatment recommendations for patients at risk or with established TLS.

Methods

A panel of experts in pediatric and adult hematologic malignancies and TLS was assembled to develop recommendations and guidelines for TLS based on clinical evidence and standards of care. A review of relevant literature was also used.

Results

New guidelines are presented regarding the prevention and management of patients at risk of developing TLS. The best management of TLS is prevention. Prevention strategies include hydration and prophylactic rasburicase in high-risk patients, hydration plus allopurinol or rasburicase for intermediate-risk patients, and close monitoring for low-risk patients. Primary management of established TLS involves similar recommendations, with the addition of aggressive hydration and diuresis, plus allopurinol or rasburicase for hyperuricemia. Alkalinization is not recommended. Although guidelines for rasburicase use in adults are provided, this agent is currently only approved for use in pediatric patients in the United States.

Conclusion

The potential severity of complications resulting from TLS requires measures for prevention in high-risk patients and prompts treatment in the event that symptoms arise. Recognition of risk factors, monitoring of at-risk patients, and appropriate interventions are the key to preventing or managing TLS. These guidelines should assist in the prevention of TLS and improve the management of patients with established TLS.

### Tumor lysis syndrome: risk factors, diagnosis, and management [^39eb8a18]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially fatal complication of induction therapy for several types of malignancies. Electrolyte derangements and even downstream complications may also occur prior to the initial presentation to a medical provider, before an oncologic diagnosis has been established. It is therefore imperative that emergency physicians be familiar with the risk factors for TLS in children as well as the criteria for diagnosis and the strategies for prevention and management. Careful evaluation of serum electrolytes, uric acid, and renal function must occur. Patients at risk for TLS and those who already exhibit laboratory or clinical evidence of TLS require close monitoring, aggressive hydration, and appropriate medical treatment.

### Developing educational interventions and clinical tools to improve risk-based prevention and management of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) [^c566d72e]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract e18811 Background: TLS is a potentially life-threatening consequence of cancer treatment resulting from massive tumor cell lysis. The best way to manage this oncologic emergency is through prevention, however the risk for TLS is often underestimated. To address this gap, we launched a continuing medical education expert interview on the ReachMD medical broadcast network. Methods: In October 2017, a CME program consisting of a 30-minute expert interview was launched across all platforms within the ReachMD network. The program focused on a comprehensive TLS risk classification system developed by an international expert consensus. A downloadable clinical tool, including a TLS risk stratification algorithm and prophylaxis/management recommendations accompanied the program.

Pre-/post-activity tests and evaluations were assessed to measure any gains in knowledge/confidence and intended practice change. There was also a 50% significant increase in mean confidence rating in a clinician's ability to identify patients at risk for TLS and apply appropriate prevention/treatment strategies. Mean confidence rating pre-education was 2. 5, which increased to
3. 8 post-education. The majority of participants also identified specific changes they intend to make in their practice, such as improving patient assessment and better identifying patients at risk for TLS. Conclusions: An educational expert interview offered across multiple e-learning formats significantly increased the knowledge and confidence of clinicians' to incorporate risk-based management of TLS.

### Consensus conference on the management of tumor lysis syndrome [^001df5ac]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially life threatening complication of massive cellular lysis in cancers. Identification of high-risk patients and early recognition of the syndrome is crucial in the institution of appropriate treatments. Drugs that act on the metabolic pathway of uric acid to allantoin, like allopurinol or rasburicase, are effective for prophylaxis and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome. Sound recommendations should regulate diagnosis and drug application in the clinical setting. The current article reports the recommendations on the management of tumor lysis syndrome that were issued during a Consensus Conference project, and which were endorsed by the Italian Society of Hematology (SIE), the Italian Association of Pediatric Oncologists (AIEOP) and the Italian Society of Medical Oncology (AIOM). Current concepts on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapy of tumor lysis syndrome were evaluated by a Panel of 8 experts. A consensus was then developed for statements regarding key questions on tumor lysis syndrome management selected according to the criterion of relevance by group discussion. Hydration and rasburicase should be administered to adult cancer patients who are candidates for tumor-specific therapy and who carry a high risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Cancer patients with a low-risk of tumor lysis syndrome should instead receive hydration along with oral allopurinol. Hydration and rasburicase should also be administered to patients with clinical tumor lysis syndrome and to adults and high-risk children who develop laboratory tumor lysis syndrome. In conclusion, the Panel recommended rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis in selected patients based on the drug efficacy profile. Methodologically rigorous studies are needed to clarify its cost-effectiveness profile.

### Tumor lysis syndrome [^4819f49a]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an acute, life-threatening disease among adults and children that is associated with the initiation of cytoreductive therapy in the treatment of malignancy. A pattern of metabolic derangements occurs as a result of a massive release of intracellular contents into the systemic circulation. Characteristic findings include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and uremia, all of which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, renal failure, and sudden death. The incidence of TLS appears to be increasing because of a rapidly growing armamentarium of highly effective biologic and targeted therapies. Risk assessment and prevention are at the forefront of management and rely on clinician awareness, prophylactic measures, and vigilant laboratory monitoring. Established TLS requires early, aggressive intervention with intravenous hydration, electrolyte management, and the use of hypouricemic agents. This review highlights the central role of diagnostic laboratory criteria for TLS, and summarizes the clinical findings, pathophysiology, and evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and management of TLS.

### Tumor lysis syndrome [^865777ab]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency that occurs due to the massive lysis of tumor cells resulting in hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Patients are at significant risk for acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, seizures, and sudden death as sequelae of this condition. Management is dependent on severity but often includes acute stabilization, aggressive hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and uric acid-lowering medications, such as rasburicase and allopurinol. TLS carries high morbidity and mortality risk making prevention through intravenous hydration and prophylactic medications the best management strategy.

### Real world incidence, prevention, and management of tumor lysis syndrome in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with venetoclax in the inpatient and outpatient settings… [^49d37641]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract 7045 Background: Venetoclax is a BCL2 inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia which can cause clinical or laboratory tumor lysis syndrome. A dose ramp-up schedule and prophylaxis strategies are incorporated into NCCN guidelines and prescribing information. Prior reports have of TLS focused mostly on patients with relapsed/refractory CLL receiving ven as monotherapy. Results: We included 616 ven escalations among 136 pts with CLL. Median age was 70 years and 86% were white. Ven was part of first line of tx for 48 pts. 11% had high TLS risk at baseline; 37% among those escalated exclusively inpatient and 2% among those escalated exclusively outpatient. Among those treated with ven, 47 pts received ven monotherapy. 74 of pts were escalated exclusively OP, 35 had at least one prophylactic hospitalization and 27 were escalated exclusively IP.

During ven initiation, 86% of pts received allopurinol, 71% intravenous hydration, 18% phosphate binders, and 10% prophylactic rasburicase. Among the entire cohort, 8 pts developed lab TLS and zero developed clinical TLS. There were 11 TLS events; 2 pts developed TLS in more than one escalation. Incidence of TLS was 15% for those escalated exclusively IP, 5. 7% for those with any prophylactic hospitalization and
2. 7% for those escalated exclusively OP. Those who developed TLS were more likely to have a higher TLS risk at baseline, preceding isolated hyperuricemia, or CrCl measurement < 60 mL/min. Conclusions: In this single institution retrospective cohort study, lab TLS was observed, though clinical TLS was not. Baseline hyperuricemia and impaired renal function were more common among those who developed lab TLS compared to those who did not.

Prophylactic measures, including use of IV hydration, may have contributed to low rates of observed TLS in the outpatient setting.

### Tumor lysis syndrome and acute kidney injury: evaluation, prevention, and management [^14b7d903]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) describes a constellation of biochemical and clinical abnormalities resulting from rapid and massive tumor cell death. TLS is frequently associated with hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hypocalcemia that may lead to serious clinical complications, including acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest. Identification of tumor- and patient-specific risk factors for TLS and early recognition of laboratory and clinical TLS based on established criteria are essential for preventing TLS and forestalling acute kidney injury. Early collaboration between oncologists and nephrologists will help improve assessment of patients' kidney function and risk factors, paving the way for timely and efficacious interventions.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^b81c76c0]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication associated with the treatment of some cancers. If left untreated, TLS may result in acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, neurologic complications, seizures, or death. Tumor lysis syndrome is most commonly observed in patients with hematologic malignancies with a high proliferation rate undergoing treatment with very effective therapies. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), historically, TLS has been observed less often, owing to a low proliferation rate and slow response to chemotherapy. New targeted therapies have recently been approved in the treatment of CLL, including the oral kinase inhibitors, idelalisib and ibrutinib, and the B-cell lymphoma-2 protein inhibitor, venetoclax. Several others are also under development, and combination strategies of these agents are being explored. This review examines the diagnosis, prevention, and management of TLS and summarizes the TLS experience in CLL clinical trials with newer targeted agents. Overall, the risk of TLS is small, but the consequences may be fatal; therefore, patients should be monitored carefully. Therapies capable of eliciting rapid response and combination regimens are increasingly being evaluated for treatment of CLL, which may pose a higher risk of TLS. For optimal management, patients at risk for TLS require prophylaxis and close monitoring with appropriate tests and appropriate management to correct laboratory abnormalities, which allows for safe and effective disease control.

Implications For Practice

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially fatal condition observed with hematologic malignancies, caused by release of cellular components in the bloodstream from rapidly dying tumor cells. The frequency and severity of TLS is partly dependent upon the biology of the disease and type of therapy administered. Novel targeted agents highly effective at inducing rapid cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may pose a risk for TLS in patients with tumors characterized by rapid growth, high tumor burden, and/or high sensitivity to treatment. In this review, prevention strategies and management of patients with CLL who develop TLS are described.

1Acute renal failure is one of the most immediate, serious, and costly TLS-related complications of treatment for hematologic malignancies. 6–10 Current treatment options for managing hyperuricemia include oral or intravenous allopurinol, with or without alkaline hydration, and possibly diuretics. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Study Treatment and Assessments Patients stratified by TLS risk were randomly assigned to three treatment arms at a ratio of 1: 1: 1 using a random permutation block design. Cytoreductive chemotherapy was initiated within 4 to 24 hours after the first dose of antihyperuricemic treatment. Discussion The incidence of TLS is a function of TLS risk and the cytoreductive nature of the chemotherapy.

A retrospective study found that 5% of adult patients with AML developed clinical TLS after receiving induction chemotherapy, even with prophylactic hydration and allopurinol treatment. 20Renal failure occurred in 98% of patients with clinical TLS, and dialysis was necessary in 18% of patients. 20The prevention and treatment of TLS are becoming more important with increasing use of potentially nephrotoxic chemotherapy agents, such as ifosfamide or methotrexate, 21that may increase the risk of TLS. Some immunomodulating agents, including rituximab and lenalidomide, have been reported to cause hyperuricemia and TLS in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders. 22, 23. Reduction of hyperuricemia may reduce the incidence of clinical TLS, because hyperuricemia is an important component of this syndrome. Consistent with results of a previous study in pediatric patients with lymphoma and leukemia. P = 0. 06).

It should be emphasized that "missing uric acid samples" and "antihyperuricemic treatment extending beyond 5 days" were the primary parameters affecting the results of this analysis, not lack of uric acid control. Treatment failure attributable to lack of uric acid control occurred only with allopurinol, not with rasburicase-containing treatments. As part of the management of TLS, sequential therapy of rasburicase for 3 days followed by allopurinol for 3 days may be beneficial for patients who are at risk for the syndrome.

### Preventing and monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome and other toxicities of venetoclax during treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^5b3831b9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent developments in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have moved the standard of care away from chemoimmunotherapy to targeted agents such as oral kinase inhibitors or BCL-2 antagonists, alone or in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies. Two different treatment approaches have evolved: continuous, indefinite treatment and, more recently, fixed-duration combination treatment. With venetoclax-based treatment, there is a requirement to follow the established guidelines for close monitoring during initiation and ramp up, to reduce the risk of tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's risk should be assessed before the initiation of venetoclax. Appropriate management strategies should be used, including uricosuric agents, hydration, and routine laboratory monitoring, per guidelines. With early identification, immediate management, and dose adjustments, we suggest that tumor lysis syndrome and other toxicities, such as neutropenia and infections, with venetoclax-based treatment can be dealt with successfully.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of risk and prophylaxis of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) in adults and children with malignant diseases: an expert TLS panel consensus [^fa64c4e8]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening oncological emergency characterized by metabolic abnormalities including hyperuricaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. These metabolic complications predispose the cancer patient to clinical toxicities including renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, neurological complications and potentially sudden death. With the increased availability of newer therapeutic targeted agents, such as rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase), there are no published guidelines on the risk classification of TLS for individual patients at risk of developing this syndrome. We convened an international TLS expert consensus panel to develop guidelines for a medical decision tree to assign low, intermediate and high risk to patients with cancer at risk for TLS. Risk factors included biological evidence of laboratory TLS (LTLS), proliferation, bulk and stage of malignant tumour and renal impairment and/or involvement at the time of TLS diagnosis. An international TLS consensus expert panel of paediatric and adult oncologists, experts in TLS pathophysiology and experts in TLS prophylaxis and management, developed a final model of low, intermediate and high risk TLS classification and associated TLS prophylaxis recommendations.

### Emergencies in haematology: tumour lysis syndrome [^21d05a90]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a significant complication of haematologic malignancies and their management. The syndrome consists of laboratory abnormalities either alone (laboratory TLS) or with clinical sequelae including renal failure, seizures, and arrhythmias (clinical TLS). Clinical TLS is a predictor for worse overall morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, but can be prevented. Thus, accurate prognostication is critical to appropriate management of patients at risk for TLS, and incorporates both disease factors (tumour type and burden) and patient factors (baseline renal insufficiency or hyperuricaemia). Strategies to prevent TLS include hydration and allopurinol in low- and intermediate-risk patients and rasburicase in high-risk patients.

### A predictive model for the detection of tumor lysis syndrome during AML induction therapy [^eda3d387]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2006). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is defined by metabolic derangements occurring in the setting of rapid tumor destruction. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), TLS frequency, risk stratification, monitoring, and management strategies are based largely on case series and data from other malignancies. A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted to estimate TLS incidence and identify TLS predictive factors in a patient population undergoing myeloid leukemia induction chemotherapy. This study included 194 patients, aged 18–86 years, with AML or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing primary myeloid leukemia induction chemotherapy. Nineteen patients (9.8%) developed TLS. In univariate analysis, elevated pre-chemotherapy values for uric acid (P < 0.0001), creatinine (P = 0.0025), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.0001), white blood cell (P = 0.0058), gender (P = 0.0064) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia history (P = 0.0292) were significant predictors. In multivariate analysis, LDH (P = 0.0042), uric acid (P < 0.0001) and gender (P = 0.0073) remained significant TLS predictors. A predictive model was then designed using a scoring system based on these factors. This analysis may lay the groundwork for the development of the first evidence-based guidelines for TLS monitoring and management in this patient population.

### The management of tumor lysis syndrome [^d2f0414f]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2006). Medium credibility.

The manifestation of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurs when the destruction of tumor cells releases breakdown products that overwhelm the excretory mechanisms of the body. A cardinal sign is hyperuricemia, leading to uric acid nephropathy. Other signs are hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and secondary hypocalcemia. Conventional management of TLS consists of aggressive intravenous hydration, diuretic therapy, urinary alkalization, and inhibition of urate production by high-dose allopurinol. Urate oxidase has been used in the management of patients at risk for TLS and recently the recombinant urate oxidase rasburicase was developed. Several data indicate that rasburicase is effective and well tolerated in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced hyperuricemia. Treatment options of hyperkalemia include sodium polystyrene sulfonate, hypertonic glucose and insulin, loop diuretics, and bicarbonate. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia reduces dietary phosphate intake and includes phosphate binders such as aluminum hydroxide and aluminum carbonate. When recurrent hypocalcemia is present, a continuous intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be initiated. Hemodialysis should be considered for every patient with excessively elevated uric acid, phosphate and/or potassium and in those patients with acute renal failure to control urinary volume and manage uremia.

### Rasburicase for the management of tumor lysis syndrome in neonates [^14acc3f2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with rasburicase in 2 patients who presented with cancer within the first month of life and compare and contrast both cases with respect to their underlying renal physiology, management, and eventual outcome.

Case Summary

TLS developed in 2 neonates born at 38 weeks' gestational age; both were managed in part with rasburicase. One patient was a 21-day-old infant who received 2 days of induction chemotherapy for the treatment of congenital Stage IV-S neuroblastoma. With a single 0.2 mg/kg dose of rasburicase, the serum urate level normalized and the infant completed therapy without incident. The second patient was a 4-day-old neonate with congenital precursor-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with spontaneous TLS complicated by renal dysfunction. Despite several doses of intravenous rasburicase (2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 4 doses of 0.2 mg/kg), as well as aggressive supportive therapy, the infant died of complications arising from uncontrolled TLS.

Discussion

Neonates may be at particular risk for TLS given their immature renal function and its predisposition toward metabolic derangements. While rasburicase has the potential to provide a rapid reversal of TLS in this patient population, when TLS is complicated by pre-existing acute renal failure, additional interventions and alternative anti-tumor strategies may be necessary for a successful outcome. When managing TLS in infancy, clinicians must consider the relative degree of renal immaturity and its predisposition toward metabolic derangements.

Conclusions

Rasburicase appears to be well tolerated and effective in lowering serum urate concentrations in the treatment of therapy-related TLS in neonates. However, in instances of spontaneous TLS complicated by the normally low glomerular filtration rate in the newborn infant, the use of rasburicase and other supportive care measures may still be inadequate, warranting further study.

Optimising venetoclax treatment in routine clinical practice

Step 1: Patient–doctor discussions to determine treatment choice

When discussing treatment options with the patient and deciding on optimal treatment selection, there are a number of factors that I believe are important to consider:

(i) informed consent; (ii) rationale for selecting venetoclax; (iii) discussion of continuous treatment strategy vs. fixed duration strategy (Venetoclax SmPC, 2018); (iv) potential side effects; (v) safety aspects, e.g. relative safety of 400 mg dose of venetoclax but requirement for a ramp‐up period to avoid TLS; (6) explaining TLS and its associated risk factors and mitigation protocols. For example, in the case of Patient A (Box 1), I would explain to him that he is at high risk for TLS but that there are specific management strategies for someone in his risk category.

Another factor for consideration is in the treatment of elderly patients, where the ramp‐up dose may be viewed as a burden in terms of the need for frequent and potentially prolonged hospital visits. As with patients A and B, once the patient and I have agreed to initiate venetoclax therapy, there are several steps to take, both before and after therapy is started (Boxes 1 and 2). The following sections constitute an example of a week‐by‐week strategy in venetoclax treatment initiation; importantly, this needs to be individualised for each patient, as not all patients will react in the same way. For instance, just because there is no laboratory‐TLS with lower doses does not mean that vigilance should be decreased, as TLS can occur for the first time on subsequent dose escalation.

### Pathophysiology, clinical consequences, and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome [^89f95e63]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome is an oncologic emergency that is characterized by severe electrolyte abnormalities and, frequently, by acute renal failure. The syndrome typically occurs in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies, most often after initiation of treatment. The pathophysiology involves massive tumor cell lysis resulting in the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid. Deposition of uric acid and calcium phosphate crystals in the renal tubules may lead to acute renal failure, which is often exacerbated by concomitant intravascular volume depletion. The kidney normally excretes these products, and consequently preexisting renal failure exacerbates the metabolic derangements of tumor lysis syndrome. Standard treatment aims to clear high plasma levels of potassium, uric acid, and phosphorus; correct acidosis; and prevent acute renal failure by way of aggressive intravenous hydration; lowering serum potassium levels; use of allopurinol; urinary alkalinization; or renal replacement therapy (if necessary). Allopurinol is the standard of care for treating hyperuricemia of malignancy, but is associated with drawbacks. Recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase), which recently became available in the United States, provides a safe and effective alternative to allopurinol for lowering uric acid levels and preventing uric acid nephropathy.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^5497a042]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Because we are now in an era of more effective therapies for CLL, TLS must be anticipated, especially for patients determined as being at high risk. The venetoclax clinical development program provides an example in which principles of risk management were systematically applied to allow for mitigation of TLS risk and continued use of the therapy. Although the overall incidence of TLS is low, optimal patient management is critical to mitigate even the possibility of a fatal event. The possibility of reducing tumor burden with cytotoxic drugs or other biological agents (e.g. monoclonal antibodies, kinase inhibitors) prior to venetoclax therapy, in order to reduce the likelihood of TLS, is now being studied in clinical trials (e.g. NCT02401503 and NCT02427451). However, using the new schedule of venetoclax administration, TLS has become a less common occurrence. With proper dosing and adherence to prophylaxis and monitoring guidelines appropriate for the level of risk of TLS at baseline, current and future CLL therapies can be safely administered with effective disease control.

Introduction

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of TLS, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

TLS is a potentially deadly metabolic oncologic emergency. It most commonly occurs in patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy, but it may also occur in those with solid tumors and in those undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Diagnosis requires clinical suspicion, thorough history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and electrocardiogram. The diagnosis is based on the Cairo-Bishop classification. Patients present with a variety of complications such as electrolyte abnormalities, renal injury, arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and neurological abnormalities such as seizures. ED treatment includes fluid resuscitation, managing electrolyte abnormalities, catalyzing uric acid oxidation with rasburicase, and excluding other life-threatening conditions. Hemodialysis may be necessary.

Conclusion

An understanding of TLS can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

Conclusion

TLS is a potentially life-threatening complication, particularly if it occurs during the treatment of childhood malignancies and particularly those that are lymphoproliferative. Clinicians should be fully aware of the risk factors of TLS and use them to determine the level of risk for each TLS patient with malignant tumors. Such a strategy can aid in early identification, leading to timely treatment and avoidance of death caused by TLS. Clinicians need to pay attention to the possibility of STLS during operation, if surgical procedures are necessary. Patients with high risk of TLS need active pre-operative prophylaxis, including aggressive fluid management and rational use of diuretics and uric-acid-lowering drugs. Furthermore, in the event of severe TLS, prompt CRRT should be considered as a viable option to save the patient.

2.4 Risk Assessment and Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Patients treated with VENCLEXTA may develop tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Refer to the appropriate section below for specific details on management. Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of TLS and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma

VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS can also occur upon resumption of VENCLEXTA following a dosage interruption. See Table 4 and Table 5 for dose modifications of VENCLEXTA after interruption.

The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] < 80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS.

Perform tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g. CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Rasburicase: future directions in tumor lysis management [^aafb1703]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency resulting in several metabolic derangements. Hyperuricemia and its associated complications are the most frequent manifestations of TLS. Crucial to the management is the prompt initiation of a hypouricemic agent such as rasburicase. An established dose of 0.2 mg/kg of rasburicase is effective at decreasing uric acid levels significantly in 4 h of administration and to undetectable levels in 48 h of initiation. The mean uric acid AUC is significantly lower for patients treated with rasburicase when compared to those receiving allopurinol. Rasburicase has demonstrated excellent tolerability and is potentially cost-effective in patients at high risk for TLS. Rasburicase is a safe and effective hypouricemic agent for both adults and children at high risk for TLS and for this reason should be considered the uricolytic agent of choice in these patients.

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric and adult tumor lysis syndrome: an evidence-based review… [^232505c2]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

1Because of the serious and potentially fatal consequences of TLS, an international panel of experts was assembled to develop a set of guidelines for the stratification of patients according to risk, optimal use of prophylactic measures, and implementation of appropriate treatments. Methods Panel Composition Process Overview Literature Review and Data Collection. 16, 17Although occurrences are rare, a literature review revealed 45 case reports of TLS in patients with solid tumors, with a mortality rate of one in three in this patient set. 18Finally, the enrollment demographics of two large international compassionate-use trials evaluating the utility of rasburicase in the initial management of individuals at high risk for the development of TLS suggest that there is a perceived risk in pediatric and adult patients with leukemias and lymphomas, including ALL, AML, chronic myeloid leukemia, CLL, and NHL.

These results suggest rasburicase usage in the initial management of high-risk patients is particularly cost-effective. Management of Hyperuricemia Hydration. 24-26Vigorous hydration is recommended for all patients in the intermediate-to-high risk groups or for those with diagnosed LTLS or CTLS, with the exception of patients presenting with renal failure or oliguria. It is important to attempt to achieve equal fluid intake and urinary output if at all possible. Allopurinol Administration 2every 8 hours orally or 10 mg/kg/d divided every 8 hours. For patients unable to take allopurinol orally, IV administration may be considered, at a dose of 200 to 400 mg/m. 19, 20, 49–51, 57with an average of 3 days observed on the 1, 069-patient compassionate-use trial. 20It is important that uric acid levels be monitored regularly and used as a guide to modulate dosing with rasburicase.

In certain cases, such as in patients experiencing massive tumor lysis, it may be necessary to increase the administration schedule to twice daily. The length of treatment is related to control of plasma uric acid levels, and therefore clinical judgment should be used. Treatment is not necessary when uric acid is extremely low or no longer detectable.
58. Management of Hyperkalemia 5For symptomatic patients, more intense intervention is recommended, such as rapid-acting insulin and glucose infusion.

Pretreatment assessments and prophylactic strategies

Before initiating venetoclax, I carry out specific pretreatment assessments to evaluate patient TLS‐risk and necessary predose prophylactic measures to be implemented, based on the patient's level of risk (Fig 1).

Prophylactic measures can be maintained during the venetoclax dose titration phase, as needed (Fig 2 B) (Venetoclax SmPC, 2018). For example, Patient A is high‐risk for TLS and was admitted for IV fluids, whereas based upon the results of the CT scan for patient B, showing moderately enlarged lymph nodes and ALC of 45 × 10⁹/L, and therefore a medium risk for TLS, she was therefore advised to drink plenty of fluids for two days before starting venetoclax (Box 1).

The importance of multidisciplinary management in the practical considerations during dose‐planning

There is a need to involve and educate the whole clinical team – especially clinical nurse specialists, treating nurses, junior doctors and pharmacists, because they are involved in biochemical monitoring and administering venetoclax – on individual responsibilities for the management of high‐risk TLS patients. The whole team needs to be made aware of the clinical signs of TLS (e.g. increased creatinine levels, risks for seizures, cardiac dysrhythmia) and other side effects, e.g. neutropoenia. Early team‐planning and communication processes need to be in place before venetoclax dose initiation to ensure monitoring of patients during the dose titration phase is managed effectively (especially, but not limited to, results and out‐of‐hours events) and that appropriate staff and beds are available. Ideally, patients should have a baseline blood test the evening before receiving the first dose so that venetoclax can be administered early in the morning. I accept results from laboratories based outside the hospital, provided the laboratory participates in an accredited quality assurance program. Laboratory results mean that we do not have to wait for the results of early‐morning blood work before administering venetoclax, and the eight‐hour blood test can be performed and then reviewed within working hours, as discussed for Patient B (Box 2).

Management approaches for patients at risk of TLS

Tumour lysis syndrome prophylaxis measures within the venetoclax protocol should be followed throughout the dose titration phase (with more intensive measures used to moderate any increase in overall risk) for patients who are considered to be at risk of developing TLS (Fig 2 B) (Venetoclax SmPC, 2018).

Leukostasis is characterized by highly elevated WBC count (usually > 100 x 10^9/L) with decreased tissue perfusion affecting respiratory and CNS function, and although leukapheresis is not typically recommended in routine treatment of patients with high WBC counts, it can be considered with caution in leukostasis unresponsive to other interventions.

Tumor lysis syndrome

Tumor lysis syndrome is more likely with the first dose of cancer treatment and is a potentially life-threatening emergency that can occur either spontaneously or because of cell death from cancer treatments. Tumor lysis syndrome of any grade was reported in 3% of patients in the InO arm compared with 2% of patients receiving standard therapy in the INO-VATE study. Prompt detection and management of tumor lysis syndrome is important to prevent potentially fatal complications such as acute renal failure, arrhythmias, seizures, and death.

Recommendations

Patients receiving InO should be monitored for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome and treated accordingly (Table 4). Cytoreduction before the first InO dose is recommended in patients with > 10,000/mm³ circulating lymphoblasts. In patients who have baseline uric acid levels > 7.5 mg/dl and in patients at high risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome, administration of rasburicase should be considered. Additional preventative measures (e.g. hydration, allopurinol) may also be considered if warranted.

Prolonged QT syndrome

Torsades de pointes, associated with QT prolongation, is a potentially sudden and fatal arrhythmia. Some common medications known to cause QT prolongation include antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. quinidine, procainamide, amiodarone), antibiotics (e.g. macrolides, ketoconazole), antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole), antidepressants (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants), and antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol). In the INO-VATE trial, prolonged QT syndrome of any grade was reported in 2% of patients in the InO group and none of the patients in the standard-therapy group. Although QT prolongation is not commonly associated with InO, it is important to monitor for and attempt to prevent this potentially life-threatening syndrome.

Recommendations

Electrolyte levels and electrocardiogram results should be monitored before starting InO and periodically throughout treatment (Table 4). InO should be used with caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances or a history of prolonged QT syndrome and in recipients of medications known to prolong the QT interval.

How to Treat TLS: Prevention and Management

Assessing patient risk and anticipating TLS when initiating highly effective therapies is key for prevention of clinically relevant TLS [1], [13]. Approaches to preventing TLS include laboratory monitoring, use of uric acid‐reducing drugs, and adequate hydration, and hospitalization should be considered for patients at high risk. Protocols to monitor urine output and fluid balance, electrolytes (potassium, inorganic phosphorus, calcium), creatinine, and uric acid during initial dosing of CLL treatment enable prompt identification and correction of abnormalities in laboratory findings [12]. A number of features factor into the risk of TLS in individual patients: high tumor burden and/or increased tumor turnover enhances the risk of TLS. However, different therapies may be associated with varying risk of TLS owing to tumor sensitivity to different mechanisms of action (e.g. risk of TLS with venetoclax could be higher than with idelalisib or rituximab). Close laboratory monitoring during the period of risk is highly recommended. General guidelines based on tumor burden as well as other factors (e.g. pre‐existing chronic renal insufficiency, oliguria, splenomegaly, dehydration, hypotension, and acidic urine) recommend that patients at high risk of TLS be monitored every 4–6 hours, that those at medium risk be monitored every 8–12 hours after initiation of therapy, and that low‐risk patients be monitored daily [12]. Current available guidelines are based on extensive experience with chemotherapy, and the general recommendation is that patients should continue to be monitored for at least 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy, as long as electrolyte abnormalities have returned (with or without intervention) to normal [14]. Similar monitoring with new targeted agents is important; in particular, during the 5‐week ramp‐up of venetoclax, monitoring laboratory values at 6–8 hours and 24 hours post each first new weekly dose level (20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg daily for weeks 1 through 5, respectively) is recommended [15].

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) management — patients with ALL may be at high risk of developing acute TLS, particularly those with highly elevated WBC counts before induction chemotherapy. Standard prophylaxis for TLS includes hyperhydration with crystalloid IV fluids that do not contain potassium; if urine output remains low after achieving an optimal state of hydration, a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide) may be used to promote diuresis, and urine alkalinization is not recommended. In patients at high risk for TLS, low-intensity initial therapy (corticosteroid monotherapy for 3–7 days) may be used, and allopurinol should be started prior to initiation of chemotherapy for patients with low WBC counts (eg, < 100 × 10⁹/L) and LDH < 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and low tumor burden.

### Clinical and biological advances of critical complications in acute myeloid leukemia [^8262c8b4]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2025). Medium credibility.

Managing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its critical complications requires understanding the complex interplay between disease biology, treatment strategies, and patient characteristics. Complications like sepsis, acute respiratory failure (ARF), hyperleukocytosis, coagulopathy, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and central nervous system (CNS) involvement present unique challenges needing precise evaluation and tailored interventions. Venetoclax-induced TLS and differentiation syndrome (DS) from IDH1/IDH2 or menin inhibitors highlight the need for ongoing research and innovative approaches. As the microbiological landscape evolves and new therapeutic agents emerge, adapting strategies to mitigate harmful pharmacological interactions is crucial. Advances in understanding the genetic profiles of patients with hyperleukocytosis contribute to better-targeted therapeutic strategies. Effective AML management relies on collaborative efforts from hematologists, specialized services, and intensive care units (ICUs). This review analyzes recent data on critical AML complications, identifies areas for further investigation, and proposes ways to advance clinical research and enhance patient care strategies.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) supportive care — Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; however, in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury with unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk. Rasburicase is given as a single dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg; the maximum dose is 6 mg and it should be repeated only if necessary based on laboratory values, and if used, blood samples for uric acid must be placed on ice to avoid spuriously low levels. Hyperkalemia management per Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) removes exogenous potassium sources, with frequent potassium checks (every 4–6 hours), continuous cardiac monitoring, and oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate recommended; glucose plus insulin or beta agonists can be temporizing measures, and calcium gluconate may be used to reduce dysrhythmia risk while awaiting hemodialysis and/or hemofiltration, which most effectively remove potassium. Hyperphosphatemia is managed with a phosphorus-restricted diet and consideration of phosphate binder such as sevelamer; do not use calcium carbonate in patients at risk for TLS, especially if the calcium phosphate product is > 60 mg²/dL². For hypocalcemia, correct hyperphosphatemia and avoid calcium supplementation unless symptomatic with tetany, muscle spasm, or Trousseau/Chvostek signs. Consider hemodialysis/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for worsening renal function when electrolyte abnormalities do not correct with medical management. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### The clinical management of tumour lysis syndrome in haematological malignancies [^6cb2facc]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is caused by the disintegration of malignant cells, usually following the instigation of chemotherapy, although it may already be established at the time of initial presentation in a minority of cases. As a direct consequence of malignant cell breakdown, intracellular ions, proteins, nucleic acids and their metabolites are released into the plasma causing the characteristic metabolic abnormalities of TLS; hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia and hypocalcaemia. In many cases the release of large amounts intracellular contents is so abrupt that the normal homeostatic mechanisms are rapidly overwhelmed and without prompt, effective management, the clinical effects of TLS soon become apparent.

### Tumour lysis syndrome [^185d0c5d]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) represents a critical oncological emergency characterized by extensive tumour cell breakdown, leading to the swift release of intracellular contents into the systemic circulation, outpacing homeostatic mechanisms. This process results in hyperuricaemia (a by-product of intracellular DNA release), hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia and the accumulation of xanthine. These electrolyte and metabolic imbalances pose a significant risk of acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, multiorgan failure and, rarely, death. While TLS can occur spontaneously, it usually arises shortly after the initiation of effective treatment, particularly in patients with a large cancer cell mass (defined as ≥ 500g or ≥ 300g/m² of body surface area in children). To prevent TLS, close monitoring and hydration to improve renal perfusion and urine output and to minimize uric acid or calcium phosphate precipitation in renal tubules are essential. Intervention is based on the risk of a patient of having TLS and can include rasburicase and allopurinol. Xanthine, typically enzymatically converted to uric acid, can accumulate when xanthine oxidases, such as allopurinol, are administered during TLS management. Whether measurement of xanthine is clinically useful to optimize the use of allopurinol or rasburicase remains to be determined.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^f46ec979]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

The NCCN recommends rasburicase for patients with any high‐risk feature (e.g. bulky disease requiring immediate therapy) in whom adequate hydration is not possible or allopurinol is ineffective, or in patients with acute renal failure [4]. Although the schedule of rasburicase was initially recommended as 0.2 mg/kg daily for up to 5 days, subsequent data support a single dose of 0.15–0.2 mg/kg, with a second dose the next day if the uric acid level is not back to within normal range [20]. A single fixed dose of 6 mg rasburicase administered intravenously is also common for lowering uric acid in the management of TLS [21], [22]. Although rasburicase is effective in correcting hyperuricemia, there are no randomized controlled trials showing that it prevents renal failure or death [23], [24]. Patients who are considered candidates for rasburicase, especially those of African or Mediterranean descent, should first be tested for glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because those with a deficiency of the enzyme are at risk for hemolysis and methemoglobinemia.

Alkalinization of the urine is no longer recommended as a management strategy because it may be associated with metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate precipitation [1], [25]. To avoid the risk of nephropathy due to calcium phosphate deposition, treatment of asymptomatic hypocalcemia is generally not recommended. Dialysis should be considered for patients with acute kidney injury who have life‐threatening electrolyte disturbances [1].

The inpatient dose escalation for venetoclax with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) is 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg given only on days 1 to 3, and the intrapatient dose escalation with low-dose cytarabine is 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg given daily on days 1 to 4. Concomitant interacting medications may require changes to these dosages, and to minimize further risk of TLS the Panel recommends aggressive monitoring of blood chemistries, monitoring and managing electrolyte imbalances, and treatment with allopurinol or another uric acid–lowering agent until there is no further risk of TLS.

TLS: prophylaxis and hospitalization practice patterns

Of 134 patients with TLS data, 44.8% were low-risk (n = 60), 35.8% were intermediate risk (n = 48), and 19.4% were high risk (n = 26). Eighty-nine of 131 patients (64.3%) had pre-venetoclax lymph node assessment by CT scan to inform TLS risk. To minimize the occurrence of TLS, allopurinol was used in almost all cases regardless of risk category (93.1% low risk, 87.5% intermediate risk, 100.0% for high risk), as was intravenous normal saline (82.1% low risk, 91.7% intermediate risk, 100.0% high risk). Rasburicase use as TLS prophylaxis varied by risk category: 17.2% of low risk, 31.3% of intermediate risk, and 46.2% of high risk patients. TLS risk stratification, prophylaxis patterns, and incidence are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2.

Most patients had one or more planned hospitalizations during dose escalation regardless of risk category (Online Supplemental Table S2). Twenty-seven patients were not hospitalized at any point, including 20 of 58 (34.5%) low risk patients and 7 of 48 (14.6%) intermediate risk patients. All high-risk patients were hospitalized at least once for TLS monitoring and prophylaxis during the dose escalation phase. Among high-risk patients, 32.0% (n = 8 of 25) were hospitalized for all five dose escalations. The mean number of days hospitalized during the 5-week dose escalation period for low risk, intermediate risk, and high-risk patients were 1.5, 1.7, and 3.1, respectively.

Mitigating for TLS

TLS can be categorised depending on whether it is detectable by changes in metabolic measurements alone ‒ either laboratory‐TLS or, if both metabolic and clinical observations are made, clinical‐TLS (Table II) (Jones et al. 2015). Patients at risk of TLS should be monitored for the development of laboratory‐TLS as a precursor to more severe clinical‐TLS, so they can be managed prophylactically to avoid progression.

Table 2
Laboratory‐ and clinical‐TLS definitions Jones et al. (2015).

To mitigate the risk of laboratory‐TLS, there are several key steps and appropriate interventions that should be used to prevent and manage TLS before venetoclax treatment is started (Coiffier et al. 2008; Cairo et al. 2010; Venetoclax SmPC, 2018). Firstly, patients should undergo evaluation for TLS‐risk factors and, if they are deemed to be at risk, they should be closely monitored in an inpatient or outpatient hospital setting, depending upon the level of risk (Fig 1 A). TLS‐risk management and prophylaxis include intensive oral and IV (intravenous) hydration, as well as administration of anti‐hyperuricaemic agents to manage high uric acid levels (Fig 1 B) (Venetoclax SmPC, 2018).

Optimising CLL treatment to mitigate the risk of TLS

In asymptomatic CLL patients who do not present with the disease at an advanced stage, a 'watch‐and‐wait' approach to treatment on diagnosis is initially adopted, as there is no evidence that treating stable patients leads to a better long‐term outcome (CLL Trialists' Collaborative Group, 1999). However, possible increases in tumour load during the watch‐and‐wait period can lead to a risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is the uncontrolled release of phosphorus, nucleic acids, potassium and inflammatory cytokines, which cause clinically relevant electrolyte and metabolic disturbances, leading to renal insufficiency, seizures and death due to cardiac arrythmias and multiorgan failure. Although it can occur spontaneously, it more commonly occurs after anti‐cancer treatment and is characterised by the rapid lysis of malignant cells and release of their cellular contents into the bloodstream (Howard, 2011).

Risk‐stratification for TLS

Patients with cancer, including haematological malignancy, can be stratified into low‐, intermediate‐ and high‐risk categories for treatment‐related TLS, based on specific risk factors (Jones et al. 2015): (i) tumour burden, (ii) tumour grade and cell turnover rate, (iii) pre‐existing renal impairment or renal involvement by tumour, (iv) age, (v) treatment with highly active cell‐cycle specific agents, (vi) concomitant use of drugs that increase uric acid levels. When risk‐stratifying CLL patients for treatment with venetoclax, it is recommended that their TLS‐risk category is primarily based upon assessment of their tumour burden (measured by lymph node size and blood count) and reduced renal function (measured by creatinine clearance) (Table 1) (Seymour et al. 2018).

### Approach to hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis-inpatient management strategies [^0f3a05b4]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperleukocytosis is defined as a white blood cell count exceeding 100,000/µL and is a critical manifestation of acute and chronic leukemia. It can lead to life-threatening complications such as leukostasis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and tumor lysis syndrome. Leukostasis results from microvascular obstruction by leukemic blasts, causing multisystemic manifestations. Leukostasis is primarily a clinical diagnosis requiring prompt recognition and intervention. Supportive care includes intravenous hydration, uric acid-lowering agents, and cautious blood transfusions to prevent worsening hyperviscosity. Hydroxyurea and cytarabine are used as cytoreductive agents until a definitive diagnosis and management are started. The role of leukapheresis is controversial, and practice patterns differ between clinicians and institutions.

### Urate oxidase for the prevention and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome in children with cancer [^e2ea0f36]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a serious complication of malignancies and can result in renal failure or death. Preliminary reports suggest that urate oxidase is highly effective in reducing serum uric acid. It is uncertain whether high quality evidence exists to support its routine use in children with malignancies.

Objectives

We aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of urate oxidase in the prevention and treatment of TLS in children with malignancies.

Search Strategy

We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009) and CINAHL (1982 to 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) evaluating urate oxidase for the prevention or treatment of TLS in children under 18 years with any malignancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed individual trial quality. We used relative risk (RR) for binary data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.

Main Results

We included five trials, involved 336 patients in the treatment groups and 458 patients in the control groups. One RCT and three CCTs compared urate oxidase and allopurinol. Two trials tested Uricozyme and two tested rasburicase for the prevention of TLS. The RCT showed no significant difference in mortality or renal failure between the treatment and the control groups. The frequency of normalization of uric acid (RR 19.09, 95% CI 1.28 to 285.41) and area under curve of uric acid (MD -201, 95% CI to -258.05 to -143.95) were significantly better in the treatment group. One patient developed hemolysis. One CCT reported significantly lower mortality due to TLS (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89) and lower incidence of renal failure (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.35) in the treatment group. Another CCT found significantly lower uric acid in the treatment group at 72 hours (MD -98.33, 95% CI -170.66 to -26) and 168 hours (MD -103.67, 95% CI -179.00 to -28.34). All included trials are highly susceptible to biases. Another included RCT with 30 patients compared different doses of rasburicase (0.2 mg/kg versus 0.15 mg/kg), which demonstrated similar efficacy in the reduction of uric acid. Adverse events occurred in 20% of patients, including hemolysis, hypersensitivity and anemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Although urate oxidase might be effective in reducing serum uric acid, it is still unclear whether this translates into a reduction in mortality or renal failure. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits of reducing uric acid and uncertain benefits of preventing renal failure or mortality from TLS against the potential risk of adverse effects.

### Tumour lysis syndrome in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with BCL-2 inhibitors: risk factors, prophylaxis, and treatment recommendations [^2f78da9e]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome is a complication of chemotherapy for haematological malignancies; in particular, aggressive leukaemias and lymphomas. For haematological malignancies, targeted therapies, such as small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have a high anti-tumour activity, are well tolerated, and have a low incidence of associated tumour lysis syndrome. The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has a high anti-tumour activity in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, achieving deep remissions by potently inducing apoptosis and increasing the risk for tumour lysis syndrome. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, monitoring, changes in laboratory parameters, and clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome, and the prophylaxis and treatments available for this complication. Prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been implemented as standard of care in patients receiving venetoclax to minimise the risk of both laboratory and clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) — definition, timing, risk factors, and monitoring — TLS is a potentially serious complication of anticancer therapy that is usually observed within 12 to 72 hours after start of chemotherapy; laboratory TLS is defined as a 25% increase in serum uric acid, potassium, or phosphorus or a 25% decrease in calcium levels, and clinical TLS refers to laboratory TLS with clinical toxicity that requires intervention; risk factors include histologies of BL, lymphoblastic lymphoma and occasionally DLBCL, bone marrow involvement, bulky tumors that are chemosensitive, rapidly proliferative or aggressive hematologic malignancies, an elevated leukocyte count or pretreatment LDH, pre-existing elevated uric acid, renal disease, or renal involvement of tumor; TLS prophylaxis should be considered for patients with any of these risk factors, and frequent monitoring of electrolytes and aggressive correction are essential.

### Recognizing, defining, and managing CAR-T hematologic toxicities [^cade4b0c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Autologous CAR-T cell therapy (CAR-T) has improved outcomes for patients with B-cell malignancies. It is associated with the well-described canonical toxicities cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which may be abrogated by corticosteroids and the anti-IL6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. Practitioners and researchers should be aware of additional toxicities. Here we review current understanding and management of hematologic toxicities after CAR-T, including cytopenias, coagulopathies, bleeding and clotting events, hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis, and tumor lysis syndrome. We pay particular attention to cytopenias, recently termed immune effector cell-associated hematological toxicity (ICAHT). While the "H" is silent, hematotoxicity is not: ICAHT has the highest cumulative incidence of all immune adverse events following CAR-T. Early cytopenia (day 0–30) is closely linked to lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CRS-related inflammatory stressors. Late ICAHT (after day 30) can present either with or without antecedent count recovery (e.g., "intermittent" vs "aplastic" phenotype), and requires careful evaluation and management strategies. Growth factor support is the mainstay of treatment, with recent evidence demonstrating safety and feasibility of early granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (e.g., within week 1). In G-CSF refractory cases, autologous stem cell boosts represent a promising treatment avenue, if available. The CAR-HEMATOTOX scoring system, validated for use across lymphoid malignancies (B-NHL, multiple myeloma), enables pretherapeutic risk assessment and presents the potential for risk-adapted management. Recent expert panels have led to diagnostic scoring criteria, severity grading systems, and management strategies for both ICAHT and the recently termed immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome (IEC-HS), now clarified and defined as a distinct entity from CRS.

Step 3: Venetoclax dose titration schedule

When starting the initial venetoclax dose titration of 20 mg daily, patient blood chemistry should be monitored closely, as electrolyte changes indicating TLS can occur as early as 6–8 h following the first dose. Blood chemistry should be monitored following each stepwise dose increase until a dose of 400 mg per day is reached at Week 5, as patients can still be at risk of TLS with subsequent doses (not just the initial dose) (Venetoclax SmPC, 2018). As illustrated in Patient A, even when blood test results remain within the normal range, changes in biochemistry should still be reviewed and may require action, such as extra fluids (Box 1).

Venetoclax dose modifications for TLS

If, following a venetoclax dose, a patient's blood chemistry meets the criteria for TLS (Table II), the following day's dose should be withheld. If their blood biochemistry returns to normal within 24–48 h after their last dose, venetoclax treatment can be resumed at the same dose received prior to TLS occurrence. If the blood chemistry change does not resolve within 48 h, or there is development of clinical‐TLS, venetoclax should be resumed at a lower dose before that week's dose escalation. If dose interruption was necessary for more than one week during the five‐week titration period or for more than two weeks after the end of the titration period, then a given patient's TLS‐risk should be reassessed to determine whether restarting at a reduced venetoclax dose is necessary (Venetoclax SmPC, 2018) (Table III).

### A randomized trial of a single-dose rasburicase versus five-daily doses in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome [^a673cc40]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by hyperuricemia and metabolic derangements. The efficacy of rasburicase, administered daily for 5 days, has been well established. However, the optimal duration of therapy is unknown in adults.

Patients and Methods

We evaluated the efficacy of rasburicase (0.15 mg/kg) administered as single dose followed by as needed dosing (maximum five doses) versus daily dosing for 5 days in adult patients at risk for TLS.

Results

Eighty of the 82 patients enrolled received rasburicase; 40 high risk [median uric acid (UA) 8.5 mg/dl; range, 1.5–19.7] and 40 potential risk (UA = 5.6 mg/dl; range, 2.4–7.4). Seventy-nine patients (99%) experienced normalization in their UA within 4 h after the first dose; 84% to an undetectable level (< 0.7 mg/dl). Thirty-nine of 40 (98%) patients in the daily-dose arm and 34 of 40 (85%) patients in single-dose arm showed sustained UA response. Six high-risk patients within the single-dose arm required second dose for UA > 7.5 mg/dl. Rasburicase was well tolerated; one patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency developed methemoglobinemia and hemolysis.

Conclusions

Rasburicase is highly effective for prevention and management of hyperuricemia in adults at risk for TLS. Single-dose rasburicase was effective in most patients; only a subset of high-risk patients required a second dose.

### Management of tumour lysis syndrome during first-line palliative chemotherapy for high-volume colorectal cancer [^9564436e]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a rare oncological emergency in solid tumours. Because it is associated with bad short-term prognosis, early recognition and treatment are mandatory. This case refers to a middle-aged woman who presented with stage IV colon cancer, with massive hepatic involvement. After three cycles of first-line FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin), she developed acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia that did not respond to standard measures. High suspicion of TLS prompted further corroborating investigations and early intensive care unit admission. With vigorous hydration and allopurinol, TLS completely resolved and the patient was discharged. Prophylaxis of subsequent TLS recurrence was complicated by biopsy-proven neutrophilic vasculitis secondary to allopurinol. Prevention of TLS with hydration and rasburicase was performed prior to each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy. This case report is intended to highlight risk factors for TLS in solid tumours and focus on treatment and secondary prophylaxis of TLS.

### Practical management of tumour lysis syndrome in venetoclax-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^aa7748bf]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Venetoclax has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in defined groups of patients with CLL, although there is the potential for a slightly increased risk of an acute comorbidity, namely TLS. In this report, clinical examples have been shared on how to successfully use venetoclax to take on and treat patients with CLL in the real world, outlining the steps which are taken to mitigate the risk of TLS. In the therapeutic context of both monotherapy, and in combination with rituximab, venetoclax treatment can be optimised through collaborative, appropriate and proactive management of the risk of TLS by the multidisciplinary team to successfully deliver clinical benefit to our patients.
