## Question

What is the area on the dorsal foot between the metatarsals and the tibia/fibula called, especially if there is pain with flexion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the precise anatomical region on the dorsal foot between the metatarsals distally and the tibia/fibula proximally is called, especially when pain there is aggravated by flexion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about exact anatomical localization and standard terminology for that region. Then, I should verify which pathologies typically produce dorsal midfoot pain, especially with flexion or weight-bearing. Next, I will review the radiographic evidence base that characterizes symptomatic midfoot osteoarthritis and related tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint pathology. After that, I need to consider key differentials like Lisfranc injuries, extensor tendinopathy, and forefoot metatarsalgia to avoid mislabeling. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline confirmatory evaluation steps with appropriate imaging and clinical correlation [^112g4eyy] [^1179bwVV].

> Let me first confirm the anatomical localization. The dorsal area situated between the ankle mortise (tibia/fibula) proximally and the metatarsal bases distally corresponds to the midfoot, encompassing the tarsometatarsal (TMT) complex, naviculocuneiform (NC), and talonavicular (TN) joints on the dorsal aspect, which are collectively referred to as the dorsal midfoot region [^112g4eyy].

> Wait, let me verify the standard terminology used in the literature. Studies evaluating foot osteoarthritis consistently define this zone as the midfoot and score OA features on weight-bearing dorsoplantar and lateral radiographs at the first and second cuneometatarsal (CM) joints, the NC joint, and the TN joint, reinforcing that this is indeed the midfoot/TMT region in question [^112g4eyy] [^1177MZwQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should correlate symptoms with mechanics. Pain provoked by foot flexion and weight-bearing commonly reflects dorsal joint compression and shear across the TMT and adjacent midfoot articulations, a pattern frequently seen with symptomatic midfoot osteoarthritis reported in population-based cohorts and clinic samples of older adults with midfoot pain [^112g4eyy] [^113DGuN4] [^1179bwVV].

> I will now examine the radiographic and anatomic pattern typical of midfoot OA to ensure alignment with the clinical picture. Symptomatic midfoot OA most often involves the first and second CM joints, the NC joint, and sometimes the TN joint, all dorsally located between the metatarsal bases and the ankle mortise, with osteophytes and joint space narrowing visible on weight-bearing views, which matches the described location and movement-provoked pain profile here [^112g4eyy] [^1177MZwQ].

> But wait, what if this is actually a Lisfranc injury or extensor tendinopathy? Let me consider differentials that can mimic dorsal midfoot pain. Acute or subacute Lisfranc pathology can localize to the TMT region and deserves exclusion with weight-bearing radiographs looking for diastasis or malalignment, whereas extensor tendinopathy produces dorsal pain more superficially along tendon courses; however, the pattern of flexion-aggravated deep dorsal pain with midfoot loading still most closely fits midfoot OA unless there is a clear traumatic mechanism or focal tendon findings on exam [^112zVYJN] [^1179bwVV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could this be metatarsalgia instead? I should double-check the regional distinction. Metatarsalgia classically refers to plantar forefoot pain under the metatarsal heads, not dorsal midfoot pain, and is therefore anatomically and clinically distinct from the area described here, which is dorsal and proximal to the metatarsal heads, supporting that we are not dealing with forefoot metatarsalgia in this scenario [^112g1nDT] [^117AvMUw].

> Let me think about how best to confirm this at the bedside and with imaging. I should confirm point tenderness over the dorsal TMT joints and reproduce pain with midfoot flexion/extension and weight-bearing, then obtain weight-bearing dorsoplantar and lateral radiographs to assess for midfoot OA features; ultrasound can help if a tendon etiology is suspected, and MRI can delineate cartilage, bone marrow lesions, and adjacent soft tissues when radiographs are equivocal or to evaluate for Lisfranc injury if instability is suspected [^112g4eyy] [^112zVYJN] [^112g1nDT].

> Conclusion: I need to ensure I state this clearly. The anatomical area is the dorsal midfoot/tarsometatarsal region, and given dorsal pain aggravated by flexion and weight-bearing, the most likely diagnosis is symptomatic midfoot osteoarthritis involving the dorsal TMT complex and adjacent midfoot joints, supported by population-based and clinical imaging data of midfoot OA in this precise region [^112g4eyy] [^113DGuN4] [^1179bwVV].

The area on the dorsal foot between the metatarsal heads and the tibia/fibula is the **dorsal midfoot region**, encompassing the tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joints and adjacent dorsal soft tissues [^112g4eyy]. Pain with flexion in this region often indicates **Lisfranc injury**, midfoot osteoarthritis, or extensor tendon pathology [^112zVYJN] [^113DGuN4]. Evaluation should include clinical examination and weight-bearing radiographs [^112g1nDT], with MRI or CT if needed to confirm diagnosis and guide management [^112g1nDT].

## Anatomical structures in the dorsal midfoot region

The **key anatomical structures** of the dorsal midfoot region include:

- **Bones and joints**: Metatarsal bases, cuneiforms, cuboid, navicular, and tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joints [^117VBJhU].

- **Ligaments**: Dorsal tarsometatarsal ligaments, dorsal intercuneiform ligaments, and dorsal cuneonavicular ligaments.

- **Tendons**: Extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and tibialis anterior tendons [^115ee7Rt].

- **Nerves**: Superficial and deep peroneal nerves providing sensory innervation to the dorsal foot.

---

## Clinical significance of pain in the dorsal midfoot region

Pain in the **dorsal midfoot region**, especially on flexion, can indicate several conditions [^1179bwVV]:

| **Clinical condition** | **Description** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Lisfranc injury [^112zVYJN] | Injury to the tarsometatarsal joints or ligaments | - Pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Bruising <br/> - Instability <br/> - Pain with flexion |
| Midfoot osteoarthritis [^113DGuN4] | Degeneration of midfoot joints | - Pain <br/> - Stiffness <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Reduced range of motion <br/> - Pain with flexion |
| Extensor tendonitis [^115ee7Rt] | Inflammation of extensor tendons | - Pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Tenderness <br/> - Pain with flexion |
| Stress fractures [^112g1nDT] | Microfractures in metatarsal bases or tarsal bones | - Pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Tenderness <br/> - Pain with flexion |
| Ganglion cysts [^117VBJhU] | Fluid-filled cysts compressing nerves | - Pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Tenderness <br/> - Pain with flexion |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis of dorsal midfoot pain combines clinical examination and imaging: Clinical examination includes palpation, range-of-motion testing, and specific tests such as the **piano key test** for Lisfranc injuries. Imaging studies include **weight-bearing radiographs** [^112g1nDT], which are essential for the initial evaluation; MRI provides detailed soft-tissue and bone assessment, and CT offers precise bony detail, particularly useful for complex injuries or preoperative planning [^112zVYJN].

---

## Treatment options

In general, **treatment depends on the underlying condition**. Conservative management may include rest, ice, NSAIDs, orthotic devices, physical therapy, and **corticosteroid injections** for inflammatory conditions [^1162gKrT], while **surgical intervention** is reserved for severe or refractory cases, including Lisfranc injuries, advanced osteoarthritis, or persistent ganglion cysts.

---

The dorsal midfoot region is the area on the dorsal foot between the metatarsal heads and the tibia/fibula, and pain with flexion in this region can indicate various clinical conditions. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for **effective management**.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: An educational review [^112g1nDT]. Insights into Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Metatarsalgia, characterized by forefoot pain, is frequent and is primarily due to foot static disorders. Initial evaluation with weight-bearing radiographs is essential, allowing precise analysis of the architecture of the foot. Ultrasound is useful for soft tissue and tendon examination and provides the best clinical correlation. Computed tomography provides detailed bone assessment and is helpful for pre-operative planning. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard modality, offering superior soft tissue contrast.

The common causes of metatarsalgia include hallux pathologies (hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, and sesamoid issues), bursitis (intermetatarsal and subcapitellar), Morton's neuroma, second ray syndrome, stress fractures, and systemic pathologies affecting the foot. Combining clinical and imaging data is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management of metatarsalgia.

Post-traumatic causes of metatarsalgia are beyond the scope of this article and will not be described. Critical relevance statement: Metatarsalgia, the pain of the forefoot, necessitates accurate imaging for diagnosis and management. This review critically assesses imaging techniques and diagnostic approaches, aiming to enhance radiological practice and support effective therapeutic decision-making.

- **Key points**: Metatarsalgia commonly results from foot static disorders, requiring weight-bearing radiographs for assessment. MRI is often the gold standard examination, but ultrasound is complementary, allowing for a radioclinical approach with dynamic examinations. The radiologist is crucial.

### Nafcillin [^116eT1Mk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Susceptibility tests

- **Diffusion techniques**: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One standardized procedure recommended for use with disks to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to nafcillin utilizes the 1 µg nafcillin disk. Interpretation involves correlating the diameter obtained in the disk test with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for nafcillin. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 1 µg nafcillin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

	- A report of "susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited by usually achievable concentrations of the antimicrobial compound in blood.
	- A report of "intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal. If the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.
	- A report of "resistant" indicates that usually achievable concentrations of the antimicrobial compound in the blood are unlikely to be inhibitory, and that alternative therapy should be selected.

### Systemic acidemia impairs cardiac function in critically ill patients [^116CvQLA]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pulse contour (PC) analysis provides continuous information, while transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) offers static measurements used to calibrate the continuous PC parameters. PiCCO™ calibration was performed pre- and post-cold fluid administration, according to institutional practice, by averaging three consecutive thermodilution cardiac output (CO) measurements. Each measurement was obtained by injecting 20 mL of cold 0.9% NaCl. Subsequently, two additional measurements were taken.

By means of transpulmonary thermodilution, the PiCCO™ system calculates CO using the modified Stewart-Hamilton equation, the mean transit time (MTt), and the exponential downslope time (DSt) of the curve. The product of CO and MTt gives the intrathoracic thermal volume (ITTV). The product of CO and DSt provides the pulmonary thermal volume (PTV). The difference between ITTV and PTV is known as the global end-diastolic volume (GEDV), or GEDVI if indexed for body surface area. Multiplying GEDV by 1.25 approximates the intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV).

Stroke volume (SV) is calculated by dividing CO by heart rate. A 'global' ejection fraction (GEF) can be obtained by dividing SV by a quarter of GEDV. Similarly, dividing CO by the preload parameter GEDV provides an indicator of cardiac systolic function, referred to as the cardiac function index (CFI).

### Which diagnostic tests in everyday clinical practice are (not) useful in the management of diabetic foot disease [^115aF9cx]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

This commentary reviews the use of a small number of tests employed in the routine management of foot disease in diabetes. The aim is to consider some of the evidence underlying the use of these tests and the difficulties that can be encountered in interpretation. All tests have their limitations, and it is important for these to be understood by the clinicians who request them. There are few test results that are categorically diagnostic in the field of the diabetic foot, and the majority merely provide supporting evidence for a diagnosis that is either less or more strongly suspected on other grounds.

### Epidemiology of posterior heel pain in the general population: Cross-sectional findings from the Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot [^113CtaWQ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

- **Study design**: Baseline data were obtained from the Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot, a 3-year prospective observational population-based cohort study. In brief, a baseline postal Health Survey questionnaire was sent to all adults aged ≥ 50 years registered at 4 general practices in the North Staffordshire region of England, UK, irrespective of consultation for foot pain. The survey was accompanied by a letter of invitation from the participant's general practitioner and an information leaflet. Consent to participate was implied by the return of the questionnaire. Ethical approval was obtained from the Coventry Research Ethics Committee (reference number 10/H1210/5).

- **Data collection - Posterior HP**: The Health Survey questionnaire contained the filter question, "In the past month, have you had any ache or pain that has lasted for one day or longer in your feet?" Respondents reporting foot ache or pain in the past month were asked to shade the location of their foot ache/pain on a foot manikin showing the dorsal, plantar, and posterior aspects of both feet. The manikins were scored with a transparent overlay, dividing the images of the feet into 26 mutually exclusive areas. Any area with shading was considered to be painful, and any area with no shading was not considered painful. Posterior HP in either foot was defined as reporting foot ache or pain in the past month and shading the posterior heel (area 26) on either foot. Bilateral posterior HP was defined as responding positively to the filter question and shading the posterior heel (area 26) in both feet.

### Metatarsal length does not correlate with maximal peak pressure and maximal force [^111iWsGY]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Primary metatarsalgia of the lesser metatarsals is a common condition caused by mechanical overload of the affected metatarsal heads. Increased metatarsal length is generally believed to be a factor in the development of primary metatarsalgia. However, there is no clear biomechanical evidence supporting this theory.

- **Questions/purposes**: We asked whether metatarsal length correlated with plantar-loading parameters under the corresponding metatarsal heads.

- **Patients and methods**: We prospectively followed two groups of patients: 46 (51 feet) with and 45 (51 feet) without metatarsalgia. Each foot underwent physical examination and standardized full-weightbearing radiography, along with dynamic pedobarography, to assess maximal peak pressure and maximal force under the first, second, and third metatarsal heads. We correlated the relative length of the first and third metatarsals with the corresponding plantar-loading parameters. Additionally, we compared maximal peak pressure and maximal force in patients with metatarsalgia to those of symptom-free patients.

- **Results**: The relative length of the first and third metatarsals did not correlate (r < 0.13) with the maximal peak pressure or maximal force under the corresponding metatarsal heads. Maximal force under the first metatarsal head was decreased in the metatarsalgia group, while there was no difference in maximal peak pressure between the metatarsalgia and nonmetatarsalgia groups.

- **Conclusions**: Relative metatarsal length had no influence on plantar-loading parameters. Shortening of a symptomatic ray to decrease plantar-loading parameters cannot be justified based on this study.

### Painful legs and moving toes syndrome evaluated through brain single photon emission computed tomography: a case series [^116f4NkJ]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Painful legs and moving toes (PLMT) syndrome is a clinical entity characterized by persistent pain in the feet or legs and involuntary movements of one or more toes. The precise patho-mechanisms of PLMT still remain unknown. Herein, we examined ten patients clinically identified with PLMT syndrome. All patients first presented persistent pain prior to the onset of motor symptoms. Each patient was examined by neurological investigation, neuroimaging methods including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrophysiological methods. The brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of eight patients indicated hypoperfusion of frontal lobes and cerebellum.

The conjunction analysis of brain SPECT imaging data of all eight patients using the 3D-SSP program, compared to 34 controls, indicated significant hypoperfusion in the prefrontal cortical, occipital cortical, cerebellar surfaces, and thalamus. There was also hyperperfusion in the surface of the anterior cingulate gyrus and parietal cortices, including primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, bilaterally. These areas reflected a part of the pain matrix. Other electrophysiological examinations did not indicate specific abnormalities to explain the patients' symptoms.

On treatment with clonazepam, four out of nine patients could resolve their foot-related motor symptoms, but not the sensory symptoms. Overall, their pain was an intractable and persistent symptom throughout their clinical course. Our study infers that PLMT syndrome is fundamentally a chronic pain disorder, possibly relating to the central nervous system.

### Impaired bone microarchitecture at distal radial and tibial reference locations is not related to injury site in athletes with bone stress injury [^112LSeTG]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Comparison of HR-pQCT parameters according to the most prevalent specific anatomic BSI sites showed no significant differences among anatomic sites, except for significantly lower distal tibial trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) in patients with a BSI in the femoral neck compared with the sacrum (P = 0.042).

- **HR-pQCT results**: Comparison of distal radius and distal tibial HR-pQCT parameters among the four most common bone stress injury sites. The horizontal dashed line indicates the median of the reference. Ct. Ar refers to cortical area; Ct.BMD, cortical bone mineral density; Ct. Th, cortical thickness; FN, femoral neck; MT, metatarsal; Sa, sacrum; Tb. Ar, trabecular area; Tb.BMD, trabecular bone mineral density; Tb.N, trabecular number; Tb. Th, trabecular thickness; Ti, tibia; Tt.BMD, total bone mineral density.

Investigation of potential differences in aBMD and bone microarchitecture parameters between individuals who had a BSI in a cortical-rich or trabecular-rich site showed no differences. Lastly, when comparing athletes with the first diagnosis of a BSI versus those with a positive medical history of BSI, no significant differences in DXA or HR-pQCT parameters were detected.

### An early Cretaceous enantiornithine (Aves) preserving an unlaid egg and probable medullary bone [^112jYVAp]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

The femur is nearly straight with a posterior trochanter excavating its proximomedial surface, as in other enantiornithines. The patellar groove is very weakly developed. The tibiotarsus is fully fused such that the ascending process of the astragalus cannot be discerned and forms a raised surface in Qiliania. The proximocaudal surface bears two tubercles previously interpreted as the facies articularis lateralis and popliteal tubercle in pengornithids. Proximomedial excavation is probably a diagenetic artifact. The fibular crest is short, comprising 14% of the length of the tibiotarsus, and is located well distal to the proximal articular surface. The distal condyles are large, round, and contact medially. The medial surface of the medial condyle is nearly flat, though it is concave in Qiliania. Only a fragment of the left fibula is preserved.

The distal tarsals are fully fused to the metatarsals, which are co-planar and unfused throughout their lengths. Metatarsal III is the longest; metatarsal IV is longer than II, which terminates level with the proximal end of the metatarsal III trochlea. Metatarsal II has a tubercle for the attachment of the m. tibialis cranialis located one-fifth from the proximal end on the craniolateral surface, contacting metatarsal III. A deep intertrochlear incision is present between metatarsals II and III, probably resultant from post-mortem plantar displacement of metatarsal II. The metatarsal II trochlea is angled so that the medial margin is proximal to the lateral margin, and the trochlear condyles are only weakly separated. The trochlea of metatarsal IV is reduced.

### Structural foot characteristics in people with midfoot osteoarthritis: Cross-sectional findings from the Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot [^112g4eyy]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

This study uses baseline data from a population-based prospective observational cohort study, the Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot. The study protocol is described in detail elsewhere. Adults aged 50 years and older registered with four general practices in Staffordshire, United Kingdom, were invited to participate.

All eligible participants were mailed a health survey questionnaire to gather information on demographic and social characteristics and general health. In the United Kingdom, over 95% of people are registered with general practices, thus providing a convenient general population sample. Those who reported pain in and around the foot in the past 12 months and provided written consent to further contact were invited to attend a research clinic in which weightbearing, dorsoplantar, and lateral radiographs of both feet were obtained.

The location of foot pain in the last 4 weeks was ascertained from shading a foot manikin (©The University of Manchester 2000. All rights reserved). The period of 4 weeks was used because this was a part of the validated instrument to ensure it was recent midfoot pain. Ethical approval was obtained from Coventry Research Ethics Committee (reference number: 10/H1210/5). Participants provided written informed consent to participate and were asked to consent to the review of their medical records by the research team.

- **Midfoot case definition**: Symptomatic, radiographic midfoot OA was defined as (1) a radiographic score of 2 or more for osteophytes or joint space narrowing on either weightbearing dorsoplantar views or lateral views.

### Sesamoids and accessory ossicles of the foot: anatomical variability and related pathology [^116CrkzR]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

- **Accessory navicular**: There are three reported types based on morphology. Type I (30%) is an oval or round sesamoid located within the distal posterior tibial tendon and may be separated up to 5 mm from the navicular tuberosity. Type II is the most common variant (50%) and is known as the os naviculare. It is a triangular or heart-shaped unfused accessory ossification center, separated from the tuberosity by a 1–2 mm wide synchondrosis. Type III (20%) is a prominent tuberosity, thought to be a fused type II accessory navicular bone. The accessory navicular bone is the second most common accessory bone of the foot, with reported prevalence from 2 to 21%. It is bilateral in 50% of cases and is best seen on an AP radiograph of the foot. Of the three variations, type II is most commonly symptomatic.

- **Os intermetatarseum**: This ossicle is most commonly located between the first and second metatarsal. Radiographic studies report a prevalence of 1–7%, while anatomical studies demonstrate a higher prevalence of up to 13%. It is best visualized on an AP foot radiograph and usually appears oval or round, but may also be spindle-shaped and attached to a metatarsal. Although this ossicle rarely has associated pathology, its location may cause it to be confused with a fracture of the second metatarsal, such as in Lisfranc injuries. Lack of a donor site, soft tissue swelling, and osseous malalignment may help differentiate this normal variant from a fracture.

### Injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults [^1162gKrT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Plantar heel pain, commonly resulting from plantar fasciitis, often results in significant morbidity. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), orthoses, physical therapy, physical agents (e.g. extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), laser), and invasive procedures, including steroid injections.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, clinical trials registries, and conference proceedings. The latest search was conducted on 27 March 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of plantar heel pain in adults were eligible for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, in which case a random-effects model was considered. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included a total of 39 studies (36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 quasi-RCTs) that involved a total of 2492 adults. Most studies were small (median = 59 participants). Participants' mean ages ranged.

### Resolution of the three dimensional structure of components of the glomerular filtration barrier [^113GKvQd]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Filtration of fluid and solutes in the kidney occurs through the renal glomerulus, a structure in the renal cortex consisting of a knot of microvessels sitting between afferent and efferent arterioles (Figure 1). The glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) retains most of the plasma proteins (e.g. albumin) in the vasculature, allowing the filtration of all small solutes while maintaining the colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma, thus enabling fluid retention in the rest of the body.

The GFB has classically been described as consisting of three layers: the podocyte foot processes, the basement membrane, and the fenestrated endothelium. However, in recent years, two additional layers of the GFB have been recognized. On the vascular side, a fine meshwork of glycosaminoglycans covers the endothelial layer, including the fenestrations. This glycocalyx contributes to the permeability properties of the GFB. On the urinary side of the GFB, the fluid can pass across the filtration slits into an area under a podocyte cell body called the subpodocyte space (SPS). This area is bounded by the podocyte cell body on one side and the podocyte foot processes on the other.

Along with the SPS, there are two further types of urinary space: the interpodocyte space (IPS), between podocyte cell bodies, and the peripheral urinary space (PUS), between the glomerular edge and the walls of the glomerular capsule. Narrow exit pores between the SPS and IPS and the PUS restrict flow away from the GFB.

### Investigations of potential phenotypes of foot osteoarthritis: Cross-sectional analysis from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^116ja3Ye]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

The identification of a subgroup with isolated first MTP joint involvement frequently occurring in isolation suggests that some individuals have a specific predilection for the development of OA in this joint, possibly as a result of altered foot structure or inappropriate footwear. Cross-sectional studies have reported characteristic variations of skeletal morphology in two conditions commonly associated with first MTP joint OA: hallux valgus and hallux rigidus. Although we found no significant differences in the prevalence of hallux valgus between the three subgroups, the role of other structural characteristics, such as variation in metatarsal length, cannot be discounted.

Although non-statistically significant, there was a slight increase in the probability that individuals had worn high- or very high-heeled shoes between the ages of 20 and 49 years, which is consistent with a previous study that found high-heeled footwear to be specifically associated with disorders of the forefoot and toes. However, while the proportion reporting they had worn narrow-toed footwear was higher in the isolated first MTP joint OA than in the no or minimal foot OA subgroup, it was lowest in the polyarticular foot OA subgroup.

Multiple joint involvement and symmetry were observed in both the isolated first MTP joint and polyarticular foot OA subgroups. However, those in the polyarticular foot OA subgroup had wider joint involvement, which also included the first MTP joint. This suggests a stronger influence of systemic risk factors and could be indicative of a generalized susceptibility to OA development.

### Freiberg's disease in the emergency department [^112KC8Qq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Freiberg's disease is an avascular necrosis affecting the second, third, or, rarely, the fourth metatarsal head. It is typically a chronic, progressive process, eventually causing pain and loss of normal function of the metatarsophalangeal joint. Normally, patients present to the emergency department with atraumatic foot pain; however, as we illustrate with this case, an acute fracture may occur, requiring recognition and appropriate treatment. Our patient presented with acute pain, swelling, and point tenderness of the forefoot following a minor fall. Radiographs revealed a fracture through the head of the second metatarsal and underlying avascular necrosis consistent with Freiberg's disease. Identifying the underlying chronic process was important in understanding how minor trauma resulted in a fracture in this patient.

### Regranex [^111VoDe4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of Regranex in healing diabetic lower extremity ulcers was evaluated in four randomized controlled studies. These studies assessed the incidence of and time to complete healing for 922 subjects, of which 478 received either Regranex 0.003% or 0.01%. All participants had lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers extending into the subcutaneous tissue or beyond, as classified by Stages III and IV of the International Association of Enterostomal Therapy guide to chronic wound staging. A substantial 93% of subjects had foot ulcers, while the remaining 7% had ulcers on the ankle or leg. Each diabetic ulcer had persisted for at least 8 weeks and demonstrated adequate blood supply (TcpO₂ > 30 mm Hg). In these trials, 95% of the ulcers measured up to 10 cm² in area, with the median ulcer size at baseline ranging from 1.4 cm² to 3.5 cm².

All treatment groups underwent a program of good ulcer care that included initial complete sharp debridement, a non-weight-bearing regimen, systemic treatment for any wound-related infections, and moist saline dressings changed twice daily. Additional debridement was performed as necessary. Regranex 0.003% or 0.01%, or a placebo, was applied once a day and covered with a saline-moistened dressing. The gel was rinsed off gently after approximately 12 hours, with a saline-moistened dressing re-applied for the remainder of the day. Subjects received treatment until complete healing or for up to 20 weeks. Subjects were considered a treatment failure if they did not achieve complete healing within the study period.

### Prevalence of foot pain across an international consortium of population-based cohorts [^112v2zhk]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Low credibility.

This is the first study to use original data to compare the prevalence of foot pain across multiple international populations. The prevalence of foot pain ranged from 13% in the Chingford 1000 Women Study to 18% in the North West Adelaide Health Study, 21% in the Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot, 25% in the Framingham Foot Study, and 36% in the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project. The study highlights the differences in foot pain across age, sex, BMI, and race while considering differences in the case definitions used for variables, which is a vital consideration when combining or comparing data across multiple data sets.

In cohorts that included both men and women, the prevalence of foot pain was consistently higher in women. This difference has been widely reported, with a suggested partial attribution to lifetime footwear habits, although other factors such as occupation and family history are also thought to contribute. Women are more likely than men to report musculoskeletal pain in general, and consideration should also be given to sex-related variations in pain perception, hormonal influences, and psychological and social factors. However, the role of other potential sex differences, such as occupation or physical activity levels, is currently unknown. The overall prevalence of foot pain was actually lowest in the Chingford 1000 Women Study, which included only women. While unknown factors such as comorbidities may play a role, this is likely due to the case definition used for foot pain.

### Therapeutic footwear for the neuropathic foot: An algorithm [^115pxM4W]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Neuropathy may bring about changes in the form and function of the foot, which can lead to ulceration and progressive deformity. These manifestations often require specially adapted footwear. At the time of writing, a comprehensive concept addressing the medical, functional, and technical requirements for this type of footwear is still lacking. In this article, we present an algorithm designed to facilitate the prescription and manufacture of adequate shoes. This algorithm attempts to establish a link between the requirements from a medical and functional perspective and the technical possibilities of orthopedic shoe technology.

### Odefsey [^113YG9tY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to drug components of Odefsey are compared with a U.S. background major birth defect rate. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. The MACDP population is not disease-specific, evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks gestation.

- **Emtricitabine (FTC)**: Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 5,400 exposures to FTC-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 3,900 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,500 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2.6% (95% CI: 2.2% to 3.2%) and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.9% to 3.7%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to FTC-containing regimens.

### Investigations of potential phenotypes of foot osteoarthritis: Cross-sectional analysis from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^1177MZwQ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

The Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot (CASF) is a prospective observational cohort study. All adults aged ≥ 50 years registered with four general practices in North Staffordshire, UK, were mailed a health survey questionnaire, irrespective of any foot-related health care consultation. Responders to the health survey reporting pain in or around the foot within the last year and who consented to further contact were invited to attend a research clinic. A flowchart showing the recruitment of participants to the CASF study has been published previously.

All participants provided written informed consent. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Coventry Research Ethics Committee (reference number 10/H1210/5).

- **Scoring of foot radiographs**: At the research clinics, weight-bearing dorsoplantar and lateral radiographs were taken separately of each foot, according to a standardized protocol. A single experienced reader (MM), who had undergone a period of training, scored five joints in each foot (first MTP joint, first and second CM joints, NC joint, and TN joint) for osteophytes and JSN (range 0–3) according to a published atlas. The joints examined were selected based on their inclusion in the published radiographic foot atlas, which had determined that they were the most commonly affected, clearly visible on dorsoplantar and lateral views, and could be reliably scored. Sixty randomly selected radiographs were rescored after 8 weeks (by MM) to assess intrarater reliability and were scored by a second experienced reader (HBM).

### Current clinical concepts: Conservative management of Achilles tendinopathy [^115EjuLF]. Journal of Athletic Training (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Achilles tendinopathy, specifically addressing history and physical examination, the AT-EG 2020 guidelines recommend performing a physical examination to elicit the following:

- **Pain assessment**: Pain on palpation of the tendon and a subjective report of pain in the midportion (2–6 cm above the calcaneal insertion) are crucial for diagnosing midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

- **Location of pain**: Distinguishing between an insertional or midportion injury requires precise identification of pain location. Greater pain on palpation anterior to the tendon, as opposed to in the tendon itself, suggests posterior ankle impingement or os trigonum syndrome. The differential diagnosis for posterior ankle pain also includes acute Achilles tendon rupture, accessory soleus muscle, sural nerve irritation, fat-pad irritation, and systemic inflammatory disease.

- **Arc sign**: Palpation of the tendon to identify thickened nodules helps confirm midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

- **Royal London Hospital test**: Pinching the tendon to identify the most symptomatic location with the foot at rest aides in confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

### Creating new guidelines on how best to treat foot symptoms in people with EB [^113j3EeV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a complex, rare condition that affects the skin and many parts of the body. Those born with EB have skin so fragile that they are called 'butterfly children'; their skin is as delicate as the wing of a butterfly. In the UK, it is estimated that there are more than 5,000 people living with EB, and 500,000 worldwide. Little clinical guidance for care existed until DEBRA International started a program to develop clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There were no previous guidelines and few published studies on foot care in EB, so treatment decisions were largely based on individual opinion and experience.

The panel — comprising clinical experts and people living with EB from Australia, the UK, and the United States — aimed to describe foot problems in people of all ages with EB and summarize evidence and management strategies. They used a logical podiatric (foot) care literature review focused on patients with EB. The authors found that the evidence in this area was limited, but several interventions currently practiced by podiatrists show positive outcomes. This study allowed the group to make recommendations on how to treat foot and nail disorders in patients with EB. Furthermore, the authors concluded that further research is needed. This is a summary of the study: Foot care in epidermolysis bullosa: evidence-based guideline.

### The Charcot foot: a pictorial review [^112LjyG2]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Charcot foot refers to an inflammatory pedal disease based on polyneuropathy; the detailed pathomechanism of the disease is still unclear. Since the most common cause of polyneuropathy in industrialized countries is diabetes mellitus, the prevalence in this risk group is very high, up to 35%. Patients with Charcot foot typically present in their fifties or sixties and most of them have had diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years. If left untreated, the disease leads to massive foot deformation. This review discusses the typical course of Charcot foot disease including radiographic and MR imaging findings for diagnosis, treatment, and detection of complications.

### Estro clinical practice guideline: Stereotactic body radiotherapy for spine metastases [^115xZnEZ]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2024). High credibility.

For patients with bone metastasis, specifically those with spine metastasis, the ESTRO 2024 guidelines recommend positioning patients with vertebral metastases of solid malignancies undergoing SBRT in a reproducible supine position. It is advised to use patient-specific rigid fixation, such as a thermoplastic head and neck mask, above the cervical-thoracic junction like the 4th thoracic vertebra and above. Below the cervical-thoracic junction, either employ near-rigid body immobilization or use no immobilization combined with intra-fraction positional verification or spine tracking.

### Photofrin [^1171GbJK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

To calculate the light dose, the following specific light dosimetry equation applies for all fiber optic diffusers. Table 2 provides the settings that will be used to deliver the dose within the shortest time (light intensity of 270 mW/cm). A second option (light intensity of 200 mW/cm) has also been included where necessary to accommodate lasers with a total capacity that does not exceed 2.5 W.

Note: No more than 1.5 times the required diffuser power output should be needed from the laser. If more than this is required, the system should be checked.

Short fiber diffusers (2.5 cm) are to be used to pretreat nodules with 50 J/cm of diffuser length prior to regular balloon treatment in the first laser light session or for the treatment of skip areas (i.e. an area that does not show sufficient mucosal response) after the first light session. For this treatment, the fiber optic diffuser is used without a centering balloon, and a light intensity of 400 mW/cm should be used. For nodule pretreatment and treatment of skipped areas, care should be taken to minimize exposure to normal tissue as it is also sensitized. Table 3 lists appropriate fiber optic power outputs and treatment times using a light intensity of 400 mW/cm.

### Is use of BMP-2 associated with tumor growth and osteoblastic differentiation in murine models of osteosarcoma [^113i6qou]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Low credibility.

The putative benefit of rhBMP-2 is in the setting of limb reconstruction using structural allografts, whether it be allograft-prosthetic composites, osteoarticular allografts, or intercalary segmental grafts. There are also potential advantages in augmenting osseointegration of uncemented endoprosthetics and in reducing infection. Recombinant human BMP-2 might mitigate nonunion in structural allograft-augmented osteosarcoma limb salvage surgery; however, its use is limited because of concerns about the pro-oncogenic effects of the agent.

- **Questions/purposes**: (1) To assess if BMP-2 signaling influences osteosarcoma cell line growth. (2) To characterize the degree of osteosarcoma cell line osteoblastic differentiation in response to BMP-2. (3) To assess if BMP-2 signaling has a consistent effect on local or systemic tumor burden in various orthotopic murine models of osteosarcoma.

- **Methods**: In this study, 143b, SaOS-2, and DLM8-M1 osteosarcoma cell lines were transfected with BMP-2 cDNA controlled by a constitutive promoter (experimental) or an empty vector (control) using a PiggyBac transposon system. Cellular proliferation was assessed using a quantitative MTT colorimetric assay. Osteoblastic differentiation was compared between control and experimental cell lines using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of the osteoblastic markers connective tissue growth factor, Runx-2, Osterix, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin. Experimental and control cell lines were injected into the proximal tibia of either NOD-SCID (143b and SaOS-2 xenograft model) or C3H (DL…

### The role of foot pressure measurement in the prediction and prevention of diabetic foot ulceration-a comprehensive review [^113orCgK]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Plantar offloading interventions for the at-risk foot

In clinical practice, offloading interventions such as footwear and insoles are commonly prescribed to reduce high plantar pressure in an attempt to heal or prevent diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). The main purpose of such interventions is to reduce plantar pressure at an active DFU or areas at risk of developing a DFU by transferring pressure to other foot regions or to the offloading device.

As discussed in previous sections, plantar pressure is lower in-shoe than in barefoot conditions. Therefore, in an attempt to prevent ulceration, custom-made therapeutic footwear is commonly prescribed to offload the foot regions of interest; however, ulcerations may still occur while wearing such footwear. Although offloading high plantar pressures is the main aim of footwear prescription, the measurement of plantar pressure often does not play a role in footwear design and manufacturing. Instead, clinical judgment and foot shape are taken into account, which vary in method, in addition to a wide variety of materials being used. Therefore, due to large variability within both research and clinical practice, there are no standardized protocols, and so footwear development is often described as more of an art than a science.

### Epidemiology of posterior heel pain in the general population: Cross-sectional findings from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^111dagqf]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Foot pain is a common symptom in the general population, particularly in older adults. The prevalence in adults aged ≥ 18 years ranges from 17% to 24%, rising to as high as 42% in adults aged > 65 years. Three-quarters of older adults with foot pain experience disabling pain affecting them on most days, and foot pain is also linked to problems with mobility and gait in this age group, with an increased risk of falling.

- **Significance & innovations**: Although the prevalence of foot pain has been well reported, the contribution of the posterior heel to this prevalence is less clear. Previous studies have reported pain by area of the foot, but in these, the heel is reported as a single region rather than by precise anatomic site. Pain in specific anatomic areas of the foot is often attributed clinically to specific conditions; therefore, observing pain at a specific site can provide greater insights into the underlying pathology.

The etiology of posterior heel pain (HP) is largely related to disorders of the Achilles tendon and associated structures and varies by age and location. In children and adolescents, the most common cause is calcaneal apophysitis (Sever's disease). In adults, midportion posterior HP is likely to represent Achilles tendinopathy, whereas insertional pain may occur due to Haglund's deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, or enthesitis.

Previous studies have reported the incidence of specific posterior heel pathologies, but the population prevalence of posterior HP is unknown. De Jonge et al. note an incidence rate of specific conditions.

### Investigations of potential phenotypes of foot osteoarthritis: Cross-sectional analysis from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^1134R6nB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Several methodological strengths and limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings in this article. This analysis included participants recruited from the general population who reported having foot pain in the previous year; therefore, a wide range of foot pain and radiographic severities were present. A standardized radiographic protocol was used to obtain weight-bearing views, so JSN was appropriately assessed, and multiple planes captured OA features, which have been noted to vary on different views. However, in this analysis, only 5 joints in each foot were examined. It is possible that other foot joints may be affected by OA and contribute to the patterning and subgroups observed.

Intrarater reliability for the presence of OA was found to be excellent. Despite interrater reliability being moderate, it was comparable with the original atlas. Although the study population had a prevalence of OA in 1 or more foot joints of 63%, when multiple foot joints were examined, the numbers in some of the combinations were quite small. This is likely to have reduced the statistical power, potentially leading to type II error. Additionally, although all individuals in the study had reported having foot pain in the last year, the latent classes of foot OA were based only on radiographic structural changes. As discordance between symptoms and structural changes are often seen, further investigation characterizing polyarticular foot OA and first MTP joint OA in relation to symptomatic radiographic disease is needed.

### Evenity [^111DnUen]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Preparation and administration instructions:

- **Step 1: Prior to administration**: Remove two syringes from the carton. Visually inspect EVENITY for particles and discoloration prior to administration. EVENITY is a clear to opalescent, colorless to light yellow solution. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or discolored or contains particles. Do not use the syringe if any part appears cracked or broken, the gray needle cap is missing or not securely attached, the expiration date printed on the label has passed, or the syringe has been dropped on a hard surface. Always hold the prefilled syringe by the syringe barrel to remove the syringe from the tray. Do not grasp the plunger rod or the gray needle cap. Do not remove the gray needle cap until you are ready to inject. Allow EVENITY to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. Do not warm in any other way.

- **Step 2: Select the injection site and prepare the syringe**: Prepare and clean two injection sites, one for each of the two injections. The recommended subcutaneous injection sites include the thigh, abdomen (except for a two-inch area right around the navel), and the outer area of the upper arm. Clean the injection sites with alcohol wipes and let the skin dry. Choose a different site each time you give an injection. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

### Diagnostic performance of computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion tissue time-to-maximum in vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113EGbiL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The advantage of automated perfusion software, as used here, is the standardization of quantitative perfusion measurements, which eliminates user-dependent qualitative interpretation of CTP maps. However, the use of these programs in settings other than acute ischemia has not been well studied, including for vasospasm prediction using more contemporary paradigms such as automated T max at penumbral delay thresholds. Despite the lack of supporting data, in our experience, the use of these programs and T max has proliferated to include clinical scenarios such as aSAH.

Prior studies have demonstrated good predictive value of qualitative CTP for DSA-confirmed vasospasm. For example, they have shown high correlation between qualitatively assessed MTT and DSA scores, as well as CTP- and DSA-derived cerebral circulation times, defined as the difference in time to peak between an arterial territory region of interest and the superior sagittal sinus. In a prior meta-analysis of CTP studies in patients with aSAH, cerebral blood flow and MTT were identified as having the highest diagnostic accuracy for vasospasm; however, T max was not included in this analysis. Unlike MTT, T max maps are obtained following deconvolution of an automated or user-defined proximal arterial input function from the tissue time-attenuation course to isolate a hypothetical tissue impulse response, providing an estimation of macrovascular delay while removing confounds related to the bolus injection or to more proximal (e.g. extracranial) sources of delay.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: An EANM evidence-based guidance [^116qpt5D]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetes-related foot disease is a global problem. Various types of foot lesions can occur in diabetic patients, usually as a consequence of diabetes-related peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease, or both. These two factors lead to foot ulcers that may be caused by repetitive stress, development of foot deformities, micro-traumas, areas of high pedal pressure, excessive load, and imbalance. Diabetes also frequently causes various, but mostly ill-defined, immunological perturbations. These, in the setting of a break in the protective skin envelope, often lead to the development of infection in the wound. This event, especially in the presence of vascular impairment — which limits the migration of phagocytic cells and delivery of antibiotic therapy — dramatically complicates the management of foot complications.

The prevalence of active foot ulcers in persons with diabetes is about 6.3%, with rates of 5.5% in Asia, Europe, and Africa, and 13% in North America. Approximately a quarter of all persons with diabetes will, at some point during their lifetime, develop a foot ulcer. These ulcers are the seeding point for the development of potentially serious infectious complications, starting with soft tissue infection (STI) and in many cases spreading to underlying bone, thus causing osteomyelitis (OM).

The classical clinical symptoms used to define STI (with or without concomitant OM) are redness, warmth, swelling, pain and/or tenderness, and purulent secretions, usually in the setting of a foot wound or ulcer.

### Anatomical location of erosions at the metatarsophalangeal joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^117XrEEP]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Ethics approval was received from the Leeds (West) Research Ethics Committee, and written consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from all participants. Consecutive patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and presenting to the specialist rheumatology foot clinic at Chapel Allerton Hospital with forefoot plantar MTP joint pain were invited to take part in the study. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of multiple morbidities, including diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and other inflammatory arthropathies, a history of forefoot surgery, or contraindications to having an MRI or intravenous contrast.

- **Imaging**: The more symptomatic forefoot was imaged using a 3T Verio scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany); MRI acquisition protocols and images are available at Rheumatology Online. Images were scored for bone erosion at each MTP joint using the RA MRI scoring (RAMRIS) system defined by the OMERACT group. MRI bone erosion is defined as a sharply marginated bone lesion, with correct juxta-articular localization, visible in two planes with a cortical break seen in at least one plane.

The base of the proximal phalanx and the head of the metatarsal (1 cm from the articular surface) were divided into quadrants to determine the location of erosions in the dorsal-medial, dorsal-lateral, plantar-medial, and plantar-lateral regions. MRIs were read by two experienced consultant musculoskeletal radiologists (R.J.H. and A.J.G.), and consensus was reached for the RAMRIS system score.

Emtricitabine (FTC):

Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 6,500 exposures to FTC-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 4,800 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,700 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.5% to 3.4%) and 2.8% (95% CI: 2.1% to 3.7%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to FTC-containing regimens.

Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF):

Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 1,200 exposures to TAF-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1000 exposed in the first trimester and over 200 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 3.9% (95% CI: 2.8% to 5.2%) and 4.8% (95% CI: 2.5% to 8.3%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to TAF-containing regimens.

Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. The MACDP population is not disease-specific, evaluates individuals and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks gestation.

### Nucynta [^1119QvwW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Nucynta tablets in treating acute pain have been established through two randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies focusing on moderate to severe pain from first metatarsal bunionectomy and end-stage degenerative joint disease.

- **Orthopedic surgery – Bunionectomy**: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study demonstrated the efficacy of 50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg Nucynta tablets. These were administered every 4 to 6 hours for 72 hours in patients aged 18 to 80 years experiencing moderate to severe pain following unilateral, first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery. Patients qualified for the study with a baseline pain score of ≥ 4 on an 11-point rating scale ranging from 0 to 10 and were randomized to one of five treatments. Patients were allowed to take a second dose of study medication as soon as 1 hour after the first dose on study Day 1, with subsequent dosing every 4 to 6 hours. If rescue analgesics were required, the patients were discontinued for lack of efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing the sum of pain intensity difference over the first 48 hours (SPID48) versus placebo. Nucynta tablets at each dose provided a greater reduction in pain compared to placebo based on SPID48 values.

For various degrees of improvement from baseline to the 48-hour endpoint, Figure 1 illustrates the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figures are cumulative, so every patient who achieves a 50% reduction in pain from baseline is included in each subsequent level.

### Metatarsalgia [^117AvMUw]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Metatarsalgia (i.e. metatarsal pain) is one of the most common reports in patients with foot problems. This pain is confined to the area across the plantar forefoot, including the second through fourth metatarsal heads. Frequently, it is accompanied by deformity of the first and fifth rays as well as of the toes. There is great variability in possible causative factors, all seemingly related to gait mechanics, foot anatomy, and foot and ankle deformity. An individualized treatment protocol is required. Nonsurgical management is usually sufficient to achieve satisfactory results. Surgical correction must be precise, with all pain-producing deformities corrected. Most patients present with abnormalities of the distal metatarsals. Metatarsal osteotomy, long a staple of treatment, always fails in the long term. Improved equipment and internal fixation methods may lead to better long-term outcomes.

### Common foot fractures [^112zVYJN]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Foot fractures account for about one-third of lower extremity fractures in adults. They are typically caused by a crush injury or an axial or twisting force on the foot. Patients usually present with bony point tenderness and swelling of the affected area. Weight-bearing varies based on the extent of the fracture and the patient's pain tolerance.

When a foot or toe fracture is suspected, anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained. The Ottawa foot and ankle rules can help determine the need for radiography after an acute ankle inversion injury. Many foot fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot or a hard-soled shoe. Weight-bearing and duration of immobilization are based on the stability of the fracture and the patient's pain level. Most toe fractures can be managed nonsurgically with a hard-soled shoe for two to six weeks. Close attention should be paid to the great toe because of its role in weight-bearing, and physicians should follow specific guidelines for orthopedic referral.

- **Metatarsal shaft fractures**: Managed with a boot or hard-soled shoe for three to six weeks. The proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal has varied rates of healing due to poor blood supply, and management is based on the fracture zone.

- **Lisfranc fractures**: Often overlooked; radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained, and physicians should look for widening of the tarsometatarsal joint.

- **Other tarsal bone fractures**: Can be managed with a short leg cast or boot for four to six weeks when nonsurgical treatment is indicated.

### Assessment and management of atraumatic first metatarsophalangeal joint pain [^112iQtJP]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Low credibility.

Nontraumatic pain in the first metatarsophalangeal joint is frequent and can be debilitating. The metatarsophalangeal joint complex comprises four articulating surfaces, including the first metatarsal, the proximal phalanx, and tibial and fibular sesamoids, all contained within a synovial capsule. The most common causes of pain are hallux valgus and hallux rigidus. However, other diagnoses such as functional hallux limitus, sesamoiditis, gout, and inflammatory autoimmune arthritis need to be considered as well. A systematic approach is key to accurately diagnose the source of pain, which can sometimes be the result of more than one condition. The most important clinical information to obtain is a focused history, meticulous clinical examination based on understanding the precise anatomy and biomechanics of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and analysis of the relevant imaging. Each pathology has a different treatment algorithm; as such, understanding the pathoanatomy and biomechanics is important in forming an effective treatment plan.

### The international working group on the diabetic foot: Stories and numbers behind three decades of evidence-based guidelines for the management of diabetes-related foot disease [^112h3Bqm]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Foot disease is a devastating complication of diabetes. For almost three decades, the mission of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has been to produce evidence-based guidelines to inform health care providers worldwide on strategies for the prevention and management of diabetes-related foot disease. In this publication, we aim to better inform the reader about "the story behind" the IWGDF Guidelines and thus facilitate improved uptake of the recommendations described in the guidelines.

The first IWGDF Guidelines were published in 1999 and have been successfully updated every four years since. With each update, IWGDF has improved methodological rigor and extended the topics covered. This has been possible thanks to the involvement of over 100 experts from more than 60 countries, all voluntarily dedicating their time. We estimate that the 2023 update of the IWGDF Guidelines required a total of 10 years of full-time work, which would have cost 2 million euros if the voluntary work had been financially compensated.

The IWGDF Guidelines are not only published in English but also translated to support local implementation. Currently, available translations serve 2.9 billion people globally in their native language. As an independent and multidisciplinary organization, IWGDF hopes that the 2023 update will continue to stimulate clinicians from all different disciplines to deliver the best care possible for these patients. It will also motivate researchers to undertake the high-quality trials needed to deliver new evidence to advance the field further.

### Ocrevus [^111PPfo3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Study 3 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either Ocrevus 600 mg or placebo as two 300 mg intravenous infusions 2 weeks apart every 24 weeks for at least 120 weeks. Selection criteria required a baseline EDSS of 3 to 6.5 and a score of 2 or greater for the EDSS pyramidal functional system due to lower extremity findings. Neurological assessments were conducted every 12 weeks. An MRI scan was obtained at baseline and at Weeks 24, 48, and 120.

In Study 3, the primary outcome was the time to onset of disability progression attributable to MS confirmed to be present at the next neurological assessment at least 12 weeks later. Disability progression occurred when the EDSS score increased by 1 point or more from the baseline EDSS if the baseline EDSS was 5.5 points or less, or by 0.5 points or more if the baseline EDSS was more than 5.5 points. In Study 3, confirmed disability progression was also deemed to have occurred if patients who had onset of disability progression discontinued participation in the study before the next assessment. Additional outcome measures included timed 25-foot walk and percentage change in T2 hyperintense lesion volume.

### Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic midfoot osteoarthritis: Cross-sectional findings from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^113DGuN4]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2015). Low credibility.

By assembling the sample from a cohort of individuals with foot pain in the last 12 months, participants may have experienced symptoms elsewhere in their foot. Restricting analysis to individuals with foot pain only in the midfoot region was not feasible due to small numbers. A sensitivity analysis was conducted, where univariable analyses for all predictor variables (excluding the force-entered variables: age, gender, and BMI) were repeated after excluding 33 individuals with symptomatic first MTPJ OA (defined as co-occurring pain and radiographic change as previously defined). This analysis indicated that 14 of the 16 observed associations had a similar magnitude and precision that would not have statistically significantly altered the model (data not shown).

- **Reliability of scoring and implications**: Although the four selected joints can be reliably scored and used to represent midfoot OA, this present analysis pertains only to the identification of radiographic OA in the medial midfoot. Whilst clinically the occurrence of OA in the lateral midfoot is understood to be rare by comparison, osteoarthritic changes in other midfoot joints could also contribute to symptoms in both midfoot pain and symptomatic midfoot OA groups.

- **Alternative imaging modalities**: Furthermore, an alternative reference standard such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound may have generated different results, and future studies could consider comparing the use of other imaging modalities for the foot.

Finally, misclassification may have arisen in the musculoskeletal midfoot pain domain. There is a need to narrow this domain to exclude those with prevalent conditions such as diabetes, peripheral…

### Neuropathic pain associated with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis: Frequency and associated factors [^112DBzBb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether neuropathic pain is a feature of first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods: A total of 98 participants (mean ± SD age 57.4 ± 10.3 years) with symptomatic radiographic first MTP joint OA completed the PainDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q), which consists of 9 questions regarding the intensity and quality of pain. The likelihood of neuropathic pain was determined using established PD-Q cutoff points. Participants with unlikely neuropathic pain were then compared to those with possible/likely neuropathic pain in relation to age, sex, general health (Short Form 12 [SF-12] health survey), psychological well-being (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale), pain characteristics (self-efficacy, duration, and severity), foot health (Foot Health Status Questionnaire [FHSQ]), first MTP dorsiflexion range of motion, and radiographic severity. Effect sizes (Cohen's d coefficient) were also calculated.

Results: A total of 30 (31%) participants had possible/likely neuropathic pain (19 possible [19.4%], 11 likely [11.2%]). The most common neuropathic symptoms were sensitivity to pressure (56%), sudden pain attacks/electric shocks (36%), and burning (24%). Compared to those with unlikely neuropathic pain, those with possible/likely neuropathic pain were significantly older (d = 0.59, P = 0.010), and had worse SF-12 physical scores (d = 1.10, P < 0.001), pain self-efficacy scores (d = 0.98, P < 0.001), FHSQ pain scores (d = 0.98, P < 0.001), and FHSQ function scores (d = 0.82, P < 0.001), and had higher pain severity at rest (d = 1.01, P < 0.001).

### ProquinXR [^1128BkyG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Susceptibility tests: Interpretive criteria for urinary isolates have not been established for Proquin XR. Interpretive criteria established based on systemic drug levels may not be appropriate for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

- **Dilution techniques**: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ciprofloxacin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:

	- **For testing Enterobacteriaceae**:
		- A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable.
		- A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.
		- A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial concentration is achieved.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of pediatric foot and ankle pain [^115ee7Rt]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

During the clinical assessment, the physician should attempt to reproduce the patient's foot or ankle pain through palpation and manipulation. Biomechanical examination is crucial in determining any potential predisposing or contributing factors. This should include an assessment for genetic predisposing factors such as excessive stiffness, loose-jointedness, pes planus, pes cavus, and increased or decreased muscle tone. Functional biomechanics should be evaluated by observing gait and performing maneuvers such as jumping, hopping (single and double-leg), cutting, and figure-of-eight running. Most causes of foot and ankle pain are unilateral, allowing comparison to the unaffected side. The lumbar spine, ipsilateral hip, and knee should always be examined.

- **Observation**: Standing assessment includes pelvis heights, lower limb alignment, hindfoot position (varus, valgus), subtalar position (inversion, eversion), forefoot position (adduction, abduction), foot arch (cavus, planus), toes (claw toes, overriding fifth toe, Morton's foot with the first ray shorter than the second), swelling, and redness. Supine or sitting assessment includes lower limb lengths and alignment, hindfoot position, forefoot position, foot arch, alteration of callus formation due to altered weight bearing, corns, plantar warts, and onychocryptosis.

- **Palpation**: Surface anatomy is best appreciated with the patient sitting. The foot and lower leg are stabilized by holding the foot around the calcaneus. It is important to palpate specific structures. The point of maximal tenderness should be correlated with the underlying bone or soft tissue anatomy.

### Avelox [^111VPaVf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Tendon problems can occur in individuals without the aforementioned risk factors when they take Avelox. Other factors that may increase the risk of tendon problems include physical activity, exercise, kidney failure, and a history of tendon issues, such as in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

- **Important actions if experiencing symptoms**:

	- **Advise healthcare provider**: At the first sign of tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation, patients should advise their healthcare provider immediately. Stop taking Avelox until tendinitis or tendon rupture has been ruled out by your healthcare provider.
	- **Avoid exercise**: Refrain from exercising and using the affected area. The Achilles tendon, located at the back of your ankle, is the most common area of pain and swelling, although other tendons may also be affected.
	- **Discuss with your healthcare provider**: Talk about the risk of tendon rupture with continued use of Avelox. You may require a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.
	- **Awareness of tendon rupture timeline**: Tendon rupture can occur while taking or after finishing Avelox. Tendon ruptures have been reported several months after completing a course of fluoroquinolone.

- **Signs of tendon rupture**:

	- Hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
	- Bruising immediately after an injury in a tendon area
	- Inability to move the affected area or bear weight

- **Worsening of myasthenia gravis**: Fluoroquinolones like Avelox may cause exacerbation of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any worsening muscle weakness or breathing difficulties.

### Diabetic foot disease: "The times they are a changin'" [^114jebCF]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot disease ranks 10th globally among diseases that pose the heaviest burden on patients and society. During their lifetime, up to 30% of people with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer, and every 20 seconds someone in the world undergoes an amputation of part of the leg because of diabetes. Despite these grave statistics, foot disease is widely considered the "Cinderella" of diabetes-related complications due to the relatively limited attention it receives in clinical practice and research compared to other complications. However, to quote Bob Dylan, "the times they are a-changin'", and interest in this common, costly, complex, and challenging area of medicine has been growing in recent decades. We who work in this field believe it is time for a shift in the perception of diabetic foot disease to a more positive one, as it appears the prince has a footpath to his Cinderella. We hope you will "please heed the call" and be stimulated and enlightened by the new information highlighted by this special issue in Diabetes Metabolism Research and Reviews (DMRR).

The issue features seven guidelines, ten systematic reviews, and two other supporting documents from the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF). Supplementing these documents are 17 invited papers on related, important, and exciting topics. This wealth of knowledge is the result of close collaboration and tireless efforts by more than 100 dedicated experts worldwide from many different disciplines. The IWGDF started this unique initiative more than 20 years ago.

### Effects of tracer arrival time on flow estimates in MR perfusion-weighted imaging [^116JXhEN]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A common technique for calculating cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mean transit time (MTT) is to track a bolus of contrast agent using perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) and deconvolve the change in concentration with an arterial input function (AIF) using singular value decomposition (SVD). This method often overestimates the volume of tissue that infarcts and, in cases of severe vasculopathy, produces CBF maps inconsistent with clinical presentation. This study examines the effects of tracer arrival time differences between tissue and a user-selected global AIF on flow estimates. CBF and MTT were calculated in both numerically simulated and clinically acquired PWI data, where the AIF and tissue signals were shifted backward and forward in time with respect to one another. Results show that when the AIF leads the tissue, CBF is underestimated, independent of the extent of delay, but dependent on MTT. Conversely, when the AIF lags the tissue, flow may be over- or underestimated depending on MTT and the extent of timing differences. These conditions may occur in practice due to the application of a user-selected AIF that is not the "true AIF"; therefore, caution must be taken in interpreting CBF and MTT estimates.

### Current treatment of plantar fasciitis [^1169zmf8]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2002). High credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is associated with various symptoms and factors including pain relieved by rest, the windlass test, calcaneal spur, calf tightness, obesity, and pain that worsens in the morning. It is also linked to pes cavus, heel tenderness, heel pain, perifascial edema, Achilles tendinopathy, decreased ankle dorsiflexion, gait disturbance, and difficulty walking. Additional factors include prolonged periods of standing, sports participation, increased plantar fascia thickness, pes planus, pain aggravated by weight-bearing, and pain that worsens with standing and limping.

### Footwear and insole design features for offloading the diabetic at risk foot-a systematic review and meta-analyses [^1112Y4sc]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Thirty-three percent (n = 18) of studies [21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 36, 37, 38, 45, 46, 47, 48, 56, 62, 64, 68, 71, 73] reported the use of metatarsal addition to the insole (Appendix S6). Only three repeated measure studies [21, 36, 45] could distinguish the effect of a metatarsal addition independently from other insole and footwear features and were used for the meta-analysis. According to the heterogeneity test, high heterogeneity existed (I² = 0%, χ² = 0.34, τ² = 0, P = 0.844). Therefore, random-effects modelling was applied to consolidate the effect value. Figure 3 shows that out of 70 participants, the use of a metatarsal addition in an insole reduced mean peak pressure by a further 35.96 kPa (MD, -35.96; 95% CI, -57.33 to -14.60; P < .001) when compared to an insole without metatarsal addition. There was a lack of description of the metatarsal addition, and no clear indication of how or when to utilize it as a modification.

- **Forest plot of peak pressure for metatarsal modification**:

	Twenty-two percent (n = 12) of studies [21, 22, 26, 27, 34, 43, 48, 53, 64, 68, 70, 73] modified insoles with the use of a cut out or aperture to target the site or lesion under the foot of clinical interest (Appendix S7). However, only two studies [21, 43] reported the direct effect of this feature.

	- **Reported effects**:
		- **Arts (2015)**: Reduction of in-shoe peak pressure by 21 kPa, from 253 (48) kPa to 232 (54) kPa, with the removal of material in the insole for a variety of target locations [21]
		- **Lin**: Reductions of MPP at regions of interest (ROI) located in the forefoot by 72 kPa from 221.4.

### A community intervention by firefighters to increase 911 calls and aspirin use for chest pain [^111wxhFC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To test the effectiveness of an intervention, delivered face-to-face by local firefighters, a study was conducted aiming to increase utilization of 911 and self-administration of aspirin for seniors experiencing chest pain.

King County, Washington, was divided into 126 geographically distinct areas which were randomized into intervention and control areas. A mailing list identified households of seniors within these areas. More than 20,000 homes in the intervention areas were contacted by local firefighters. Data on all 911 calls for chest pain and self-administration of aspirin were collected from the medical incident report form (MIRF). The unit of analysis was the area. Firefighters delivered a heart attack survival kit (that included an aspirin) and counseled participants on the importance of aspirin and 911 use for chest pain. Main outcome measures were 911 calls for chest pain and aspirin ingestion for a chest pain event, obtained from the MIRFs that were collected by emergency medical services personnel for two years after the intervention.

There were significantly more calls (16%) among seniors on the mailing list in the intervention than control areas in the first year after the intervention. Among the seniors who were not on the mailing list, there was little difference in the intervention and control areas. The results were somewhat sensitive to the analytical model used and to an outlier in the treatment group.

A community-based firefighter intervention can be effective in increasing appropriate response to symptoms of a heart attack among the elderly.

### Amyvid [^1111kRUj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Studies Two and Three used a clinically applicable binary image interpretation method (positive/negative) to evaluate images from a range of patients who had participated in earlier studies. The studies assessed performance characteristics — sensitivity and specificity — among subjects with a postmortem amyloid neuritic plaque density truth standard. Additionally, inter-reader and intra-reader image interpretation reproducibility was assessed among all the subjects, including those who lacked a postmortem truth standard.

Before image interpretation, all readers underwent special training: Study Two used an in-person tutoring type of training, and Study Three used an electronic media-based training method. Five trained readers interpreted images independently within each study. The brain neuritic plaque density in both studies was determined using an algorithm in which microscopic measures of highest plaque density within a brain region were averaged to produce a global brain estimate of neuritic plaque density. The global neuritic plaque density was categorized in the same manner as that for a region, where plaques were counted on slides with modified Bielschowsky silver stained tissue sections.

For purposes of determining the agreement between the in-vivo Amyvid image results and the post-mortem whole brain amyloid neuritic plaque density, Amyvid results (negative/positive) were pre-specified to correspond with specific plaque density scores, based upon a modification of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria.

### Forefoot: A basic integrated imaging perspective for radiologists [^117VBJhU]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging of the forefoot is increasingly requested for patients with metatarsalgia. Awareness of specific anatomic arrangements exclusive to the forefoot, along with the widely variable pathologic entities associated with metatarsalgia, helps the radiologist tailor a cost-effective imaging approach. This enables reaching a specific diagnosis as much as possible, leading to proper patient management. This pictorial review aims to provide a basic understanding of the different imaging modalities used in studying the forefoot. Certain anatomic arrangements exclusive to the forefoot are then discussed. The final section of this review describes the imaging findings of some common forefoot problems.
