## Question

Discuss the indications of statin treatment for primary and secondary prevention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for statin treatment in both primary and secondary prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining primary versus secondary prevention and the overarching principles that guide statin use. Then, I should verify the evidence base and magnitude of benefit in secondary prevention. Next, I will examine primary prevention indications by risk category, including diabetes, severe hypercholesterolemia, and age-stratified risk thresholds. After that, I need to check the role of coronary artery calcium scoring and risk enhancers. I will then review safety, monitoring, and special populations, and finally synthesize a practical decision framework with intensity selection and shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions and principles. Primary prevention refers to patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, whereas secondary prevention refers to patients with clinical ASCVD such as coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease, where the absolute risk and thus the absolute benefit of statins are highest, and guideline consensus is strongest for high-intensity therapy in appropriate candidates [^116aLHq6] [^113yvSgn]. I should confirm that modern guidance emphasizes risk-based treatment rather than LDL-C targets alone, with percentage LDL-C reduction goals tied to risk category and a strong emphasis on clinician–patient risk discussion before initiating therapy [^1138QxsW] [^117CHTFV].

> Now, I will examine secondary prevention indications and intensity. High-intensity statins are recommended for adults aged 75 years or younger with clinical ASCVD unless contraindicated, with moderate-intensity statins as an alternative when high-intensity is not tolerated, and in adults older than 75 years it is reasonable to continue or initiate statins based on expected benefit, comorbidities, and patient preferences, acknowledging that most RCT data are in younger populations [^113yvSgn] [^115vtFC5]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit: each approximately 38 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C yields about a 20–25% relative risk reduction in major ASCVD events, which explains the preference for high-intensity therapy when tolerated in secondary prevention [^116aLHq6].

> Next, I should review primary prevention in adults 40–75 years without diabetes and with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL. I need to ensure I apply the pooled cohort equations correctly: initiate a moderate-intensity statin when 10-year ASCVD risk is 7.5% or higher, and selectively offer a statin when risk is 5% to less than 7.5% after a clinician–patient risk discussion, with risk enhancers and, when uncertainty remains, coronary artery calcium scoring informing the decision [^1171dFqY]. Hold on, I should verify the expected benefit gradient: the absolute benefit is greater at 10% or higher risk, while at 7.5% to less than 10% the net benefit is smaller and more dependent on patient preferences and risk enhancers, which is why shared decision-making is emphasized here [^1176EN33] [^112Huago].

> I will now examine diabetes as a special high-risk primary prevention group. Adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes should receive at least moderate-intensity statin therapy regardless of calculated 10-year risk, and it is reasonable to use high-intensity statins when multiple ASCVD risk factors are present, given consistent RCT evidence of event reduction in this population [^117SzPjZ] [^115ETCBW]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: multiple primary prevention RCTs in diabetes demonstrate significant ASCVD event reductions with moderate-intensity statins, supporting this class I recommendation [^117SzPjZ].

> Next, I should review severe hypercholesterolemia. For adults aged 20–75 years with LDL-C 190 mg/dL or higher, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended without the need for formal risk calculation, given the high lifetime risk attributable to genetically mediated dyslipidemia and the large absolute benefit from aggressive LDL-C lowering [^116g1c8J] [^115ETCBW]. Hold on, I should confirm that this applies to primary prevention contexts; yes, this is a primary prevention indication due to very high baseline risk from LDL-C elevation itself [^116g1c8J].

> Let me consider younger adults aged 20–39 years. I should confirm that routine statin therapy is not recommended here; instead, emphasize lifestyle and estimate lifetime risk, reserving drug therapy for select patients with very high LDL-C, such as LDL-C 160 mg/dL or higher, particularly if there is a family history of premature ASCVD or other risk enhancers, recognizing the evidence gap for hard outcomes in this age group [^116TMavT] [^111Ksvaj]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "treat if LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL" was a universal threshold, but I should correct that: this is a reasonable, guideline-concordant approach in select high-risk younger adults rather than a blanket indication, and decisions should be individualized given limited RCT data in this age range [^116TMavT].

> I should now review older adults aged 76 years or older. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against initiating statins for primary prevention in this group, so decisions should be individualized based on comorbidity, life expectancy, frailty, and patient preferences, while secondary prevention benefits generally support continuation if already on therapy and tolerated [^115HRh7E] [^115128CK]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not contradict ACC/AHA guidance; ACC/AHA similarly advises individualized assessment and risk discussion for adults older than 75 years, aligning with a cautious, patient-centered approach [^116TMavT].

> Next, I should review the role of coronary artery calcium scoring and risk enhancers. In adults at intermediate risk, or selected borderline-risk adults in whom the decision is uncertain, CAC can refine risk: CAC zero allows deferral of statins in the absence of higher-risk conditions with reassessment in 5–10 years, CAC 1–99 favors statin initiation especially after age 55, and CAC 100 or higher or at or above the 75th percentile supports statin therapy. Risk enhancers such as family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory disorders, and persistently elevated triglycerides can also tip the balance toward treatment in borderline-risk patients [^115c4Mvu] [^111Pb273]. I need to ensure I emphasize that CAC is optional and most useful when the decision is genuinely uncertain after a thorough risk discussion [^1177TNkm].

> I will now examine safety, monitoring, and special populations. Statins are generally safe and well tolerated; the main adverse effects are myalgias and rare hepatotoxicity, and there is a small increase in new-onset diabetes risk, particularly in patients with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome, so baseline hepatic enzymes and symptom surveillance are prudent, with glucose monitoring considered in those at elevated diabetes risk [^114WaUCG] [^117W8o15]. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has active liver disease? Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy and should be avoided in active hepatic disease, and in patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms, switching to a different statin or lower intensity, or using nonstatin options, may be reasonable strategies within guideline frameworks [^113H3qi9] [^115vtFC5].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. For secondary prevention, start or continue high-intensity statin in adults aged 75 or younger unless contraindicated, and individualize intensity in those older than 75. For primary prevention, use the pooled cohort equations in adults 40–75 years, initiate moderate-intensity statin at 10-year risk 7.5% or higher, selectively offer at 5% to less than 7.5% using risk enhancers and CAC as needed, treat all adults 40–75 with diabetes with at least moderate-intensity statin, and treat LDL-C 190 mg/dL or higher with high-intensity statin regardless of calculated risk. In adults 20–39 years, prioritize lifestyle and lifetime risk, reserving pharmacotherapy for select very high-risk phenotypes. In adults 76 or older, individualize decisions given insufficient initiation evidence, while generally continuing therapy if already on and tolerated [^117CHTFV] [^115HRh7E] [^116TMavT]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both USPSTF and ACC/AHA; yes, this synthesis reflects both bodies' risk-based, shared decision-making approach with attention to special populations and intensity selection [^117CHTFV] [^115HRh7E].

> Finally, I need to ensure the implementation details are clear. Use moderate-intensity statins for most primary prevention starts, escalate intensity when indicated by higher risk or LDL-C 190 mg/dL, and avoid routine LDL-C targets. Instead, monitor for expected percentage LDL-C reduction and adherence, and reinforce lifestyle as foundational therapy alongside statins, with periodic reassessment of risk and patient preferences over time [^114t4u26] [^117CHTFV]. I should double-check that this avoids overcomplication: the key is to match intensity to risk, verify tolerance and adherence, and revisit decisions as clinical circumstances evolve, which is consistent with contemporary guideline pathways [^1138QxsW].

Statin therapy is indicated for **primary prevention** in adults aged 40–75 years with ≥ 1 CVD risk factor (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a **10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%** [^115HRh7E], and should be selectively considered for those with a 7.5–10% risk after shared decision-making [^114zkBRW]. For **secondary prevention**, statins are indicated for all adults with clinical ASCVD (e.g. MI, stroke, PAD) [^113yvSgn], with high-intensity therapy preferred for those ≤ 75 years and moderate-intensity for those > 75 years or when high-intensity is not tolerated [^115vtFC5]. Statin therapy is also indicated for adults ≥ 20 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [^111CzrrQ] and for adults 40–75 years with diabetes, regardless of calculated risk [^111CzrrQ].

## Primary prevention indications

Primary prevention aims to prevent the **first cardiovascular event** in individuals without established ASCVD. Statin therapy is recommended based on age, risk factors, and calculated cardiovascular risk [^1171i962].

---

### Age 40–75 years

- **10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%**: Initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy [^112Huago] [^114t4u26].
- **10-year ASCVD risk 7.5–10%**: Consider moderate-intensity statin therapy after shared decision-making, incorporating patient preferences and risk enhancers [^111Pb273] [^112Huago].
- **10-year ASCVD risk < 7.5%**: Emphasize lifestyle modifications; statin therapy is generally not recommended unless additional risk enhancers are present [^1171i962].

---

### Age 20–39 years

Emphasis is placed on **lifestyle modification and risk assessment** [^116TMavT]; statin therapy is generally not recommended unless there is severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL) or familial hypercholesterolemia [^116g1c8J].

---

### Age ≥ 76 years

Evidence is insufficient to support routine initiation of statin therapy; decisions should be **individualized** based on comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preferences [^114zkBRW] [^116TMavT].

---

## Secondary prevention indications

Secondary prevention targets individuals with established ASCVD, in whom statin therapy significantly reduces recurrent events and mortality [^111wNdmE].

---

### Clinical ASCVD

- **High-intensity statin therapy**: Recommended for adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD (e.g. MI, stroke, PAD) unless contraindicated [^113yvSgn] [^115vtFC5].
- **Moderate-intensity statin therapy**: Recommended for adults > 75 years or those unable to tolerate high-intensity therapy [^113yvSgn] [^115vtFC5].
- **Very high-risk patients**: Consider adding nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) if LDL-C goals are not achieved on maximally tolerated statin therapy [^1138QxsW].

---

## Special considerations

### Severe hypercholesterolemia

Adults ≥ 20 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL should receive **high-intensity statin therapy** regardless of calculated cardiovascular risk [^116g1c8J] [^115ETCBW].

---

### Diabetes mellitus

Adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes should receive **moderate-intensity statin therapy** regardless of calculated cardiovascular risk [^117SzPjZ] [^115ETCBW].

---

## Statin therapy indications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication** | **Statin intensity** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary prevention, 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% | Yes | Moderate |
| Primary prevention, 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5–10% | Consider | Moderate |
| Primary prevention, age ≥ 76 years | Insufficient evidence | Individualized |
| Secondary prevention, age ≤ 75 years | Yes | High |
| Secondary prevention, age > 75 years | Yes | Moderate |
| Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL) | Yes | High |
| Diabetes mellitus, age 40–75 years | Yes | Moderate |

---

Statin therapy is indicated for **primary prevention** in adults aged 40–75 years with ≥ 1 CVD risk factor and a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% [^115HRh7E], and for **secondary prevention** in all adults with clinical ASCVD, with intensity tailored to age and tolerance [^113yvSgn].

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Management Guideline included major shifts in recommended approaches to primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 The ACC/AHA guideline significantly expanded the population eligible for statin lipid‐lowering therapy for primary prevention, mainly by emphasizing recommendations based on estimated cardiovascular risk and abandoning low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. One study estimated that 12.8 million additional adults would be eligible for statin therapy compared with prior guidelines. 2 However, before initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, the ACC/AHA guideline emphasized a clinician‐patient risk discussion. Although guidance has been published 3 detailing elements of discussions, little is known about how such discussions are currently being implemented in clinical practice or whether specific practices are associated with statin prescription.

Although the ACC/AHA guideline expanded the population eligible for statin therapy and recommended potentially higher doses of statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention, evidence to date indicates modest adoption in clinical practice. 4, 5, 6, 7 One study evaluated statin use in 161 cardiology practices before and after the ACC/AHA guideline, finding no significant difference in trends of use of moderate‐ to high‐intensity statins for eligible subgroups, with postguideline primary prevention use of 55.2% for diabetic patients and 46.9% for patients with no clinical ASCVD but elevated ASCVD risk. 8 A study using a national database of pharmacy and medical claims found that the ACC/AHA guideline publication was associated with a decrease in statin initiation. 9

Given that the current ACC/AHA guideline represented a substantial change in the approach to cholesterol management while also promoting individualized decision making, it is likely that clinician and patient beliefs impact decision making. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the implementation of the ACC/AHA guideline from the perspective of primary care providers (PCPs), potentially helping to explain patterns of uptake as well as to identify potential barriers and solutions. We hypothesized that community PCPs hold varying beliefs of the risks and benefits of statin therapy and report varying approaches to statin risk discussions with patients. We further hypothesized that the following PCP survey responses, pertaining to recommended elements of informed discussions, would be associated with increased statin prescription for primary prevention: (1) greater reported statin efficacy; (2) fewer number of adverse effects believed to be caused by statins; (3) lower reported deviation from the guidelines because of other cardiovascular risk factors; and (4) lower reported discordance between PCP recommendations and patient preferences.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

### Statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116ugS9h]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Statins are widely used in the evidence-based lowering of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The use of these drugs for secondary prevention of CVD is well founded, but their expanding use in primary prevention — in individuals without documented CVD — has raised some concerns. Firstly, evidence suggests that, in primary prevention, statins substantially decrease CVD morbidity, but only moderately reduce CVD mortality. Secondly, long-term statin use might cause adverse effects, such as incident diabetes mellitus. Thirdly, the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy is unclear, and has to be balanced against the risk of 'overmedicating' the general population. Data clearly support the use of statins for primary prevention in high-risk individuals, in whom the strategy is cost-effective and the benefits exceed the risks. Whether primary prevention is beneficial in individuals at low or moderate risk is not certain. Therefore, the prescription of statins for primary prevention should be individualized on the basis of clinical judgment, particularly for low-risk individuals. In appropriately selected individuals, statins should also be used for primary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: cons [^116wHW7Y]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

While recent decades have seen substantial reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart disease remains the number one cause of death both in the United States and globally. This has led many to advocate for prescribing statins even more widely, including to patients with low risk of cardiovascular disease, based on the hypothesis that any reduction in lipid levels will eventually translate to a reduction in the development of atherosclerosis and thus to subsequent mortality. However, empirical evidence to date has not substantiated the hoped for benefits of this strategy. When healthy patients without cardiovascular disease are prescribed statins they do not live longer, and they have only a marginal reduction in the risk of ischemic events. Furthermore, statins cause numerous side effects which substantially limit their net benefit. These tradeoffs are even more lopsided in elderly patients treated for primary prevention, in whom statin therapy does not lead to a reduction in mortality or ischemic events and has the potential for significant harms. Strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease should therefore avoid a focus on cholesterol levels and subsequent pharmacological therapy and should instead redouble efforts to improve the lifestyle factors that are far more consequential to the development of cardiovascular disease and overall good health.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### An assessment by the statin diabetes safety task force: 2014 update [^117W8o15]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 25% to 30% in primary as well as secondary prevention patients. Thus, statins are the pharmacologic therapy of choice for the management of high blood cholesterol levels. Prompted by examination of clinical trial data suggesting a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 added a statement to the labels of statin medications indicating that increases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting glucose levels have been reported with statin use. This labeling change has raised questions among clinicians regarding the relative benefits and risks of statin use, both among patients with diabetes mellitus and among those with diabetes risk factors. This 2014 report from the Diabetes Subpanel of the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Statin Safety reviews the published evidence relating statin use to the hazard for diabetes mellitus or worsening glycemia, examines potential mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between statin use and diabetes mellitus risk, and suggests future research efforts. Given the well-established benefits of statin therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among those with indications for treatment, no changes to clinical practice are recommended other than the measurement of HbA1C or fasting glucose in those deemed to also be at elevated diabetes risk after initiating statin therapy, and potentially before initiation in selected patients considered to be at elevated risk of developing diabetes. The panel advocates following recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, or other relevant guidelines if outside the United States, for screening and diagnosis as well as lifestyle modification for prevention or delay of diabetes mellitus in those with prediabetes or other risk factors.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### 2019 vs. 2016 ESC / EAS statin guidelines for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113FCGyS]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

The 2019 vs. 2016 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) dyslipidaemia guidelines contains new recommendations for primary prevention with statins; however, the potential impact of these changes is unclear. We compared the 2019 and 2016 guidelines regarding statin eligibility and potential impact on prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the general population.

Methods and Results

We examined 45750 individuals aged 40–75 from the Copenhagen General Population Study, all free of ASCVD and statin use at baseline. During the 9.2-year follow-up, 3337 experienced ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death). For Class I/A recommendations, 32.3% (95% confidence interval: 31.8–32.7) and 15.4% (15.1–15.7) of individuals were statin eligible according to the 2019 and 2016 guidelines. The increased statin eligibility by the 2019 guidelines was explained by lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) thresholds alone (explaining 33.2%), older age range alone (49.4%), older age range in combination with lower LDL-C thresholds (14.7%), and updated SCORE risk algorithm (2.8%). If fully implemented, the estimated percentage of ASCVD events that can be prevented by using high-intensity statins for 10years were 25% and 11% with the 2019 and 2016 guidelines. Mainly because of older age range in the 2019 guidelines, the corresponding estimated numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one ASCVD event were 19 and 20.

Conclusion

Due to lower LDL-C threshold and older age range, the 2019 vs. 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines doubles the number of individuals eligible for primary prevention with statins. This considerably improves the potential for ASCVD prevention in the general population, with similar NNT to prevent one event.

### Statins and LDL-C in secondary prevention-so much progress, so far to Go… [^116aLHq6]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Elevated circulating concentrations of low-density lipoproteins have been definitively demonstrated to be a cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Increasing recognition is given to the importance of reducing lifetime exposure to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 1 according to the rule of "the lower the better, " but also "the earlier the better" and "the longer the better". Statin therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular events by approximately a quarter for each reduction in low-density lipoprotein level of 38. 6 mg/dL, and long-term LDL-C reduction might even be associated with a reduction of cardiovascular mortality by 50% to 55%. The largest absolute benefits of statin therapy occur in individuals at the greatest risk, such as those who have already experienced an ASCVD event. 2 Taken together, these facts might lead us to expect near-universal coverage of statin therapy in the secondary prevention of ASCVD.

However, Yao and colleagues3 shed light on how and why this is not the case in an actual setting. Their 10-year retrospective cohort study using administrative data from 2007–2016 in the US demonstrated increases in the proportion of secondary prevention patients receiving statins and high-intensity statins during the study period. The proportion of patients adherent to statin therapy also increased, from 58. 7% to
70. 5%. It is especially true after the publication of the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society 2019 lipid guidelines, which decreased the LDL-C target to less than 55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients, and which defined patients with extremely high cardiovascular disease risk as. those with a second vascular event within 2 years while receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy, and recommended an LDL-C goal of less than 40 mg/dL.

4 This target is unlikely to be achieved without good adherence to maximally tolerated statin therapy, and recent data suggest that the goal. of less than 55 mg/dL is achieved in only 18% of patients. 5 Thus, to meet these targets, experts have recently proposed initial combination therapy with statins and ezetimibe, or triple therapy with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, especially for patients with high baseline LDL-C levels and for those at extreme cardiovascular disease risk with the precise definition of this risk group. 4, 6, 7. Of particular concern was the finding by Yao and colleagues3 that women and ethnic minorities were less likely to receive and adhere to statins. The reasons for these discrepancies need to be explored and addressed as a matter of priority. Cost is probably not a major contributor to these differences.

The study included only privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients, which limits the eternal validity of the work but reduces the potential for confounding by expense. 3 In any event, the availability of generic statins led to reductions in the cost of statin therapy during the course of the study, which were far more significant than the corresponding increase in statin use. The same phenomenon has been noted with generic ezetimibe; despite that the cost decreased substantially 3 years ago, it is used by only 15% to 20% of patients with indications for combination therapy. Could different susceptibilities to statin nonadherence/intolerance explain the differences in the extent of statin use. This question cannot easily be answered from an administrative data set; however, it is clear that further research is needed to determine the risk factors for statin intolerance and how these can be addressed.

### Review of primary and secondary prevention trials with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin [^112RLyHV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

There are overwhelming data in favor of cholesterol as a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Lifestyle modifications are considered first-line treatments for lowering cholesterol, but drug therapies are recommended in at-risk groups. Trials published before the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III reports have helped statins emerge at the forefront of lipid therapies, and more recent trials have shed light on high-risk prevention. Although 6 statins are currently available, large clinical trials reported thus far have mainly evaluated atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in the prevention of CAD and other cardiovascular events. A few small end point trials have evaluated fluvastatin, whereas rosuvastatin trials are only in their early days.

### Evaluation of the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III algorithm for selecting candidates for statin therapy: insights from the A to Z trial [^112BLTDv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommends an algorithm to integrate iterative risk-stratification information with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels to identify candidates for statin therapy. We used the Aggrastat to Zocor (A to Z) trial, in which all patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event in the absence of previous statin therapy, to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. Of 1,750 patients with ACS included in this analysis, 1,126 (64%) had an indication for statin therapy before enrollment and 624 (36%) did not have a statin indication before enrollment. We estimate that initiating statin therapy at moderate dosages (decreasing LDL by 1 mmol/L) according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines would have prevented approximately 15% of the ACS events leading to enrollment in the A to Z trial, whereas more intensive statin therapy (decreasing LDL by 1.5 mmol/L) would have prevented > 21% of events. Aspirin use before enrollment was reported in only 38% of subjects with a statin indication. In conclusion, these observations represent missed opportunities for primary and secondary prevention and highlight the need for assessment of patient risk and better adherence to existing prevention guidelines.

### Management of cardiovascular risk: the importance of meeting lipid targets [^111wNdmE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention focus on optimization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Since the 2004 update of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, developments in the field of preventive cardiology have included new guidelines for women and for familial hypercholesterolemia; a risk assessment algorithm incorporating the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); and clinical trial data confirming the efficacy of aggressive lipid management. Within secondary prevention in particular, there is a need for more widespread use of intensive statin therapy to achieve low LDL cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients at high risk for recurrent events. Within primary prevention, individuals with diabetes mellitus, mixed dyslipidemia, or elevated hsCRP also are at increased risk and may warrant treatment with aggressive lipid-modifying therapy. In this article, we provide an update on recent guidelines, risk algorithms, and trials related to the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Primary prevention — borderline/intermediate ASCVD risk in adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes: Patients with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to < 7.5% were judged borderline and initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy may be considered, while those with 7.5% to < 20% are intermediate risk and the guideline recommends that such patients be considered for treatment with a moderate-intensity statin; in borderline or intermediate risk started on moderate-intensity statin, patients are recommended to achieve a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; inadequate response is defined as < 30% reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), for which routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if these thresholds are not achieved, the writing committee recommends consideration of escalation to a high-intensity statin.

### Statin therapy: where are we? Where do we go next? [^111U5HL4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality in primary and secondary prevention trials including patients with elevated and average cholesterol levels. The association between reduction of total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and preventive benefit is well established. However, additional risk factors for coronary artery disease need to be incorporated into risk assessment to provide an accurate measure of global risk for use in lifestyle intervention and drug therapy guidelines. Assessment of outcomes in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study primary prevention trial, which involved patients with average cholesterol levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), suggests the importance of on-treatment values of apolipoproteins B and A-I in predicting first major events in such a population. Other data, including trials of fibrate therapy showing reduction in coronary artery disease events, support the importance of triglycerides and HDL-C in coronary artery disease risk. Challenges for future treatment guidelines include incorporation of emerging and novel risk factors into risk assessment, refinement of global risk measurement, and simplification for application to clinical practice.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117CHTFV]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease — The most important way to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation is to promote a healthy lifestyle throughout life. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions. Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy, such as antihypertensive therapy, a statin, or aspirin; the presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium scanning can help guide decisions. All adults should consume a healthy diet that emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, lean vegetable or animal protein, and fish and minimizes the intake of trans fats, red meat and processed red meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages; for adults with overweight and obesity, counseling and caloric restriction are recommended for achieving and maintaining weight loss. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, if medication is indicated, metformin is first-line therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. All adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use, and those who use tobacco should be assisted and strongly advised to quit. Aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of ASCVD because of lack of net benefit. Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended for all adults with elevated blood pressure or hypertension, and for those requiring pharmacological therapy, the target blood pressure should generally be < 130/80 mm Hg.

### How do we achieve optimal cardiovascular risk reduction? [^115PGbQB]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Optimizing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction requires the application of clinical evidence to patient care, as well as the refinement of risk assessment. Clinical evidence indicates that most patients are not treated to optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals. Despite the efficacy of statin therapy in reducing the incidence of CHD, many treated patients still experience CHD events. Targeting other lipid factors such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides may augment the risk reduction achieved by lowering LDL cholesterol. Refined global risk assessment can lead to more accurate determinations of absolute risk and to the identification both of high-risk patients needing aggressive intervention and intermediate-risk patients who appear to be at low risk. Previous global risk assessment measures failed to identify a substantial proportion of primary prevention patients who would benefit from therapy. However, revised guidelines issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program introduce new criteria for more precise risk assessment and advocate use of the Framingham scoring system to calculate absolute risk. Although intensified treatment is recommended for high-risk patients, cost considerations may limit drug therapy for some lower-risk individuals.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1148dNK8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of coronary heart disease (CHD) is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with coronary artery disease. The case for primary prevention, however, is less clear.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Strategy

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (2001 to March 2007) and EMBASE (2003 to March 2007). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of statins with minimum duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on their total low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD, were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), change in blood total cholesterol concentration, revascularisation, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data pooled weighted mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated.

Main Results

Fourteen randomised control trials (16 trial arms; 34,272 participants) were included. Eleven trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD endpoints (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.79). Benefits were also seen in the reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83). Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no clear evidence of any significant harm caused by statin prescription or of effects on patient quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Although reductions in all-cause mortality, composite endpoints and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events, there was evidence of selective reporting of outcomes, failure to report adverse events and inclusion of people with cardiovascular disease. Only limited evidence showed that primary prevention with statins may be cost effective and improve patient quality of life. Caution should be taken in prescribing statins for primary prevention among people at low cardiovascular risk.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — age-focused synopsis states that young adults 20 to 39 years should prioritize estimating lifetime risk and healthy lifestyle, with drug therapy only for select patients with moderately high LDL-C (≥ 160 mg/dL) or very high LDL-C (≥ 190 mg/dL); adults 40 to 75 years should use 10-year ASCVD risk to guide therapy; and for patients > 75 years, assessment of risk status and a clinician–patient risk discussion determine whether to continue or initiate statin treatment.

Outcomes and procedures

Our outcomes were the proportion of eligible individuals self-reporting use of statins for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. We defined these outcomes to align with the monitoring indicator recommended in the WHO non-communicable diseases Global Monitoring Framework and WHO HEARTS Technical Package for cardiovascular diseases management in primary health care: "Proportion of eligible persons receiving drug therapy… to prevent heart attacks and strokes". We defined statin use among respondents on the basis of the answer to the following question in STEPS surveys: "Are you currently taking statins regularly to prevent or treat heart disease?" We defined cardiovascular disease history on the basis of the answer to the following question in STEPS surveys: "Have you ever had a heart attack or chest pain from heart disease (angina) or a stroke (cerebrovascular accident or incident)?"

Eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention was defined among individuals without a history of self-reported cardiovascular disease and with either: (1) a history of diagnosed diabetes or (2) a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of more than 20% using the 2019 WHO laboratory-based risk equations. These equations use individual-level inputs of age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol. The measurement of biological variables across surveys is summarised in appendix 2 (pp 30–33). Eligibility for statin therapy for secondary prevention was defined among individuals with a history of self-reported cardiovascular disease.

### Recommendations for statin management in primary prevention: disparities among international risk scores [^115UN3sE]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the consensus-driven process of algorithmic risk stratification as the first step to determine statin allocation in primary prevention in many prominent lipid guidelines leads to marked heterogeneity on an international scale with respect to treatment eligibility and the potential need for ancillary testing. In the context of such heterogeneity, most algorithms systematically identify candidates for treatment who are predominantly male, are of advanced age, and have co-morbidities of hypertension and/or smoking. Whether this is the best approach for reducing or eliminating lipid-specific cardiovascular risk in the general population should be re-considered.

Perspectives: core clinical competencies

Risk algorithms induce profound variance in statin treatment decisions and the potential for reliance on ancillary testing. The results bring into question whether algorithm-based approaches are optimal for lowering lipid-related risk in primary prevention.

Translational outlook

Additional studies are required to establish an internationally accepted patient phenotype warranting primary prevention therapy with statins based on available randomized clinical trial data.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — risk stratification for adults age 40–75 y and LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL (1.8–4.9 mmol/L) without diabetes mellitus uses 10-year ASCVD risk categories of < 5% 'Low Risk', 5% - < 7.5% 'Borderline Risk', ≥ 7.5% - < 20% 'Intermediate Risk', and ≥ 20% 'High Risk'. Corresponding actions are: emphasize lifestyle to reduce risk factors (Class I) for low risk; if risk enhancers present then risk discussion regarding moderate-intensity statin therapy (Class IIb) for borderline risk; if risk estimate + risk enhancers favor statin, initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I) for intermediate risk; and initiate statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I) for high risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided statin decisions — in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk) adults or selected borderline-risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults in whom a CAC score is measured for the purpose of making a treatment decision, if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years so long as higher-risk conditions are absent; if the CAC score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the CAC score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Additionally, in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Statin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults… [^1171occs]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Recommendations The USPSTF recommends initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer low- to moderate-dose statins to adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older.

Quiz Ref IDThe USPSTF recommends that adults without a history of cardiovascular disease use a low- to moderate-dose statin for the prevention of CVD events and mortality when all of the following criteria are met: they are aged 40 to 75 years; they have 1 or more CVD risk factors; and they have a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater. Although statin use may be beneficial for the primary prevention of CVD events in some adults with a 10-year CVD event risk of less than 10%, the likelihood of benefit is smaller, because of a lower probability of disease and uncertainty in individual risk prediction.

Clinicians may choose to offer a low- to moderate-dose statin to certain adults without a history of CVD when all of the following criteria are met: they are aged 40 to 75 years; they have 1 or more CVD risk factors; and they have a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years and older without a history of heart attack or stroke. Thus, clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin use.

Patients who place a higher value on the potential benefits than on the potential harms and the inconvenience of taking a daily medication may choose to initiate statin use for reduction of CVD risk. The USPSTF has made several other recommendations relevant to the prevention of CVD in adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.

### Synergistic effects of blood pressure-lowering drugs and statins: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112deNxK]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death globally and are increasing. Risk factors can be effectively treated, but more people need to be treated more aggressively for the high-risk strategy to be effective. Proposed solutions include polypillsand risk-based approaches, the latter recognising the merits of basing treatment decisions for the prevention of cardiovascular disease on a person's predicted absolute risk of disease, rather than on the level of a single risk factor. Both solutions need the answer to a specific, but hitherto overlooked question: are there any synergistic effects between the preventive drug treatments?

When a high-risk person is identified as a candidate for primary or secondary prevention against cardiovascular disease, the potential drug regimen is likely to include blood pressure-lowering drugs and statins. Combining these two treatments may result in anything from less than an additive effect to more than a multiplicative effect on cardiovascular disease risk. Experimental studies have suggested positiveas well as negativesynergistic effects between blood pressure-lowering drugs and statins.

Several factorial trials with these two treatments have been made in humans, but as a whole, their interaction is unknown. With the recent addition to that literature, the evidence base may now be sufficient to answer the question. We hypothesised that the combined effects of blood pressure-lowering drugs and statins are multiplicative. In order to test the hypothesis, we performed a systematic review of randomised factorial trials of the effects of blood pressure-lowering drugs and statins on cardiovascular outcomes in primary or secondary prevention.

### Dyslipidemia management for cardiovascular disease… [^113kNSbh]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. From the AFP Editors Cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis causes significant morbidity and mortality, which can be improved by controlling risk factors through lifestyle interventions and lipid-lowering medications. The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense have updated recommendations for evaluation and management of dyslipidemia to prevent cardiovascular disease.

Primary Prevention Without known cardiovascular disease, treatment decisions should be based on estimated 10-year risk calculators such as the pooled cohort equations. Treatment is recommended at a 10-year risk of 12%, which matches the populations that experienced benefit in clinical trials. People with diabetes mellitus and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg per dL are also at high risk and should be offered treatment regardless of estimated risk. Shared decision-making is recommended with 10-year risk between 6% and 12%, which represents populations less studied in clinical trials. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another.

Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level. There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality. The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins.

PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent. Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe. Icosapent ethyl appears to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality with elevated triglyceride levels, although the single trial results are controversial because of high rates of cardiovascular events in the control group. Target cholesterol levels are not recommended to guide these decisions. Diet One diet has clinical evidence of decreasing risk in primary and secondary prevention. A dietitian-led Mediterranean diet decreases rates of cardiovascular events, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been studied extensively but does not reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Statins alone or polypill for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^116ozBwh]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, imposes huge healthcare costs to society and significant burdens to patients. It is estimated that 18 million deaths occurred from CVD annually worldwide. Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries including Iran. Therefore, developing and implementing public health strategies is necessary for primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Many of these deaths may be prevented with use of approved medications. Guidelines strongly recommend the use of medicines including aspirin, statins, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptors blockers (ARBs) for prevention of CVD risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia and thrombosis. Nowadays fixed-dose combination therapy is recommended. However, the possible superior clinical effect of polypill compared to statins alone for primary prevention of CVD in intermediate risk population has not been investigated yet.

According to the importance of dyslipidemia, current guidelines recommend statins in the primary prevention of CVD based on predicted cardiovascular risk approach. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) statin guidelines recommend high and moderate-high intensity statin therapy for all adults with low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) equal or greater than 190 mg/dl and risk of CVD ≥ 7.5% over 10 years, respectively. Moreover, ACC/AHA recommends moderate-intensity therapy for adults without diabetes mellitus, aged 40–75 years with 5–7.5% risk of CVD over 10 years. In this regard, Khalili et al. showed that the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on statin therapy could be useful for both moderate and intensive treatment of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of CVD events in Iranian population. However, Thanassoulis et al. (2016) revealed that an individualized statin benefit approach based on predicted absolute risk reduction over 10 years in comparison with the 10-year risk-based approach could better identify eligible lower-risk individuals who meaningfully benefit from statin treatment. In spite of probable statins adverse effects like muscle pain and increasing serum blood sugar, meta-analysis of randomized trials which evaluated the effect of statin on primary prevention of CVD documented that 1 mmol per liter reduction of LDL-C with statin was associated with 25% lower risk of CVD events.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^112yuL3E]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review illustrates the variation in recommendations surrounding optimal on-statin lipid monitoring within secondary prevention. Specifically, there were considerable differences in the recommendations for cholesterol targets (including their use) and the ongoing monitoring of lipid levels over the longer term. These findings reflect the fact that no guideline identified a specifically designed randomised controlled trial to assess either treatment targets or monitoring of therapy. However, such trials are likely to be expensive, although in the future advances with electronic health records may facilitate the evidence base for this. Nonetheless, this systematic review illustrates that better evidence is needed to provide an optimal approach to lipid monitoring in order to balance safety, adherence, cost, and time burden to patients.

All guideline committees are likely to be searching a broadly similar evidence base, where the efficacy and safety of statins has been well established in the prevention of further cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the WHO recommends the use of statins as part of their secondary prevention programme, with the increased risk widely accepted within this population. It is therefore not surprising that all guidelines agree that statins should be commenced as the lipid-lowering therapy with a high level of evidence, commensurate with the availability of randomised controlled trials. Guidelines that specify drugs or doses generally recommend high dose therapy and titrating down as necessary to a tolerated dose, rather than titrating up. This is in line with large randomised controlled trials over the preceding decades that have shown that higher dose statin therapy improves outcomes. Nonetheless, despite this widespread recommendation, there is some evidence to suggest that statins are not consistently prescribed within the secondary prevention population depending on the cardiovascular events experienced. Meanwhile, recommendations for the use of other lipid-lowering therapies illustrate that such guidelines are likely a reflection of the evidence available when the guidelines were created; for example, PCSK9 inhibitors were only discussed in guidelines published after 2016. Therefore, in clinical practice, consideration may need to be given to the timing of the publication where new evidence has emerged.

Current practice — statin use in older adults — indicates that data on primary prevention statin use in persons 76 years or older are limited; one study estimated that 10.7 million adults 75 years or older were taking a statin in 2013 to 2014 without distinguishing primary vs secondary prevention; another study among adults 75 years or older without a history of CVD found higher initiation rates in those with diabetes than those without diabetes (76.1 and 34.5 initiators per 1000 person-years, respectively), and it did not report the prevalence of statin use.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117SzPjZ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Limitations and knowledge gaps — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) priorities: The guideline notes that it is based largely on RCT outcomes and that most RCT data are from statin therapy, with limited nonstatin add-on data; more data are needed and several questions remain for additional RCTs, including in secondary prevention whether a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exists beyond which incremental benefit is not worth risks or cost; what indications justify adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy; in patients with ASCVD who have statin-associated side effects whether PCSK9 inhibitors are an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins; in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what incremental risk reduction high-intensity statins provide versus moderate-intensity statins; and in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what the value is of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia [^111WBLSe]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle changes can be used for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins have the most convincing data for primary prevention, especially for higher risk patients. Therefore, risk stratification is essential. Statin therapy is also recommended for secondary prevention in all patients with known cardiovascular disease or the risk equivalent. High-dose statins should be initiated in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Omega-3 fatty acids may be a good alternative after myocardial infarction for patients who cannot tolerate statins. Fibrates and niacin have not been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in secondary prevention, but may be useful adjuncts when statins alone cannot adequately control lipid levels. Other cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease have not been shown to consistently improve patient-oriented outcomes. There is good evidence for using statins in the secondary prevention of stroke and peripheral arterial disease.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1176EN33]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Risk–benefit gradient and patient discussion — The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on their absolute risk of having a future CVD event, the higher a person's 10-year risk of a CVD event, the greater the chance of benefit from statin use, and thus the expected benefit of statin therapy for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater exceeds the expected benefit for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%; clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin therapy.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^113vETxB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy).

### A look to the future: new treatment guidelines and a perspective on statins [^115FcyUb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

New National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines incorporate a global measure of coronary heart disease (CHD) that alters risk categorization in primary prevention by identifying individuals with CHD risk equivalence on the basis of estimated absolute CHD risk. Increasing recognition of the association of on-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with risk of CHD events is also reflected in the new guidelines by incorporation of secondary non-HDL cholesterol goals. The increased complexity of the guidelines and the likelihood of more individuals being assigned to higher risk groups with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals is of some concern, because most patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy do not achieve current guideline LDL cholesterol goals. Increased potency of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs would be of value in enabling more patients to achieve goals.

### Personalizing treatment: between primary and secondary prevention [^116MmVat]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with elevated blood cholesterol increasingly emphasize assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in deciding when to initiate pharmacotherapy. The decision to treat is based primarily on mathematical integration of traditional risk factors, including age, sex, race, lipid values, systolic blood pressure, hypertension therapy, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Advanced risk testing is selectively endorsed for patients when the decision to treat is otherwise uncertain, or more broadly interpreted as those patients who are at so-called "intermediate risk" of ASCVD events using traditional risk factors alone. These new guidelines also place new emphasis on a clinician-patient risk discussion, a process of shared decision making in which patient and physician consider the potential benefits of treatment, risk of adverse events, and patient preferences before making a final decision to initiate treatment. Advanced risk testing is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process as weaknesses in exclusive reliance on traditional risk factors are recognized, new non-statin therapies become available, and guidelines are iteratively updated. Comparative efficacy studies of the various advanced risk testing options suggest that coronary artery calcium scoring is most strongly predictive of ASCVD events. Most importantly, coronary artery calcium scoring appears to identify an important subgroup of patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis-who are "between" primary and secondary prevention-that might benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: this statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112yqeQY]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until after a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials. Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none-all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone. Future investigation in prevention should focus on improving our ability to identify these at-risk individuals.

### Evaluation of statin prescribing for secondary prevention in primary care following new guideline recommendations [^111CgJkK]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol recommends high-intensity statin therapy for most patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) versus previously recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The impact of the ACC/AHA guidelines on prescribing patterns in primary care is uncertain.

Objective

To describe the prescribing habits of statin therapy in primary care patients with ASCVD before and after the ACC/AHA guidelines were published.

Methods

This retrospective observational study evaluated patients with ASCVD who were seen in at least 1 of 8 primary care clinics in the University of Colorado Health system. It received expedited approval by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with established ASCVD prescribed high-intensity statin therapy within 1 year before or after guideline release.

Results

In total, 220 patients were included in the analysis with 110 in the before and 110 in the after cohort. For the primary outcome analysis, the rate of high-intensity statin utilization in the before versus after groups was significantly greater (25.5% vs 41.8%, P = 0.01). For ages 76 to 89 years, 36 of 37 and 29 of 30 patients in the before and after groups were receiving moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy (97.3% vs 96.7%, P = 0.99). Subgroup analysis in the after cohort for all ages showed no change in statin therapy for 77% of patients.

Conclusions

High-intensity statin prescribing increased in patients with ASCVD after release of the ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines. Our data indicate that national evidence-based guidelines may influence clinical practice in very high risk patients.

### Statins and primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention-what we know, where we need to Go, and… [^115keNEX]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has updated recommendations pertaining to statin therapy use for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults. 1, 2 For statin efficacy, the recommendations were based on an extensive updated evidence review that included 22 randomized clinical trials was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and the composite cardiovascular outcome. 1, 2 Insufficient data were available for older adults, especially individuals older than 75 years. Importantly, the evidence review did not find any significant harm associated with statin therapy, suggesting a significant overall net benefit in primary prevention in appropriate groups of individuals. 1, 2.

The evidence review2 led to 3 clinical recommendations1 that are consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. A B statement was made that clinicians initiate statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with at least 1 CVD risk factor and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk 10% or greater. A C statement was made that clinicians selectively offer statins in those with a 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7. 5% to less than 10%. 1, 2 The sex- and race-specific pooled cohort risk equations may be used for 10-year ASCVD risk estimation. 3 Given lack of sufficient data, the USPSTF concluded that "there was insufficient evidence to assess outcomes of statins in adults 76 years or older. "1, 2. These recommendations from the USPSTF1, 2 are sensible and practical. A few issues need further discussion.

First, these recommendations take a conservative approach with a B recommendation for adults aged 40 to 75 years with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or greater and a nuanced approach among those with 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% to 10%. This is understandable, given the issues surrounding overestimation of ASCVD risk using PCE, as shown in some studies, and the dominant role that age plays in 10-year ASCVD risk estimation. 3 On the other hand, statin therapy has been shown to be efficacious at much lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels. For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from 5. 1% to
7. 6%. 4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk.

5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time. With statin therapy, this strategy could still be considered by clinicians, given more than 40 years' worth of efficacy and safety data; excellent cost-effectiveness, even for individuals with 10-year ASCVD risk of at least 5%6; availability of statin therapy as a low-cost generic medication; and. an early stage of atherosclerosis can retard atherosclerosis and could potentially lead to more events prevented compared with similar LDL-C reduction later in life, once atherosclerosis is more advanced. 7 Intuitively, the benefit of any preventive therapy is a function of the magnitude of effect of that therapy on the outcomes studied, the intensity of the therapy used, and duration for which the treatment is given. Most patients who initiate preventive therapies use those therapies for a much longer period of time.

Recommendations for the use of statin medication, cholesterol targets and the frequency of monitoring are presented in table 3.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations

Treatment recommendations

All of the guidelines presented recommendations for the treatment of the secondary prevention population, with all recommending statins as the primary therapy. Only UK/Scottish guidelines suggested the specific drug and dose, namely, atorvastatin 80 mg, with many instead recommending the maximally tolerated high-intensity doses in general, with lower doses considered when contraindications were present, or they were poorly tolerated by the patients. Few caveats were stated regarding the prescription of statins. For example, all stroke guidelines recommended statins only when the cause of the stroke was likely to be atherosclerotic, with the South African Stroke Society additionally only recommending them in the case of total cholesterol > 3.5 mmol/L, and the Australia Stroke Society only considering them appropriate when the patient's life expectancy was considered reasonable. For the secondary prevention population as a whole, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society (ESCEAS) tailored their recommendations for patients whose baseline LDL was < 1.4 mmol/L at baseline, respectively, with therapy considered rather than offered to these patients. Finally, the 2018 American Consensus (ACD) guidelines stated that the benefit–risk ratio should be considered when offering medication to patients over the age of 75 years.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — recommendations for adults. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), if risk-based decisions for preventive interventions remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111Pb273]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — risk-based statin therapy and coronary artery calcium (CAC) use in adults: For age 40–75 y with LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL without diabetes mellitus, a 10-year ASCVD risk discussion is initiated and actions align with risk strata: < 5% "Low Risk" emphasizes lifestyle (Class I); 5% - < 7.5% "Borderline Risk" considers moderate-intensity statin if risk enhancers are present (Class IIb); ≥ 7.5% - < 20% "Intermediate Risk" favors initiating moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I); and ≥ 20% "High Risk" initiates statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I). When risk decision is uncertain, CAC = zero lowers risk and clinicians may consider no statin unless diabetes, family history of premature CHD, or cigarette smoking are present; CAC = 1–99 favors statin (especially after age 55); CAC = 100+ and/or ≥ 75th percentile indicates statin therapy. Additional branches specify LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL warrants high-intensity statin without risk assessment (Class I), diabetes mellitus age 40–75 y warrants moderate-intensity statin (Class I) with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa), and age > 75 y requires clinical assessment and risk discussion.

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^114ZfXdR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Study Highlights

New guidelines to manage dyslipidemia recommend individualized prevention measures to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and focus on two benefit groups: first, secondary prevention patients, diabetics, and patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking) or with chronic kidney disease; and second, individuals with 10‐year cardiovascular risk estimates. 1, 2, 3, 4 These guidelines have lowered the estimated 10‐year cardiovascular risk threshold to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. In primary prevention, European guidelines recommend treatment in individuals with 5% or higher risk on the SCORE 10‐year fatal cardiovascular risk chart and in those with low (< 5%) risk and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels between 2.6 and 4 mmol/L. 4 US guidelines recommend treatment for individuals aged 40–75 years with 10‐year risk scores 7.5%; each guide, however, with different levels of evidence. 1, 2 In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests statin treatment in primary prevention for people with 10% risk. 3 The definition of high cardiovascular risk varies across guidelines and depends on the risk function used, the endpoints considered, the reference population, and the presence of comorbidities. These recommendations are based on the results from previous meta‐analyses 5, 6 and recent clinical trials, 7 which show that the efficacy of statins is similar in high and intermediate cardiovascular risk populations.

These threshold recommendations are controversial for several reasons. First, the population eligible for lifetime statin therapy would increase substantially. Second, the focus is on relative rather than absolute risk reduction. 8, 9, 10 Finally, the randomization of the clinical trials upon which the guidelines are based did not take baseline cardiovascular risk into account.

As participants in clinical trials may not represent the general population because specific groups (statin‐intolerant or poorly adherent, diabetics, women, young people) are often excluded, 11 data from electronic medical records can be used to provide population‐based evidence for cardiovascular risk management decisions and to evaluate treatment effectiveness in real‐life clinical conditions. 12

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effectiveness of statins in a general population according to their coronary risk estimation.

### Cardiovascular risk estimation and eligibility for statins in primary prevention comparing different strategies [^117NCuPG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations for statin use for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) are based on estimation of the 10-year CHD risk. It is unclear which risk algorithm and guidelines should be used in European populations. Using data from a population-based study in Switzerland, we first assessed 10-year CHD risk and eligibility for statins in 5,683 women and men 35 to 75 years of age without cardiovascular disease by comparing recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology without and with extrapolation of risk to age 60 years, the International Atherosclerosis Society, and the US Adult Treatment Panel III. The proportions of participants classified as high-risk for CHD were 12.5% (15.4% with extrapolation), 3.0%, and 5.8%, respectively. Proportions of participants eligible for statins were 9.2% (11.6% with extrapolation), 13.7%, and 16.7%, respectively. Assuming full compliance to each guideline, expected relative decreases in CHD deaths in Switzerland over a 10-year period would be 16.4% (17.5% with extrapolation), 18.7%, and 19.3%, respectively; the corresponding numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 CHD death would be 285 (340 with extrapolation), 380, and 440, respectively. In conclusion, the proportion of subjects classified as high risk for CHD varied over a fivefold range across recommendations. Following the International Atherosclerosis Society and the Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations might prevent more CHD deaths at the cost of higher numbers needed to treat compared with European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^115128CK]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Up to the age of approximately 75 years, the effectiveness of cardiovascular preventive medication is undisputed and, together with lifestyle interventions, significantly reduces the impact of cardiovascular disease. 1, 2, 3 Also, for vital adults aged 75 to 85 years, there is evidence that the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks, especially in secondary prevention. 4, 5 However, when confronted with declining health status and the development of complex health problems, the use of preventive medications with long‐term effects might become of questionable benefit; on the one hand, treatment priorities shift and life expectancy shortens, while on the other hand, the risks of adverse effects increase due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, polypharmacy, and multimorbidity, 6, 7, 8, 9 especially in old age. These risks can be influenced positively by decreasing medication prescriptions. In addition, high‐quality evidence is not yet available for either primary or secondary statin‐based prevention in people aged 85 years and older or in those with complex health problems (as they are currently excluded from trials). 10 In a recent meta‐analysis of the efficacy and safety of statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention in older adults, which included data from 28 trials, only 8% of all patients were aged older than 75 years at enrollment. 5 As statins are one of the most commonly used drugs in the older population, with a prevalence ranging between 18% and 45%, 11, 12 with concerns about the benefits, they have been identified as possible candidates for deprescribing (the process of tapering or stopping inappropriate medication) by both clinicians and patients. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 In a modified Delphi approach, physicians, pharmacists, and nurses prioritized statins in the top three of a list of medication classes where evidence‐based deprescribing guidelines would be of benefit to clinicians because of concerns about benefit given the lack of older patients in trials, the lack of clarity around ongoing indication and when they can be stopped, as well as an emerging recognition of adverse effects and overtreatment of low‐risk patients. 14

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Screening and statin use in… [^112TjC8L]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality.

POTENTIAL HARMS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small. Randomized, clinical trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. USPSTF ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10% has a small net benefit. The decision to initiate therapy in this population should reflect an assessment of patients' specific circumstances and their preference for a potential small benefit relative to the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a lifelong daily medication. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD.

As such, the USPSTF does not recommend for or against the use of CRP alone as a risk factor in screening to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD. 12 In JUPITER, most of the trial participants either also had hypertension or were smokers 10 — risk factors the USPSTF prioritized for determining potential suitability for statin therapy. In the recent HOPE-3 trial, there was no difference in the effects of statins among participants with or without elevated CRP levels.
8. The USPSTF recognizes the rationale for screening for dyslipidemia in adults aged 21 to 39 years to identify those at risk for the development of early atherosclerosis, including those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Unfortunately, the evidence is lacking in this age group. The USPSTF found 4 trials of statin use for primary prevention that enrolled patients younger than 40 years.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^113SGejH]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

These results were confirmed in a meta-analysis that included ten trials (70,388 participants without established CVD), which showed that statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.88), major coronary events (0.70) and major cerebrovascular events (0.81). In another analysis, Ray et al. determined whether statin therapy reduces all-cause mortality among intermediate to high-risk individuals without a history of CVD. Data from 11 studies with 65,229 participants showed that use of statins in the high-risk primary prevention setting was not associated with a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.91) in the risk of all-cause mortality. These findings complement and extend the above-mentioned meta-analyses as well as the results from the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, which reported that statins reduced death from any cause by 12%. However, these estimates were based on information from both individuals with and without pre-existing CHD or stroke, which may overestimate the real benefits in the primary prevention setting. Despite the continuing discussion of the effect of statins on all-cause mortality in these groups of patients, their role in primary prevention individuals, especially in high-risk ones, is unquestionable. In low and moderate-risk patients the decision regarding starting statin therapy should be assessed individually taking into account the cardiovascular risk as well as the risk of statin-related side effects (e.g. new onset diabetes, especially in patients with overweight/obesity and/or insulin resistance).

### Primary prevention with statins in the Elderly [^112EBHgP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-income countries is mostly borne by the elderly. With increasing life expectancy, clear guidance on sensible use of statin therapy to prevent a first and potentially devastating ASCVD event is critically important to ensure a healthy aging population. Since 2013, 5 major North American and European guidelines on statin use in primary prevention of ASCVD have been released by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society. Guidance on using statin therapy in primary ASCVD prevention in the growing elderly population (> 65 years of age) differs markedly. The authors discuss the discrepant recommendations, place them into the context of available evidence, and identify circumstances in which uncertainty may hamper the appropriate use of statins in the elderly.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

### Statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention… [^112AGZFQ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In the US, more than 126 million adults have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. 1 Reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with CVD is a public health imperative. Accordingly, considerable resources and effort have been invested in determining not only how to effectively treat symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke, but also on prevention of clinical CVD. Although elevated low-density lipoprotein is associated with higher rates of CVD, 2 there is uncertainty regarding the net benefit to risk ratio of using statins to reduce LDL among persons without CVD. This contrasts with the established role of LDL reduction for persons with established CVD. The US Preventive Services Task Force has updated its 2016 recommendations on the use of statins for the primary prevention of clinical CVD. 3 Two of us wrote about the 2016 recommendations, 4 and in this Editorial we update our comments for the 2022 recommendations.
5. First, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or higher based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations and at least 1 risk factor — dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and/or smoking — are likely to derive moderate benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin. Second, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to less than 10% and at least 1 risk factor are likely to experience small net benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin, and thus clinicians should engage patients in shared decision-making.

Third, the Task Force concludes that there is insufficient evidence to fully assess the net harms and benefits of initiating statins in adults 76 years and older, regardless of estimated 10-year CVD event risk or presence of risk factors. The details of the updated recommendations merit further consideration. 5 The systematic review6 that accompanies the 2022 USPSTF recommendations examined 22 randomized clinical trials that compared statin therapy vs placebo or no statin, with a mean follow-up duration of 3 years. The updated evidence synthesis6 found that statins yielded a slightly smaller, but still statistically significant, reduction in all-cause mortality, as well as for myocardial infarction and stroke.

The USPSTF recommendations should be considered in the context of a meta-analysis, published in 2010, 8 which included only trials that enrolled patients receiving high-risk primary prevention; this study showed no benefit on all-cause mortality with statins. In contrast with its 2016 recommendations, 3 the USPSTF no longer recommends use of low-intensity statins in certain situations. This change is driven by the fact that 17 of the 22 trials had fixed-dose statin groups, including 12 which used moderate-intensity statins. 6 We are unaware of any RCTs that directly compare either different statin intensities in terms of clinical CVD outcomes or fixed-dose vs titrate-to-LDL goal approaches. artery disease equivalents, such as carotid artery atherosclerosis. 12 As noted previously, a meta-analysis of statins for patients receiving high-risk primary prevention found no benefit on all-cause mortality.

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^114WaUCG]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Statins are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and have been recommended in clinical guidelines as frontline treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Various adverse events have been reported in clinical use, however, including muscle problems, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, diabetes, and eye conditions. Previous studies have shown that uptake and persistence with statin treatment is poor and, as a result, millions of patients could be missing out on life saving treatment. This underuse is partly because of concerns about potential adverse effects, and these concerns are particularly evident when statins are used for primary prevention in asymptomatic patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. In these individuals, who have a lower average risk of cardiovascular disease, the absolute benefits of statins are smaller than in a secondary prevention population with previous cardiovascular disease events, and therefore the benefit-to-harm balance of treatment might be less favourable. Nevertheless, recent guidelines have recommended wider use of statins for primary prevention, making a large population at low risk of cardiovascular disease eligible for treatment and exposed to the risks of adverse effects. This increased eligibility for intervention with statins has been controversial, and better understanding of the risks of adverse effects is needed to determine the trade-off between the benefits and harms of statins in a primary prevention population.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### Primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: controversies and clinical considerations [^111tGkFj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

A new guideline for the treatment of blood cholesterol was recently released by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), serving as an update to the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III cholesterol guideline first released in 2001. With significant changes to key definitions, treatment strategy, and therapy selection, the guideline has transformed the treatment of blood cholesterol and also created controversy within the health care community. This controversy is largely focused on appropriate identification and treatment of patients for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Whereas statins play an integral role in the treatment and secondary prevention of ASCVD, their use for primary prevention is less clearly defined. It is imperative that health care providers are well versed in the concepts and controversies of the new guideline recommendations for primary prevention of ASCVD and can effectively assess the risks and benefits of statin therapy in this patient population.

### Continuation of statin therapy and primary prevention of nonfatal cardiovascular events [^116bCdH8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Although the beneficial effect of statins in secondary prevention of cardiac events is well established, their effectiveness in primary prevention is questionable when most evidence derives from randomized controlled trials and not "real-life" data. To evaluate the association between persistent use of statins and risk of acute nonfatal cardiovascular events in primary prevention patients in community settings, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 171,535 adults 45 to 75 years old with no indication of cardiovascular disease who began statin therapy from 1998 to 2009 in a large health maintenance organization in Israel. Persistence with statins was measured by the proportion of days covered with dispensed prescriptions of statins during the follow-up period. Main outcome measurements were occurrence of myocardial infarction or performance of a cardiac revascularization procedure. Incidence of acute cardiovascular events during the follow-up period (993,519 person-years) was 10.22 per 1,000 person-years. Persistence with statins was associated with a lower risk of incident cardiac events (p for trend < 0.01). The most persistent users (covered with statins for ≥ 80% of their follow-up time) had a hazard ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.62) compared to nonpersistent users (proportion of days covered < 20%). Similar results were found when analyses were limited to patients with > 5 years of follow-up. Treatment with high efficacy statins was associated with a lower risk of cardiac events. In conclusion, our large and unselected community-based study supports the results of randomized controlled trials regarding the beneficial effect of statins in the primary prevention of acute cardiac events.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QWr6D]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117D5jmp]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Update of previous USPSTF recommendation — In 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended a low- to moderate-dose statin for adults without a history of cardiovascular disease when aged 40 to 75 years, with 1 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors, and a calculated 10-year cardiovascular event risk of 10% or greater; it also recommended that clinicians selectively offer a low- to moderate-dose statin to adults meeting the first two criteria with a calculated 10-year risk of 7.5% to less than 10%, and concluded there was insufficient evidence to assess initiating statins in adults 76 years or older.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Statin therapy — Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician–patient risk discussion.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1135PJdz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

Clinical recommendations for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) state that high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). In individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, and patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A). Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### A comparative analysis of current Lipid Treatment guidelines: nothing stands still [^113p5GKP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review similarities and differences of 5 lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion. However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

### Comparison of ACC / AHA and ESC guideline recommendations following trial evidence for statin use in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: results from the population-based rotterdam study [^116hvtiV]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines both recommend lipid-lowering treatment for primary prevention based on global risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for statin use have included participants with specific risk-factor profiles.

Objective

To evaluate the overlap between the ACC/AHA and ESC guideline recommendations and available evidence from RCTs for statin use in primary prevention of CVD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We calculated the 10-year risk for hard atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) following the ACC/AHA guideline, 10-year risk of CVD mortality following the ESC guideline, and we determined eligibility for each of 10 major RCTs for primary prevention of CVD. Conducted from July 2014 to August 2015, this study included 7279 individuals free of CVD, aged 45 to 75 years, examined between 1997 and 2008 for the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportions of individuals qualifying for lipid-lowering treatment per guidelines, proportions of individuals eligible for any of the 10 RCTs, overlap between these groups, and corresponding ASCVD incidence rates.

Results

Of the 7279 individuals included in the study, 58.2% were women (n = 4238) and had a mean (SD) age of 61.1 (6.9) years. The ACC/AHA guidelines would recommend statin initiation in 4284 participants (58.9%), while the ESC guidelines would in 2399 participants (33.0%) (overlapping by 95.8% with ACC/AHA). A total of 3857 participants (53.0%) met eligibility criteria for at least 1 RCT. Recommendations from both guidelines and trial evidence overlapped for 1546 participants (21.2%), who were at high risk for ASCVD (21.5 per 1000 person-years). A further 1703 participants (23.4%) would be recommended for statins by the guidelines in the absence of direct trial evidence, while 1176 (16.2%) would have been eligible for at least 1 trial without being recommended statin treatment by any guideline. Finally, 1719 participants (23.6%) would not be recommended a statin, nor would qualify for any of the trials. These individuals had low incidence of ASCVD (3.3 per 1000 person-years).

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on this European population study, ACC/AHA and ESC prevention guidelines often did not align at the individual level. However, for one-fifth of the general population, guidelines on both sides of the Atlantic recommend statin initiation, with trial data supporting the efficacy. There should be no controversy about providing optimal preventive medication to these individuals.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — severe hypercholesterolemia and diabetes statin initiation: For LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L), no risk assessment; high-intensity statin (Class I). In adults with diabetes mellitus and age 40–75 y, moderate-intensity statin (Class I), with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa). For age > 75 y, clinical assessment and risk discussion are specified.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

Brief review of cholesterol guidelines

The management of hypercholesterolemia has undergone significant evolution since the first major U.S. national cholesterol guidelines were introduced in 1988. This progress has been driven by the advent of statin therapy and numerous clinical trials demonstrating substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. A brief review of the most recent international guidelines is essential. These include the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) multisociety guidelines, with subsequent updates reflected in the 2021 and 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) on hypertriglyceridemiaand nonstatin therapies, respectively; the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; and the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Table 2, provides an overview of the guidelines.

Table 2
Comparison of Recent International Cholesterol Statements

Two of the most significant differences across these guidelines are the approach to risk classification and treatment.

The AHA/ACC and CCS guidelines make an initial distinction between primary and secondary prevention; the AHA/ACC guidelines also separately provide recommendations for those with diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL). In contrast, the ESC guidelines delineate patients from those with established ASCVD to those with low-calculate 10-year risk; however the guideline does make note of primary and secondary prevention in discussions of treatment.

In regard to treatment and nonstatin use, the ESC overall is more aggressive in LDL-C treatment thresholds and recommends LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for all secondary and very-high-risk primary prevention patients. In contrast, the AHA/ACA guidelines reserve this for very-high-risk secondary prevention patients. Similarly, treating to LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL is recommended for a wide group of patients in ESC guidance.

In terms of therapeutic options, the biggest divergence is on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. These are recommended for secondary and select primary prevention patients in ESC guidelinesalthough it is noteworthy that evidence of benefit in nonsecondary prevention and non-FH patients is lacking although clinical trials are ongoing. In contrast, use is limited in the ACC ECDP to secondary-prevention patients and those with likely FH.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: pros [^1123QQkc]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

The initiation of statins for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a debated subject, despite decades worth of clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. Statin therapy, in addition to blood pressure-lowering drugs and efforts to reduce cigarette smoking, was a key component of the preventive cardiology renaissance that achieved a dramatic reduction in ASCVD-related mortality from the 1950s to 2010. However, deaths attributable to ASCVD have increased by approximately 13% in recent years, which are in part driven by incomplete treatment of risk factor burden starting in youth. Statins are a cornerstone of preventive cardiology practice, not only due to their lipid-lowering properties, but also in part due to their ability to exert pleiotropic effects that promote atherosclerotic plaque stability which reduces the likelihood of atherothrombotic clinical events. While the benefit of statin therapy undoubtedly depends on the presence and degree of atherosclerotic plaque burden, a broader statin allocation strategy on a population-based level should be considered especially in younger communities that are disproportionately affected by ASCVD risk factors. Thus, the era of precision medicine must be balanced with a pragmatic, cost-effective approach that maximizes ASCVD prevention across the life course. Herein, we examine the pros of statin pharmacotherapy in primary prevention while examining over three decades worth of basic science, translational, and clinical research in the setting of clinical practice guidelines.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116WNmHi]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — Initial risk stratification required the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and the magnitude of benefit was considered proportional to estimated risk, such that a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% provides at least a small net benefit and 10% or greater provides at least a moderate net benefit; the recommendation concerns initiating statins, and in adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins; these recommendations do not pertain to adults with familial hypercholesterolemia or a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L).

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^114sdCdu]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The safe and optimal treatment of plasma lipids within the secondary prevention population is key to reducing the increasing burden of CVD in society. However, given the paucity of evidence for the frequency of ongoing monitoring, there is a clear need for further research in these two key areas of its management. This will improve patient care while optimising costs in an evidence-based manner.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115HRh7E]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in the US and is the cause of more than 1 of every 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death and accounts for 43% of deaths attributable to CVD in the US. In 2019, an estimated 558 000 deaths were caused by coronary heart disease and 109 000 deaths were caused by ischemic stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of statins for reducing CVD-related morbidity or mortality or all-cause mortality.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without a history of known CVD and who do not have signs and symptoms of CVD.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for the prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more of these CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%. The likelihood of benefit is smaller in this group than in persons with a 10-year risk of 10% or greater. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older. (I statement).

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112Huago]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — implementation — advises to consider the patient's age and, for adults aged 40 to 75 years, determine whether the patient has a cardiovascular risk factor, estimate CVD risk, and in patients with a cardiovascular risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater, initiate a moderate-intensity statin after discussing the rationale and provided the patient agrees; in patients with a cardiovascular risk factor and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%, clinicians should selectively offer a statin, taking patient values and preferences into account; for adults 76 years or older, the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against starting a statin.
