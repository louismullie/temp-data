## Question

What specific immunological changes occur in the body after blood transfusion that may contribute to colon cancer progression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what specific immunological changes occur after blood transfusion that may contribute to colon cancer progression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching concept of transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) and whether it plausibly affects cancer outcomes. Then, I should verify which immune pathways are most consistently implicated in colorectal cancer progression. Next, I will examine direct clinical evidence linking transfusion to immunologic shifts in CRC patients. After that, I need to consider dose, timing, and storage effects. Finally, I should integrate confounding and reconcile conflicting data before synthesizing a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and the strength of evidence. TRIM is a recognized phenomenon whereby allogeneic transfusion alters host immunity, with potential consequences including infection and cancer recurrence, though causality remains debated and confounding by indication is common in observational studies, so I need to be careful not to overstate causality here [^3421e654] [^4ece5d4f].

> I will now examine the core immunologic shifts repeatedly linked to transfusion in CRC cohorts. Wait, let me verify the dominant axes: multiple studies converge on suppression of cell-mediated (Th1) immunity, impaired natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and a proinflammatory milieu with elevated IL-6 and IL-10, all of which can blunt antitumor surveillance and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis [^3c5ba918] [^1e391d50] [^774c3cdb].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence in CRC. Prospective and observational perioperative studies show that transfusion is associated with higher postoperative IL-6 and IL-10, lower CD8+ T-cell counts, and a lower TNFα/IL-10 mRNA ratio, alongside more complications and worse survival, even after propensity matching, suggesting that TRIM contributes to a permissive environment for recurrence rather than acting as a mere surrogate for sicker patients or more complex surgery [^1e391d50] [^aa25e4c8] [^69bbb8c7].

> Hold on, I should verify the Treg signal specifically. Intraoperative transfusion in digestive tract malignancies increases circulating Tregs and FOXP3 expression within 24 hours, with the magnitude varying by ABO blood type, which strengthens the biological plausibility that transfusion acutely tilts the balance toward suppression of effector T-cell responses that normally constrain micrometastatic disease [^774c3cdb] [^b68f9f48].

> Let me consider dose, timing, and storage effects, because these may modulate risk. Animal models indicate that older stored erythrocytes, rather than leukocytes per se, drive increased tumor retention and mortality, likely via storage lesions and bioactive mediators; in humans, a dose–response relationship for transfusion and worse outcomes has been repeatedly observed, and the immediate perioperative window may be particularly consequential when combined with surgical immunosuppression [^5abc3609] [^723a2c10] [^34265c31].

> But wait, what if leukoreduction mitigates this? I should double-check that. Randomized and longitudinal data show that while leukodepletion reduces infectious complications, it does not eliminate the association of transfusion with worse long-term survival, implying that non-leukocyte mediators such as extracellular vesicles, oxidized lipids, and free hemoglobin also contribute to TRIM in cancer surgery contexts [^71e43f66] [^43274848] [^723a2c10].

> I need to ensure I integrate confounding and conflicting evidence. Some contemporary propensity-matched cohorts and umbrella reviews argue that much of the transfusion–recurrence signal may reflect indication bias, tumor burden, and surgical complexity rather than a direct causal effect; nonetheless, even after adjustment, several large datasets still show independent associations of transfusion with recurrence and death, and mechanistic studies continue to identify plausible immunologic pathways, so a conservative interpretation is that TRIM likely contributes to progression risk in a subset, particularly when multiple units are given perioperatively [^4ece5d4f] [^3421e654] [^4b8fe8d8].

> Let me synthesize the specific immunological changes that plausibly promote colon cancer progression after transfusion: transfusion acutely suppresses Th1 and NK effector function, expands Tregs, and elevates IL-6 and IL-10, while storage-related mediators amplify inflammation and oxidative stress. Together, these changes can impair immune surveillance of circulating tumor cells, facilitate angiogenesis, and promote a pro-metastatic niche, especially when superimposed on surgical immunosuppression and existing tumor-induced immune dysfunction [^3c5ba918] [^1e391d50] [^723a2c10].

> Finally, I should translate this into cautious clinical implications. Given the balance of evidence, restrictive transfusion thresholds, meticulous blood conservation, and optimization of preoperative anemia are reasonable strategies to minimize exposure, particularly in curative-intent CRC surgery. If transfusion is unavoidable, using the smallest effective dose and integrating enhanced recovery principles may mitigate both infectious and oncologic risks, while acknowledging that definitive causal proof awaits prospective trials designed to isolate TRIM effects from confounding by indication and surgical stress [^6e6b58a0] [^48639345] [^3421e654].

Perioperative blood transfusion in colon cancer patients causes **TRIM** [^6306bd6b] — with **Treg expansion** [^774c3cdb], **NK cell dysfunction** [^3c5ba918], and a **Th1-to-Th2 shift** [^3c5ba918] — that together suppress anti-tumor immunity and promote tumor growth and recurrence [^34265c31]. These effects are amplified by **storage lesions** (extracellular vesicles, oxidized lipids, free hemoglobin) [^723a2c10] [^43274848] and are dose-related [^34265c31]; leukoreduction does not fully mitigate them [^71e43f66] [^00d09c20]. Clinically, transfusion is associated with higher recurrence and worse survival [^4b8fe8d8], especially when combined with postoperative infection [^aaba619e], supporting restrictive transfusion strategies [^6e6b58a0].

## Immunological changes induced by blood transfusion

### Transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM)

TRIM is a well-documented phenomenon characterized by **suppression of cellular immunity** [^6306bd6b] and altered immune responses following allogeneic blood transfusion [^cd7061fe]. Key features include:

- **T-cell dysfunction**: Suppression of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, particularly Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2) essential for anti-tumor immunity [^3c5ba918].

- **Regulatory T-cell (Treg) expansion**: Increased Treg frequency and FOXP3 expression, leading to enhanced immunosuppression and tumor immune escape [^774c3cdb] [^b68f9f48].

- **Natural killer (NK) cell impairment**: Reduced NK cell cytotoxicity, compromising innate immune surveillance against tumor cells [^3c5ba918].

- **Monocyte dysfunction**: Altered monocyte activation and cytokine secretion, contributing to immunosuppression [^1e391d50].

---

### Storage-related immunomodulatory effects

Stored red blood cells undergo biochemical and morphological changes — the **storage lesion** [^415fbfae] — that further modulate immune responses:

- **Extracellular vesicles (EVs)**: Accumulate during storage, carrying bioactive molecules (cytokines, oxidized lipids, hemoglobin) that promote inflammation and immunosuppression [^43274848].

- **Oxidized lipids and free hemoglobin**: Induce oxidative stress, endothelial activation, and immune dysregulation, fostering a pro-tumorigenic environment [^723a2c10].

- **Cytokine accumulation**: Elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in stored blood contribute to systemic inflammation and immune suppression [^notfound].

---

## Specific immunological changes associated with colon cancer progression

### Suppression of anti-tumor immunity

Blood transfusion-induced immunomodulation **impairs host defenses** against colon cancer through several mechanisms:

- **Treg expansion and FOXP3 upregulation**: Tregs suppress effector T-cell responses, facilitating tumor immune escape and progression [^774c3cdb] [^b68f9f48].

- **NK cell dysfunction**: Reduced NK cell activity diminishes clearance of circulating tumor cells, promoting metastasis [^3c5ba918].

- **Th1-to-Th2 shift**: Decreased Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2) and increased Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) impair cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity [^3c5ba918].

---

### Promotion of tumor growth and metastasis

Transfusion-related immunomodulation creates a **permissive environment** for tumor growth and metastasis by:

- **Increased angiogenesis**: Elevated VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors promote tumor vascularization and growth [^notfound].

- **Enhanced tumor cell survival**: Immunosuppression reduces immune-mediated tumor cell destruction, allowing persistent tumor growth [^3c5ba918].

- **Facilitation of metastatic spread**: Impaired immune surveillance enables dissemination of tumor cells, leading to recurrence and metastasis [^3c5ba918].

## Clinical evidence linking blood transfusion to colon cancer progression

Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated associations between perioperative blood transfusion and **adverse oncologic outcomes** in colon cancer:

| **Study** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Cochrane meta-analysis (2006) | Perioperative transfusion increased colorectal cancer recurrence by 42% (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20–1.67) [^34265c31] |
| Annals of Surgery (2017) | Transfusion independently associated with worse cancer-specific survival (HR 1.19) and additive negative effect with sepsis [^aaba619e] |
| Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020) | Transfusion associated with exaggerated systemic inflammatory response, more complications, and poorer survival [^aa25e4c8] [^d2c9c5a0] |
| Randomized trial (2012) | Autologous transfusion did not improve outcomes vs allogeneic; both associated with worse survival, suggesting non-leukocyte mediators [^e494fe3c] |

---

## Influence of transfusion-related factors

Several transfusion-related factors modulate the **magnitude of immunomodulation**:

- **Storage duration**: Longer storage increases accumulation of EVs, oxidized lipids, and cytokines, exacerbating immunosuppression [^723a2c10] [^43274848].

- **Leukocyte content**: Leukoreduction reduces but does not eliminate TRIM, indicating non-leukocyte mediators (e.g. EVs, free hemoglobin) [^71e43f66] [^00d09c20].

- **Transfusion volume**: Higher transfusion volumes correlate with greater immunosuppression and worse outcomes [^34265c31] [^d20af4c5].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the evidence, **restrictive transfusion strategies** are recommended to minimize transfusion-related immunomodulation and its potential impact on colon cancer progression:

- **Restrictive transfusion thresholds**: Hemoglobin thresholds of 7–8 g/dL are generally recommended unless symptomatic anemia is present [^6e6b58a0].

- **Blood conservation strategies**: Minimize intraoperative blood loss and utilize autologous transfusion or cell salvage when feasible [^ab26a67e].

- **Leukoreduction**: While not eliminating TRIM, leukoreduction may reduce its severity [^notfound].

- **Alternative oxygen carriers**: Investigate alternatives (e.g. hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers) to mitigate storage-related immunomodulatory effects [^257af819].

---

Blood transfusion in colon cancer patients induces **TRIM** [^6306bd6b] — with Treg expansion, NK dysfunction, and a Th1-to-Th2 shift [^3c5ba918] — and is further amplified by storage lesions [^723a2c10], leading to suppressed anti-tumor immunity and worse outcomes [^aaba619e]. Restrictive transfusion and blood conservation are prudent to limit these effects [^6e6b58a0].

### Inflammatory response, immunosuppression, and cancer recurrence after perioperative blood transfusions [^0bc94ab3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Debate on appropriate triggers for transfusion of allogeneic blood products and their effects on short- and long-term survival in surgical and critically ill patients continue with no definitive evidence or decisive resolution. Although transfusion-related immune modulation (TRIM) is well established, its influence on immune competence in the recipient and its effects on cancer recurrence after a curative resection remains controversial. An association between perioperative transfusion of allogeneic blood products and risk for recurrence has been shown in colorectal cancer in randomized trials; whether the same is true for other types of cancer remains to be determined. This article focuses on the laboratory, animal, and clinical evidence to date on the mechanistic understanding of inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects of blood products and their significance for recurrence in the cancer surgical patient.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with postoperative systemic inflammatory response and poorer outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer [^88501f30]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Allogeneic blood transfusion in the perioperative period is widely thought to be negatively associated with short-term postoperative outcomes and survival in patients undergoing surgery for cancer, with an older Cochrane review, a recent large propensity score matched study of over 4000 patients, and a very recent comprehensive meta-analysisreporting this to be the case. However, two propensity score matched cohorts from a single group of researchers found no negative impact on survival in colonor rectal cancer, and a smaller recent observational study found no independent impact of blood transfusion on colorectal cancer recurrence when corrected for preoperative anemia. It is unclear why more recent studies tend to report no impact on survival. It may be that modern blood donation, processing, and transfusion guidelines lead to a lower negative risk profile, or it may relate to the analyses used by the reporting groups. With this in mind, the present study included preoperative anemia as a matching variable along with a wider variety of other perioperative variables, and the results are in favor of a negative impact on both short- and long-term outcomes. Given the association between perioperative blood transfusion and postoperative systemic inflammatory response, it is possible that the contribution of blood transfusion to postoperative immunologic dissonance is the mechanism by which such outcomes are affected. Indeed, this would be in keeping with older evidence reporting even poorer outcomes in patients who both received a perioperative blood transfusion and experienced a postoperative infective complication.

### Is immunotherapy the only treatment some people need?-NCI… [^93737d2e]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

The leaders of those trials and other experts stressed that much more research is needed before this treatment approach becomes part of everyday cancer care. But they agreed that the findings so far are highly encouraging. The most recent results come from a 35-patient clinical trial conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Most patients in the trial had locally advanced colorectal cancer. Perhaps most important, however, was that all participants' tumors had specific genetic changes — known as MSI-high or dMMR — that make them particularly good candidates for immunotherapy. And there are additional reasons to think that, in certain people — primarily whose tumors have certain genetic alterations/characteristics — giving immunotherapy prior to surgery may be particularly effective. Among those are people with MSI-high and dMMR tumors, which is the case for about 15% of people with colorectal cancer. MSI-high and dMMR tumor cells tend to have more mutated genes than most cancer cells.

Those genes, in turn, can cause the tumor cells to make more mutant proteins that the immune system might recognize as foreign and attack. In other words, the large number of mutated genes in MSI-high and dMMR tumor cells "means that you have a ton of targets for the immune system to go after, " Dr. Gulley said, "and at least one of them is likely to be clinically relevant". Of the 18 patients who didn't get surgery, 10 completed the full year of pembrolizumab and most had no evidence of cancer on routine imaging scans during the study period. The cancer returned or progressed in several patients, most of whom went on to have "salvage surgery" to remove the tumor. The findings, Dr. Ludford and the team wrote, suggest that a short course of immunotherapy could be a "definitive approach" for people with locally advanced MSI-high or dMMR tumors — that is, it could be their sole treatment.

Last year, even more impressive results were reported from a similar but smaller trial conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. That trial included 12 people with rectal cancer whose tumors were MSI-high or dMMR. Becoming part of standard cancer care. With the evidence emerging from trials like this, Dr. Chalabi said she believes colorectal cancer treatment may soon change. "I believe that neoadjuvant immunotherapy has a very strong potential to become the standard of care for people with dMMR colon cancer, " she said during her presentation at the ESMO meeting.

### Perioperative blood transfusions and cancer progression: a narrative review [^90772a10]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the most recent evidence about known controversies on the effect of perioperative transfusion on cancer progression.

Recent Findings

Laboratory evidence suggests that transfusion-related immunomodulation can be modified by blood management and storage practices, but it is likely of less intensity than the effect of the surgical stress response. Clinical evidence has questioned the independent effect of blood transfusion on cancer progression for some cancers but supported it for others. Despite major changes in surgery and anesthesia, cancer surgery remains a major player in perioperative blood product utilization. Prospective data is still required to strengthen or refute existing associations. Transfusion-related immunomodulation in cancer surgery is well-documented, but the extent to which it affects cancer progression is unclear. Associations between transfusion and cancer progression are disease-specific. Increasing evidence shows autologous blood transfusion may be safe in cancer surgery.

The impact of multimodal therapy on anti-tumour immune response

How altered immune responses recover following systemic chemotherapy, either in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, remains poorly understood and is not considered in current treatment strategies. Depletion of all the main subtypes of circulating lymphocytes has been observed for up to 12 months following standard chemotherapy in non-colorectal cancers. It would seem counterintuitive to induce immunosuppression at a time when the immune system should be at maximal functional capacity. Whilst chemotherapy activates anti-tumour immune responses, it may also deplete functional immune cells. Understanding the underpinning molecular mechanisms of treatment-related immune dysfunction may guide strategy approach (e.g. neoadjuvant vs adjuvant therapy).

Evaluation of the immune response to surgery has focused on mechanisms that drive post-operative recovery including single cell analysis for unique signatures that predict it. Surgical-induced stress evokes an immunosuppressive environment stimulating the inflammatory cascade with secretion of chemokines and cytokines and increasing levels of Tregs. Does this lead to a permissive environment where tumour cells could thrive? It is plausible because Treg proliferation hinders anti-tumour surveillance and perioperative NK cell cytotoxicity may be impaired for up to 2 months.

General anaesthesia may also evoke immune modulation independent of surgical insult. Both inhalational and intravenous anaesthetic agents inhibit NK cell activity, induce T-cell apoptosis, and enhance angiogenesis through hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). The magnitude of these effects varies depending on the specific agent used. There is evidence that intravenous anaesthesia induces less immunosuppression than inhalational and regional agents such that it may be a preferred approach for oncological surgery. In addition, regional anaesthesia use should reduce perioperative opioid requirements to minimise transient opiate-induced suppression of NK cytotoxicity.

Perioperative allogenic blood transfusion is associated with an increased likelihood of disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality in CRC. It has been postulated that the association between blood transfusion and cancer recurrence is due to transfusion-related immune modulation (TRIM). TRIM is a biological phenomenon characterised by induction of suppressor T cells, inhibition of NK cell function and polarisation of the immune system to Th2 response, with suppression of Th1 response. Enhanced systemic inflammation (higher levels of IL-6) and decreased immunity (lower CD8 + T-cell counts) were observed post-transfusion in patients undergoing resection for CRC.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with postoperative systemic inflammatory response and poorer outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer [^4b8fe8d8]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

A significant proportion of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer require allogeneic blood transfusion in the perioperative period. Such transfusions are associated with infective postoperative complications and anastomotic leak. They are also associated with disease recurrence, and this effect is even greater in the presence of infective complications. Therefore, it has long been hypothesized that allogeneic blood transfusion might impair the host adaptive immune response to both pathogens and circulating or micrometastatic tumor cells.

There is increasing evidence that an exaggerated postoperative systemic inflammatory response following surgery for colorectal cancer is associated with postoperative complications and long-term survival. Furthermore, there is some observational evidence that modulation of this response can improve both short-, and long-term outcomes. It may be that perioperative blood transfusion and postoperative complications have a negative impact on oncologic outcomes via a common pathway, the systemic inflammatory response.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between perioperative blood transfusion and the magnitude of postoperative systemic inflammatory response, in particular C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin, which have been reported to be reliable indicators of the magnitude of surgical injury. Furthermore, the study aimed to examine the impact of blood transfusion on the development of postoperative complications and long-term outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with postoperative systemic inflammatory response and poorer outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer [^3a8b43dd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of the present study report a significant association between perioperative blood transfusion, an exaggerated postoperative systemic inflammatory response, postoperative complications and survival following surgery for colorectal cancer. This remained the case even after propensity score matching for variables known to be associated with blood transfusion, postoperative systemic inflammatory response, and postoperative complications. Although blood transfusion is recognized to be associated with healthcare-related serious infectionand short- and long-term outcomes following colorectal cancer resection, this study lends evidence to one of the proposed mechanisms — modulation of the host immune response to surgery.

There is increasing evidence that an exaggerated postoperative systemic inflammatory response is associated with postoperative complications and poorer oncologic outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.–It is hypothesized that the primarily innate immune response to the trauma of surgery leads to relative suppression of adaptive responses. The reduced efficacy of this useful anticancer response, coupled with the pro-metastatic nature of the innate cellular, cytokine and neurohormonal surgical response, may increase the risk of recurrence. Furthermore, it has been observed that modulation of the postoperative systemic inflammatory response with perioperative corticosteroids is associated with fewer postoperative complications and improved survival; however, these findings are yet to be confirmed in prospective trials.

### Blood transfusion had no influence on the 5-year biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a retrospective study [^bc835010]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that perioperative transfusion was not independent factor for 5-year BCR in patients undergoing RARP. In addition, this study found that pathologic T stage, N stage, Gleason score, and surgical margin were independently associated with an increased 5-year BCR.

Several studies focused on how transfusion causes pro-tumorigenic environment and supported a significant association between transfusion and increased recurrence in patients undergoing surgery for colon, stomach, liver, or bladder cancer. There are several pathophysiology to explain the effect of blood transfusion on tumor recurrence in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Surgical manipulation may enable malignant cells to circulate in the bloodstream. Moreover, anesthetics and opioids attenuate host immunity, leading to a permissive tumor environment. Indeed, previous work assessed perioperative changes in the ratio of Th1/Th2 cells period in surgical patients, and observed a shift toward a Th2 immune response, indicative of a significant alteration in the composition of the immune system. Post-surgical immunosuppression may be further aggravated by transfusion as RBCs can also modulate the immune system, a phenomena referred to as transfusion related immunomodulation (TRIM). There are 4 mechanisms for TRIM; (1) suppression of cytotoxic cell and monocyte activity; (2) release of immunosuppressive prostaglandins; (3) inhibition of interleukin-2 production; (4) increased suppressor T-cell activity. Contrary to those studies, we found that transfusion was not associated with increased 5-year BCR in patients undergoing RARP.

### Effect of perioperative allogeneic red blood cell transfusion on the immune-inflammatory response after colorectal cancer resection [^1e391d50]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Cytokines play an important role in the acute-phase response to trauma. Few studies have analyzed the effects of allogeneic blood transfusion containing packed red blood cells (RBCs) on the early postoperative immune/inflammatory response after colorectal resection for cancer This study investigated whether allogeneic RBC transfusion influences the postoperative immune/inflammatory response of patients submitted to large bowel resection due to cancer. A total of 26 patients — 15 men and 11 women, with a median age of 56.5 years (range 24–87 years) — were prospectively studied. Blood samples were obtained preoperatively and on the first and fourth postoperative days for C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10 assays and for CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts. Transfused (≥ 3 and < 3 units), and nontransfused patients were compared. Both IL-6 and IL-10 increased postoperatively in transfused patients (p < 0.01). The serum IL-6 level was higher in patients receiving ≥ 3 units of RBCs (p < 0.01). CRP increased postoperatively unrelated to blood transfusion. The CD8 count decreased (p < 0.04) in transfused subjects, whereas CD4 decreased (p < 0.01) only in major-transfusion patients. Perioperative allogeneic RBC transfusion enhances the inflammatory systemic response and decreased immunity in patients submitted to colorectal resection for cancer.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with postoperative systemic inflammatory response and poorer outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer [^d2c9c5a0]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The present study reports a significant association between perioperative blood transfusion, the postoperative systemic inflammatory response, complications and survival following surgery for colorectal cancer. Furthermore, in those who received a blood transfusion, an exaggerated perioperative innate systemic inflammatory response appeared to compound the negative effects on short- and long-term outcomes. Although the described relationship between blood transfusion and poorer outcomes is not new, the present study suggests a possible mechanism, i.e. modulation of the postoperative systemic inflammatory response.

### Association among blood transfusion, postoperative infectious complications, and cancer-specific survival in patients with stage II / III gastric cancer after radical gastrectomy: emphasizing benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy [^54d1ac6a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

With respect to survival, both BTF and infections were confirmed to have an adverse impact on CSS. More importantly, and for the first time, a synergistic adverse influence of both receiving BTF and developing infections on the CSS of GC patients was confirmed, which was echoed by the results of Aquina and colleagues. In their study of 24,230 stage I to III colon cancer cases, after risk adjustment, BTF and sepsis were found to be associated with poorer OS, CSS, and cardiovascular disease-specific survival. Additionally, there was an additive effect in those patients who experienced both BTF and sepsis. This finding can be partly explained by systemic inflammation and depression of host immune response during an operation, transfusion, and infections that accelerate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Because BTF has an independent, and also a synergistic influence with regard to infection on prognosis after curative resection for GC, to reduce the risk of infection and improve survival, restrictive transfusion practice seems to be a promise strategy. In fact, some prospective, multicenter, large-scale studies have compared short and long outcomes after restrictive (hemoglobin < 70 or 75 g/L) or liberal (hemoglobin < 90 or 85 g/L) levels during surgery or after hematopoietic cell transplantation and concluded that a restrictive transfusion strategy would reduce the number of transfusions required without impacting on the mortality rate. It seems inappropriate to copy their experiences verbatim in patients who underwent gastrectomy and, more importantly, whether different BTF strategies would influence the prognosis of patients with malignancy, but this issue has rarely been investigated. Preoperative iron supplementation and transfusion with leukocyte-depleted red blood cells also may be useful strategies to reduce the requirement for transfusion and the rate of occurrence of infections. To establish whether these measures improve survival, further prospective studies are needed.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with postoperative systemic inflammatory response and poorer outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer [^bd54ae93]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the propensity score matched cohort, perioperative blood transfusion was not associated with sustained significant differences in postoperative Hb. This might suggest that despite the transfusion of PRCs achieving the aim of restoring the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, the impact on the host immune system still leads to poorer outcome.

Alternatively, it is possible that more advanced and bulky tumors lead to longer and more difficult surgery, generating a greater inflammatory response, while also being associated with an increased transfusion requirement and a greater likelihood of morbidity and mortality. Although the propensity score matching process in the present study aimed to correct for most of these confounders, its retrospective nature prevents us from making any causal inference between transfusion and postoperative inflammatory response.

The present study has a number of limitations. Its retrospective nature leads to missing data, and the use of propensity score matching, although designed to reduce confounding, can introduce bias in parameters that have not been recorded or are unknown. Furthermore, its use leads to loss of statistical power. The lack of a formal blood transfusion protocol during the study period means that some patients with preoperative anemia did not receive a perioperative blood transfusion, whereas some patients who were not anemic did, presumably due to intraoperative blood loss or other factors. Compounding this, the small numbers of transfused patients prevented meaningful subgroup analysis of transfusion timing. Estimated blood loss was recorded very poorly, preventing this important variable from being included in the analysis. Despite this, the similar effect sizes found at sensitivity analysis suggest internal validity to the findings.

### Association between peri-operative red blood cell transfusion and cancer recurrence in patients undergoing major cancer surgery: an umbrella review [^3421e654]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is used to treat anaemia in patients undergoing major surgery. Systematic reviews, meta‐analyses and clinical guidelines generally support restrictive RBC use with transfusion 'triggers' of 70–80 g.l ‐1. However, there is potential heterogeneity of treatment effect in different populations and/or at different stages of an illness, with limited evidence for many specific populations. Red blood cell transfusion may cause transfusion‐related immunomodulation – a down‐regulation of the recipient's cellular immunity and immune surveillance systems – which could predispose to cancer recurrence and other adverse outcomes associated with RBC transfusion (e.g. infection).

Early observational studies, mainly in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, reported associations between RBC exposure, cancer recurrence and reduced long‐term survival. Many improvements to RBC production, transfusion practice, general peri‐operative care and cancer treatments have occurred in recent years. These include RBC leucoreduction; blood management programmes; and developments in surgical and anaesthetic practice, which have decreased peri‐operative RBC use. The poor outcomes observed in earlier studies could also be attributed to advanced patient age; comorbidities; pre‐operative anaemia; and difficulty and duration of surgery. Therefore, the observed associations may be as a result of uncontrolled/unmeasured confounding (Fig. 1), and it is plausible that the risk‐to‐benefit balance for RBC transfusion has changed.

Immunosuppression is hypothesised to be the key mediator of transfusion on cancer recurrence. SES, socioeconomic status; pre‐op, pre‐operative; intra‐op, intra‐operative; peri‐op, peri‐operative.

Surveys show variation in practice in postoperative RBC transfusion following cancer surgery. This is relevant to enhanced recovery after surgery programmes, as untreated anaemia may contribute to delayed recovery, for example through fatigue or exacerbation of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of anaemia is likely to increase because of adherence to restrictive transfusion policies recommended by guidelines. As anaemia is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality, there is a need to review the quality of current evidence regarding RBC transfusion for patients undergoing cancer surgery.

### Survival after minimally invasive vs open surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^98790db3]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Surgical Trauma Promoting Cancer Progression

Because surgical trauma of the standard open approach is more extensive than that of minimally invasive surgery, locoregional and systemic effects are more favorable after minimally invasive compared with open surgery. In lung and colon cancer, but not in other cancers, better survival has been reported after minimally invasive compared with open surgery. Much research has concentrated on perioperative locoregional and systemic biologic perturbations involved in cancer recurrence and postoperative development of metastasis. Even in early stages of cancer, circulating tumor cells are detectable both before and after surgical resection of PC, capable of causing cancer recurrence. Surgical trauma induces the release of a number of neuro-endocrine, angiogenic, and growth factors. Release of catecholamines and prostaglandins by damaged tissue can activate tumor cells as they bear surface receptors for these molecules. They and other modulating factors cause immunosuppression and favor metastasis-promoting processes and cancer progression. Platelets, activated during surgery to achieve hemostasis, can form a shell around circulating tumor cells and protect them from destruction by the host immune system. Additional immunosuppression is caused by intraoperative hypothermia that might occur more frequently in open procedures. Hypothermia can cause impaired blood clotting and — secondary to more bleeding — increase the need for blood transfusion. Finally, the association between perioperative blood transfusion and its deleterious effect on the oncologic outcome was shown in a Cochrane review of 36 studies. In the current study, patients in OPS had significantly more transfusion need both intraoperatively and postoperatively.

Limitations

The limitation of this study is its retrospective and thus nonrandomized nature. For now, we believe it is hard to conduct a randomized trial in which participating centers have passed their learning curve on minimally invasive PC surgery and perform at least 50 procedures a year. Ideally, this trial should also be stratified for variables such as TNM stage, simultaneous vascular resection, type of surgical procedure, and neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. We took these variables into account and used them in the propensity score–based comparative analysis and additionally corrected for year of surgery and the type of adjuvant chemotherapy, aiming to minimize the effect of bias. However, it is possible that some not-yet measurable aspect of patient selection or surgeon judgment was at play and was not considered in the propensity score–matched analysis.

### Blood transfusions and prognosis in colorectal cancer: long-term results of a randomized controlled trial [^e494fe3c]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Perioperative blood transfusions may adversely affect survival in patients with colorectal malignancy, although definite proof of a causal relationship has never been reported.

Background

We report the long-term outcomes of a randomized controlled trial performed between 1986 and 1991 to compare the effects of allogeneic blood transfusions and an autologous blood transfusion program in colorectal cancer patients.

Methods

All 475 randomized patients operated upon for colorectal cancer were tracked via a national computerized record-linkage system to investigate survival and cause of death. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to study 20 years' overall survival. Colorectal cancer-specific survival was analyzed over the 10-year time period after surgery.

Results

The overall survival percentage at 20 years after surgery was worse in the autologous group (21%) compared to the allogeneic group (28%) (P = 0.041; log-rank test). Cox regression, allowing for tumor stage, age, and sex, resulted in a hazard ratio (autologous vs allogeneic group) for overall mortality of 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.00–1.54; P = 0.051). Colorectal cancer-specific survival at 10 years for the whole study group was 48% and 60% for the autologous and allogeneic group, respectively (P = 0.020; log-rank test). The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.39 (95 confidence interval 1.05–1.83; P = 0.045).

Conclusions

At long-term follow-up colorectal cancer patients did not benefit from autologous transfusion compared with standard allogeneic transfusion. On the contrary, the overall and colorectal cancer-specific survival rates were worse in the patients in the autologous transfusion group.

### Perioperative blood transfusions, with or without allogeneic leucocytes, relate to survival, not to cancer recurrence [^d1141381]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative blood transfusions are reported to be related to cancer recurrence and reduced survival. Different underlying mechanisms have been proposed, and allogeneic leucocytes in transfused blood have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon.

Methods

Packed red cells without buffy coat (PC group) were compared with filtered, leucoreduced, red cells (LD group) in a randomized trial of 697 patients with colorectal carcinoma. Five-year survival and cancer recurrence rates were determined, with special emphasis on the location of recurrence.

Results

The intention-to-treat analysis showed a survival rate of 63.6 per cent in the PC group and 65.3 per cent in the LD group (P = 0.69), with recurrence rates of 27.8 and 27.9 per cent respectively. The observational analysis showed a significant difference in survival between transfused and non-transfused patients (59.6 versus 72.9 per cent; P < 0.001). The difference in cancer recurrence rate between transfused and non-transfused patients was not statistically significant (29.8 versus 24.3 per cent; P = 0.13). Local recurrences were more frequent in transfused than non-transfused patients (11.9 versus 7.6 per cent; P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Leucocyte depletion of perioperative transfused blood has no effect on long-term survival and/or cancer recurrence. Perioperative blood transfusions are associated with impaired survival, but not with cancer recurrence. The slight increase in local recurrence rate in transfused patients appears to be related to complicated, in particular rectal, surgery.

### Perioperative blood transfusions and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective study [^cfd654a1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Surgery remains the most effective treatment for stage I to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the second most common cancer in the United States. Although the rate of perioperative blood transfusions in patients with NSCLC is relatively low, the number of patients who will receive packed red blood cells (pRBCs) across the world during surgery for NSCLC is not insignificant and hence their exposition to adverse effects of blood transfusions. Unfortunately, administration of pRBCs is associated with a distinct pathology of immunosuppression, known as transfusion related immune suppression (TRIM). TRIM has been linked to a number of complications including effects on cancer recurrence. TRIM is considered to contribute to progression of minimal residual disease (MRD) to clinical metastasis particularly in patients who do not receive postoperative chemo-radiation as adjuvant therapy after surgery. Several mechanisms have been described to be responsible of TRIM. The accumulation of tumor growth factors, lysophophatidylcholines and pro-tumoral cytokines in the units of pRBCs along with a predominant immunosuppressive response of the host in reaction to microparticles and fragmented RBCs facilitate the growth of cancer cells. Moreover, patients undergoing lung cancer surgery have significant impairment in their ability to attack cancer cells as the result of cancer itself, surgery, anesthetics and analgesics given intra- and postoperatively. Thus, TRIM may further impair the innate immunity of these patients after surgery.

The results of a Cochrane review indicate that blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk of cancer recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer. Several retrospective studies in patients with NSCLC demonstrated that perioperative blood transfusions were associated with poorer disease-free and overall survival. However, other studies have concluded to the contrary. The published retrospective studies had several limitations including small sample size, differences in the surgical procedures performed, differences in the type of blood products administered, differences in the follow-up duration and the presence of confounding tumor and treatment related factors. Thus, we decided to investigate whether the administration of pRBCs to patients with stage 1–3 NSCLC who underwent tumor resection at MD Anderson Cancer Center had an effect on their recurrence-free survival and overall survival.

### The influence of allogenic blood transfusion in patients having free-flap primary surgery for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^76299bb8]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Perioperative blood transfusions are reported to be related to cancer recurrence and reduced survival. Different underlying mechanisms have been proposed, and allogenic leucocytes in transfused blood have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon. The persistence of antigens in the recipient's circulation might also create an environment, which allows immune system downregulation. This possibility was supported by the evidence that allogenic blood transfusion enhances renal allograft survival; however, it has been hypothesised that blood transfusion-associated immune depression might be deleterious in cancer patients. Although numerous clinical studies have addressed the question of perioperative blood transfusion and cancer recurrence and/or survival, the possibly harmful effect of allogenic blood transfusion on immunomodulation remains unresolved.

To date, there is relatively little published data on blood transfusion and outcome in oropharyngeal cancer. In head and neck cancer, the effect of allogenic blood transfusion has been reported on relatively small numbers of patients with conflicting results (Table 1). Some authors have reported deleterious effects of blood transfusion, while others could not confirm transfusion as an independent predictive factor in multivariate analysis. A recent paper by, specific to oral and oropharyngeal cancer, only showed the outcomes were worse with 3 or more units. This accumulating threshold effect of allogenic blood transfusion has already been seen with colonic and oesophageal cancers. Hence, we undertook this study to test the hypothesis that perioperative blood transfusion has an adverse effect on survival of patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with a gene transcription profile characteristic of immunosuppression: a prospective cohort study [^00d09c20]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Although numerous small studies have suggested that perioperative allogenic blood transfusion may induce immune modulations that create an environment that promotes both microbial growth and tumorigenesis their conclusions are limited by small cohort size, in vitro and ex vivo assays and insensitive protein assays. In addition, these studies largely predate the routine leukodepletion of transfused blood and suggest a causal relationship between immune modulation and the infusion of allogeneic leukocytes; a biological effect that could be ameliorated by pre-storage leukodepletion. It cannot therefore be inferred that a similar immunological response will be observed following exposure to a leukodepleted product. In contrast, the packed red cells transfused in the study reported here were universally leukodepleted. Furthermore, the use of qRT-PCR in this study to assay gene expression allows for a validated ultrasensitive technique to assess immune pathways in the in vivo state. The results we present suggest that the immunosuppression observed following perioperative transfusion may not be solely dependent on the presence of allogeneic leukocytes in the transfused blood. However, despite a 3 log reduction in leukocyte numbers achieved following current filtration techniques some leukocytes do persist and these retain the ability to influence host immune responses.

### Long-term survival after colorectal surgery associated with buffy-coat-poor and leucocyte-depleted blood transfusion: a follow-up study [^71e43f66]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

A Danish clinical trial showed that transfusion with leucocyte-depleted red blood cells reduces postoperative infectious complications compared with cells without buffy-coat. However, the effect on long-term outcome is unknown. We followed up the 142 cancer patients transfused with buffy-coat-poor red cells, the 118 transfused with leucocyte-depleted blood, and the 329 who were not transfused, until 2003. After 7 years' follow-up, survival for those with leucocyte-depleted blood transfusion (46 [41%]) was not significantly different from transfusion of blood without buffy-coat (59 [45%], p = 0.51). Although survival is reduced by blood transfusion, it does not differ between the two transfusion regimens.

### Association among blood transfusion, sepsis, and decreased long-term survival after colon cancer resection [^aaba619e]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the potential additive effects of blood transfusion and sepsis on colon cancer disease-specific survival, cardiovascular disease-specific survival, and overall survival after colon cancer surgery.

Background

Perioperative blood transfusions are associated with infectious complications and increased risk of cancer recurrence through systemic inflammatory effects. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested an association among sepsis, subsequent systemic inflammation, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, no study has investigated the association among transfusion, sepsis, and disease-specific survival in postoperative patients.

Methods

The New York State Cancer Registry and Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System were queried for stage I to III colon cancer resections from 2004 to 2011. Propensity-adjusted survival analyses assessed the association of perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, sepsis, and 5-year colon cancer disease-specific survival, cardiovascular disease-specific survival, and overall survival.

Results

Among 24,230 patients, 29% received a transfusion and 4% developed sepsis. After risk adjustment, transfusion and sepsis were associated with worse colon cancer disease-specific survival [(+)transfusion: hazard ratio (HR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–1.30; (+)sepsis: HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.44–2.35; (+)transfusion/(+)sepsis: HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.87–2.76], cardiovascular disease-specific survival [(+)transfusion: HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.33; (+)sepsis: HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.14–2.31; (+)transfusion/(+)sepsis: HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.58–2.63], and overall survival [(+)transfusion: HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.14–1.29; (+)sepsis: HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.48–2.09; (+)transfusion/(+)sepsis: HR 2.36, 95% CI 2.07–2.68] relative to (-)transfusion/(-)sepsis. Additional analyses suggested an additive effect with those who both received a blood transfusion and developed sepsis having even worse survival.

Conclusions

Perioperative blood transfusions are associated with shorter survival, independent of sepsis, after colon cancer resection. However, receiving a transfusion and developing sepsis has an additive effect and is associated with even worse survival. Restrictive perioperative transfusion practices are a possible strategy to reduce sepsis rates and improve survival after colon cancer surgery.

### Impact of blood transfusions on recurrence and survival after rectal cancer surgery [^ff513b71]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to determine whether type or number of blood units transfused affected short-term and long-term outcome in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer. The number of perioperative blood units is associated with postoperative mortality and overall survival by some authors. In addition, allogenic perioperative blood transfusion has been postulated to produce host immunosuppression and has been reported to result in adverse outcome in patients with colorectal cancer. Autologous blood transfusion might improve results compared with allogenic transfusion.

Methods

Clinical outcome for 597 patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer was analyzed according to their transfusion status. Results for type (autologous or allogenic) and number of blood units transfused were recorded.

Results

Blood transfusion was associated with increased postoperative mortality at 60 days. Patients who received > 3 units had a postoperative mortality of 6 percent compared with 1 percent for patients who received 1 to 3 units and 0 percent for patients who did not require transfusions. No difference was found between patients who received autologous or allogenic blood. Blood transfusions were also associated with impaired overall survival in a univariate analysis, but this finding was not confirmed in the multivariate analysis. The number or type of blood units transfused did not influence oncologic results. Local recurrence rates, distant metastases rates, and disease-free survival were not influenced by transfusion in our patients.

Conclusions

Increased numbers of blood units were associated with postoperative mortality. However, there is no reason, with respect to cancer recurrence or disease-free survival, to use a program of transfusion with autologous blood in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer.

### Prognostic value of ABO blood group in patients with surgically resected colon cancer [^0d4a2caa]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Furthermore, the loss of expression of blood group antigens with malignant transformation and tumour progression is intriguing as a possible mechanism for the association of ABO blood type and colon cancer survival in our study. In addition, the loss of expression of blood group antigens A and B occurs during wound healing. Within hours following wounding, epithelial cells adjacent to the wound site exhibit loss of blood group antigens. After the healing process is complete, the antigens are expressed again. It has been hypothesised that the association between the loss expression of blood group antigens and the risk of metastasis may partially explain our observed differences in colon cancer survival. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that loss of expression of ABH blood type and/or Le a antigens is linked with more aggressive tumours in cancers of the breast and uterine cervix.

We acknowledge the limitations of our retrospective analysis. First, our study population was composed of yellow participants (Chinese population), which somewhat limits the generalisability of our results. Accordingly, the results of further investigations including more diverse populations (white/black/brown participants) from other institutes are needed to confirm our findings. In addition, not all patients had computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest and/or brain at the time of diagnosis, and it is possible that some patients had asymptomatic disease at the time of primary treatment. However, this would have had a negative influence, if any, on survival.

In summary, our results suggested an association between ABO blood group and colon cancer survival. Compared with patients with non-AB blood types (blood types A, B, and O), patients with blood type AB were more likely to have a better survival. The impact of ABO blood type on malignant potential and prognosis in patients with colon cancer remains an interesting area of research, which warrants additional investigation.

### Leucocyte-depleted blood transfusion is an independent predictor of surgical morbidity in patients undergoing elective colon cancer surgery-a single-center analysis of 531 patients [^7d610f2d]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Leukocyte-depleted packed red blood cells (PRBC) were introduced to reduce potential immunomodulatory effects and transfusion-associated morbidity. It has, however, remained unclear, if leucocyte depletion prevents negative side effects of blood transfusion. The aim of this analysis was to examine the effects of leukocyte-depleted PRBC on surgical morbidity after elective colon cancer surgery.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected from 531 consecutive patients undergoing elective colon cancer surgery at a single high-volume center (University Hospital) from 2002 to 2008. Potentially predictive factors for surgical morbidity were tested on univariate and multivariate analysis.

Results

A total of 531 patients with colon cancer were included. A curative (R0) resection was performed in 497 patients (94%). The mortality rate, overall morbidity rate, and surgical morbidity rate were 1.1, 33, and 21%, respectively. Some 135 patients (25%) received perioperative transfusion of PRBCs. On multivariate analysis age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.02–1.06; P = 0.001), BMI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.13; P = 0.003), and PRBC transfusion (2.4, 1.41–4.11; P = 0.001) were revealed as independent predictors of surgical morbidity. The risk of surgical complications increased continuously with the amount of transfused PRBCs. The adverse impact of PRBC transfusion was neither restricted to the timepoint of transfusion (intraoperative or postoperative), nor to the kind of complication (infectious vs noninfectious complication).

Conclusion

Perioperative transfusion of leukocyte-depleted PRBCs has a significantly negative effect on surgical morbidity of patients undergoing elective colon cancer surgery. The use of perioperative blood transfusions in these patients should be avoided, whenever possible.

### Effect of intraoperative blood transfusion on treg and FOXP3 in patients with digestive tract malignancies and different ABO blood types [^b68f9f48]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Intraoperative blood transfusion can lead to an increase in blood Tregs and FOXP3 expression in patients with digestive tract malignancies. Increases were greatest on the first day after surgery and differed among patients with different blood types. Increases were greatest in blood type B and least in blood type A.

### Perioperative blood transfusions for the recurrence of colorectal cancer [^34265c31]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The improvement of renal allograft survival by pre-transplantation transfusions alerted the medical community to the potential detrimental effect of transfusions in patients being treated for cancer.

Objectives

The present meta-analysis aims to evaluate the role of perioperative blood transfusions (PBT) on colorectal cancer recurrence. This is accomplished by validating the results of a previously published meta-analysis (Amato 1998); and by updating it to December 2004.

Search Strategy

Published papers were retrieved using Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, controlled trials web-based registries, or the CCG Trial Database. The search strategy used was: {colon OR rectal OR colorectal} WITH {cancer OR tumor OR neoplasm} AND transfusion. The tendency not to publish negative trials was balanced by inspecting the proceedings of international congresses.

Selection Criteria

Patients undergoing curative resection of colorectal cancer (classified either as Dukes stages A-C, Astler-Coller stages A-C2, or TNM stages T1-3a/N0-1/M0) were included if they had received any amount of blood products within one month of surgery. Excluded were patients with distant metastases at surgery, and studies with short follow-up or with no data.

Data Collection and Analysis

A specific form was developed for data collection. Data extraction was cross-checked, using the most recent publication in case of repetitive ones. Papers' quality was ranked using the method by Evans and Pollock. Odds ratios (OR, with 95% confidence intervals) were computed for each study, and pooled estimates were generated by RevMan (version 4.2). When available, data were stratified for risk factors of cancer recurrence.

Main Results

The findings of the 1998 meta-analysis were confirmed, with small variations in some estimates. Updating it through December 2004 led to the identification of 237 references. Two-hundred and one of them were excluded because they analyzed survival (n = 22), were repetitive (n = 26), letters/reviews (n = 66) or had no data (n = 87). Thirty-six studies on 12,127 patients were included: 23 showed a detrimental effect of PBT; 22 used also multivariable analyses, and 14 found PBT to be an independent prognostic factor. Pooled estimates of PBT effect on colorectal cancer recurrence yielded overall OR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.20 to 1.67) against transfused patients in randomized controlled studies. Stratified meta-analyses confirmed these findings, also when stratifying patients by site and stage of disease. The PBT effect was observed regardless of timing, type, and in a dose-related fashion, although heterogeneity was detected. Data on surgical techniques was not available for further analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis confirms the previous findings. All analyses support the hypothesis that PBT have a detrimental effect on the recurrence of curable colorectal cancers. However, since heterogeneity was detected and conclusions on the effect of surgical technique could not be drawn, a causal relationship cannot still be claimed. Carefully restricted indications for PBT seems necessary.

### Pilot study of sentinel-node-based adoptive immunotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer [^f9e63486]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Life expectancy in stage IV patients is 8–12 months. Even though the cumulative survival was not significantly different from in conventionally treated controls, likely due to the limited number of patients included in our study, the median survival of 2.6 years in the nine immunotherapy-treated stage IV patients is encouraging (Fig. 4 e). The possibility of receiving immunotherapy tended to select patients hesitant to subject themselves to chemotherapy, and therefore the overall amount of chemotherapy used was low. Most patients received only immunotherapy (as described in the "Methods" section). Among the four complete responders, two patients (nos. 14 and 16) received chemotherapy in association with immunotherapy, whereas the other two patients had chemotherapy over 1 year prior to immunotherapy (patients no. 13 and 15). Thus, the clinical results among immunotherapy-treated stage IV patients are unlikely due to chemotherapy. Theoretically, chemotherapy is a two-edged sword. Chemotherapy may decrease the proliferative capability of tumor-reactive T-cells since chemotherapy affects dividing cells, and therefore results may have been underestimated. On the other hand, when chemotherapy is administered, the increased tumor cell death will result in increased antigen presentation to T-lymphocytes, thus increased T-cell reactivity may occur, as discussed in a recent review. It would be interesting to test immunotherapy and chemotherapy in combination in a future systematic study.

To our knowledge, sentinel-node-based immunotherapy in patients with colon cancer is a novel approach. There are some major differences between our study and others that use anti-CD3/anti-CD28 expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, myeloablation, and high-dose IL-2. Firstly, we use sentinel-node-acquired lymphocytes providing a natural antitumoral response, enhanced by ex vivo stimulation with autologous tumor homogenate, physiological doses of IL-2, and restimulation with autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) on one occasion after about 3 weeks of expansion. Only T-lymphocytes with high affinity to antigens from the primary tumor will survive until transfusion. Secondly, myeloablation and high-dose IL-2 regimen entail high toxicity and bring along risk of severe complications, long treatment periods, and high costs. Our transfusions, however, were given without complications, during a period of 1 h, with patients often discharged the same day. Thirdly, our protocol aims at expansion of CD4 + Th1-lymphocytes from sentinel nodes, as opposed to expansion of cytotoxic CD8 + T-lymphocytes harvested as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

### Intravenous vitamin C (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^9f52a06a]. NCI (2013). Low credibility.

- Laboratory studies have reported that IV vitamin C has redox properties and decreased cell proliferation in prostate, pancreatic, hepatocellular, colon, mesothelioma, and neuroblastoma cell lines.
- IV vitamin C has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials.
- IV administration of vitamin C of doses over 500 mg produces much higher blood concentrations of ascorbate than oral administration of the same dose. Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies In Vitro Studies Numerous studies have demonstrated that supraphysiologic concentrations of ascorbic acid decrease cell proliferation in a variety of cancer cell lines. Specifically, decreases in cell proliferation after ascorbic acid treatment have been reported for prostate, pancreatic, hepatocellular, colon, mesothelioma, and neuroblastoma cell lines.

in vitro direct cytotoxic effect of ascorbic acid on various types of cancer cells is mediated through a chemical reaction that generates hydrogen peroxide. Treating colon cancer cells with 2 mM to 3 mM of ascorbic acid resulted in downregulation of specificity protein transcription factors, iron metabolism disruption, and Sp-regulated genes involved in cancer progression. Animal Studies In 2007, researches showed that oral N-acetylcysteine and vitamin C, both thought to act predominantly as antioxidants, may have antitumorigenic actions in vivo by decreasing levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1, a transcription factor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor and plays a role in angiogenesis. 23] This increase in tumor volume was caused by a chemical reaction that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract but does not appear to be relevant to intravenous administration.

Studies in cell culture and performed by adding blood plasma from healthy volunteers given oral vitamin C also showed a significant decrease in bortezomib's growth inhibitory effect on multiple myeloma cells. Another study found similar results. Plasma from healthy volunteers who took 1 g of oral vitamin C per day was shown to decrease bortezomib growth inhibition in multiple myeloma cells and to block its inhibitory effect on 20S proteasome activity.

### Association between peri-operative red blood cell transfusion and cancer recurrence in patients undergoing major cancer surgery: an umbrella review [^2040989a]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The search identified 1595 articles. After screening, we assessed 59 full‐text articles, of which five were suitable for inclusion (Fig. 2). A summary of the five included systematic reviews is shown in Table 2 with detailed results in online Supporting Information Table S1. Of the five studies, four were systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, and one was a systematic review alone. The study period ranged from 1985 to 2019, and included studies analysed between seven and 123 primary data sources. The number of participants ranged from 2110 to 184,190. Two studies analysed data for colorectal cancer only. Three studies analysed data on different solid organ cancers. Four studies reported data on cancer‐related effects of RBC transfusion alone, while one presented this as a subgroup analysis alongside the effects of administration of other blood products. Only two of the studies summarised follow‐up periods with one reporting a mean (SD) observation time of 62.5 (28.8) months and one reporting a range of median follow‐up times from 10 to 99.5 months. Only one study described whether the RBCs used in the included studies were leucodepleted vs. non‐leucodepleted. None of the studies included a clear definition of 'peri‐operative period'. According to AMSTAR 2, four reviews were rated as 'critically low quality', and one as 'low quality' (Fig. 3). A summary of the approach to risk of bias assessment, quality assessment and confounding variable adjustment in each included study is shown in online Supporting Information Table S2.

### Perioperative blood transfusions promote pancreas cancer progression [^9976866e]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Complex abdominal procedures to extirpate malignancies are often associated with blood transfusion. In particular, perioperative transfusion rates for pancreaticoduodenectomy can be as high as 75%. In the early 1970s it was shown that blood transfusions likely had immunomodulating effects as renal allografts were found to have longer survival in patients who received multiple transfusions. Subsequently, it has been suggested that blood transfusions may promote cancer progression. Many retrospective series have supported this hypothesis, and recent studies examining long-term survival in patients undergoing "Whipple" procedures suggests that transfusion is a negative prognostic factor. Despite these studies, the claim that transfusion is a simple surrogate for patient health, tumor size, location, and biology are difficult to refute. The use of syngeneic murine models has allowed many confounding variables to be controlled, and suggest that transfusion does indeed promote pancreas cancer progression. Based on these findings, as well as the continued need for blood transfusion, alternate strategies in transfusion management are warranted.

### Influence of transfusions on perioperative and long-term outcome in patients following hepatic resection for colorectal metastases [^ab26a67e]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if transfusion affected perioperative and long-term outcome in patients undergoing liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer.

Summary Background Data

Blood transfusion produces host immunosuppression and has been postulated to result in adverse outcome for patients undergoing surgical resection of malignancies.

Methods

Blood transfusion records and clinical outcomes for 1,351 patients undergoing liver resection at a tertiary cancer referral center were analyzed.

Results

Blood transfusion was associated with adverse outcome after liver resection. The greatest effect was in the perioperative course, where transfusion was an independent predictor of operative mortality, complications, major complications, and length of hospital stay. This effect was dose-related. Patients receiving one or two units or more than two units had an operative mortality of 2.5% and 11.1%, respectively, compared to 1.2% for patients not requiring transfusions. Transfusion was also associated with adverse long-term survival by univariate analysis, but this factor was not significant on multivariate analysis. Even patients receiving only one or two units had a more adverse outcome.

Conclusions

Perioperative blood transfusion is a risk factor for poor outcome after liver resection. Blood conservation methods should be used to avoid transfusion, especially in patents currently requiring limited amounts of transfused blood products.

### Effects of immune suppression for transplantation on inflammatory colorectal cancer progression [^2ee06226]. Oncogenesis (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This patient presented with an advanced adenocarcinoma of the anal transitional zone 1 year after a kidney transplant and 6 years after his first rectal cancer. The timing (6 years later), the stage at onset, the KRAS mutation pattern and the MMR gene status were different between the cancers, but the different speed of progression was the most striking, and fatal, feature. The influence of immunosuppressive regimens on malignant behavior in kidney recipients has long been debated –. In those patients on a TAC plus MPS plus prednisone-based regimen, the appearance of malignancies has been noted significantly earlier, suggesting a quicker cancer progression. Interestingly, our patient received a massive immunosuppressive load with anti-thymocyte globulins and a switch to a TAC plus MPS plus prednisone-based regimen after the episode of acute rejection, which occurred 6 months before the diagnosis of metastatic anal transitional zone adenocarcinoma. Moreover, this cancer showed an unexpected reduced T cell infiltration, contrary to what is usually observed in CRC with MMR defects or in UC-related CRC. In fact, in our patient, CD4 and CD8 infiltration within the tumor was similar to that observed in post-transplant CRCs and lower than that observed in UC-related CRCs, suggesting a deep effect on cancer microenvironment of post-transplant immunosuppression regimen. Thus, our hypothesis is that the immunosuppressive medication caused the dramatic acceleration of the colonic inflammatory carcinogenesis.

### Impact of anesthetics, analgesics, and perioperative blood transfusion in pediatric cancer patients: a comprehensive review of the literature [^00ddd0dd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in developed countries. Children and adolescents with cancer need surgical interventions (ie, biopsy or major surgery) to diagnose, treat, or palliate their malignancies. Surgery is a period of high vulnerability because it stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, catecholamines, and angiogenesis activators, which coincides with a period of immunosuppression. Thus, during and after surgery, dormant tumors or micrometastasis (ie, minimal residual disease) can grow and become clinically relevant metastasis. Anesthetics (ie, volatile agents, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine) and analgesics (ie, opioids) may also contribute to the growth of minimal residual disease or disease progression. For instance, volatile anesthetics have been implicated in immunosuppression and direct stimulation of cancer cell survival and proliferation. Contrarily, propofol has shown in vitro anticancer effects. In addition, perioperative blood transfusions are not uncommon in children undergoing cancer surgery. In adults, an association between perioperative blood transfusions and cancer progression has been described for some malignancies. Transfusion-related immunomodulation is one of the mechanisms by which blood transfusions can promote cancer progression. Other mechanisms include inflammation and the infusion of growth factors. In the present review, we discuss different aspects of tumorigenesis, metastasis, angiogenesis, the immune system, and the current studies about the impact of anesthetics, analgesics, and perioperative blood transfusions on pediatric cancer progression.

### Navigating the prognostic role of transfusions after CAR-T [^d6f6bdce]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Another striking finding of this study was the remarkably shorter overall survival and increased rate of disease progression and relapse in the transfusion group, particularly during the early phase. However, these data should be interpreted in the context of the significant disease burden carried by the patients in the transfusion group. For example, patients who needed transfusions were older (63% aged > 60 years), had poor performance status (25% with ECOG ≥ 2), more than one-third displayed bulky disease, and 84% received systemic bridging therapy to control their disease during CAR-T manufacturing. As a result, transfusion needs may simply represent a surrogate marker for higher risk disease features. Additionally, the authors also postulated that transfusions may negatively affect the recipient's immune system through various mechanisms, potentially impairing CAR T-cell function in a phenomenon called transfusion-related immunomodulation, although this would require further mechanistic exploration in the context of CAR-T. Intriguingly, the transfusion group also demonstrated an approximately twofold increase in the rate of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) compared to the control group. This was particularly evident for early transfusions, suggesting these patients also developed concurrent severe ICAHT with profound neutropenia. Although nonrelapse-related causes of death were not captured in this analysis for each group separately, one may speculate that the higher NRM rate in patients receiving transfusions may reflect an increase in fatal infections due to severe hematotoxicity. In line with this, we recently demonstrated that severe ICAHT was associated with increased transfusion requirements, a higher rate of severe infections, and increased infection-driven NRM.

### Blood transfusion promotes cancer progression: a critical role for aged erythrocytes [^5abc3609]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In cancer patients, allogeneic blood transfusion is associated with poorer prognosis, but the independent effect of the transfusion is controversial. Moreover, mediating mechanisms underlying the alleged cancer-promoting effects of blood transfusion are unknown, including the involvement of donors' leukocytes, erythrocytes, and soluble factors.

Method

Two syngeneic tumor models were used in Fischer 344 rats, the MADB106 mammary adenocarcinoma and the CRNK-16 leukemia. Outcomes included host ability to clear circulating cancer cells, and host survival rates. The independent impact of blood transfusion was assessed, and potential deleterious characteristics of the transfusion were studied, including blood storage duration; the role of erythrocytes, leukocyte, and soluble factors; and the kinetics of the effects.

Results

Blood transfusion was found to be an independent and significant risk factor for cancer progression in both models, causing up to a fourfold increase in lung tumor retention and doubling mortality rates. Blood storage time was the critical determinant of these deleterious effects, regardless of whether the transfused blood was allogeneic or autogenic. Surprisingly, aged erythrocytes (9 days and older), rather than leukocytes or soluble factors, mediated the effects, which occurred in both operated and nonoperated animals. The effects of erythrocytes transfusion in the MADB106 model emerged immediately and dissipated within 24 h.

Conclusions

In rats, transfusion of fresh blood is less harmful than transfusion of stored blood in the context of progressing malignancies. Further studies should address mediating mechanisms through which erythrocytes' storage duration can impact the rate of complications while treating malignant diseases and potentially other pathologies.

### The preoperative lymphocyte to monocyte ratio predicts clinical outcome in patients with stage III colon cancer [^05323abd]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

In Europe, similar to the United States, colorectal cancer ranks third place of cancer overall and even second leading cause of cancer-related death affecting both, males and females. There is still a high mortality caused by colorectal cancer, mainly resulting from tumour dissemination. Despite multiple systemic treatment options in advanced colon cancer, surgery is still the mainstay of treatment in non-metastatic disease. In non-metastatic disease 5-year survival rates range from about 40 to 90 percent, depending on clinical stage. 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with stage III and high-risk stage II colon cancer after curative surgery. However, a large number of colon cancer patients does not benefit from adjuvant treatment, either because these patients are cured by surgery alone or because they develop tumour recurrence or distant metastases despite adjuvant treatment. There is intense interest in the elucidation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers that will improve clinical outcome through patient classification. Despite the fact, that up to now, promising results for molecular biomarkers could be found, they still have not come to routine clinical practice, due to high costs or missing standardisation and evidence.

The knowledge about the bilateral influence of cancer and inflammation was discovered over a century ago; however, interest in this topic has revived in the last few years. Nevertheless, up to now, tumour–inflammation interaction has not been completely explained. The variation in systemic inflammatory cell amount might be a valuable pretreatment prognostic marker for stratifying patients at risk for tumour recurrence in colon cancer, as it could be shown for example in the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio or platelet to lymphocyte ratio in various cancer entities.

One reason for these findings could be the accumulation of genetic failures over time, leading to oncogenic activation, simultaneously, inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, which are responsible for higher transcription of inflammatory mediators resulting in an inflammatory condition in tumour cell environment. Another reason might be, that tumour-related leukocytes, especially monocytes, which are main regulators of cancer inflammation, have an essential role in systemic inflammatory response to tumorous disease. Up to now there are no data in solid tumours regarding the lymphocyte to monocyte ratio as a prognostic marker. However, recent results in haematologic malignancies suggest that survival benefit is associated with an increased LMR. The LMR might be a good reflection of both, lymphopenia that is a surrogate marker of weak immune response and an increased monocyte count, standing for a microenvironment surrogate marker of high tumour burden.

### Pilot study of sentinel-node-based adoptive immunotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer [^c619368d]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Follow-up

Patients were clinically evaluated according to the regular follow-up program after diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer in Sweden. Follow-up visits usually took place 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after cell transfusion. On each of these occasions, general condition was estimated and the amount of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum was measured. Every 6 months the patients were also examined for presence of liver and lung metastases by ultrasound, X-ray or computer tomography (CT) scan, or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Assessment of clinical response was made by comparison of radiographic measurements and physical examinations before and after treatment using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Complete disappearance of all evaluable disease was defined as complete response (CR). Partial response (PR) was defined as decrease of 50% or more in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as no signs of tumor progression between two consecutive CT evaluations of measurable remaining disease or lack of additional (stage IV) or no appearance of metastatic lesions (stage II and III).

Statistical Analysis

The number of cells received by patients with SD and PR disease was compared with the number of cells received by patients classified as CR using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. All patients in the Stockholm colon cancer registry diagnosed during the year 2003 with stage IV (n = 174) were used as a control group for cumulative survival comparison. The survival time of the nine stage IV patients treated with immunotherapy and the control stage IV cohort were plotted in an actuarial survival diagram. Survival times were compared using log-rank (Mantel–Cox) analysis. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

### The importance of blood loss during colon cancer surgery for long-term survival: an epidemiological study based on a population based register [^8031316c]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study tested the hypothesis that the amount of blood loss during surgery for colonic cancer influences long-term survival.

Background

The perioperative blood loss during surgery for colorectal cancer relates to the risk for complications and early mortality.

Methods

All patients who underwent surgery for colon cancer between 1997 and 2003 in the health-care region of Uppsala/Örebro were prospectively registered at the regional oncological center. Data on patients who underwent radical surgery for stages I to III disease were analyzed. Patients who died within 6 months after surgery were excluded. Hazard ratios were calculated with uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. Because of covariation, blood loss, blood transfusion, and complications were tested in separate multivariate analyses.

Results

Blood loss of 250 mL or more during surgery, male gender, occurrence of complications, age more than 75 years, and stage III disease were risk factors for overall mortality in the uni- and multivariate analyses. Perioperative blood transfusion was shown to be a risk factor in the univariate analysis only.

Conclusions

The results support the hypothesis that degree of blood loss during surgery for colon cancer is a factor that influences long-term survival.

### The influence of allogenic blood transfusion in patients having free-flap primary surgery for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^d20af4c5]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

To date, clinical trials are inconclusive as to whether tumour recurrence rate is higher after transfusion in head and neck cancer. Our study suggests that the local and systemic cancer recurrence rate is higher in those patients who were transfused with 3 or more units of blood. Given that the volume of blood transfused appears to be of prime importance in this worsened outcome, it is likely that the underlying cause is a dose-related immune suppression. The earliest reports of immunomodulation after blood transfusion in the 1970s were in the field of renal transplantation where transfusion before transplantation was accompanied with an improved allograft survival. Improved graft survival is associated with an increasing number of transfusions before transplantation, with a near maximal benefit after 5 units. These data suggest that there may be an immunomodulatory threshold effect related to volume of blood transfused. In the context of cancer surgery, a similar finding has been demonstrated in that the adverse influence of blood transfusion on survival is seen only after larger transfusions for colorectal tumours, soft-tissue sarcomas and oesophageal cancers. Our results would appear to support the existence of a threshold effect, which has been demonstrated previously.

Transfusion-related immunosuppression consists of a monocyte-mediated early phase and a later phase, which is characterised by increased suppressor T-cell activity. Both effects appear to be dependent on the number of transfusions. Allogenic blood transfusion has been shown to impair natural killer cell function and also inhibit interleukin-2 production, both mechanisms crucial for normal antitumour activity.

Although it is not entirely clear at molecular level which factors modulate the effects of allogenic blood transfusion in cancer surgery, there is good evidence that leucocytes in the blood mediate them.

The patients in the current study did not have leukocyte-depleted transfusions until 1999, since when all allogenic blood for transfusion in our hospital has been leucocyte depleted. This is part of a nationwide policy in the United Kingdom aimed at minimising the possibility of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease being passed through transfusion of blood orblood products. Although most of the possible detrimental effects of blood transfusion are thought to be mediated via the transfused leucocytes, we were unable to find any significant differences in the clinical outcome of patients before and after the leucocyte depletion policy was implemented.

### Large variation in blood transfusion use after colorectal resection: a call to action [^6eed1b99]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk of adverse postoperative outcomes through immunomodulatory effects.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with variation in blood transfusion use after elective colorectal resection and associated postoperative infectious complications

Design

This was a retrospective cohort study.

Settings

The study included elective colorectal resections in New York State from 2001 to 2013.

Patients

The study cohort consists of 125,160 colorectal resections. Patients who were admitted nonelectively or who were admitted before the date of surgery were excluded.

Main Outcome Measures

Receipt of a perioperative allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and the secondary end points of postoperative pneumonia, surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, and sepsis were measured.

Results

The overall rate of perioperative blood transfusion for the study cohort was 13.9%. The unadjusted blood transfusion rates ranged from 2.4% to 58.7% for individual surgeons and 2.9% to 32.8% for individual hospitals. After controlling for patient-, surgeon-, and hospital-level factors in a 3-level mixed-effects multivariable model, significant variation was still present across both surgeons (p < 0.0001) and hospitals (p < 0.0001), with a 16.8-fold difference in adjusted blood transfusion rates across surgeons and a 13.2-fold difference in adjusted blood transfusion rates across hospitals. Receipt of a blood transfusion was also independently associated with pneumonia (OR = 3.23 (95% CI, 2.92–3.57)), surgical site infection (OR = 2.27 (95% CI, 2.14–2.40)), intra-abdominal abscess (OR = 2.72 (95% CI, 2.41–3.07)), and sepsis (OR = 4.51 (95% CI, 4.11–4.94)).

Limitations

Limitations include the retrospective design and the possibility of miscoding within administrative data.

Conclusions

Large surgeon- and hospital-level variations in perioperative blood transfusion use for patients undergoing colorectal resection are present despite controlling for patient-, surgeon-, and hospital-level factors. In addition, receipt of a blood transfusion was independently associated with an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications. These findings support the creation and implementation of perioperative blood transfusion protocols aimed at limiting unwarranted variation.

### Intrahepatic CD69V δ 1 T cells re-circulate in the blood of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and limit tumor progression [^0dccd646]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The metastatic progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) to livers occurs in approximately 50% of patients and still represents an unmet clinical need lacking a cure. The surgical resection of colon liver metastases (CLM) is the only available treatment increasing patients' overall survival (OS), while definitive and shared clinical criteria that stratifies patients' eligibility to surgery and/or neoadjuvant conventional/biological chemotherapies (na-CHT) are still missing.

Targeting different aspects of antitumor immune responses in primary or metastatic tumors (MTs) is key for the development of new clinical tools to predict cancer progression and develop alternative therapeutic strategies. Indeed, since the diagnostic potential of resected/biopsied tumors is hampered by multiple methodological and ethical constraints, there is a growing interest in finding immune prognostic variables within the so-called 'liquid biopsies' from peripheral blood (PB). In this scenario, tumor-infiltrating (TI) lymphocytes (TILs) have been also found in the PB of patients affected by different cancers. The development of new single-cell technologies with an unprecedented degree of immunological resolution can now identify in 'liquid biopsies' T cells showing tumor specificities similar to those of their homologs in neoplastic lesions.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with postoperative systemic inflammatory response and poorer outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer [^aa25e4c8]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The present study investigated relationships between perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative systemic inflammatory response, and outcomes following surgery for colorectal cancer.

Methods

Data were recorded for patients (n = 544) undergoing potentially curative, elective surgery for colorectal cancer at a single center between 2012 and 2017. Transfusion history was obtained retrospectively from electronic records. Associations between blood transfusion, postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, hemoglobin, complications, cancer-specific survival and overall survival (OS) were assessed using propensity score matching (n = 116).

Results

Of 544 patients, the majority were male (n = 294, 54%), over 65 years of age (n = 350, 64%), and with colonic (n = 347, 64%) node-negative disease (n = 353, 65%). Eighty-six patients (16%) required perioperative blood transfusion. In the unmatched cohort, blood transfusion was associated with higher median postoperative day (POD) 3 CRP {143 [interquartile range (IQR) 96–221 mg/L] vs. 120 (IQR 72–188 mg/L); p = 0.004}, lower median POD 3 albumin [24 (IQR 20–26 g/L) vs. 27 (IQR 24–30 g/L); p < 0.001], more postoperative complications [odds ratio (OR) 3.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.03–5.29] and poorer OS [hazard ratio (HR) 3.18, 95% CI 2.08–4.84]. In the propensity score matched cohort, blood transfusion was similarly associated with higher median POD 3 CRP [130 (IQR 93–196 mg/L) vs. 113 (IQR 66–173 mg/L); p = 0.046], lower median POD 3 albumin [24 (IQR 20–26 g/L) vs. 26 (IQR 24–30 g/L); p < 0.001], more postoperative complications (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.36–6.20) and poorer OS (HR 2.38, 95% CI 0.99–5.73).

Conclusions

Perioperative blood transfusion was associated with postoperative inflammation, complications, and poorer survival in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, with and without propensity score techniques.

### Effect of intraoperative blood transfusion on treg and FOXP3 in patients with digestive tract malignancies and different ABO blood types [^774c3cdb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results found that intraoperative blood transfusion may lead to an increase in Treg and FOXP3 in the blood of patients with digestive tract malignancies. For the patients with different ABO blood types, there was increase in Treg and FOXP3, but differed in degree. The patients with blood type B had the highest increase and those with blood type A showed the lowest increase.

The immune system plays a key role in the body's defense against malignancy. While immune function in patients with malignant tumors is often impaired, the specific mechanism is not clear. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Tregs and FOXP3 are increased in the peripheral blood and tumors of patients with digestive tract malignancies and are positively correlated with tumor stage. In addition, increases of Tregs and FOXP3 in patients with digestive tract malignancies are associated with a poor prognosis because of an association with tumor immune escape. Tregs are mainly produced by the thymus (tTregs), but can also be produced in the periphery (pTregs) or induced in cell culture (iTregs). Tregs can directly or indirectly inhibit the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, monocytes, B cells, inhibit the expression of macrophages, and regulate the expression of T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 2 (Th2) cells. This occurs through direct cell-to-cell contact, secretion of multiple inhibitory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin (IL)-10, and through inhibiting the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These actions cumulatively exert an immunosuppressive effect on the body's defenses. FOXP3 is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor family. It is specifically expressed on Treg without being affected by activation status and is distinct from other molecular markers of Tregs such as CD25, CD45RB, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR). FOXP3 is the key to the development, activation and function of Tregs. FOXP3 may also participate in the regulation of Tregs through the dual roles of transcription repressor and activator. Only changes in FOXP3 on thymus Tregs can affect Treg numbers in peripheral blood.

### Association between peri-operative red blood cell transfusion and cancer recurrence in patients undergoing major cancer surgery: an umbrella review [^4ece5d4f]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

These factors all risk bias by indication, meaning that the patients receiving the exposure of interest, in this case RBC transfusion, are systematically different from those not receiving it (or receiving less of it) regarding the outcomes of interest. Bias by indication, due to inadequate correction for confounding variables, has been shown on multiple occasions to be a major limitation of observational blood transfusion research. For example, many observational studies suggest transfusing RBCs stored for longer duration may worsen patient outcomes, but when randomised controlled trials were performed these provided no evidence of harm when compared with RBCs stored for a shorter duration. More recently, methodologists have highlighted the need to consider the biological plausibility of effects in relation to time, particularly effects on outcomes that occur early which increases the probability they are explained by confounding.

Three systematic reviews addressed confounding adjustment in the primary studies, but not at the meta‐analysis level, and two reviews did not mention confounding adjustment at any level. These observations highlight the current uncertainty that the RBC exposure–outcome relationship for cancer surgery is causal. One approach to decreasing the risk of confounding in observational studies is propensity analyses. Of relevance, a recent review limiting studies to propensity‐adjusted observational studies in radical surgery for gastric and colorectal cancers found no association between RBC exposure and disease‐free survival. We did not include this study in our review as some of the included studies did not specify only using RBCs as the blood product administered. However, the authors concluded that peri‐operative RBC transfusion was associated with worse overall survival which may be attributable to imbalances in the rates of major postoperative complications after propensity score adjustment.

### Age of blood: does it make a difference? [^415fbfae]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

During the past 20 years, the perceived value of blood transfusions has changed as it has become appreciated that transfusions are not without risk. Red blood cell transfusion has been associated with disease transmission and immunosuppression for some time. More recently, proinflammatory consequences of red blood cell transfusion have also been documented. Moreover, it has become increasingly evident that stored red blood cells undergo time-dependent metabolic, biochemical, and molecular changes. This 'storage lesion' may be responsible for many of the adverse effects of red blood cell transfusion. Clinically, the age of blood has been associated with multiple organ failure, postoperative pneumonia, and wound infection. The relationship between age of blood and clinical adverse effects needs further study.

### Extracellular vesicle impact on immunity following blood transfusion [^43274848]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

Recent insights into extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from platelet (PC) and red blood cell concentrates (RBC), which form during blood product processing and storage.

Recent Findings

EVs impact transfusion outcomes by modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Acting as lipid mediators and expressing adhesion molecules, EVs contribute to immune signaling via cytokines, DAMPs, and antigen-presenting molecules. In RBC, EVs accumulate during storage and are linked to endothelial cell (EC) activation, increased thrombotic risk, and tissue inflammation - especially under existing inflammatory conditions. While their effect on circulating immune cells is limited, they strongly activate tissue-resident immune and EC. In PCs, platelet-derived EVs and other cell-specific EVs also emerge. Certain EV subtypes express CD27, CD70, CD39, and HLA antigens, altering T-cell, B-cell, and monocyte activity. These immunomodulatory effects may contribute to transfusion-related immunomodulation and alloimmunization.

Summary

EVs in stored blood products influence immune responses highlighting the need for monitoring.

### Association between peri-operative red blood cell transfusion and cancer recurrence in patients undergoing major cancer surgery: an umbrella review [^8618c527]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study had strengths and limitations. Our protocol was registered prospectively, used rigorous data extraction methodology and quality assessment tools, and adhered to recommended umbrella review methodology. The strengths of umbrella reviews include structured evaluation of a topic based on published systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. We summarised the broad and complex literature regarding RBC transfusion associations with cancer recurrence across different populations. However, limitations of this approach include the risk of missing studies not included in the included reviews, potential inclusion of individual studies across multiple included systematic reviews and limited quality assessment for the studies included in the systematic reviews. Our umbrella approach also meant we did not examine all the individual observational studies included in the systematic reviews. The risk of confounding is well‐recognised in observational studies in transfusion research. We used group consensus, covering a range of medical specialities, to develop a framework to consider potential confounders to the exposure‐outcome relationships in the reviews. Although this approach could have missed important potential areas of confounding, it allowed a structured method to describe how this was addressed in the systematic reviews identified, alongside the AMSTAR 2 quality assessment tool. Exploring the quality of evidence and uncertainty about the association between transfusion and cancer recurrence, especially with contemporary blood products and transfusion practice, was the main aim of this umbrella review. Other limitations included a search strategy limited to full journal publications in English, which could have missed information in the grey literature, and variation in ascertaining and measuring cancer outcomes. Cancer recurrence and cancer‐free survival were measured in different ways and over different time periods in individual studies. Universal leukoreduction of all blood products was adopted in the UK in 1999 and across many countries in subsequent years. However, individual studies in the systematic reviews still used data from patients before implementation. As the studies include patient data from different countries, variation in leukoreduction practices and policy implementation mean there is inconsistency in blood products given to patients. Leukoreduction reduces the proinflammatory reaction associated with blood transfusion, which may theoretically lessen the impact of transfusion‐related immunomodulation. Even though all the included studies explicitly mentioned that they only included studies looking at RBC products exclusively, some of their included studies either do not specify which blood products were used or used a combination of blood products in their patients.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with a gene transcription profile characteristic of immunosuppression: a prospective cohort study [^075670d3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Differential leucocyte count and gene expression

In order to assess for an association between perioperative variations in white blood cell subpopulations and gene expression, changes in neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and eosinophil counts over the initial 24 hours were compared with changes in individual gene expression over the same period (see Additional file 5). Thirty-six comparisons were generated. Of these, just two attained a level of statistical significance with P < 0.05 before correcting for multiple comparisons. An association was noted between increasing IL-10 mRNA levels and increasing neutrophil counts (r² = 0.06, P = 0.01) and between decreasing lymphocyte counts and increasing IL-10 mRNA levels (r² = 0.05, P = 0.02).

### The correlation between colorectal cancer rates of proliferation and apoptosis and systemic cytokine levels; plus their influence upon survival [^6b336b27]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Colorectal carcinomas arise through a series of histological changes, each of which is accompanied by specific genetic alterations in a handful of oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. Chronic inflammation plays a causative role in the molecular pathways of colon carcinogenesis and leads to altered rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis, altered cellular adhesion, increased angiogenesis and cellular transformation. Significantly, chronic inflammation also causes negative feedback inhibition of the CMI and causes a predominance of HI. This state of host immunity is described in a number of malignant diseases and inhibits immune-mediated tumour rejection.

Colorectal cancer has been shown to cause CMI suppression and HI promotion that is linked to disease progression and has an influence on survival. Decreased total numbers of the CMI promoting Th1 CD4 + cells have been found in patients with colorectal tumours. Lowered levels of CMI-associated cytokines have been measured, corresponding to the pathological stage of the tumour and reversed by surgery. It has also been demonstrated that elevated basal levels of the HI-associated cytokine, IL-10, are correlated to reduced disease-free survival. The mechanisms through which this shift in immunity is performed have not been fully explained but include COX-2 overexpression, histamine production and increased expression of IL-10.

### Tumour-associated autoantibodies as prognostic cancer biomarkers-a review [^12bc32ba]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Throughout the process of carcinogenesis, autologous cells are transformed into cancer cells, leading to changes in their protein expression profiles. It has been suggested that mutations, protein misfolding, overexpression and aberrant post-translational modifications, changes in protein abundance or location can render tumour-associated antigens immunogenic. Subsequent changes in the tumour microenvironment may lead to humoral immune responses and therefore the production of tumour-associated autoantibodies. Hence, autoantibodies are suggested to be immunological biomarkers of aberrant cellular mechanisms occurring throughout tumourigenesis. Since autoantibodies represent a stable and amplified signature of the anti-tumour immune response that may be generated prior to the clinical detection of other tumour proteins and prior to the first clinically detectable signs of the cancer or its recurrence, there is great interest in using autoantibodies as diagnostic and prognostic blood-based biomarkers. In this review, we discuss the current evidence supporting the prognostic value of autoantibodies in a highly immunogenic cancer such as melanoma as well as breast, lung, colon, prostate and stomach cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancers globally in 2020.

Methods of testing — Colon cancer molecular testing can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (preferred) or blood-based assay. Repeat molecular testing should not be performed after standard cytotoxic chemotherapy as significant molecular changes are rarely observed, but changes in the molecular profile are more commonly seen after targeted therapies and repeat testing may be considered to guide further targeted therapy decisions.

### Effect of intraoperative blood transfusion on treg and FOXP3 in patients with digestive tract malignancies and different ABO blood types [^06c68e2e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with malignant tumors of the digestive tract often have anemia because of tumor-associated bleeding, malnutrition, bone marrow suppression due to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and intraoperative blood loss. Anemia not only affects the quality of life in these patients, but is also an independent risk factor for death. Perioperative blood transfusion is commonly utilized to improve tissue oxygen delivery and perfusion, but transfusion also carries the risk of adverse effects. Blood transfusion has been shown to induce immunosuppression in patients with cancer, expecially digestive tract cancer, then increase the risk of postoperative infections including lung and anastomotic infections, meanwhile increase early recurrence of malignancy and cancer-specific deaths, and reduce survival rates. The complications can negatively affect patients' prognosis. Previous studies have found that an increase in regulatory T cells (Tregs) and expression of their specific marker forkhead box protein-3 (FOXP3) after allogenic blood transfusion may be one of the mechanisms of immunosuppression. However, the effect of blood transfusion on Tregs and FOXP3 in patients with digestive tract malignancies is unclear.

Treg generally refers to regulatory CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cells. These cells can have immunosuppressive effects through activation and expression of a variety of immune cells by cell-cell contact and cytokine-mediated mechanisms. FOXP3 is the specific marker of Tregs and is the key to their development, activation, and function. Deletion of FOXP3 can lead to the loss of Treg suppressive function on autoreactive T cells in scurfy (sf) mice. This has been shown to cause severe autoimmune reactions and death. However, since it is an intracellular protein, the FOXP3/scurfin protein is not easy to detect. CD127 expression is inversely correlated with FOXP3; it is specifically expressed at a low level on the surface of Tregs and can be used as a biomarker for detecting them. Human ABO blood group substances are abundantly expressed on the surface of red blood cells and in various tissues, organs and body fluids. ABO blood groups are associated with various diseases including tumors of the digestive system. There are also differences in the levels of inflammatory factors and the incidence of transfusion reactions due to erythrocyte concentrates in patients with different ABO blood types. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of blood transfusion on Tregs and FOXP3 expression in patients with malignant tumors of the digestive tract and different ABO blood types.

### Autologous white blood cell transfusion: toward a younger immunity [^5570d9f7]. Human Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

More and more cells and tissues of human origin are considered as unique medical bio-resources and are instrumental in the ongoing development of regenerative medicine. Although a better understanding of the genetic complexity of the major histocompatibility complex has contributed to develop allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the autologous setting was viewed early on only as a means to overcome myelodepression. The contribution of the immune system for adoptive immunotherapy was recognized in the 1990s, when donor lymphocyte infusion demonstrated an antileukemic effect of the transfused T cells. This led to the foundation and development of adoptive immunotherapy in the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases and cancer. The recognition that the immune system is undergoing a progressive decline and deterioration with age introduces a new challenge. Immunosenescence results in a well-documented increase in incidence and severity of infections, impaired responses to vaccines, and development of cancer. We propose and argue that autologous white blood cells collected and cryopreserved at a young age will represent a valuable bio-resource for the restoration of immunity and the successful development of adoptive immunotherapies in treating infections and cancer, and will pave the way to anticipatory medicine.

### The correlation between colorectal cancer rates of proliferation and apoptosis and systemic cytokine levels; plus their influence upon survival [^03fd0a24]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

The basis for the development of colorectal cancer is believed to be the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, which involves a stepwise progression from normal to dysplastic epithelium to carcinoma. It is associated with the accumulation of multiple, clonally selected genetic alterations and results in disturbed rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis are dependent upon the pathways that govern the different cell cycle phases. These pathways are under genetic control but are influenced by both exogenous and endogenous stimuli. The immune system and its components are key regulators of cell proliferation and cell death when there are inflammatory responses, for example, during wound healing. The majority of colorectal cancer evolves in a chronic inflammatory background and there is strong evidence of an immune response to colorectal cancer.

In order for tumours to establish and progress it is thought that suppression of the host's immune system is needed. Tumour-induced immune suppression occurs at both a molecular and cellular level and progresses to affect the whole organism. Colorectal cancer results in a fundamental shift in immunity with suppression of the cell-mediated immune system (CMI), associated with tumour rejection, and a predominance of humoral immunity (HI) which conversely prevents rejection. There is a reduced production of cytokines from the CMI-associated Th1 lymphocytes while those produced by the Th2 lymphocytes (associated with HI) appear to remain at normal or even elevated levels. The further the disease has progressed the more significant these imbalances become and complete resection of the tumour reverses these changes.

The purpose of this study was to correlate colorectal tumour rates of proliferation and apoptosis with host systemic cytokine levels and investigate what influence these factors have upon patient prognosis. Archived cancer specimens from a group of patients, who were previously studied to investigate the relationship between systemic cytokine levels and colorectal cancer, were stained with the antibody Ki67 to measure proliferation and the antibody M30 to measure apoptosis. Long-term patient follow-up was also preformed. The original work had shown a suppression of CMI-associated cytokines, tumour necrosis factor- α (TNF- α) and interferon- γ (IFN- γ) in patients with colorectal cancer that was greater in those with a Dukes' C tumour compared to those with either a Dukes' A or B tumour and was reversed by surgery. No difference had been found in the levels of the HI-associated cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) in patients with colorectal tumours compared to the controls both pre- and postsurgery.

### Immunological complications of blood transfusion: current insights and advances [^6306bd6b]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood transfusion is integral to modern medicine but carries significant immunological risks. This review outlines key immune-mediated complications, including acute hemolytic transfusion reactions from ABO incompatibility, and febrile nonhemolytic reactions caused by cytokines or antileukocyte antibodies. Other reactions include allergic responses, anaphylaxis (notably in IgA-deficient patients), and transfusion-related acute lung injury - the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. Delayed hemolytic reactions, alloimmunization-induced platelet refractoriness, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, and post-transfusion purpura also contribute to morbidity. Transfusion-related immunomodulation may increase infection and cancer recurrence risks. Preventive measures such as leukoreduction, irradiation, extended antigen matching, and restrictive transfusion strategies are crucial. This review article emphasis the importance on the need for strict adherence to protocols, enhanced hemovigilance, and education, especially in resource-limited settings. This review article summarizes the various immunological complications of blood transfusion and the recent advances in their etiopathogenesis, prevention, mitigation, and future research direction.

### Red cell transfusion and the immune system [^cd7061fe]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding the complex immunological consequences of red cell transfusion is essential if we are to use this valuable resource wisely and safely. The decision to transfuse red cells should be made after serious considerations of the associated risks and benefits. Immunological risks of transfusion include major incompatibility reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury, while other immunological insults such as transfusion-related immunomodulation are relatively underappreciated. Red cell transfusions should be acknowledged as immunological exposures, with consequences weighed against expected benefits. This article reviews immunological consequences and the emerging evidence that may inform risk-benefit considerations in clinical practice.

### Immunoregulatory effects of stored red blood cells [^2caa5f65]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Some clinical studies have identified potential adverse patient outcomes associated with RBC storage length. This may in part be due to the release of potentially hazardous bioactive products that accumulate during storage and are delivered at high concentrations during transfusion. In this situation, a proinflammatory tissue microenvironment may be established that can alter immunoregulatory mechanisms. This review highlights some of the potential immunomodulatory effects of stored RBCs that may be responsible for adverse transfusion reactions.

### Modulation of colony stimulating factor release and apoptosis in human colon cancer cells by anticancer drugs [^aef63ae7]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Secretion of CSFs by cancer cells has important consequences for tumour progression. For instance, in murine models of colon adenocarcinoma, melanoma or acute myeloid leukaemia transfection of cancer cells with genes to overexpress G-CSF or GM-CSF results in reduced tumorigenicity. Additionally, injection of irradiated tumour cells expressing murine GM-CSF produces potent, specific and long-lasting anti-tumour immunity and even induces regression of pre-established cancer. Likewise, some preliminary clinical trials testing the therapeutic potential of systemic GM-CSF administration have produced encouraging results. Rejection of CSF-secreting cancer cells appears to be because they increase the recruitment and activity of phagocytic cells, while the specific immunisation is probably related to the enhanced antigen presentation activity and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Increased levels of CSFs following systemic administration may also have beneficial effects by helping to reverse the defective antigen presentation and tumoricidal activities that are found in mononuclear phagocytes isolated from cancer patients. However, a localised release of these cytokines would have extra benefits by attracting the inflammatory cells to the tumour and facilitating their contact with the cancer cells, as pointed out by some experimental studies. Our findings suggest that changes in the secretion of CSFs by cancer cells themselves after treatment with anticancer drugs, may be of significance for the immune response against those cells. This may be particularly important when considering the mechanism of action of drugs such as cisplatin and 6-MP. Thus, we suggest that treatment with these drugs may modulate the host immune response against cancer cells and this could contribute to their anti-neoplasic action. New investigations are required to analyse whether these effects take place in vivo and whether anticancer drugs act preferentially in cancer cells.

### Blood transfusion-modulated tumor recurrence: first results of a randomized study of autologous versus allogeneic blood transfusion in colorectal cancer surgery… [^1eef13bf]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose Allogeneic blood transfusions have reportedly been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with curatively resected cancer. To control for immunosuppression induced by a speculatively causal allogeneic blood transfusion, we designed a randomized study in which the control group received autologous blood transfusions not related to any condition of immunosuppression. Results In curatively resected cancer patients, the number who needed allogeneic blood transfusions was reduced from 60% in the allogeneic blood group to 33% in the autologous blood group. After a median follow-up duration of 22 months tumor recurrence was observed in 28. 9% of the allogeneic blood group and
16. 7% of the autologous blood group. Life-table analysis established a tendency toward a shorter tumor-free survival for the allogeneic blood group.

The problem with this analysis was the strong association of allogeneic blood transfusions with tumor recurrence, which interfered in 33% of patients in the autologous blood group who required additional allogeneic blood transfusions. Multivariate analysis of established risk factors for tumor recurrence and surgery-related variables reflecting potential immunosuppressive conditions showed that only pT stage, pN stage, which was reduced to borderline significance by adjustment for tumor and node stage.

Conclusion As indicated by these first results, the blood transfusion modality has a significant effect on tumor recurrence after surgical treatment of colorectal cancer. A change in the practice of blood transfusion might thus potentially surpass the impact of any recent adjuvant treatment strategies.

### Tumour-educated circulating monocytes are powerful candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and disease follow-up of colorectal cancer [^50f72281]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Cancer immunology is a growing field of research whose aim is to develop innovative therapies and diagnostic tests. Starting from the hypothesis that immune cells promptly respond to harmful stimuli, we used peripheral blood monocytes in order to characterise a distinct gene expression profile and to evaluate its potential as a candidate diagnostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), a still unmet clinical need.

Design

We performed a case-control study including 360 peripheral blood monocyte samples from four European oncological centres and defined a gene expression profile specific to CRC. The robustness of the genetic profile and disease specificity were assessed in an independent setting.

Results

This screen returned 43 putative diagnostic markers, which we refined and validated in the confirmative multicentric analysis to 23 genes with outstanding diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.99 (0.99 to 1.00), Se = 100.0% (100.0% to 100.0%), Sp = 92.9% (78.6% to 100.0%) in multiple-gene receiver operating characteristic analysis). The diagnostic accuracy was robustly maintained in prospectively collected independent samples (AUC = 0.95 (0.85 to 1.00), Se = 92.6% (81.5% to 100.0%), Sp = 92.3% (76.9% to 100.0%). This monocyte signature was expressed at early disease onset, remained robust over the course of disease progression, and was specific for the monocytic fraction of mononuclear cells. The gene modulation was induced specifically by soluble factors derived from transformed colon epithelium in comparison to normal colon or other cancer histotypes. Moreover, expression changes were plastic and reversible, as they were abrogated upon withdrawal of these tumour-released factors. Consistently, the modified set of genes reverted to normal expression upon curative treatment and was specific for CRC.

Conclusions

Our study is the first to demonstrate monocyte plasticity in response to tumour-released soluble factors. The identified distinct signature in tumour-educated monocytes might be used as a candidate biomarker in CRC diagnosis and harbours the potential for disease follow-up and therapeutic monitoring.

### Impact of low skeletal muscle mass index and perioperative blood transfusion on the prognosis for HCC following curative resection [^b8882d89]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Several previous studies have demonstrated that blood transfusion had a negative impact on the prognosis of HCC patients. In line with Harada et al.'s study, this study suggests that blood transfusion was associated with HCC recurrence after hepatectomy in patients with Child–Pugh class A. Recent studies have reported that transfusion-related immunomodulation affects the prognosis of patients who received blood transfusion. RBCs transfusion was referred to as an immune system suppressor and has been linked to tumor recurrence. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count of patients who underwent blood transfusion is lower than that of patients who did not undergo blood transfusion. There is one study that demonstrated that the natural killer cell activity of patients who underwent blood transfusion decreased on postoperative day 7, leading to decreased tumor suppression. Additionally, blood transfusion cause secondary iron overload, which may accelerate the progression of liver fibrosis and recurrence of HCC. The long-term prognosis of patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma who received perioperative RBCs transfusion was poorer than those who did not receive RBCs transfusion. Moreover, intraoperative RBCs transfusion was associated with poor OS in patients with periampullary cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. In our study, the patients in the blood transfusion group required longer operation time and had a larger volume of intraoperative blood loss than those in the non-transfusion group even after the propensity-matched analysis. Blood transfusion had a negative impact on RFS. Hence, it is important to avoid unnecessary blood transfusion and intraoperative blood loss to maintain the normal function of the host immune system.

This retrospective, single-center study had a limited sample size. Future prospective cohort studies involving multiple institutions should be performed to confirm our results. The patients who underwent blood transfusion were significantly associated with preoperative anemia as compared with those who did not receive blood transfusion. The several biases were still attributed to the enforcement of blood transfusion even after the propensity-matched analysis.

### Immune function after major surgical interventions: the effect of postoperative pain treatment [^be0945ef]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 16 patients were included in the study (mean age 64 ± 11 years, mean ± SD; eight males/eight females): nine patients were randomized to Group A (mean age 63.8 ± 11.7 years; six males/three females) and seven patients to Group B (mean age 63.4 ± 12.74 years; two males/five females). Duration of surgery for each patient is reported in Table 1. Only one of the 16 patients needed blood transfusions preoperatively (Group A), while three patients received intra-operative transfusion (two in Group A and one in Group B). Since immune parameters of transfused patients were never different from those of non-transfused one (data not shown), we did not exclude them from the analysis. Patients reported good pain relief all along the postoperative period, as shown by NRS values at rest and movement (Figure 1). No significant differences between groups were observed.

Cytokines

Figure 2 reports the production of cytokines after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide.

As reported in Figure 2A, surgery does not influence the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which remains unmodified along the 48 hours of observation, without any significant difference between the two groups. In contrast, the other relevant proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α (Figure 2B) is significantly decreased after the surgery, and the levels remained lower than preoperatively also at 24 and 48 hours in both Group A and Group B. Figure 2C shows the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which is not altered at any time.

Data on Th1 and Th2 cytokine production are reported in Figure 3. Both IFN-γ (Figure 3A) and IL-2 (Figure 3B), typical Th1 cytokines, are significantly reduced at the end of surgery. IFN-γ remains reduced after 24 and 48 hours, irrespective of the allocation group, while a trend toward normalization was observed for IL-2 at 24 and 48 hours in both groups.

On the other hand, the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 do not appear to be altered either by surgery or postoperative pain treatments (Figure 3C and D).

Lymphoproliferation

As reported in Figure 4, a significant reduction in lymphoproliferation was observed immediately after surgery in all patients; a trend toward a return to presurgical lymphoproliferation was retrieved at 48 hours, without statistically significant difference.

### Influence of blood transfusions during radical retropubic prostatectomy on disease outcome [^e0e29687]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Blood transfusion in patients with malignant neoplasms may alter the disease outcome because of a theoretical immunomodulatory effect. This effect may reduce prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-free and disease-specific survival in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. However, the results in published studies have been contradictory, and this effect has not yet been determined.

Methods

We evaluated 1412 patients after radical prostatectomy from 1984 to 2003 in a retrospective analysis, with a special focus on the rate and type of blood transfusions, specifically heterologous versus autologous blood. Univariate analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the impact of blood transfusions on disease outcome.

Results

The overall transfusion rate was 56.7%. The rate dropped from 88.9% in 1988 to 9.1% in 2002. PSA recurrence (greater than 0.5 ng/mL) was noted in 11.0% in patients without and in 26.0% with blood transfusions, which was not statistically significant on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Again, no difference was noted when patients were stratified according to the type (autologous versus heterologous) or the amount (2 U or less versus more than 2 U) of blood transfusion. Evaluating overall survival, again no differences were found. The established Cox regression model also proved that blood transfusions had no impact on disease outcome.

Conclusions

Our retrospective analysis did not detect any effect of blood transfusions in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. If a negative adverse effect occurs, this effect must be minimal. However, the infectious risk and the costs of blood transfusions should be reason enough to reduce blood loss and the transfusion rate further in patients with prostate cancer.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with a gene transcription profile characteristic of immunosuppression: a prospective cohort study [^69bbb8c7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood transfusion in the perioperative period has frequently been associated with an excess of nosocomial infections. Whilst transfused whole blood induces specific host immune alteration that may predispose to nosocomial infections, the immunomodulating properties associated with leukodepleted blood remain incompletely understood. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that the transfusion of leukodepleted allogeneic blood during or following major gastrointestinal surgery is associated with an immunosuppressed phenotype, which may in turn predispose to postoperative infectious complications.

Methods

Patients aged over 45 years undergoing scheduled inpatient major gastrointestinal surgery were recruited. Gene expression profiles of specific inflammatory genes were assayed from blood collected preoperatively, at 24 and at 48 hours after surgery. Genes were selected based on their ability to represent specific immune pathways. Gene expression was quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to measure messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Postoperative infections were documented using predefined criteria.

Results

One hundred and nineteen patients were recruited. Fifteen (13%) patients required blood transfusion within 24 hours of surgery, 44 (37%) patients developed infections and 3 (2%) patients died prior to discharge. Patients receiving a blood transfusion were more likely to develop postoperative infections (P = 0.02) and to have lower tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-12, IL-23 and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma T (RORγt) gene expression in the postoperative period (P < 0.05). The TNFα/IL-10 mRNA ratio at 24 hours (P = 0.0006) and at 48 hours (P = 0.01) was lower in patients receiving a blood transfusion over this period. Multivariable analysis confirmed that these observations were independent of the severity of the surgical insult.

Conclusions

An association between an immunosuppressive pattern of gene expression and blood transfusion following major elective gastrointestinal surgery is described. This gene expression profile includes a reduction in the activity of innate immunity and T helper cell type 1 (T h 1) and T helper cell type 17 (T h 17) pathways in those patients receiving a blood transfusion. Blood transfusion was also associated with an excess of infectious complications in this cohort. A mechanistic link is suggested but not proven.

### Immunomodulation effect of blood transfusion… [^92db4cc3]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Immunomodulation Effect of Blood TransfusionClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview All patients undergo the identical anesthesiological procedure, including premedication, general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, monitoring and postoperative pain therapy and mobilization. Surgery is performed by the identical team performing a standardized technique. Transfusion regimen The 'trigger' for homologous red cell transfusion intra- and postoperatively is the actual hematocrit concentration. Transfusion depends on discretion of the treating physicians. Number of units transfused, amount of blood loss, time, reasoning and decision maker are recorded. The purpose to include non-transfused otherwise fully comparable patients is to distinguish between trauma and transfusion and their influence on immune modulation. Within the studies about blood transfusion and immune modulation only some few made this differentiation.

In patients with colorectal cancer surgery randomized groups with autologous predonation and patients with allogeneic transfusion only have been compared. However, within the latter group of 27 patients only 13 had to be transfused, thus creating a non-transfusion group of 14 patients. These 14 non-transfused patients remained within the study being compared with autologous and allogeneic transfused patients. Operative trauma and allogeneic transfusion both increased the secretion of several cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and Interleukin-10; this effect was less pronounced in patients with autologous- and without any transfusion. Another group studied forty three orthopedic patients with total knee- or hip-arthroplasty, initially to compare autologous to allogeneic red cell transfusion. They had to change their protocol due to the small number of allogeneic transfusions.

Including perioperatively transfused patients only they found an increase in immune regulatory cytokine Interleukin -10 after red cell transfusion, which was most pronounced 7 days after surgery, whereas there was only a mild increase in non- or autologous transfused patients. Unfortunately they did not differentiate between autologous-and non-transfused patients. Thus their data could not reveal the effect of surgery itself on the analyzed parameters.

### Transfusion needs after CAR T-cell therapy for large B-cell lymphoma: predictive factors and outcome (a DESCAR-T study) [^027e5e38]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD19 have been approved for the treatment of relapse/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Hematotoxicity is the most frequent CAR T-cell-related adverse event. Transfusion support is a surrogate marker of severe cytopenias. Transfusion affects patients' quality of life, presents specific toxicities, and is known to affect immunity through the so-called transfusion-related immunomodulation that may affect CAR T-cell efficacy. We analyzed data from 671 patients from the French DESCAR-T registry for whom exhaustive transfusion data were available. Overall, 401 (59.8%) and 378 (56.3%) patients received transfusion in the 6-month period before and after CAR T-cell infusion, respectively. The number of patients receiving transfusion and the mean number of transfused products increased during the 6-month period before CAR T-cell infusion, peaked during the first month after infusion (early phase), and decreased over time. Predictive factors for transfusion at the early phase were age > 60 years, ECOG PS ≥ 2, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel, pre-CAR T-cell transfusions, and CAR-HEMATOTOX score ≥ 2. Predictive factors for late transfusion (between 1 and 6 months after infusion) were pre-CAR T-cell transfusions, CAR-HEMATOTOX score ≥ 2, ICANS ≥ 3 (for red blood cells [RBC] transfusion), and tocilizumab use (for platelets transfusion). Early transfusions and late platelets (but not RBC) transfusions were associated with a shorter progression-free survival and overall survival. Lymphoma-related mortality and nonrelapse mortality were both increased in the transfused population. Our data shed light on the mechanisms of early and late cytopenia and on the potential impact of transfusions on CAR T-cell efficacy and toxicity.

### Infectious and immunologic consequences of blood transfusion [^1d2da7cb]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Blood transfusions remain common practice in the critical care and surgical settings. Transfusions carry significant risks, including risks for transmission of infectious agents and immune suppression. Transmission of bacterial infections, although rare, is the most common adverse event with transfusion. The risk for transmission of viral infections has decreased over time, clearly because tests are becoming more sensitive in detecting certain viral infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Several immunomodulatory effects are thought to be related to transfusions, and these can result in cancer recurrence, mortality, and postoperative infections. Numerous studies have been performed to examine the role of leukoreduction in decreasing these transfusion-related complications but results remain contradictory. We review the infectious risks associated with blood transfusion and the most recent data on its immunologic effects, specifically on cancer recurrence, mortality, and postoperative infections in surgical patients. We also review the use of leukoreduction in blood transfusion and its role in preventing transfusion-transmitted infections and immunomodulatory complications.

### From metabolomics to transfusion-associated immunomodulation [^723a2c10]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent advances in metabolomics that have enhanced our understanding of transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM), highlighting how biochemical changes in stored blood products - with a focus on packed red blood cells - affect recipient immune responses.

Recent Findings

Metabolomics has revealed critical biochemical shifts - termed storage lesions - in blood products, notably accumulation of oxidized lipids, extracellular vesicles, and hemolysis-derived molecules, such as free heme and iron. These metabolites influence recipient immunity by triggering both inflammatory and immunosuppressive pathways, mediated through mechanisms involving redox imbalance, inflammasome activation, and modulation of immune cell metabolism. Studies underscore that the immunological outcomes of transfusions are shaped not only by storage duration but also by donor-specific metabolic profiles influenced by genetics, diet, and environmental exposures. Metabolic profiling has identified novel biomarkers, such as hypoxanthine and kynurenine, which correlate with transfusion quality and immunological impact.

Summary

Metabolomics has transformed our understanding of TRIM, emphasizing that transfusion is an active biochemical intervention rather than passive fluid replacement. Moving forward, integrating metabolomic insights into transfusion medicine promises personalized strategies - selecting blood units based on metabolic rather than chronological age and donor characteristics - thus improving safety and clinical outcomes in transfusion recipients.

### The effect of colorectal cancer upon host peripheral immune cell function [^cddd48dd]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Colorectal cancer is immunogenic. However, it is also associated with suppression of host immunity. Identifying the mechanisms involved in immune suppression is necessary to develop future immunotherapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to assess immune cell function in colorectal cancer patients.

Method

A total of 80 colorectal cancer patients (41 male) prior to treatment and 38 matched controls (21 male) were recruited. Venous blood samples were taken. White blood cell composition was determined using monoclonal antibodies. Levels of cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-6 were measured from the supernatants of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) following thawing and re-suspension. Peripheral blood mononuclear proliferation was measured using 3H-Thymidine.

Results

Stage I-III cancer patients had elevated percentages of CD8 T cell (P = 0.004) whilst stage IV patients had low total lymphocyte percentages (P = 0.016). Monocyte and NKT cell percentage decreased with advanced tumour stages (P = 0.013 and P = 0.038). Patients had lower PBMC proliferation and production of the TH1 cytokines (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) (P < 0.001) than that of the controls. IL-6 and IL-4 production were not significantly different. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha concentrations reduced with tumour vascular invasion (P = 0.011 and P = 0.019).

Conclusion

Colorectal cancer induces an immunological response, shifting the cytokine balance. The most profound changes are seen once disease has spread systemically.

Technical considerations

Several factors can influence the analytical and clinical validity as well as the clinical utility of ctDNA-based assays. These factors include preanalytical variables, assay characteristics and the bioinformatic analysis of the data provided.

Pre-analytical variables

The major challenges at the pre-analytical stage include the typically small proportion of ctDNA relative to total cfDNA, the potential for contamination of samples by DNA released during immune-cell lysis and the labile nature of DNA (and consequent implications for storage and transport). Blood samples should be drawn using a large gauge diameter needle (≤ 21 G) according to established guidelines, and analysis should be performed on ctDNA obtained from plasma rather than on serum as the latter contains greater quantities of DNA released from immune cells during the clotting process –. Blood should be drawn into K 2 EDTA or cell-stabilizing tubes (such as Streck cfDNA collection tubes). Plasma isolation should be done as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours with K 2 EDTA (preferably within 4–6 hours) or within 2–7 days if using cell-stabilizing tubes, with interim storage at 4°C for the former and at 10–30°C for the latter –. The volume of blood drawn should be optimized according to the clinical setting (for example, higher volumes of plasma (up to 60 ml) might be required for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) compared with attempts to evaluate therapy responses in the metastatic setting, in which 5–10 mL is usually sufficient) and the analytical method used. Blood should be processed for the isolation of plasma using sequential centrifugation at progressively increasing speeds (800–1,600 g) at 4°C or through filtration followed by immediate deep freezing (typically at –80°C) –. Immune cells obtained from the buffy coat layer can be used as a source of DNA for assessment of mutations as originating from the germ line and/or clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Although rapid freezing of plasma samples does not affect subsequent DNA yield, unspun blood must not be frozen (to avoid immune-cell lysis) nor should plasma samples be exposed to multiple freeze–thaw cycles –. The latter issue can easily be avoided by aliquoting plasma into single-use tubes of an appropriate volume. Several methods of DNA extraction and purification from plasma are currently available through ready-to-use commercial kits. However, the DNA purification method needs to be tailored depending on the upstream pre-analytical and downstream analysis methods used, (Fig. 2).

### Male sex and history of ischemic heart disease are major risk factors for anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic anterior resection in patients with rectal cancer [^8de85717]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a complication that occurs in 1.2 to 19.0% of patients during anterior resection (AR) for rectal cancer. This complication can lead to serious conditions such as peritonitis and sepsis, repeated surgeries or percutaneous intervention with prolonged hospitalization, increased cost, and a worse oncological prognosis. The basic requirements for anastomotic healing are an appropriate blood supply, healthy bowel ends, and tension-free anastomosis. Risk factors for AL after AR have been discussed since anastomosis was initially established. Reported risk factors during open surgery include surgical duration, amount of intraoperative hemorrhage, and amount of blood transfusion.

The number of elderly patients with colon cancer has increased along with the aging of society. Elderly patients often have co-morbidities and age-related physiological problems that can lead to worse postoperative complications compared with younger patients. Risk factors for colon surgery should be re-evaluated depending on changes in social situation.

Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can eliminate blind areas in the narrow surgical field of the pelvis, and rectal surgery can now proceed in a magnified operative field, thus improving the quality of this procedure, although laparotomy has historically contributed to the treatment of diseases of the digestive system because it allows complete visualization of the pelvis. Despite recent progress in laparoscopic surgery and standardized surgical technique, some patients still develop AL. Little is known about risk factors for AL after laparoscopic rectal surgery. The present study aimed to determine risk factors for AL based on patients' characteristics, extent of tumor progression, and factors related to surgery.

### Adverse effects of perioperative transfusion on patients with stage III and IV gastric cancer [^9c2766b7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The degree of immunomodulation by perioperative blood transfusion and its resultant effects on cancer surgery are a subject of controversy. We evaluated the prognostic effects of perioperative blood transfusion on gastric cancer surgery.

Methods

A total of 1710 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer from 1991 to 1995 were retrospectively reviewed. Uni- and multivariate analyses of the incidence, amount, and timing of perioperative blood transfusions and a comparison of the clinicopathological features were performed.

Results

A higher incidence of blood transfusions was associated with female sex, large tumors, upper-body location, Borrmann type III or IV lesions, longer operations, total gastrectomies, splenectomies, and D3 or more extended lymphadenectomy. The tumors in the transfused group were more advanced in depth of invasion and nodal classification. More frequent tumor recurrences were found in the transfused group. A dose-response relationship between the amount of transfused blood and prognosis was evident. Subgroup analyses of prognosis according to stage showed significant differences in stages III and IV between the transfused and nontransfused groups. On multivariate analysis, transfusion was shown to be an independent risk factor for recurrence and poor prognosis.

Conclusions

These results suggest that perioperative transfusion is an unfavorable prognostic factor. It is thus better to refrain from unnecessary blood transfusion and to give the least amount of blood to patients with gastric cancer when transfusion is inevitable, especially for those with stage III and IV gastric cancers.

### Do multiple blood transfusions predispose for a higher rate of non-blood-related infection complications? [^e4c13554]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Allogeneic transfusions of red blood cell (RBC) concentrates have been related to an increase in postoperative infections. Leukocytes present in RBC units might have deleterious effects on the receptor immune system, provoking a state of immunosuppression that favors the development of postoperative infections (TRIM effect). The bioactive substances released by leukocytes in a time-dependent form, accumulating in blood components during storage, might be responsible for the TRIM effect. Multiple observational studies with logistic regression have demonstrated a direct relationship between transfusion and infection. However, several factors related to surgical difficulty and patient illness severity might act as strong confounding variables on the relationship studied. Randomized controlled trials designed to establish a causal relationship between transfusion and infection have yielded contradictory results. While we await new studies, allogeneic transfusions should be considered as a possible risk factor for postoperative infection.

### Allogeneic red cell transfusion and its influence on relevant humoral and cellular immunological parameters: a prospective observational trial [^2ec455ba]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is assumed that transfusion of allogeneic red cells is associated with increased peri-operative mortality and morbidity. Also assumed is the theory of transfusion-related immunomodulation.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that red cell transfusion specifically leads to an immunological response in surgical patients.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Departments of Orthopedic Surgery and Anaesthesia, University Hospital, Thailand.

Patients

Low-risk, noncancer patients, aged 18 to 75 years undergoing elective major spine surgery, with and without red cell transfusion therapy.

Interventions

Blood specimens were withdrawn four times (prior to surgery and on days 1, 3 and 5).

Main Outcome Measures

Assessment of immunocompetent cells and cytokines in transfused and nontransfused patients using flow cytometry and multiplex ELISA.

Results

From a total of 78 patients, 61 met the requirements and were analysed in three groups: 19 with no transfusion and 26 and 16 transfused intra-operatively and on day 1 or 2, respectively. No patient experienced peri-operative haemorrhage. Postoperative infection or thrombosis occurred in 5.5% of nontransfused patients and 16.6% of transfused patients; the difference was not significant. There was no significant immunomodulatory effect of red cell transfusion: of 45 immunological parameters, only five little-relevant cytokines were significantly affected, although slightly and nonspecifically.

Conclusion

Our data indicate that red cell transfusion alone does not create an immunological response in otherwise healthy surgical patients. Our findings do not generally contradict the transfusion-related immunomodulation phenomenon, which has, however, primarily been observed in patients with an already weakened or procedure-deteriorated immune system, such as from malignant disease, significant comorbidity, extensive abdominal/thoracic surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass.

Trial Registration

The study was registered on 15 May 2014, before enrolment of the first patient, at www. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02140216.

### Allogeneic nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation in metastatic colon cancer: tumor-specific T cells directed to a tumor-associated antigen are generated in vivo during GVHD [^88eac53e]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

A pilot study was conducted to evaluate safety and activity of nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and to determine whether a T-cell response to a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) was induced. Fifteen patients with metastatic CRC underwent HCT from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings after a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. All patients engrafted with a median donor T-cell chimerism of 72% at day +56. Eight patients experienced grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Despite progressive disease before HCT, partial remission and disease stabilization longer than 90 days were observed in 1 and 3 patients, respectively. Induction of TAA-specific T cells was evaluated with a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific HLA-A(*)0201 pentamer in 6 patients with CRC. CEA-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in 3 of 3 patients concomitant with GHVD onset, but not in 3 of 3 patients without GVHD. They were also not detected in 9 of 9 control patients with GVHD who received transplants for diagnoses other than CRC. Antitumor activity of CEA-specific T cells was also validated in vitro. In one patient, the induction of CEA-specific T cells was associated with a decrease of serum CEA levels and a partial response. Thus, graft-versus-host reactions associated with allogeneic HCT can trigger the generation of T cells specific for CEA, and this may be associated with a clinical response.

### Cancer risk among 21st century blood transfusion recipients [^8539bf17]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The excess risk of transfusion-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been consistently reported previously. Some have proposed the possibility of introduction of donor lymphoma cells through blood, although a large register-based study of cancer in the donors did not support this hypothesis. Others have suggested that chemical or biological components of transfused blood may cause a temporary immunomodulation, promoting lymphoma development, but this hypothesis would not explain why risks remain high many years after transfusion. Emerging evidence has suggested possible associations between viruses and some non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases, including Epstein–Barr virus and again Hepatitis G virus, and these viruses are not screened for in transfused blood.

Our findings are limited by the type of information on transfusion that was available. We did not have information on the type or the number of transfusions, nor on transfusions done before the hospital records began or on unrecorded transfusions. We could not investigate transfusion-associated cancer risks longer than 10 years after transfusion, because we restricted our study to the transfusions in the 21st century. Additionally, associations may be confounded by unmeasured factors, including conditions not recorded at the time of transfusion, or by transfusion history or other history prior to the period of data availability. Furthermore, we have no information for men or people transfused at younger ages.

Blood transfusions are generally given for life-threatening situations, and the immediate benefits would out-weight the long-term risk of cancer. Nevertheless, the long-term excess risks of liver cancer and of non-Hodgkin lymphoma warrants search for carcinogenic agents not currently screened for in transfused blood.

Key message

Screening for the blood-borne viruses in transfused blood has been extensive in the UK during the 21st century. In this large prospective study of UK women, we found increased risks of liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma more than 5 years after transfusion, suggesting that some of these malignancies may be caused by carcinogenic agents that are not currently screened for in transfused blood.

### Perioperative blood transfusion is associated with a gene transcription profile characteristic of immunosuppression: a prospective cohort study [^db5fbd64]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study we determined levels of mRNA for a panel of interlinked cytokines and related transcription factors and demonstrated that those patients receiving a perioperative blood transfusion following major gastrointestinal surgery displayed a pattern of gene expression consistent with greater immunosuppression when compared with a cohort not receiving a blood transfusion. This observation was independent of variables descriptive of the extent of surgical trauma. The gene expression data presented suggests that blood transfusion in this setting may be associated with specific immune defects in innate immunity and in T h 1 and T h 17 pathways. These patients also had an excess of postoperative infectious complications when compared with patients that did not receive a blood transfusion; an observation that was again independent of the duration of the surgical procedure.

The genes selected as candidates in this study are well described as surrogate measures of the specific immune pathways outlined in Table 1. Furthermore, the construction of a ratio of gene expression that incorporates the prototypical proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα, and the archetypal anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, permits the concurrent assessment of both major facets of the immune response and has previously been utilised to predict postoperative outcome. Whilst the observed reductions in TNFα and IL-12 gene expression are indicative of impaired innate immunity and T h 1 pathways respectively and the reduction in IL-23 and RORγt is indicative of reduced T h 17 activity, these data should not be interpreted as being conclusive. Flow cytometry experiments would be necessary to confirm these initial data but present significant logistical barriers and are ideally not performed on stored samples. The T h 1 pathway is an essential link between innate and adaptive immunity and T h 1 effector cells are particularly important for effective bactericidal activity against intracellular pathogens. T h 17 cells are a branch of the adaptive immune system and appear to deal primarily with organisms inadequately subdued by T h 1 or T h 2 immunity and that seem to require a very robust inflammatory response. It is biologically plausible that an acquired immune deficit involving these pathways could lead to an increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections with the pathogens encountered in the perioperative period.

### Predicting the presence of colon cancer in members of a health maintenance organisation by evaluating analytes from standard laboratory records [^31a62dd6]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Our study is similar to a previous study of, which was conducted using a UK-based data set (THIN). In that study, which included 13 879 colon cancer cases and 54 109 matched controls, the risk model contained several of the haematologic variables we have included here, including red blood cell counts and neutrophils. In that study, the odds ratio for individuals in the highest vs the lowest risk decile was 18. In comparison, in our study, for individuals in the highest decile, the odds ratio was ∼28. For both the studies, the discriminatory power greatly exceeded that of previous models based on demographic factors and other risk factors.

The specific components of the CRC score fall into three principal categories: iron deficiency, inflammation and thrombosis, and liver function. Those individuals in the lowest quintile of haemoglobin level (< 13.5 for men and < 12.2 for women) were at increased risk for the development of CRC, presumably due to occult colonic bleeding, but the magnitude of the associations using haemoglobin alone (odds ratios three to four) were much less than those generated using the CRC score. There were also very strong and independent associations with low levels of serum iron and ferritin, which also contributed to risk beyond that of haemoglobin and red cell morphology. A high platelet count (top quintile vs others) was associated with a three-fold increased risk of CRC. Platelets have been implicated in CRC carcinogenesis and progression in several studies, although the exact mechanism by which platelets contribute to CRC incidence and metastasis is not known. Possible mechanisms include transport of cancer cells through intravasation and extravasation in and out of vessels and promoting cancer cell aggregation. Platelets also induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition of cancer cells, thereby enhancing their metastatic ability. Importantly, there is now compelling evidence that daily low-dose aspirin is an effective chemoprevention agent against CRC. It is proposed that the protective effect of aspirin works through the inhibition of platelet activation at GI mucosal lesions during the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. We hope to replicate the findings of the current study using other populations and to conduct studies to confirm the potential of our preliminary findings in terms of facilitating the early diagnosis of cancer.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with or without active cancer [^c3fd6713]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We observed that patients with active cancer were at increased risk of bleeding requiring transfusion and readmission at 30, 90, and 180 days after TAVR compared with those without. Previous studies demonstrated that patients with active cancer tend to have more bleeding events; our study extends beyond that, showing data of in‐hospital complications and readmission rates up to 180 days for individual cancer types. Specifically, patients with active colon cancer had the higher risks of bleeding events after the procedure. This has clinical implications, for example, a no‐antithrombotic strategy may be beneficial for patients with active colon cancer after TAVR, because the recent data revealed the potential benefit of nonantithrombotic therapy for reducing bleeding events without an increase in ischemic events. Another potential explanation for increased risk of readmission may be anemia due to bleeding, cancer, or cancer‐related therapies. Anemia has been found in 30% to 90% of patients with cancer, depending on the type and extent of cancer. Anemia in patients with cancer can be caused by hemolysis, blood loss, bone marrow failure, infection, and inflammation; all of which are also common side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Blood disorders, including anemia, are prevalent in patients undergoing TAVR, ranging from 45% to 65%, which have been associated with mortality and bleeding complications after TAVR. The findings from the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) I, II, and III trials and registries suggest that moderate‐to‐severe anemia (hemoglobin level < 11.0 g/dL) is independently associated with increased 1‐year mortality. In addition, blood transfusion itself also has been associated with acute kidney injury and long‐term mortality after TAVR, independently of bleeding. Although the limitations of the data set did not allow us to assess the impact of anemia on outcomes after TAVR in patients with active cancer, further studies are needed to reduce bleeding complications and blood transfusion.

### Current immunotherapeutic strategies in colon cancer [^71ff60b2]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Because chemotherapy is standard in the treatment of colorectal cancer, it is important to demonstrate whether immunizations may be given to patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. Although some studies have demonstrated immune responses in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who failed standard chemotherapy, the setting of minimal residual disease may be the preferred setting for cancer vaccines. It may be important to choose antigens that have functions important to the cancer cell. The best adjuvant is not well established and may depend on the type of immune response desired. The immune system is "programmed" to down-regulate immune responses once they have become activated to avoid the development of autoimmune disease.

### Hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier mitigates transfusion-mediated pancreas cancer progression [^257af819]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative blood transfusion in pancreatic cancer patients is linked to decreased survival; however, a causal mechanism has not been determined. Previously we have shown that the plasma fraction of stored packed red blood cells (pRBCs) promotes pancreas cancer progression and associated morbidity. We hypothesize these untoward effects will be mitigated by use of a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC).

Methods

Cytokines and growth factors were measured in the plasma fraction from stored pRBCs and in an HBOC via cytokine array followed by formal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In an immunocompetent murine model, pancreas cancer progression was determined in vivo by bioluminescence, tumor weight, and number of metastases.

Results

Elevated levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were present in the plasma fraction of stored pRBCs, but were not found in the HBOC. Intravenous delivery of plasma fraction to mice with pancreatic cancer resulted in increased bioluminescence activity compared with mice that received HBOC. Metastatic events and pancreatic primary tumor weights were significantly higher in animals receiving plasma fraction from stored pRBCs compared with animals receiving HBOC.

Conclusions

Intravenous receipt of the acellular plasma fraction of stored pRBCs promotes pancreatic cancer progression in an immunocompetent mouse model. These untoward events are mitigated by use of an HBOC.

Table 11 — colorectal cancer: Pediatric survivors < age 45 years and RT exposed should undergo CRC screening with colonoscopy or multitarget stool DNA screening at 5 years post-RT exposure or age 30 years, whichever occurs later (2B); adult survivors, as part of shared decision making, consider those exposed to abdominal/ pelvic RT or TBI who underwent HCT at ≥ 25 years of age, with colonoscopy beginning 5 years postRT exposure and no later than age 45 years (2B). Additional comments state to screen patients without RT exposure according to general population guidelines for their geographic region, individual risk factors, and family history; to screen patients with colon CPS based on underlying CPS; and that risk of subsequent CRC in those exposed to TBI is likely dose–dependent, with lower doses possibly not increasing risk to a level that makes early colonoscopy warranted.

### Effects of erythropoietin receptors and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on disease progression in cancer [^ee2d0e09]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Anaemia is often associated with chemotherapy treatment because of the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy and/or the cancer disease itself. As anaemia can lead to fatigue and decreased quality of life, its management is important for patient care. Anaemia therapies include red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which increase RBC production in bone marrow by activating the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) on erythrocytic-progenitor cells. Transfusions quickly increase haemoglobin levels but are associated with risks such as transmission of infectious pathogens and transfusion-related acute-lung injury. Large, placebo-controlled clinical trials have shown that ESAs decrease transfusion rates in cancer patients. Based on these trials, ESAs such as epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are approved in the United States and other countries for treating anaemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Additional ESAs are approved outside the United States for this indication.

Clinical and preclinical research has examined the benefits and risks associated with ESA use. Although ESAs decrease transfusions, they are associated with an increase in thromboembolic events. The potential for ESAs to affect disease progression and/or mortality in cancer patients has also been of concern. To better understand ESA-related safety issues, several recent large meta-analyses have examined how ESAs affect thromboembolic events and mortality. Disease progression, however, was not always addressed. Difficulties in analysing disease progression include variation in endpoints (e.g. progression-free survival, locoregional control, tumour response, etc.) and varying quality of disease-assessment measurements. Nonetheless, understanding if and how ESAs impact disease progression are key issues. This narrative review discusses clinical-trial data regarding ESAs and disease progression as well as preclinical research regarding how ESAs could affect disease progression at a cellular/molecular level.

### Immunological reactions secondary to blood transfusion [^dbd5c6e9]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Multiply injured patients are at risk of developing the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which may involve multiple organ failure, infections/sepsis, longer hospital stay and mortality. These systemic complications have been associated with immunological changes in which several components of the immune system have been implicated. Recent studies have shown that blood transfusions may increase these changes. The immunomodulating effects of packed red blood cells have been identified and attributed to contaminating leukocytes and inflammatory mediators in the supernatant liquid. This review will outline immunological consequences of allogeneic blood transfusion, with a special focus on trauma cases.

### Analysis of platelet count and new cancer diagnosis over a 10-year period [^b31a837c]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large, nested case-control study, we found that an elevated platelet count identified during a routine blood examination was associated with an increased risk of developing a range of solid tumors. The OR for the association was greatest for a diagnosis of cancer within 6 months of a blood test. For several cancer sites (lung, colon, stomach, esophagus, and kidney), a high platelet count was associated with a cancer diagnosis in the following 3 or more years. For lung cancer, a significant association was present 10 years before diagnosis. Long-term associations were also seen for kidney cancer and esophageal cancer. In contrast, for ovarian cancer, there was an association only in the 6 months before a diagnosis.

Overall, given the transient nature of the association with platelet count, our findings suggest that an elevated platelet count detected through routine blood examination may be a consequence of the presence of cancer rather than being a risk factor for the disease. The physiologic basis for the association is not clear but may be multifactorial. Platelets are produced in the bone marrow in response to thrombopoietin, which is upregulated by interleukin 6, primarily produced in the liver. It is possible that the increase in platelet count is a response to circulating factors produced by the cancer cells or is a local response to inflammation induced by the cancer cell mass. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between high platelet count and cancer, including the aggregation of cancer cells by platelets, increased extravasation or enhanced permeability of the basement membrane, and shielding cancer cells from immune attack in the bloodstream. Other possible mechanisms include iron deficiency, bleeding (among patients with colon cancer), abnormal platelet counts, and the infiltration of disseminated cancer cells in the bone marrow.
