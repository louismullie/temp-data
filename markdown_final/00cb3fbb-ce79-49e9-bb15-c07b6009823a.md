## Question

Dosage for Prednisolone in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prednisolone dosing in children across indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that prednisolone dosing must be individualized by disease severity and patient response. Then, I should verify disease-specific regimens for asthma exacerbations, nephrotic syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hepatitis, juvenile dermatomyositis, infantile hemangioma, and croup. Next, I will review formulation-specific considerations, administration timing, and bioequivalence issues. After that, I need to check tapering rules, adrenal suppression risk, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical dosing ranges and highlight key safety caveats and exceptions, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: prednisolone dosing in children is individualized by disease severity and clinical response, not by age or weight ratios alone, and therapy should be titrated to the lowest effective dose with close monitoring, tapering when courses exceed a few days to avoid withdrawal and adrenal suppression, which is consistently emphasized in FDA labeling and endocrine guidance [^116e4yj7] [^114jHng6] [^113Pu83V].

> I will now examine pediatric asthma exacerbations, since this is a common scenario; GINA recommends prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years, 30 mg/day for ages 2–5 years, and 40 mg/day for ages 6–11 years, typically for 3–5 days without tapering, and dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days is an evidence-based alternative with better adherence and less vomiting, with switching to prednisolone if relapse occurs, so I should confirm those ceilings and durations before proceeding [^112MXZew] [^115Sbu4q] [^111EEe41] [^113KRmut] [^1157R5if].

> Wait, let me verify the no-taper rule for short courses; NHLBI-aligned sources and GINA indicate that short "burst" therapy of 3–10 days does not require tapering after improvement, and meta-analytic data support dexamethasone as noninferior to prednisolone for relapse outcomes, which reinforces the practice of short, fixed-duration bursts in children with acute asthma [^1124pUMs] [^115paH13] [^114L3YfA].

> Next, I should review steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome; the standard initial regimen is prednisolone 60 mg/m²/day (or 2 mg/kg/day, maximum 60 mg/day) once daily for 4–6 weeks, followed by alternate-day prednisolone 40 mg/m²/day (or 1.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg on alternate days) for 2–5 months with tapering, and I need to ensure I distinguish this prolonged course from asthma bursts because tapering is integral here [^117JTtE6] [^114RdBh5].

> Hold on, I should verify whether longer initial courses reduce relapses; the PREDNOS trial found that extending to 16 weeks did not improve time to first relapse versus 8 weeks, and a Dutch RCT showed no benefit to extending from 3 to 6 months without increasing cumulative dose, suggesting that cumulative dose, not duration per se, drives relapse reduction, so I must be cautious not to overextend therapy without a dose rationale [^113bAxoz] [^115sopUr] [^111gikaL].

> For immune thrombocytopenia in children, I need to check the recommended prednisone/prednisolone dose; the ASH guideline suggests 2–4 mg/kg/day (maximum 120 mg/day) for 5–7 days, favoring prednisone over dexamethasone for non–life-threatening bleeding or HRQoL impairment, and I should confirm that this short, high-dose burst is not tapered if limited to 7 days or fewer [^112i42d8].

> Let me consider autoimmune hepatitis; AASLD guidance recommends prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day (maximum 40–60 mg/day) for induction, often with azathioprine to enable steroid sparing, and I should double-check that tapering begins after biochemical remission with reductions of 2.5–5 mg every 2–4 weeks toward a maintenance of 5–10 mg/day, which is distinct from the fixed short bursts used in asthma [^117YLHof].

> For juvenile dermatomyositis, I should confirm that high-dose glucocorticoids are first-line; SHARE/CARRA-aligned recommendations support oral prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day or IV methylprednisolone pulses 30 mg/kg/day (max 1 g) for induction, followed by a slow taper over months with early addition of methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent, and I need to ensure I note the emphasis on minimizing cumulative steroid exposure due to growth and toxicity risks [^112cts1E] [^1115dhg3].

> Now, infantile hemangioma; I should verify that when propranolol is contraindicated or ineffective, prednisolone 2–3 mg/kg/day for 4–12 weeks followed by a gradual taper and completion by 9–12 months is reasonable, but I must also highlight the consistent association with clinically important harms including growth suppression, hypertension, and behavioral changes, so the risk–benefit balance must be reassessed frequently [^117HSauH].

> For croup, let me reconsider the comparative data; a randomized trial showed prednisolone 1 mg/kg was noninferior to dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg and to low-dose dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg for short-term outcomes, so prednisolone remains acceptable when dexamethasone is unavailable or contraindicated, though dexamethasone is often preferred for adherence due to its longer half-life [^112LUMHy].

> I need to check formulation-specific issues; prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solutions and ODTs list pediatric initial ranges of 0.14–2 mg/kg/day in divided doses, but ODTs are friable and should not be split, so if precise tapering below 10 mg is needed, a liquid or crushable tablet should be used instead, and I should confirm that bioequivalence across pediatric formulations has been evaluated, with saliva-based PK studies supporting comparable exposure in children across common formulations [^112arHyN] [^114ZsXzX] [^114rhsgp].

> Next, I should review administration timing; morning administration aligns better with circadian cortisol physiology and may mitigate HPA-axis suppression, and delayed-release prednisone (RAYOS) leverages this principle, though pediatric-specific morning-dosing data for prednisolone are limited and decisions should prioritize clinical control and tolerability while avoiding late-evening dosing when possible [^114dh4av] [^113ejWEN].

> I will now examine tapering and adrenal suppression; tapering is required after more than 2 weeks of systemic therapy or when supraphysiologic exposure has occurred, with endocrine guidance recommending dose-based decrements and vigilance for glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, and I should confirm that physiologic thresholds for risk are roughly prednisolone 4–6 mg/day equivalents with risk rising after 3–4 weeks of exposure, prompting a structured taper and, when indicated, evaluation for adrenal insufficiency [^112G8gaC] [^114DSdhQ] [^113Pu83V] [^1171fF7m].

> But wait, what if the child is on long-term prednisolone and becomes ill; I need to ensure a sick-day plan is in place, with BSPED recommending additional hydrocortisone for stress dosing or, if not feasible, prednisolone 7.5 mg/m²/day divided twice daily, and I should double-check that families have emergency hydrocortisone and education on adrenal crisis prevention after prolonged or high-dose exposure [^114CQHnP] [^113kAt4R].

> Let me synthesize practical pediatric dosing ranges while keeping the disease-specific maxima in mind: for acute anti-inflammatory bursts, 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisolone is typical across asthma, ITP, JDM, and AIH, with hard caps of 20–60 mg/day depending on age and indication, whereas for nephrotic syndrome induction, 60 mg/m²/day (max 60 mg/day) is standard, and for infantile hemangioma, 2–3 mg/kg/day is used, always titrating to the lowest effective dose and transitioning to steroid-sparing strategies when possible [^112MXZew] [^112cts1E] [^117YLHof] [^117JTtE6] [^117HSauH].

> Hold on, I should verify growth-related cautions; prednisolone is approximately 15-fold more growth-suppressive than hydrocortisone, so for chronic replacement or prolonged therapy, hydrocortisone is preferred, and in CAH specifically, doses exceeding about 20 mg/m²/day in infants and 15–17 mg/m²/day in adolescents impair height, reinforcing the principle to use the lowest effective dose and to monitor growth velocity closely in any child on systemic steroids beyond a few weeks [^111qYfhp] [^112iUoH9].

> Finally, I need to ensure monitoring and safety are explicit; during prolonged therapy, check blood pressure, weight, height, and labs including postprandial glucose and potassium, and in children, track growth velocity as a sensitive marker of over-replacement; after systemic exposure, counsel families on infection risk, behavioral effects, and the need for timely follow-up to reassess control and steroid burden, adjusting therapy toward steroid-sparing agents whenever feasible [^116e4yj7] [^116MfdKQ] [^113KRmut].

Prednisolone dosing in children is individualized by disease severity and response, with typical pediatric ranges of 0.14–2 mg/kg/day [^112arHyN] or 4–60 mg/m²/day [^112nDjuY] in divided doses. For **acute asthma**, use 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 20–40 mg) for 3–5 days without taper [^112MXZew] [^111EEe41]. For **nephrotic syndrome**, use 60 mg/m²/day (max 80 mg) for 4 weeks, then 40 mg/m² on alternate days for 4 weeks [^114foCfP] [^112nDjuY]. For ITP, use 2–4 mg/kg/day (max 120 mg) for 5–7 days [^112i42d8]. Taper after prolonged use (> 2 weeks) to prevent **adrenal suppression**, and monitor growth, blood pressure, glucose, and bone health during therapy [^112G8gaC] [^116MfdKQ].

---

## General dosing principles

- **Individualized dosing**: Dose based on disease severity, response, and patient factors; avoid strict age/weight ratios [^116e4yj7] [^114jHng6].

- **Formulation considerations**: Use liquids or ODTs for young children; ODTs are not scored and should not be split [^114ZsXzX] [^114rhsgp].

- **Tapering**: Gradually reduce after > 2 weeks to avoid adrenal suppression [^112G8gaC] [^114DSdhQ].

## Indication-specific dosing guidelines

| **Indication** | **Recommended dose** | **Duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute asthma exacerbation | 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 20–40 mg) | 3–5 days | No taper required [^112MXZew] [^111EEe41] |
| Nephrotic syndrome (initial episode) | 60 mg/m²/day (max 80 mg) | 4 weeks daily, then 4 weeks alternate-day | Standard ISKDC regimen [^117JTtE6] [^112nDjuY] |
| Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) | 2–4 mg/kg/day (max 120 mg) | 5–7 days | Short course recommended [^112i42d8] |
| Juvenile dermatomyositis | 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 60–80 mg) | Months | Taper based on response [^112cts1E] [^1115dhg3] |
| Adrenal insufficiency (replacement) | 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/day | Daily | Monitor growth and adrenal function [^112iUoH9] |

---

## Maximum daily doses by age group

Maximum doses vary by indication and age: for asthma, **≤ 2 years: 20 mg/day** and **2–5 years: 30 mg/day** [^112MXZew]; for nephrotic syndrome, **≤ 80 mg/day** (typically 60 mg/m²/day) [^114foCfP]; and for ITP, **≤ 120 mg/day** [^112i42d8].

---

## Duration of therapy and tapering strategies

- **Short-term therapy (≤ 2 weeks)**: No taper required for asthma exacerbations [^111EEe41].

- **Long-term therapy (> 2 weeks)**: Taper gradually to prevent adrenal suppression [^112G8gaC] [^114DSdhQ].

- **Nephrotic syndrome**: Taper after initial daily course; alternate-day therapy reduces adverse effects [^117JTtE6] [^117Eubdi].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Growth monitoring**: Regular height/weight checks; growth suppression can occur even at low doses [^116MfdKQ].

- **Blood pressure and glucose**: Monitor during prolonged therapy [^116e4yj7].

- **Bone health**: Consider calcium/vitamin D and bone protection with prolonged use [^115PQDWj].

- **Adrenal suppression**: Risk increases with doses > 0.2 mg/kg/day or prolonged therapy; taper slowly [^111JUFyw] [^113Pu83V] [^114DSdhQ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants and young children**: Use liquid formulations; monitor growth and development closely [^111KmxBg] [^116MfdKQ].

- **Adolescents**: Higher doses may be needed due to increased metabolism; monitor for adverse effects [^116MfdKQ].

- **Alternative corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone or methylprednisolone may be used for specific indications (e.g. asthma, croup) [^112LUMHy] [^111EEe41].

---

Prednisolone dosing in children is tailored to disease severity and response, with typical ranges of 0.14–2 mg/kg/day or 4–60 mg/m²/day. Taper after prolonged use and monitor growth, blood pressure, glucose, and bone health to minimize adverse effects.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage of prednisolone oral solution should be individualized according to the severity of the disease and the response of the patient. For infants and children, the recommended dosage should be governed by the same considerations rather than strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

Hormone therapy is an adjunct to and not a replacement for conventional therapy. Dosage should be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days.

The severity, prognosis, expected duration of the disease, and the reaction of the patient to medication are primary factors in determining dosage. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued.

Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including two-hour postprandial blood glucose and serum potassium, and a chest X-ray should be obtained at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with known or suspected peptic ulcer disease.

The initial dosage of prednisolone oral solution may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisolone oral solution should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisolone oral solution for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### A review of prednisolone prescribing for children with acute asthma in the UK [^112DKbTt]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide asthma guidelines recommend short courses of oral prednisolone in children with acute exacerbations generating high prescription numbers. There is a paucity of evidence to inform the optimal dose and course duration. This has led to a variation in the recommendations for prednisolone prescribing. Our objective was to assess prednisolone prescribing practise for children with acute asthma in a representative sample of UK prescribers.

Methods

We developed an online questionnaire asking prescribers the prednisolone dosage, course duration and formulation used, whether they discussed oral prednisolone side effects with the family and at what child's age they changed from prescribing soluble to non-soluble formulations. This was sent to 1006 UK prescribers including Paediatric Respiratory Consultants, doctors in training, asthma nurses and General Practitioners.

Results

200 complete responses were received (response rate 20%). The majority of surveyed prescribers follow the British National Formulary for Children recommendations on dosage rather than those included in the British Thoracic Society and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Despite this, we highlighted a 4-fold variation in prednisolone dosages for acute asthma. The majority of prescribers chose 3 days as the course duration. High use of soluble formulations was highlighted.

Conclusions

There is wide variation in the dose of prednisolone prescribed for children with acute asthma in the UK. This reflects a relative lack of evidence that needs addressing.

### Is physiological glucocorticoid replacement important in children? [^114EP2Dr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Current glucocorticoid therapy in children

The dosage of hydrocortisone used for adrenal replacement has reduced over time. There has also been a move from twice-daily dosing to thrice-daily dosing with some evidence of benefit. More complex regimes with four times per day dosing, or dosing with reversed circadian pattern or strict 8 hourly dosing patterns are recommended by some paediatricians, but to date there has been no definitive evidence of superiority of any of these regimens and none of these regimens has replaced the physiological profile of cortisol in children or adults. Paediatric therapy for adrenal insufficiency in Europe was surveyed in 2014 through the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinologists. Although the survey response was small (67 respondents), participants represented 16 countries, and the vast majority of prescribers were using generic hydrocortisone either as crushed/dispersed tablets or as specially manufactured (ie, unlicensed) formulations. Manipulation of the doses was necessary as the standard tablet for hydrocortisone is 10 mg, which is too large a dose for the majority of children. Most paediatricians were prescribing hydrocortisone three times per day. In older children and adults, prednisolone or dexamethasone was used by some, but these are avoided in childhood because of their more potent effect on growth. Treatment with hydrocortisone results in cortisol profiles that are unphysiological, despite many different regimens being used. Children treated with hydrocortisone experience several spikes in cortisol concentrations over the day, often to supraphysiological concentrations, followed by prolonged periods of hypocortisolaemia between doses. Some regimens leave children and adults with low concentrations of cortisol over the evening, and with most current regimens cortisol concentrations fall to undetectable levels overnight, and do not rise again until the first dose of hydrocortisone has been absorbed.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^114ZsXzX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosing

Dosage of Orapred ODT should be individualized according to the severity of the disease and the response of the patient. For pediatric patients, the recommended dosage should be governed by the same considerations rather than strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

Do not break or use partial Orapred ODT tablets. Use an appropriate formulation of prednisolone if indicated dose cannot be obtained using Orapred ODT. This may become important in the treatment of conditions that require tapering doses that cannot be adequately accommodated by Orapred ODT, e.g., tapering the dose below 10 mg.

The initial dose of Orapred ODT may vary from 10 to 60 mg (prednisolone base) per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time, there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, Orapred should be discontinued and the patient placed on other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of Orapred ODT for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition.

### Glucocorticoid dosing and implications for vaccination: evolution of global definitions [^116QnqEG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite widespread adoption of "high-dose" glucocorticoid definitions across international immunisation guidelines (ie, prednisone-equivalent dosing > 20mg/day, or > 2mg/kg/day in children), the rationale remains unclear. Literature searches were performed through academic databases for this narrative review to identify relevant evidence regarding glucocorticoid dosing on vaccine responses and safety. In people receiving prednisone < 7mg/day, vaccine responses are maintained. In people on "high-dose" glucocorticoids (> 20mg/day), antibody titres and seropositivity are reduced, whereas the impact of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids (7 to 20mg/day) on vaccine efficacy remains inconclusive. Due to inconsistent paediatric dosing regimens, data is insufficient to support a unified "high-dose" glucocorticoid threshold. Non-live vaccines are well tolerated in patients receiving glucocorticoids with rheumatic/inflammatory disorders, but enhanced reactogenicity after live vaccination may occur in those with severe immunodeficiencies. Clinicians should consider individual risk-benefit profiles, rather than following strict dosing thresholds, when curating immunisation programs for patients prescribed glucocorticoids.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MXZew]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids in children with severe exacerbations — A dose of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years of age and 30 mg/day for children aged 2–5 years, is currently recommended (Evidence A). Several studies have failed to show any benefits when OCS are given earlier during periods of worsening wheeze managed in an outpatient setting, whereas a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of hospitalization when OCS were administered in the emergency department, but no clear benefit when given in the outpatient setting. A course of 3–5 days is sufficient in most children of this age and can be stopped without tapering, but the child must be reviewed after discharge to confirm recovery. In children discharged from the emergency department, an intramuscular corticosteroid may be an alternative to a course of OCS for preventing relapse, but the risk of long-term adverse effects must be considered and there is insufficient evidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.

### Prednisone (Rayos) [^114dh4av]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1	Recommended Dosing

Dosage of RAYOS should be individualized according to the severity of the disease and the response of the patient. For pediatric patients, the recommended dosage should be governed by the same considerations rather than strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am and is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocorticoid activity the least when given at the time of maximal activity. RAYOS is a delayed-release formulation of prednisone which releases the active substance beginning approximately 4 hours after intake [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The timing of RAYOS administration should take into account the delayed-release pharmacokinetics and the disease or condition being treated.

The initial dosage of RAYOS may vary from 5 to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Patients currently on immediate release prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone should be switched to RAYOS at an equivalent dose based on relative potency (2.4).

In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, RAYOS should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of RAYOS for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

Systemic corticosteroids for acute asthma — timing and doses: OCS should be given promptly, especially if the patient is deteriorating, or had already increased their reliever and maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting (Evidence B). The recommended dose of prednisolone for adults is 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, and 1–2 mg/kg/day for children 6–11 years.

### Methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) [^1124pUMs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1 mg/kg/day to 2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

Dosage must be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Routine laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, two-hour postprandial blood sugar, determination of blood pressure and body weight and a chest X-ray should be made at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with an ulcer history or significant dyspepsia.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neurologic-psychiatric).

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

Recommendations

Recommendations are followed by parentheses detailing GRADE and SoA details (strength of recommendation, quality of body of evidence, SoA).

(i) How should skeletal muscle inflammation (myositis) be treated?

1 -High dose glucocorticoids should be used to treat active muscle inflammation at time of treatment induction (1, B, 100%).

1a - Adult-specific. Oral prednisolone at a dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, usually 40–60 mg, is recommended (1, B, 100%).

1b - Paediatric-specific. Oral prednisolone at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day or intravenous methylprednisolone pulses 30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g daily i.v. dose is recommended (1, B, 100%).

1c -Intravenous methylprednisolone is to be considered, especially when there are concerns about gastrointestinal absorption. Use of intravenous methylprednisolone may allow increased therapeutic effect and less toxicity compared with oral glucocorticoid (2, B, 96%).

2 -Oral prednisolone should be tapered according to clinical response (1, B, 100%).

3 -Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs should be used to reduce muscle inflammation, achieve clinical remission and reduce steroid burden (1, C, 100%).

3a - Paediatric-specific. Early, complete control of muscle weakness and inflammation should be sought in juvenile-onset IIM, with the aim of improving outcomes and reducing disease-related complications (1, B, 100%).

3b - Paediatric-specific. A combination of high dose glucocorticoid and methotrexate should be used as first-line treatment in most cases (1, B, 100%).

3c - Paediatric-specific. A combination of prednisolone and methotrexate, as opposed to prednisolone and ciclosporin, should be used for the treatment of juvenile-onset IIM as this has a more favourable side effect profile (1, B, 100%).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113KRmut]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management — oral corticosteroids (OCS) action plan dosing and triggers: For most patients, the written asthma action plan should provide instructions for when and how to commence OCS, with a short course used for adults at 40–50 mg/day usually for 5–7 days for patients who fail to respond to an increase in reliever and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing maintenance medication for 2–3 days, deteriorate rapidly or have a peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 60% of their personal best or predicted value, or have worsening asthma and a history of sudden severe exacerbations; for children 6–11 years, the recommended dose of prednisone is 1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days, and patients should be advised about common side-effects and should contact their doctor if they start taking OCS.

Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) in children — treatment of the initial episode — We recommend that corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or prednisolone)* be given for at least 12 weeks, We recommend that oral prednisone be administered as a single daily dose starting at 60 mg/ m2/d or 2 mg/kg/d to a maximum 60 mg/d, and We recommend that daily oral prednisone be given for 4–6 weeks followed by alternate-day medication as a single daily dose starting at 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg on alternate days) and continued for 2–5 months with tapering of the dose. Prednisone and prednisolone are equivalent, used in the same dosage, and have both been used in RCTs depending on the country of origin. Patients and parents should be counseled regarding treatment adherence and that steroid therapy extended beyond the child's initial response may decrease the long-term risk of frequent relapses, and because more than 80% of children with new-onset NS relapse, altering the timing and frequency of future relapses is of broad impact.

### A multicenter randomized trial indicates initial prednisolone treatment for childhood nephrotic syndrome for two months is not inferior to six-month treatment [^111gikaL]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Extension of initial steroid treatment for more than 3 months to decrease the risk of relapse in children with steroid-sensitive (SS) NS has been widely described in previous studies. However, 80–90% of children diagnosed with SSNS who are given new corticosteroid treatments continue to relapse, and ∼50% relapse frequently. Therefore, initial approaches to SSNS therapy are likely to be substantially different. Our results demonstrate that extending initial steroid treatment, and even increasing the total dose of prednisolone (2240 vs. 3885 mg/m 2), does not improve clinical outcomes (time to FRNS, time to first relapse, the number of relapses, total prednisolone dose, and adverse events) for pediatric NS. Our results add to the Cochrane review by Hodgson et al. by comparing treatment regimens of 2 vs. 6 months.

Our findings build on a 2013 study from the Netherlands. This well-designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of children with NS clearly showed no improvement in clinical outcomes when the initial prednisolone treatment was extended from 3 to 6 months without an increasing cumulative dose. However, despite the results of this trial, the most effective duration and dosage of prednisolone treatment for an initial episode of SSNS is still under debate. Although our study has demonstrated that increasing the total dose in 2-month or 6-month regimens does not improve clinical outcomes, further investigation is still required to determine the most effective duration and dosage regimen for initial SSNS.

A key strength of our trial is its unique design. This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for noninferiority that compares the efficacy of the 2-month ISKDC regimen with a 6-month, long-term prednisolone regimen. The most important clinical objective of initial treatment of SSNS is to prevent frequent relapses. Consequently, the primary end point was set to time to FRNS rather than initial relapses.

### Childhood sarcoidosis: a rare but fascinating disorder [^11525sve]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment

The current therapy of choice for childhood sarcoidosis with multisystem involvement is corticosteroids. Dose and duration of therapy must often be individualized. Oral prednisone or prednisolone is usually initiated at 1–2 mg/kg/d for 4–8 weeks as induction treatment. This treatment is continued until the clinical manifestations of the disease resolve or show significant improvement. The steroid dosage is slowly tapered in treatment responders over a period of 2–3 months to an appropriate maintenance dose (i.e. the lowest dose that controls activity of the disease, typically 10–15 mg per day as a once daily regimen). Depending on which organs are involved and on the activity of the disease, maintenance treatment is usually required for at least 6 months for most age groups and then tapered if possible. Asymptomatic patients with isolated bilateral hilar adenopathy may not need systemic steroid therapy.

### A multicenter randomized trial indicates initial prednisolone treatment for childhood nephrotic syndrome for two months is not inferior to six-month treatment [^112zC9hr]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a disorder affecting the kidneys that is mainly characterized by high excretion of protein in the urine. Pediatric idiopathic NS is understood to be the most common cause of primary glomerular diseases, and it frequently occurs in infants aged 2–6 years. Most patients are presumed to have minor glomerular abnormality. Cellular immunologic abnormalities are believed to contribute to the condition, although its pathology remains unknown. In Europe and the United States, two in 100,000 children will develop idiopathic NS in a single year. An 8-week corticosteroid regimen is the standard initial treatment for children with idiopathic NS, as outlined by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC). Although corticosteroids induce the remission of proteinuria in more than 80% of children with idiopathic NS, ∼60% undergo proteinuria relapse. Previous research has shown that a high number of children undergo frequent relapse, and corticosteroid toxicities occur after repeated therapy. Although some controlled studies, and a meta-analysisshow that long-term corticosteroid treatment up to 7 months maximum leads to a longer sustained remission of NS than ISKDC-recommended administration, the optimum dose and duration of initial therapy are still unknown. A Cochrane review concluded that a well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trial is required to establish the optimum dose and duration of treatment. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 2 months of initial prednisolone therapy (ISKDC regimen) is not inferior to 6 months of initial therapy with an increasing cumulative dose, and to compare adverse events between treatment regimens.

BSPED consensus recommendations for oral hydrocortisone dose for sick day episodes: Specific situations

In patients on supraphysiological glucocorticoid therapy such as prednisolone, deflazacort or dexamethasone for an existing chronic condition, a simple and safe approach is to consider additional hydrocortisone, at sick day doses to ensure adequate plasma cortisol levels throughout the day and night. Alternatively, if the child is taking a glucocorticoid at over 30 mg/m 2 /day of a hydrocortisone equivalent dose, then further sick day doses with additional hydrocortisone may not be necessary in principle but they should have a bespoke plan for the management of AI. For those on regular prednisolone, our recommendation is for sick day dosing with hydrocortisone. If this is not practical, then prednisolone 7.5/mg/m 2 /day given in two divided doses can be used. If the existing prednisolone dose is greater than the required sick day dose, then the prescribed prednisolone should be split into two doses given at 12-hourly intervals. The relatively short half-life of Deflazacort necessitates the use of sick day dosing with hydrocortisone.

For patients prescribed Alkindi, increase doses as per sick day guidance using either Alkindi granules in capsules for opening or oral hydrocortisone (immediate release preparation).

If the child is on two times a day Efmody (modified release hydrocortisone), they should be switched to immediate release oral hydrocortisone as per sick day episode guidance in four divided doses while unwell. Alternatively, Efmody may be continued at the usual dose and additional immediate release hydrocortisone added in four divided doses to provide a combined (Efmody and immediate release oral hydrocortisone) glucocorticoid dose of 30 mg/m 2 /day.

BSPED consensus recommendations for treatment of adrenal crisis

Management of AC includes urgent administration of hydrocortisone, along with assessment and treatment of hypoglycaemia, hypotension and dehydration (table 3). Young people (16–18 years) admitted under the care of adult services should be managed as per the SFE guidelines. For a new presentation of AI or AC, diagnostic investigations should be taken prior to the administration of hydrocortisone where possible (urea and electrolytes, glucose, ACTH, cortisol, renin, aldosterone, 17OHP, urine steroid profile).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11692LFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Adrenal crisis in primary adrenal insufficiency — acute management — We recommend that patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with an immediate parenteral injection of 100 mg (50 mg/m2 for children) hydrocortisone, followed by appropriate fluid resuscitation and 200 mg (50–100 mg/m2 for children) of hydrocortisone/24 hours (via continuous iv therapy or 6 hourly injection), with age- and body surface-appropriate dosing required in children; if hydrocortisone is unavailable, we suggest prednisolone as an alternative, and dexamethasone is the least- preferred alternative and should only be given if no other glucocorticoid is available.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^115qmevJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Randomisation

Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: intervention (prednisolone) or matched placebo. An independent statistician has generated a randomization schedule using variable block sizes, stratified by site. This schedule will be used by the central study pharmacist at RCH to undertake the blinding, labelling and distribution of the study drugs to participating sites by putting together study packs of the required drug labelled with sequential study numbers for each site and dosing instructions. Randomization will be undertaken at the site by ED and research staff by selecting the lowest numbered study pack (next pack system) from the study drug store in ED.

Interventions

There is currently little evidence to assist in determining the best prednisolone dose in children. Adult studies of Bell's palsy have used various steroids and doses. The two large adult RCT used 50 mg prednisolone daily for 10 days or 60 mg prednisolone daily for 5 days then weaning over 5 days. The only paediatric RCT of steroid use for Bell's palsy used methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 1.25 mg/kg/day prednisolone) for 10 days, then weaned over 3–5 days. Observational data from the central study site, and unpublished survey data from the PREDICT network indicate that prednisolone is the most frequently used steroid for Bell's palsy in children, usually at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for a variable number of days. Prednisolone is also the most frequently used oral corticosteroid in children in Australia and New Zealand for various other inflammatory conditions, with routine doses of 1–2 mg/kg/day.

Noting the adult dose used by Sullivan et al. (50 mg for 10 days without taper); having sought advice from endocrinologists and rheumatologists; in consideration of the current local guidelines and with consideration to ease of preparation of study drugs, a dose of ~1 mg/kg daily for 10 days without taper was chosen for the current study. For the 10-day study treatment period, participants will therefore be assigned to receive either ~1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone (based on weight categories) up to a maximum of 50 mg/day or to receive matching placebo.

Adverse events from this dose and short duration are expected to be limited to minor behavioral changes and possible weight gain. Drug related adverse events will be recorded. Risks should be reduced by adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117YLHof]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) induction and taper dosing with prednisone/prednisolone and azathioprine (AZA) is specified as follows: Prednisone alone is 40–60 mg daily in adults and 1–2 mg/kg daily in children (maximum dose 40–60 mg daily), or a lower dose of prednisone 20–40 mg daily in combination with AZA; AZA adult dosing is United States 50–150 mg daily, Europe 1–2 mg/kg daily, and pediatric 1–2 mg/kg daily. Some centers advocate using prednisone 1 mg/kg for adult patients. In Europe, prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily) is administered with AZA (1–2 mg/kg daily). Most centers recommend waiting 2 weeks before starting AZA to confirm steroid responsiveness, evaluate TPMT status, and exclude AZA-induced hepatitis. Once a biochemical remission has been achieved, response-guided therapy is advocated, with reduction to 20 mg daily while monitoring laboratory tests every 2 weeks, followed by a gradual taper of 2.5–5 mg every 2–4 weeks to achieve a lower dose of 5–10 mg daily.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^116MesSr]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Two previous randomised controlled trials found no benefit associated with parent initiated oral corticosteroids. The first study, by Grant et al, evaluated a single 2 mg per kg dose of prednisolone administered by parents at the onset of wheezing in 86 children with a diagnosis of "asthma". The participants were aged 2 to 14 years, but most were less than 6 years of age. They were observed for a 12 month period: during one six month period the study medication was prednisolone, during the other it was placebo. Surprisingly, the likelihood of health resource use was greater during the six months where the study medication was prednisolone. There were no differences between treatment periods in the other measured outcomes.

The second study, by Oommen et al, evaluated in children aged 1 to 5 years the efficacy of 20 mg prednisolone a day for five days administered by parents at the onset of an episode of wheeze. A total of 217 children were enrolled and data were collected on 121 wheeze episodes. There was no difference between treatment groups in symptom scores, health resource use, substitution of the study medication, or other outcome measures.

There are several reasons why we observed a benefit from parent initiated oral corticosteroids whereas previous trials on parent led oral corticosteroid use have not. Most notably, the children included in this study were of school age, whereas most of the participants in the previous trials on parent initiated oral corticosteroids were of preschool age. There is good evidence that oral corticosteroids are effective in school age children with asthma, whereas recent evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids may not be effective among preschool children with virus induced wheezing.

It may also be relevant that we emphasised coadministration of high doses of β agonists. The early effects of oral corticosteroids are partly owing to upregulation of β receptors on the surface of airway smooth muscle, rather than anti-inflammatory action. In the previous trials on parent initiated oral corticosteroids, the recommended dose of β agonist was either lower than that used in our trial (up to 400 μg of salbutamol)or not specified.

Finally, our study had greater statistical power than previous studies because we collected data on a higher number of episodes and our data were paired.

### Benefit of dexamethasone compared with prednisolone for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: results of the UK medical research council ALL97 randomized trial [^11661GhG]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are an essential component of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Prednisolone is the most commonly used steroid, particularly in the maintenance phase of therapy. There is increasing evidence that, even in equipotent dosage for glucocorticoid effect, dexamethasone has enhanced lymphoblast cytotoxicity and penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) compared with prednisolone. Substitution of dexamethasone for prednisolone in the treatment of ALL might, therefore, result in improved event-free and overall survival. Children with newly diagnosed ALL were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone or prednisolone in the induction, consolidation (all received dexamethasone in intensification) and continuation phases of treatment. Among 1603 eligible randomized patients, those receiving dexamethasone had half the risk of isolated CNS relapse (P = 0.0007). Event-free survival was significantly improved with dexamethasone (84.2% vs. 75.6% at 5 years; P = 0.01), with no evidence of differing effects in any subgroup of patients. The use of 6.5 mg/m(2) dexamethasone throughout treatment for ALL led to a significant decrease in the risk of relapse for all risk-groups of patients and, despite the increased toxicity, should now be regarded as part of standard therapy for childhood ALL.

### Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in children: an open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease [^111BUSed]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Various prednisolone formulations are frequently used to treat asthma-like symptoms in children; the potential differences in bioequivalence between these formulations have never been examined.
Pharmacokinetic studies have traditionally been burdensome for the paediatric population due to numerous blood samples.
It is important to study the acceptability of paediatric formulations, since manipulating medicine or introducing different formulations may diminish or enhance tolerability.

What this study hopes to add?

Paediatric bioequivalence data on prednisolone oral solution, crushed tablets and orodispersible tablets compared with whole tablets.
Prednisolone concentration data are collected using saliva samples, validated with plasma samples if the patient has an intravenous access for clinical purposes.
Acceptability data on different prednisolone formulations using a modified Wong-Baker face scale.

### Long term tapering versus standard prednisolone treatment for first episode of childhood nephrotic syndrome: phase III randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113bAxoz]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The best initial prednisolone regimen for children presenting with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome remains unknown. The eight week course first described in the 1960s by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (prednisolone 60 mg/m 2 for four weeks then 40 mg/m 2 on alternate days for four weeks) continues to be used in most UK centres and in many other countries. However, systematic review data suggest that a more intensive initial treatment course improves clinical outcomes. When the prednisolone in nephrotic syndrome (PREDNOS) trial started, six randomised controlled trials had compared the eight week course with a range of different prednisolone regimens of three months or longer. A 2005 Cochrane review concluded that prednisolone treatment of three months or longer statistically significantly reduced the rate of relapse at 12–24 months and the rate of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines published in 2012 supported the conclusions of this Cochrane review. These guidelines recommended daily prednisolone treatment of 60 mg/m 2 or 2 mg/kg for four to six weeks followed by 40 mg/m 2 or 1.5 mg/kg on alternate days and continued for two to five months, with tapering of the dose. Despite these recommendations, several methodological concerns relating to these six studies have resulted in the continued use of the eight week course in the UK and elsewhere.

We conducted the PREDNOS trial to compare this eight week course with a longer 16 week course in UK children. The study design was optimised to overcome the methodological concerns relating to previous studies. We first performed an external pilot study over a year that included 55 participants. This pilot study helped us to develop the design of the main trial and found that participants of different ethnicities could be recruited in district hospitals and tertiary nephrology centres. The primary objective of the main trial was to determine whether an initial 16 week extended course of prednisolone treatment increased the time to first relapse in children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome compared with the eight week standard course. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the extended course reduced the relapse rate, the proportion of participants who developed frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, and the requirement for second and third line immunosuppressive agents. Additionally, we considered whether the extended course was associated with an increased incidence of corticosteroid related adverse events, including behavioural problems. We also performed a cost effectiveness analysis by comparing costs and quality adjusted life years for the two regimens, and the methods and results are reported in supplementary appendices 1, 3, and 4.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111dFmQa]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

PCP with moderate or severe disease — systemic corticosteroids indication, timing, and dosing: On the basis of studies in both adults and children, a short course of corticosteroids is recommended in cases of moderate or severe PCP, starting within 72 hours of diagnosis (AI*). Indications for corticosteroid treatment include a PaO2 value of < 70 mm Hg or an alveolar-arterial gradient of > 35 mm Hg. A commonly used scheme is prednisone 1 mg/kg of body weight/dose twice daily on days 1 through 5; 0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose twice daily on days 6 through 10; and 0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose once daily on days 11 through 21. Alternative regimens include adult dosage of prednisone 40 mg/dose twice daily on days 1 through 5; 40 mg/dose once daily on days 6 through 10; 20 mg/dose once daily on days 11 through 21, and methylprednisolone IV 1 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours on days 1 through 7; 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 8 through 9; 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily on days 10 and 11; and 1 mg/kg/dose once daily on days 12–16.

### Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in children: an open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease [^1123hSCB]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Ethics and dissemination

Before prednisolone treatment is initiated, a patient information sheet is given to eligible patients and the trial is explained to their parents. Parents will have a minimum of 15 min to consider the consent, because treatment should not be unnecessarily delayed. Informed consent will be granted by parents or legal guardian, as all children are below 15 years of age. If one of the parents is not present, a written authority can be used. The consent process will be conducted by an investigator with training and experience with minors. The collected material is considered a research biobank.

Safety

Despite a large therapeutic index, it is important that all glucocorticoids are administered in the lowest effective dose as possible, since a considerable number of dose-dependent adverse drugs reactions (ADRs) are well described. A recent review found that the most frequent ADRs associated with short course oral corticosteroids (< 14 days) in children were vomiting, changes in behavoiur and sleep disturbances with incidence rates of 5.4%, 4.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Increased susceptability to infection were one of the serious ADRs ocurring in up to 1% of the children.

Trial limitations

Alterations have been made in this trial compared with a classic BE trial to adapt to the relevant population. There are no existing guidelines for paediatric BE trials. A guideline is warranted since paediatric BE trials must be pragmatic in order to adapt to the paediatric population and to be conducted ethically.

Optimally, a randomised, two-period/three-period, two-sequence/three-sequence single-dose cross-over design would be used for healthy adults. This trial is a single-dose study performed during admission, limiting the possible number of doses/formulations per patient, with a theoretical washout period of 24 hours, as prednisolone is dosed once daily. The half-life of prednisolone is 2.5 ± 0.5 hours, and 24 hours should be enough time to ensure drug concentrations below quantification. However, as a precaution, predose samples are collected if prednisolone has been administered the day before inclusion. The saliva samples will be measured in 11 or 12 hours, respectively, which will be within five half-lives for many patients. Late night samples will be more difficult to collect if the participants are asleep and some might not be collected due to patient and parent preferences.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate [^112nDjuY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (20.2 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

5 ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS

5.1 Recommendations

1 Oral corticosteroids should be used as a second‐line induction treatment for mild‐to‐moderate UC not responding to 5‐ASA (oral and/or rectal). Corticosteroids may be considered as first‐line induction treatment for moderate‐to‐severe disease based on clinical and endoscopic characteristics [EL3, adults EL1] (Agreement 100%).
2 Second‐generation oral corticosteroids with lower systemic effect such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) [EL2, adults EL1] and budesonide‐MMX [EL5, adults EL2] may be considered in patients with mild‐to‐moderate disease refractory to 5‐ASA (Agreement 100%).
3 Corticosteroids should not be used for maintaining remission, and the need for repeated courses should prompt a change in therapy; corticosteroid‐sparing strategies should be applied [EL5, adults EL4] (Agreement 100%).

5.2 Practice points

1 The recommended daily dose for oral prednisolone/prednisone is 1 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) once daily in the morning for 1–2 weeks (in any case not > 4 weeks) followed by a tapering period of up to 7 weeks (Table 1) (Agreement 100%).
2 In patients > 30 kg, the dosing schedule of BDP is 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks, and for budesonide‐MMX 9 mg for 8 weeks. Dosing for children < 30 kg has not been established. No liquid formulation is available. There is no evidence to support whether and how to taper either drug. While abrupt discontinuation has been practiced in RCTs, alternate day tapering over 2–4 weeks may be considered (Agreement 100%).
3 The term 'corticosteroid‐dependency' applies to patients who are unable to stop corticosteroids within 3 months due to ongoing disease activity, or who have a relapse requiring corticosteroids within 3 months of stopping corticosteroids (Agreement 100%).
4 Alertness to symptoms of adrenal suppression (e.g. weakness/fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, arthralgia and abdominal pain) is needed for all patients on corticosteroids, particularly in those recently exposed to high doses and repeated exposures/long duration. When these symptoms are present while weaning corticosteroids below physiological threshold (approx. 0.2 mg/kg/day of prednisone), adrenal insufficiency should be excluded (Agreement 100%).

Initial corticosteroid regimen history and duration evidence — pediatric nephrotic syndrome: In the 1960s and 1970s, a consensus initial corticosteroid regimen was 60 mg/m^2/d for 4 weeks followed by +40 mg/m^2/d for 3 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks, with the follow-up dose later changed to every other day corticosteroids for ease of administration and no head-to-head comparisons available. While some early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a benefit of longer corticosteroid treatment (12–24 weeks) versus 8 weeks on risk of relapse, more recent studies have not consistently shown a benefit for extending the initial treatment course beyond 12 weeks.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^114rhsgp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Orapred ODT are packaged in a blister. Patients should be instructed not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. The blister pack should then be peeled open, and the orally disintegrating tablet placed on the tongue, where tablets may be swallowed whole as any conventional tablet, or allowed to dissolve in the mouth, with or without the assistance of water. Orally disintegrating tablet dosage forms are friable and are not intended to be cut, split, or broken.

Multiple Sclerosis

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

Pediatric

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of Orapred may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

Nephrotic Syndrome

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

Asthma

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses.

It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

2.2 Recommended Monitoring

Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including serum potassium and fasting blood glucose, should be obtained at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Appropriate diagnostic studies should be performed in patients with known or suspected peptic ulcer disease and in patients at risk for reactivation of latent tuberculosis infections.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113ejWEN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid physiology and dose equivalence — Glucocorticoids are secreted in a pulsatile and circadian rhythm with a morning peak and a nadir around midnight. Mean cortisol production is about 5–8 mg/m2/d, which is equivalent to an oral replacement with 15–25 mg/d of hydrocortisone or 20–35 mg of cortisone acetate in adults. In most industrialized countries, hydrocortisone is the preferred pharmacological replacement agent, but cortisone acetate is also in widespread use, and in a number of countries only prednisolone is available. Because of the short plasma half-life of hydrocortisone (approximately 90 min), multiple dosing is recommended; the first and largest dose is suggested upon awakening, the second after lunch, and, with a three-dose regimen, the last and smallest dose not later than 4–6 hours before bedtime.

### Prednisolone versus dexamethasone for croup: a randomized controlled trial [^112LUMHy]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The use of either prednisolone or low-dose dexamethasone in the treatment of childhood croup lacks a rigorous evidence base despite widespread use. In this study, we compare dexamethasone at 0.6 mg/kg with both low-dose dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg and prednisolone at 1 mg/kg.

Methods

Prospective, double-blind, noninferiority randomized controlled trial based in 1 tertiary pediatric emergency department and 1 urban district emergency department in Perth, Western Australia. Inclusions were age > 6 months, maximum weight 20 kg, contactable by telephone, and English-speaking caregivers. Exclusion criteria were known prednisolone or dexamethasone allergy, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, steroid therapy or enrollment in the study within the previous 14 days, and a high clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A total of 1252 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg; n = 410), low-dose dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg; n = 410), or prednisolone (1 mg/kg; n = 411). Primary outcome measures included Westley Croup Score 1-hour after treatment and unscheduled medical re-attendance during the 7 days after treatment.

Results

Mean Westley Croup Score at baseline was 1.4 for dexamethasone, 1.5 for low-dose dexamethasone, and 1.5 for prednisolone. Adjusted difference in scores at 1 hour, compared with dexamethasone, was 0.03 (95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.15) for low-dose dexamethasone and 0.05 (95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.17) for prednisolone. Re-attendance rates were 17.8% for dexamethasone, 19.5% for low-dose dexamethasone, and 21.7% for prednisolone (not significant [P = 0.59 and .19]).

Conclusions

Noninferiority was demonstrated for both low-dose dexamethasone and prednisolone. The type of oral steroid seems to have no clinically significant impact on efficacy, both acutely and during the week after treatment.

### A multicenter randomized trial indicates initial prednisolone treatment for childhood nephrotic syndrome for two months is not inferior to six-month treatment [^114foCfP]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Procedures

The first patient was randomized in September 2007, and the last patient in January 2011. Follow-up started at diagnosis and was truncated when the last enrolled patients finished the 24-month intervention.

All patients diagnosed with a first episode of idiopathic NS started initial therapy of 60 mg/m 2 oral prednisolone in three divided doses (maximum of 80 mg/day) daily for 4 weeks. Patients underwent a screening examination and were registered after their eligibility, including remission, was verified. Participants switched to trial medication after initial doses of prednisolone were given (Figure 4). If participants relapsed after remission during the initial 4-week prednisolone treatment, they were excluded.

Trial medication consisted of initial treatment regimens and relapse treatment, and was completed within a total of 24 months in both groups (Figures 4 and 5). The duration of long-term prednisolone treatment was set to 6 months, which is consistent with recommendations from a non-Japanese randomized controlled trial. The cumulative dose of initial treatment was 2240 mg/m 2 (2-month group) and 3885 mg/m 2 (6-month group). Participants who relapsed during the 24-month trial medication period received relapse treatment regimens (Figure 5). Relapse treatment was the same in both groups. However, relapse treatment given during the 6-month initial treatment was adjusted according to the initial treatment regimen in the 6-month group.

Participant characteristics (age, sex, physical characteristics, blood, and urine test results) were recorded at baseline. Clinical assessment and urine tests (urinalysis, qualitative and quantitative proteinuria, quantitative creatinine) were performed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after enrollment and every 3 months thereafter, and also on diagnosis of relapse. Blood analysis (complete blood cell count, blood chemistry) was performed at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months after enrollment, at the end of treatment, and at diagnosis of relapse only.

Adverse events were recorded throughout the trial period and assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Within 4 weeks of starting initial treatment, participants were screened for glaucoma by an ophthalmologist. Details about monitoring adverse events are described in the Supplementary Information online. Briefly, name of diagnosis, severity, seriousness, date of onset and disappearance, outcome, and assessment of causal relationship to the study drug were investigated at the start of study treatment and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months after the start of study treatment (each within ± 2 weeks).

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111qYfhp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Childhood glucocorticoid (GC) selection, formulations, and growth effects — "During childhood, the preferred GC is HC" due to its short half-life, with potency comparisons showing "the estimated growth-suppressive effect of prednisolone was ~15-fold more potent than that of HC; Dex may be up to 70- to 80-fold more potent than HC". Liquid preparations vary: "HC cypionate oral suspensions were inadequate to control CAH in children", whereas "Good control can be achieved by orally administering crushed, weighed HC tablets", and "Compounding pharmacies should be chosen for reliability". Dosing schedules lack evidence: "Insufficient data exist to recommend fractional distribution of doses", and excessive dosing impairs growth — "When doses exceed 20 mg/m2 per day in infants or 15 to 17 mg/m2 per day in adolescents, there is a decrease in height standard deviation score (SDS)". Pharmacokinetic variability "may influence HC dosing requirements", more potent GCs "cannot be routinely recommended", puberty may reduce control, and importantly "patients treated with < 20 mg of HC/m2 per day at the start of puberty are significantly taller" than those on higher doses.

### Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in children: an open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease [^111CRdy4]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

One in three Danish children under 3 years of age experience asthma-like symptoms, and one-third will later be diagnosed with asthma. Oral prednisolone is used in various formulations to treat acute asthma. However, the potential differences in bioequivalence between these formulations have never been examined in children despite interchangeable use in clinical practice.

Methods and analysis

An open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease.

The included patients (6 months–11 years of age) are admitted to the Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine Nordsjællands University Hospital, Hillerød, with asthma or asthma-like symptoms.

The primary objective is to assess the bioequivalence between different prednisolone formulations herein area under the concentration time curve, Cmax and Tmax using saliva samples. The secondary objectives are to evaluate tolerability (five-point face scale), adverse events and severity of the disease. If the patient has an intravenous access for other purposes, the saliva samples will be validated with plasma samples.

A total of 66 evaluable patients are needed according to European Medicines Agency Guideline on bioequivalence.

Ethics and dissemination

Traditional pharmacokinetic trials are burdensome due to the extent of blood samples necessary to capture the time-dependant drug profile. Saliva sampling is far more acceptable for paediatric patients. In addition, this trial adheres to standard dosing strategies. No additional venepunctures are performed, and no additional prednisolone doses are administered.

Guidelines for paediatric bioequivalence trials are warranted.

Trial registration number

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115Sbu4q]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations in primary or acute care for children 5 years and younger — assess severity while starting SABA and oxygen: "SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for first hour) and oxygen (to maintain saturation 94–98%)". Recommend escalation and transfer criteria: "Recommend immediate transfer to hospital if there is no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours;… respiratory rate > 40/minute… or if oxygen saturation is < 92% on room air". Systemic corticosteroid options and dosing include: "Consider oral prednisolone/prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day… up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0–2 years, and 30 mg/day for children aged 3–5 years, for up to 5 days; or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 days". If relapse or non‑resolution occurs with dexamethasone, "consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone". Note measurement caution: "oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color".

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^117HSauH]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Key action statement 3E — systemic corticosteroids for infantile hemangiomas (IHs): Clinicians may prescribe oral prednisolone or prednisone to treat IHs if there are contraindications or an inadequate response to oral propranolol (grade B, moderate recommendation). In the AHRQ review, oral steroids had a mean estimate of expected clearance of 43%. Dose ranges of prednisone or prednisolone reported most frequently are between 2 and 5 mg/kg per day, and most consider optimal dosing to be 2 to 3 mg/kg per day; typical protocols include treating at full dose for 4 to 12 weeks followed by a gradual taper and completion of therapy by 9 to 12 months of age, with some advocating shorter treatment durations (1–6 weeks) with intermittent courses as needed. In the AHRQ review, steroids were consistently associated with clinically important harms, including Cushingoid appearance, infection, growth retardation, hypertension, and mood changes, and the authors considered the SOE to be moderate for the association of steroids with clinically important harms.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution) [^112arHyN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (25 mg prednisolone per 5 mL) may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (33.6 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

Cortisone, 125 Triamcinolone, 20

Hydrocortisone, 100 Paramethasone, 10

Prednisolone, 25 Betamethasone, 3.75

Prednisone, 25 Dexamethasone, 3.75

Methylprednisolone, 20

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

Introduction

One in three Danish children under 3 years of age experience asthma-like symptoms, and one-third will later be diagnosed with asthma. Therapeutic management of acute asthma-like symptoms in infants and children has been repeatedly discussed. Oral glucocorticoids are frequently added to inhaled beta-2-agonist if the patient does not respond to the initial treatment. However, no therapeutic interval exists for glucocorticoids, and no clinical biomarker has been deveopled to asses efficacy.

Furthermore, in Denmark, only intravenous formulations and prednisolone or hydrocortisone tablets are licenced for patients < 18 years of age. Infants and children who are unable or unwilling to swallow a tablet or where dosing is based on body weight are urged to use either an extemporaneous oral liquid formulation, crushed or split tablets. Splitting tablets may lead to dose inaccuracy, and in one study, crushing hydrocortisone tablets lead to therapeutic failure. Extemporaneous formulations are not subject to randomised controlled trials as licenced formulations and bioequivalence (BE) are not determined between different formulations with the same active ingredience. Moreover, the paediatric population is a heterogeneous group of patients ranging from premature neonates to adolescents. The wide physical and developmental differences influence both pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic parameters. These issues are generally poorly studied.

BE studies compare both the rate (the time to Cmax = Tmax) and extent of absorption (area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of various drug formulations. Regulatory guidelines on BE state that two treatments are not different from one another if the 90% CI of the ratio of a log-transformed exposure measure (AUC and/or Cmax) falls within the range of 80%–125%.

To date, one BE study with prednisolone have been performed in healthy adults. Francisco et al examined AUC, Tmax and Cmax of five commercially oral prednisone tablets compared with one reference solution in 18 healthy adults. No statistically significant differences were found between the tablets. Non-significant variations were seen between the solution and tablets except for Tmax, which was 0.53 and 1.2–1.7 hours, respectively. A bioavailability study from Georgitis et al compared liquid prednisone, prednisone tablet and intravenous prednisoloneand found that the AUC for liquid and tablet were significantly different. No studies have been performed in a target patient population, taking into consideration factors such as comorbidities, comedication and physiological factors including first pass metabolism, gastric pH and bacterial flora, which are highly relevant in infants and children.

### Novel insights into glucocorticoid replacement therapy for pediatric and adult adrenal insufficiency [^112USH9t]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

No consensual definition of adrenal crisis has been internationally accepted. A recent review proposed a revised definition: '… an acute health impairment accompanied by features such as hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, or 20 mmHg lower than the usual value), acute abdominal symptomatology, altered sensorium, acute metabolic disturbances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia), pyrexia, which resolve after parenteral glucocorticoid administration'. he clinical features are a consequence of the incapacity of adrenocortical hormones levels to meet requirements during physical and physiological stress.

The first-line management relies on fluid resuscitation and stress-dosing glucocorticoid replacement. While hypovolemia and hyponatremia need rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with isotonic sodium chloride 0.9%, hypoglycemia is corrected with intravenous 5% dextrose. As for glucocorticoid replacement, parenteral HC should be administered immediately, either intramuscularly or intravenously, to prevent further clinical deterioration. An important advantage of HC is its mineralocorticoid effect when it exceeds 50 mg/day. If HC is not available, prednisolone is the second-line preferred treatment and dexamethasone is the least preferred.

For adults, Endocrine Society guidelines recommend an intravenous bolus of 100 mg HC, followed by 200 mg/24 h as a continuous infusion or 6-hourly injection and reduced to 100 mg/day the next day. Glucocorticoids should be tapered to maintenance dosage in 1–3 days in accordance with the clinical evolution. In children, the stress dose varies according to age as follows: 25 mg/m 2 in infants, 50 mg/m 2 in preschool children and 100 mg/m 2 in children above the age of 12 years. The bolus is followed by the same dose divided 6 hourly for 24–48 h. As for fluid resuscitation, a rapid bolus of 20 ml/kg is recommended. In case of shock, it can be increased up to 60 ml/kg within 1 h. Hypoglycemia correction, which is much more common in children necessitates 0.5–1 g/kg of intravenous (IV) dextrose.

### Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in children: an open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease [^112gvzxz]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

One in three Danish children under 3years of age experience asthma-like symptoms, and one-third will later be diagnosed with asthma. Oral prednisolone is used in various formulations to treat acute asthma. However, the potential differences in bioequivalence between these formulations have never been examined in children despite interchangeable use in clinical practice.

Methods and Analysis

An open-label, randomised, two-treatment cross-over trial investigating the bioequivalence of different prednisolone formulations in children with airway disease. The included patients (6 months-11 years of age) are admitted to the Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine Nordsjællands University Hospital, Hillerød, with asthma or asthma-like symptoms. The primary objective is to assess the bioequivalence between different prednisolone formulations herein area under the concentration time curve, Cmax and Tmax using saliva samples. The secondary objectives are to evaluate tolerability (five-point face scale), adverse events and severity of the disease. If the patient has an intravenous access for other purposes, the saliva samples will be validated with plasma samples. A total of 66 evaluable patients are needed according to European Medicines Agency Guideline on bioequivalence.

Ethics and Dissemination

Traditional pharmacokinetic trials are burdensome due to the extent of blood samples necessary to capture the time-dependant drug profile. Saliva sampling is far more acceptable for paediatric patients. In addition, this trial adheres to standard dosing strategies. No additional venepunctures are performed, and no additional prednisolone doses are administered. Guidelines for paediatric bioequivalence trials are warranted.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1157R5if]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113Pu83V]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — definitions and dose thresholds — are specified as follows: physiologic daily dose equivalent is defined as daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production with 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, and 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone, and endogenous cortisol production is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration, while long-term glucocorticoid therapy is glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Exposure thresholds considered to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency include duration of glucocorticoid therapy 3–4 weeks, or greater, and any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalence of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably, and doses vary by agent and are defined as physiologic within lower and upper ranges to reflect inter-individual differences.

### Dexamethasone for acute asthma exacerbations in children: a meta-analysis [^114L3YfA]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Dexamethasone has been proposed as an equivalent therapy to prednisone/prednisolone for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. Although multiple small trials exist, clear consensus data are lacking. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether intramuscular or oral dexamethasone is equivalent or superior to a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone. The primary outcome of interest was return visits or hospital readmissions.

Methods

A search of PubMed (Medline) through October 19, 2013, by using the keywords dexamethasone or decadron and asthma or status asthmaticus identified potential studies. Six randomized controlled trials in the emergency department of children ≤ 18 years of age comparing dexamethasone with prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations were included. Data were abstracted by 4 authors and verified by a second author. Two reviewers evaluated study quality independently and interrater agreement was assessed.

Results

There was no difference in relative risk (RR) of relapse between the 2 groups at any time point (5 days RR 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–1.78, Q = 1.86, df = 3, I2 = 0.0%, 10–14 days RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.77–1.67, Q = 0.84, df = 2, I2 = 0.0%, or 30 days RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.03–56.93). Patients who received dexamethasone were less likely to experience vomiting in either the emergency department (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12–0.69, Q = 3.78, df = 3, I2 = 20.7%) or at home (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14–0.74, Q = 2.09, df = 2, I2 = 4.2%).

Conclusions

Practitioners should consider single or 2-dose regimens of dexamethasone as a viable alternative to a 5-day course of prednisone/prednisolone.

### Short-duration prednisolone in children with nephrotic syndrome relapse: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^117FNiRh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In children with nephrotic syndrome, steroids are the cornerstone of therapy for relapse. The adequate duration and dosage of steroids, however, have not been an active area of research, especially in children with infrequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. This study investigated the efficacy of an abbreviated regimen for treatment of a relapse in this population.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of prednisolone as a "short regimen" (40 mg/m 2 on alternate days for 2 weeks) compared with "standard regimen" (40 mg/m 2 on alternate days for 4 weeks) for children aged 1–16 years who achieved remission of a relapse. The primary outcome was the proportion of children developing frequent relapses or steroid dependence at 12 months.

Results

A total of 117 patients were enrolled and randomized to short (55) or standard (62) regimen. Fourteen (24%) patients in standard regimen and 12 (23%) in short regimen developed frequent relapses or steroid dependence over a period of 1 year (risk difference, -1%; 95% confidence interval, -15 to 16; P = 0.90). A large 95% confidence interval crossed the proposed noninferiority margin. In a time to event analysis, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children developing frequent relapses or steroid dependence and time to outcome between the two groups (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.23; P = 0.98). Time to relapse, relapse rate, and steroid-related adverse events were similar in both groups. Cumulative steroid exposure was significantly lower in the short regimen (risk difference, -541 mg/m 2; 95% confidence interval, -917 to -164 mg/m 2; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In children with infrequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome, a short steroid treatment for relapse resulted in a similar proportion of patients developing frequent relapses or steroid dependence; however, noninferiority of a short regimen was not established.

### Oral prednisolone in preschool children with virus-associated wheeze: a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112gWXoX]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Children of preschool age often have episodes of virus-associated wheeze, and research assessing efficacy of corticosteroids for paediatric wheeze exacerbations is inconclusive.

Methods

This non-inferiority, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to compare the efficacy of placebo versus oral prednisolone in children aged 24–72 months presenting with virus-associated wheeze at the paediatric emergency department of Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth, WA, Australia. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated random number program to receive placebo or prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day) for 3 days. The primary outcome was total length of stay in hospital until ready for discharge. Following an analysis to test the hypothesis that placebo is non-inferior to prednisolone, a post-hoc superiority analysis was done to test the hypothesis that prednisolone was superior to placebo. A non-inferiority margin of 10% was used to establish non-inferiority. Efficacy analyses were on a modified intention-to-treat basis, whereby patients were excluded from the final efficacy analysis if consent was withdrawn, two doses of study drug were vomited, or paperwork was lost. All participants were included in safety analyses. This study is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12612000394842.

Findings

Between June 11, 2012, and June 10, 2015, we screened 3727 patients for eligibility. 624 eligible patients were randomly assigned to treatment, and 605 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (300 patients from the placebo group, 305 patients from the prednisolone group). The median length of stay until ready for discharge was longer in the placebo group (540 min [IQR 124–971]) than in the prednisolone group (370 min [121–709]); placebo was inferior to prednisolone. In the post-hoc superiority analysis of 605 patients, the unadjusted ratio of geometric mean for length of stay was 0·79 (95% CI 0·64–0·97; p = 0·0227) for the prednisolone group relative to the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported during the study or follow-up period. One child in the placebo group had a non-specific maculopapular rash, which resolved spontaneously. Two children (one from each group) were reported to be hyperactive during follow-up assessments.

Interpretation

Oral prednisolone had a clear benefit over placebo at reducing the length of stay in children presenting to a paediatric emergency department with virus-associated wheeze and was well tolerated.

### A multicenter randomized trial indicates initial prednisolone treatment for childhood nephrotic syndrome for two months is not inferior to six-month treatment [^112mHCnS]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

No significant difference in adverse events was observed between the two regimens in our large-scale trial, which is a similar finding to previous small-scale trials. Most adverse events were transient and occurred during initial or relapse therapy. However, because the ISKDC regimen is generally less likely to cause adverse events owing to the lower dosage and the shorter duration, its use can be recommended.

A limitation of our trial is the open-label design, which may have introduced preconception bias. However, as our trial design is a noninferiority trial with regular visits, and relapses are measured objectively, we cannot assume positive placebo effects. Therefore, the open-label design of this study may have limited impact on preconception bias. Moreover, the results of this trial may partially be due to the relatively high rate of relapse compared with other studies. The high rate of relapse may be owing to our definition of relapse (proteinuria 2+ or higher). It still remains unknown whether long prednisolone therapy consisting of a dose of 60 mg/m 2 per day for 6 weeks, followed by alternate-day doses of 40 mg/m 2 per 2 days for 6 weeks, is more effective against time to FRNS compared with the ISKDC regimen for treating idiopathic NS. In our study, only one patient withdrew consent. A low rate of consent withdrawal is common in Japan. Cultural differences between countries may account for variations in rates of consent withdrawal.

### COVID-19 and corticosteroids: unfamiliar but potentially fatal infections that can arise following short-course steroid treatment [^116yq7bn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone, have powerful inhibitory effects on the immune system. Patients with COVID-19 may develop severe inflammatory-mediated disease with acute lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. Corticosteroids may improve outcomes in seriously ill COVID-19 patients by attenuating this inappropriate host immune response. –

Lower 28-day mortality was demonstrated in the large prospective, open-label controlled RECOVERY trial involving 6,425 participants admitted with COVID-19 in those randomized to 6 mg dexamethasone intravenously or orally once daily for up to 10 days than usual care. In those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality among those treated with dexamethasone was one-third that in those receiving usual care and in those receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation mortality was reduced by one-fifth. Benefit was also seen in those treated more than 7 days after symptom onset with inflammatory lung damage, but not for those without respiratory support requirement at randomization, suggesting the timing of this intervention within the course of illness may be important. On this basis, the use of corticosteroids, which are relatively inexpensive and readily available medications, has increased worldwide for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease, as recommended by several health authorities such as the WHO, the NIH, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Similarly, evolving observational data also suggest that corticosteroids may be helpful in the management of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome, an uncommon but very serious complication of COVID-19 in children.

Results: A total of 1374 visits of 95 children were included, spanning a median duration of 29 months (IQR: 14–56). While glucocorticoid tapering was observed in 341 (24.8) visits, 112 (8.2%) visits were followed by subsequent flares. The flare rate was similar in visits with tapering compared to those without glucocorticoid tapering (7.0% vs. 8,5%, p: 0.43). Higher than 5 mg/day prednisolone equivalent doses of glucocorticoids decreased the odds of subsequent flares (OR: 0.11; p: 0.001), but neither tapering nor tapering towards a lower than 5 mg/day prednisolone dose increased the odds for flare (p > 0.05).

Conclusion: A significant number of flares does not occur upon glucocorticoid tapering, and tapering of glucocorticoid treatment might not be the main driver behind flares. Our results needs to be validated with large-scale multinational studies, including children treated with newer therapies to uncover the associations behind flares and to improve the glucocorticoid tapering practices.

Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) — frequently relapsing (FR) and steroid-dependent (SD) corticosteroid regimens: We suggest that relapses in children with FR and SD SSNS be treated with daily prednisolone until the child has been in remission for at least 3 days, followed by alternate-day prednisolone for at least 3 months. We suggest that prednisone be given on alternate days in the lowest dose to maintain remission without major adverse effects in children with FR and SD SSNS. We suggest that daily prednisolone at the lowest dose be given to maintain remission without major adverse effects in children with SD SSNS where alternate-day prednisone therapy is not effective. We suggest that daily prednisolone be given during episodes of upper respiratory tract and other infections to reduce the risk for relapse in children with FR and SD SSNS already on alternate-day prednisolone.

### Extending prednisolone treatment does not reduce relapses in childhood nephrotic syndrome [^115sopUr]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Prolonged prednisolone treatment for the initial episode of childhood nephrotic syndrome may reduce relapse rate, but whether this results from the increased duration of treatment or a higher cumulative dose remains unclear. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 69 hospitals in The Netherlands. We randomly assigned 150 children (9 months to 17 years) presenting with nephrotic syndrome to either 3 months of prednisolone followed by 3 months of placebo (n = 74) or 6 months of prednisolone (n = 76), and median follow-up was 47 months. Both groups received equal cumulative doses of prednisolone (approximately 3360 mg/m(2)). Among the 126 children who started trial medication, relapses occurred in 48 (77%) of 62 patients who received 3 months of prednisolone and 51 (80%) of 64 patients who received 6 months of prednisolone. Frequent relapses, according to international criteria, occurred with similar frequency between groups as well (45% versus 50%). In addition, there were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to the eventual initiation of prednisolone maintenance and/or other immunosuppressive therapy (50% versus 59%), steroid dependence, or adverse effects. In conclusion, in this trial, extending initial prednisolone treatment from 3 to 6 months without increasing cumulative dose did not benefit clinical outcome in children with nephrotic syndrome. Previous findings indicating that prolonged treatment regimens reduce relapses most likely resulted from increased cumulative dose rather than the treatment duration.

Steroids tapering schedule (doses are in mg/day prednisone equivalent): The goal is to discontinue steroids by Week 7.

Oral corticosteroids represent the second‐line therapy to induce remission in children with extensive mild‐to‐moderate active UC, who fail to respond to oral and/or topical mesalamine. Studies on the natural history of children with active UC receiving an initial course of corticosteroids report short‐term (1–3 months) remission rates of 45%–64%; at 1 year 49%–61% had prolonged response; however, 14%–49% were corticosteroid‐dependent and 4%–33% required surgery. While we recognise the efficacy of corticosteroids, efforts to reduce corticosteroid exposure need to be a priority, as also reflected in the tapering approach in Table 1 and discussed throughout the guidelines.

Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.

Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects:

Pregnancy Category C.

Prednisolone has been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which prednisolone has been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of cleft palate in the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.

Nursing Mothers: Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use: The efficacy and safety of prednisolone in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (> 2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (> 1 month of age). However, some of these conclusions and other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroid, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.

### Dexamethasone compared to prednisone for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations [^114eVmd6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are recommended in clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation based on evidence demonstrating reduced hospitalizations and improved outcomes after administration in the emergency department. Although prednisone and related oral preparations have been recommended previously, researchers have assessed dexamethasone as an alternative based on its longer biologic half-life and improved palatability. Systematic reviews of multiple small trials and 2 larger trials have found no difference in revisits to the emergency department compared to prednisone for dexamethasone given either as an intramuscular injection or orally. Studies of oral administration have found reduced emesis for dexamethasone compared to prednisone both in the emergency department and for a second oral dose, typically given 24 to 48 hours later. Studies assessing a single dose of dexamethasone have found equivalent improvement at follow-up but with some evidence of increased symptoms and increased need for additional corticosteroids compared to multiple doses of prednisone. Future research could further assess dexamethasone dose, formulation, and frequency and measure other related adverse effects such as behavior change. Consideration of baseline differences within the heterogeneous population of children requiring acute care for asthma may also guide the design of an optimal dexamethasone regimen.

Definitions

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency, is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — 3–4 weeks, or greater
Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

Physiologic daily dose equivalent: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above)
Short-term glucocorticoid therapy: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration
Long-term glucocorticoid therapy: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)
Glucocorticoid taper: Taper of glucocorticoid therapy dose, initially guided by the management of the underlying disease (= therapeutic taper), and later by the management of glucocorticoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency (= endocrine taper)
Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome: Symptoms experienced when lowering glucocorticoid dose within the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dose range, that are not due to the underlying disease for which the glucocorticoids were initially prescribed for and per definition not due to untreated adrenal insufficiency, as the total glucocorticoid daily dose is still supraphysiologic

Glucocorticoid doses vary based on glucocorticoid agent and are defined as physiologic within the lower and upper ranges to illustrate the inter-individual differences. In the recommendations, prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably.

GC-associated AEs can occur across multiple organ systems, as shown in Fig. 1. GC use contributes to organ damage accrual, quantified by the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI), in patients with SLE, independent of disease activity. The association between GC dosages ≥ 7.5 mg/day and organ damage has been demonstrated in multiple studies and is acknowledged in treatment guidelines. However, even dosages of ≥ 5–7.5 mg/day, as recommended for maintenance across treatment guidelines, are linked to AEs and long-term toxicity in patients with SLE. Use of low-to-moderate GC dosages (≤ 30 mg/day prednisolone equivalent) is associated with osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma, skin thinning, cardiovascular damage, weight gain and infections, whereas higher dosages are additionally associated with myopathy, psychological and behavioural disturbances, and osteonecrosis. Over long periods, cumulative GC exposure is associated with severe organ damage, including osteoporotic fractures, avascular necrosis, cataracts, coronary heart disease and diabetes. Adults with SLE have a 2- to 6-fold increase in relative risk of infection events compared with the general population, which is higher among those who have initiated GCs; this highlights the need to monitor patients with SLE for risk of GC-related infections. GCs have also been shown to have AEs in children with SLE, including growth impairment, and during pregnancy. Treatment guidelines note that GC use in the first trimester is associated with a moderately increased risk of cleft palate. Furthermore, GC use is associated with potential risks of maternal complications, including hypertension, diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth and premature rupture of membranes, particularly at higher dosages of ≥ 10–20 mg/day.

### Emergency management of adrenal insufficiency in children: advocating for treatment options in outpatient and field settings [^111kk5Cg]. Journal of Investigative Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Long-acting glucocorticoids and alternative steroids — use in children is addressed as follows: long-acting agents "are not recommended for maintenance glucocorticoid therapy in growing children", and their use for initial adrenal crisis will "prevent" an ACTH stimulation test during initial hospitalization. For growth suppression potency, "Prednisolone and dexamethasone are 15-fold and 80–100-fold more potent, respectively, than hydrocortisone". In EMS settings, "dexamethasone sodium phosphate (1.5–2 mg/10 kg/dose) has been available… and used in secondary AI", but "it is not suitable for treatment of salt-wasting adrenal crisis in primary AI because it has no mineralocorticoid effect".

Saliva samples

The primary and secondary outcomes are assessed at predefined time points shown in table 3 and figure 1. Patients are randomised to one of two sampling groups, A and B, figure 1. Sampling times are calculated on the basis of a previous study. Each child will follow the same time schedule for both doses. The samples will be collected using the SalivaBio Children's Swab and the SalivaBio Oral Swab (exclusively from Salimetrics, State College, Pennsylvania, USA), synthetic swabs specifically designed to improve volume collection and increase participant compliance. Saliva will be removed from the swabs by centrifuge (15 min at 2500 rpm) and stored in cryovials at −20 ᵒC for maximum 2 weeks and hereafter at −80°C until analysis. Concentrations of prednisolone and its inactive metabolite prednisone will be determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The assay is validated according to the EMA guideline 'Guideline on bioanalytical method validation' (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use). Analyses are performed in accordance with ISO 15189. Concentrations will be determined in 10 µL saliva or plasma. In the latter case, both total and unbound concentrations will be determined. The lower limit of quantification is 2 ng/mL for both compounds. Saliva samples are non-invasive samples and are considered a painless low-risk procedure. Saliva sampling of prednisolone and subsequent analysis has recently been performed in children with median 4.6 years of age using Salivette equipment. As this trial includes children from 6 months of age, we chose the Salimetrics equipment. If any child has a cubital intravenous access at inclusion, additional blood samples will be taken time equivalent to the saliva samples. In order to assess plasma prednisolone for validation of the saliva samples. No additional venepunctures will be made.

Table 3
The table illustrates the different trial activities.

Sample size

The number of subjects required for a BE study depends on the expected deviation between formulations. Because of limited data on prednisolone PKs and BE of different formulations, sample size calculation is not feasible. In accordance with the EMA guideline on the investigation of BE, the number of subjects to be included in a study should preferably be based on sample size calculations and not be less than 12. To account for drop-outs, 14 patients were allocated to each formulation in the three different age groups and the control group (a total of 77 patients) (figure 1). The optimal number of participants is 66 evaluable patients.

### Novel insights into glucocorticoid replacement therapy for pediatric and adult adrenal insufficiency [^112BFpGx]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical relevance

Prednisolone is the therapy of choice, especially in patients who are unable to tolerate multiple-dose regimens (e.g. lack of compliance, daily fatigue, sleep disorders). Moreover, its longer half-life allows a once-daily administration in cases where lower replacement doses are required (primary and central insufficiency). Williams and colleagueshave recently examined the prednisolone pharmacokinetic profile through ultraperformance liquid chromatography in healthy subjects and patients with AI. A single mean dose of 3.86 mg did not only attain adequate replacement but it also mimicked physiological cortisol profile. Dose fractioning extended the total glucocorticoid exposure through increasing the total (0–24 h) AUC.

In CAH, evening prednisolone administration more easily achieves androgen target levels with a better suppression of the morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone surge. However, Ajish and colleaguesdid not demonstrate significant improvements when compared with the equivalent HC dose. Cadalto and colleaguescompared the benefits of a once-daily morning dose of prednisolone in CAH with conventional HC replacement in patients aged from 1 to 21 years. At 1 year of follow up better improvements were shown in suppression of steroid levels and in control of skeletal maturation advancement. On the other hand, a similar studyperformed on 15 pediatric patients showed no difference between prednisolone and HC; the efficacy between the two regimens being comparable.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^115okSPN]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

The results of this study are important because there has been minimal previous success in identifying parent initiated strategies that may reduce the burden of acute asthma in children. One of the approaches that has been evaluated is administration of a short course of inhaled corticosteroids. Although there is some evidence that high dose inhaled corticosteroids may be effective in the treatment of acute asthma in the hospital settingand may also be associated with modest benefit in the ambulatory setting, high dose inhaled corticosteroids are not as effective as oral corticosteroids.

A second approach is the use of formulations containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting β agonist. Among children with uncontrolled asthma, the use of inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist as both maintenance and reliever medication may reduce asthma related health resource use compared with fixed dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist as maintenance treatment only. However, fewer than 15% of children who present to an emergency department with an episode of acute asthma have a background of uncontrolled asthma; therefore, maintenance and reliever treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and a long acting β agonist is not appropriate for the great majority of children likely to use health resources to relieve acute asthma.

### Short-and long-term efficacy of prednisolone for first acute rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode [^112wpAkU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinovirus-induced wheezing is an important risk factor for recurrent wheezing. There are no randomized controlled trials on the effect of systemic corticosteroids in patients with this disease.

Objective

We sought to study the short- and long-term effects of prednisolone treatment of the first acute, moderate-to-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode in young children.

Methods

After confirming rhinovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate by using PCR, 79 children with a first wheezing episode at age 3 to 23 months were randomized to receive oral prednisolone (first dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by 2 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses for 3 days) or placebo. The trial was double blind throughout the 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were long term: new physician-confirmed wheezing episode within 2 months, number of physician-confirmed wheezing episodes within 12 months, and initiation of regular controller medication for asthma symptoms within 12 months. The primary interaction analysis examined rhinovirus load.

Results

Seventy-four patients completed the study (mean age, 13 months; 28% atopic). Long-term outcomes did not differ between groups (all P ≥ .30). For short-term outcomes, the prednisolone group had less cough, rhinitis, noisy breathing, severe breathing difficulties, and nocturnal respiratory symptoms at home within 2 weeks (all P < .05). The 25 children with greater than 7000 rhinovirus copies/mL (most sensitive cutoff) benefitted from prednisolone in terms of less risk of physician-confirmed recurrence within 2 and 12 months compared with placebo (both P < .05).

Conclusions

Prednisolone cannot be routinely recommended for all young children experiencing their first acute, moderate-to-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode. Prednisolone might be beneficial in a subgroup of children with high viral loads.

GC use in special populations: patients with childhood-onset SLE, LN and CLE

In addition to the adult treatment recommendations reviewed in Tables 1–3, guidance was also reviewed from the Single Hub and Access Point for Paediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) initiative. Short-term GC use in childhood-onset SLE, LN and CLE is supported by current treatment recommendations. Recommendations across manifestations suggest adding disease-modifying drugs to permit GC tapering in children with lupus. Moreover, recommendations from the SHARE initiative state that prepubertal and peripubertal patients with SLE receiving a high cumulative dose of GCs must be proactively assessed for growth impairment.

Guidance from KDIGO states that when devising a therapy plan for children with LN, considerations must be made regarding dosage adjustment, growth, fertility and psychosocial factors. Specific guidance for appropriate GC dosages in childhood-onset LN is provided in Latin American guidelines, which advise against prolonged GC exposure and recommend that induction with high-dosage GCs (prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day, maximum 60 mg/day) combined with another immunosuppressive agent is preferable to using high-dosage GCs alone; GCs are not recommended for maintenance therapy. Brazilian guidelines recommend i.v. MP 10–30 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by prednisone 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/day for 3–4 weeks, with progressive reduction, aiming to achieve dosages of 5–10 mg/day after 6 months. With accumulating data on the efficacy and GC-sparing role of immunosuppressive medications, there is a shift toward reducing GC exposure in paediatric patients with lupus.

Children with MPGN — A trial of steroids in children with MPGN and nephrotic syndrome (NS) and/or impaired renal function may be warranted as first-line treatment; in one randomized controlled trial, 80 children with all types of MPGN and heavy proteinuria were randomized to receive either 40 mg/m2 of prednisone on alternate days or placebo for a mean duration of 41 months, and renal survival at 130 months was 61% among patients receiving prednisone and 12% among placebo-treated patients (P = 0.07); a reasonable approach is a trial of alternate-day steroids (ie, 40 mg/m2) for a period of 6 to 12 months (and possibly longer) if there is a clear clinical response, and if no significant reduction of proteinuria is observed, steroids should be tapered and discontinued.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112De2xh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Medium credibility.

Childhood CAH — glucocorticoid selection, potency, and dose effects: During childhood, the preferred GC is HC because its short half-life minimizes the adverse side effects typical of longer-acting, more potent GCs, especially growth suppression. In one trial, the estimated growth-suppressive effect of prednisone was ~15-fold more potent than that of HC; Dex may be up to 70- to 80-fold more potent than HC. Insufficient data exist to recommend fractional distribution of doses throughout the day or empiric dosing in the very early morning hours, and good control can be achieved by orally administering crushed, weighed HC tablets mixed with a small volume of liquid. When doses exceed 20 mg/m2 per day in infants or 15 to 17 mg/m2 per day in adolescents, there is a decrease in height standard deviation score, and patients treated with < 20 mg of HC/m2 per day at the start of puberty are significantly taller than those given higher HC doses. Although prednisone and Dex treatments are effective in suppressing adrenal androgens in children with CAH, these more potent drugs are more likely than HC to impede statural growth and cannot be routinely recommended.

### Randomized trial of single-dose intramuscular dexamethasone compared with prednisolone for children with acute asthma [^111goPHF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy of single-dose intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone phosphate to a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate asthma exacerbations in young children discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized trial in children aged 18 months to less than 7 years with asthma who presented to the ED with a clinical asthma score of 3 to 7 on a 9-point scale. Children were randomized to 1 dose of IM dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum 15 mg) or oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg) once daily for 5 days. The primary outcome, measured only for patients discharged from the ED, was change in asthma score from ED presentation to 4-day follow-up examination, as assessed by a physician masked to group assignment. We assessed secondary clinical course outcomes by a structured interview at 4 and 14 days.

Results

Eighty-eight patients were appropriately randomized to dexamethasone and 93 to prednisolone. Group characteristics were similar at baseline. Among those discharged from the ED, 62 (90%) of 69 and 64 (90%) of 74 patients in the dexamethasone and prednisolone groups, respectively, were reassessed at 4 days for the primary outcome. The mean change in total asthma score at 4-day follow-up was 3.6 in the dexamethasone group and 3.4 in the prednisolone group (difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, -0.4 to 0.7). Of patients initially discharged, 5.9% of dexamethasone patients and 4.1% of prednisolone patients were admitted before the 2-week follow-up (difference, 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, -5.4% to 9.0%).

Conclusions

A single dose of IM dexamethasone showed no clinically meaningful difference in outcomes compared with a 5-day course of oral prednisolone for the treatment of moderate acute asthma exacerbations in young children who are discharged from the ED.

### Doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: randomised controlled trial [^111dqCZv]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Asthma self-management plans that include doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when the condition deteriorates improve asthma control. Whether doubling the dose of corticosteroid in isolation is effective is unknown. We undertook a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteriods when asthma deteriorates.

Methods

390 individuals with asthma who were at risk of an exacerbation monitored their morning peak flow and asthma symptoms for up to 12 months. When peak flow or symptoms started to deteriorate, participants added an active or placebo corticosteroid inhaler to their usual corticosteroid for 14 days to produce a doubling or no change in dose. The primary outcome was the number of individuals starting oral prednisolone in each group.

Findings

During 12 months, 207 (53%) started their study inhaler and 46 (12%) started prednisolone — 22 (11%) of 192 and 24 (12%) of 198 in the active and placebo groups, respectively. The risk ratio for starting prednisolone was therefore 0.95 (95% CI 0.55–1.64, p = 0.8).

Interpretation

We recorded little evidence to support the widely recommended intervention of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control starts to deteriorate.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^111Z2hjj]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute asthma is one of the leading causes of emergency department presentation and hospital admission worldwide. Strategies to reduce the burden of symptoms related to acute asthma and cut health resource use are clearly needed. There is high level evidence that oral corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of acute asthma in children of school age when administered after the child has been assessed by a doctor.

Many of the benefits of oral corticosteroids have been shown to begin within three hours of administration, and delayed dosing is less effective at resolving acute asthma. Incorporating parent initiation of oral corticosteroids into the education and action plans for acute asthma that doctors provide families may be an effective way to ensure oral corticosteroid therapy is initiated promptly when a child suffers an episode of acute asthma. However, a strategy of parent initiated oral corticosteroids is likely to result in higher levels of administration of corticosteroids to children with asthma. This issue is of concern because in addition to their immediate effects on behaviourand adrenal function, oral corticosteroids are linked with reduced adult height in children with asthma. For example, as few as five short courses of oral corticosteroids over a seven year period during childhood has been associated with diminished bone mineral accrual. Therefore, the potential benefits of parent initiated oral corticosteroids require careful evaluation.

Parent initiated treatment with oral corticosteroids seems to be ineffective among preschool children with so called "viral induced wheeze", and the European Respiratory Society recently advised against parent initiated oral corticosteroids in children of preschool age with recurrent wheeze. Existing evidence regarding parent initiated oral corticosteroids in school age children with asthma is inadequate, and the role of parent initiation of oral corticosteroids is not clarified in international asthma management guidelines. None the less, parent initiated oral corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice.

We undertook a double blind, randomised, crossover trial to determine the effectiveness of parent initiated oral prednisolone compared with placebo in children of primary school age who experience recurrent episodes of acute asthma.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution) [^116MfdKQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The adverse effects of prednisolone in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Children who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in children than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of children treated with corticosteroids by any route should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of other treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, children should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.

Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience with prednisolone sodium phosphate has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the incidence of corticosteroid-induced side effects may be increased in geriatric patients and appear to be dose-related.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112iUoH9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric primary adrenal insufficiency — glucocorticoid therapy and monitoring — In children with PAI, we suggest avoiding synthetic, long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, prednisolone, dexamethasone), and we suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replacement by clinical assessment, including growth velocity, body weight, blood pressure, and energy levels; the daily hydrocortisone dose is usually divided into two or preferably three doses, with a typical daily dose of about 8 mg/m2, and growth suppression is possible because dosages above 8 mg/m2/d may exceed the physiological range; in patients with CAH, glucocorticoid dosages exceeding 20 mg/m2/d in infants and 15 to 17 mg/m2/d in adolescents have been shown to result in loss of height and shorter adult stature; excessive weight gain with decreased height velocity or other symptoms or signs of Cushing syndrome indicate excessive glucocorticoid replacement, plasma ACTH is typically above the normal range and is not useful for routine monitoring, and inadequate weight gain, fatigue, anorexia, and hyperpigmentation suggest the need for increased medication dose.

### Evaluation of daily low-dose prednisolone during upper respiratory tract infection to prevent relapse in children with relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome: the PREDNOS 2 randomized clinical trial [^112JdYdJ]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

In children with corticosteroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, many relapses are triggered by upper respiratory tract infections. Four small studies found that administration of daily low-dose prednisolone for 5 to 7 days at the time of an upper respiratory tract infection reduced the risk of relapse, but the generalizability of their findings is limited by location of the studies and selection of study population.

Objective

To investigate the use of daily low-dose prednisolone for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection-related relapses.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (Prednisolone in Nephrotic Syndrome [PREDNOS] 2) evaluated 365 children with relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome with and without background immunosuppressive treatment at 122 pediatric departments in the UK from February 1, 2013, to January 31, 2020. Data from the modified intention-to-treat population were analyzed from July 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.

Interventions

At the start of an upper respiratory tract infection, children received 6 days of prednisolone, 15 mg/m2 daily, or matching placebo preparation. Those already taking alternate-day prednisolone rounded their daily dose using trial medication to the equivalent of 15 mg/m2 daily or their alternate-day dose, whichever was greater.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of first upper respiratory tract infection-related relapse. Secondary outcomes included overall rate of relapse, changes in background immunosuppressive treatment, cumulative dose of prednisolone, rates of serious adverse events, incidence of corticosteroid adverse effects, and quality of life.

Results

The modified intention-to-treat analysis population comprised 271 children (mean [SD] age, 7.6[3.5] years; 174 [64.2%] male), with 134 in the prednisolone arm and 137 in the placebo arm. The number of patients experiencing an upper respiratory tract infection-related relapse was 56 of 131 (42.7%) in the prednisolone arm and 58 of 131 (44.3%) in the placebo arm (adjusted risk difference, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.10; p = 0.70). No evidence was found that the treatment effect differed according to background immunosuppressive treatment. No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes between the treatment arms. A post hoc subgroup analysis assessing the primary outcome in 54 children of South Asian ethnicity (risk ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.40–1.10) vs 208 children of other ethnicity (risk ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.81–1.54) found no difference in efficacy of intervention in those of South Asian ethnicity (test for interaction P = 0.09).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of PREDNOS 2 suggest that administering 6 days of daily low-dose prednisolone at the time of an upper respiratory tract infection does not reduce the risk of relapse of nephrotic syndrome in children in the UK. Further work is needed to investigate interethnic differences in treatment response.

### Expert recommendations and clinical considerations in the use of onasemnogene abeparvovec gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy [^112Ufgav]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: Treating physicians should counsel families on the importance of monitoring laboratory results after onasemnogene abeparvovec, and the need for potentially longer steroid dosing schedules in response to abnormal laboratory values.

Recommendation: Given the long duration of steroid treatment that may be required for some patients, consultation with an endocrinologist may be considered when pursuing treatment, given the risk of adrenal insufficiency. This is important to ensure adrenal function is normal in treated patients, especially in context of a respiratory infection or other physiological stress. Examinations in older children may include a morning (8:00 AM) cortisol test and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests to ensure patients have recovered normal adrenal function after steroid exposure. Newborns may require additional testing to detect adrenal insufficiency because of residual adrenal reserve that can respond to synthetic ACTHand lack of normal circadian rhythm in morning cortisol concentration.

Recommendation: For patients receiving prolonged corticosteroids, physicians should consider using injectable stress dosing hydrocortisone if evidence of acute illness presents in the post‐dosage period. Physicians may also consider consultation with an endocrinologist in the context of acute illness of a hospitalized child receiving post‐dose corticosteroids. After prednisolone is stopped, a sick‐day plan for adrenal insufficiency should be provided to families according to institutional guidelines.

### Randomized trial of dexamethasone versus prednisone for children with acute asthma exacerbations [^1152CnrF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether 2 doses of dexamethasone is as effective as 5 days of prednisolone/prednisone therapy in improving symptoms and quality of life of children with asthma exacerbations admitted to the emergency department (ED).

Study Design

We conducted a randomized, noninferiority trial including patients aged 1–14 years who presented to the ED with acute asthma to compare the efficacy of 2 doses of dexamethasone (0.6mg/kg/dose, experimental treatment) vs a 5-day course of prednisolone/prednisone (1.5mg/kg/d, followed by 1mg/kg/d on days 2–5, conventional treatment). Two follow-up telephone interviews were completed at 7 and 15 days. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of patients with asthma symptoms and quality of life at day 7. Secondary outcomes were unscheduled returns, admissions, adherence, and vomiting.

Results

During the study period, 710 children who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate and 590 agreed. Primary outcome data were available in 557 patients. At day 7, experimental and conventional groups did not show differences related to persistence of symptoms (56.6%, 95% CI 50.6–62.6 vs 58.3%, 95% CI 52.3–64.2, respectively), quality of life score (80.0 vs 77.7, not significant [ns]), admission rate (23.9% vs 21.7%, ns), unscheduled ED return visits (4.6% vs 3.3%, ns), and vomiting (2.1% vs 4.4%, ns). Adherence was greater in the dexamethasone group (99.3% vs 96.0%, P < .05).

Conclusion

Two doses of dexamethasone may be an effective alternative to a 5-day course of prednisone/prednisolone for asthma exacerbations, as measured by persistence of symptoms and quality of life at day 7.

### Favorable outcomes with reduced steroid use in juvenile dermatomyositis [^1115dhg3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

During this era of gradual improvement in treatment outcomes, there were no randomized controlled trials or published corticosteroid treatment regimens to guide therapeutic decisions. In fact, only recently has a randomized controlled trial studied superiority of two different immunomodulatory agent in combination with prednisone to prednisone alone; however, this manuscript was published in 2016 many years after practice trends had developed. Generally, different doses, routes, and duration of glucocorticoids were first-line therapy for mild, moderate, and severe JDM in combination with other immunomodulatory agents. However, a number of published reports advocated that initial high-dose, intravenous and/or pulsed intervals of glucocorticoids were needed to aggressively suppress disease activity, sustain remission, and prevent calcinosis, a highly morbid JDM complication. Despite this trend, there remained tremendous variety in practice, with most authors advocating an initial oral prednisone dose of 2 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day), with pulses of high-dose (up to 30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g daily) intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) for moderate to severe cases as induction therapy, followed by a slow taper of oral steroids over 1 year. However, lower to medium doses of prednisone (1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) were also reported effective, particularly after taking into account the disability associated with higher glucocorticoid dosing. Another report showed comparable outcomes using combinations of other immunosuppressive agents with no use of systemic glucocorticoids, albeit in an admittedly mild disease phenotype where the practice was not universal amongst treated patients. Not only have disease outcomes improved with addition of steroid-sparing agents, but it is recognized that aggressively utilizing these agents can reduce the burden of adverse effects of glucocorticoids without sacrificing outcome. Regardless, the most current recommendations continue to endorse high-dose glucocorticoids: Consensus-based treatment plans published by the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) for the initial treatment of moderate to severe JDM recommended 2 mg/kg/day oral prednisone in combination with methotrexate in their most conservative protocol, with the two more aggressive protocols utilizing intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g) for 3 days and continuing with weekly or monthly intravenous methylprednisolone pulses ⁠. Similarly, European recommendations from the Single Hub and Access point for Pediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) recommended high-dose intravenous dosing of methylprednisolone (15–30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g/day) for all patients at diagnosis or with a disease flare, followed by an oral prednisone taper beginning at 1–2 mg/kg/day. To our knowledge, there have been no reports describing outcomes with lower doses of glucocorticoids used consistently in early combination with other immunosuppressive agents as a universal approach in a single referral center.
