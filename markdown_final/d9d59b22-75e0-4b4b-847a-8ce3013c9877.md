## Question

Are copper cups safe

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether unlined copper drinking cups are safe for everyday use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly makes a cup "safe" in this context, including material composition, lining, and exposure conditions. Then, I should verify the baseline copper exposure from a typical diet and how that influences the safety margin. Next, I will review how water chemistry, acidity, temperature, and dwell time affect copper leaching. After that, I should compare likely leaching levels to regulatory limits and evidence on gastrointestinal effects. I also need to consider high-risk populations, such as Wilson disease, infants, and people with cholestasis or hypersensitivity. Finally, I will weigh antimicrobial claims and formulate practical recommendations for different scenarios, while checking whether any guidance specifically addresses unlined copper cups.

> Let me first confirm what "copper cups" means here. Most discussions focus on unlined, solid copper mugs (like Moscow Mule cups) rather than stainless steel mugs with a copper exterior, and safety hinges on whether the inner surface contacting beverages is pure copper, whether there is a food-safe lining, and what liquids are used, since acidic drinks increase copper solubility and duration of contact matters for total exposure.

> I need to establish baseline copper intake and the narrow window between deficiency and excess; the adult RDA is about 0.9 mg/day and median U.S. dietary intake is roughly 1–1.6 mg/day, so routine intake already meets physiologic needs, which means any additional leached copper from an unlined cup could narrow the safety margin, particularly with acidic beverages or prolonged contact time [^111mXwBw].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory frame for copper in drinking water because that sets a practical benchmark for what is considered acceptable. The U.S. EPA's action level for copper in public water systems is 1.3 mg/L, which corresponds to 1.3 mg per liter, and water quality studies document real-world ranges from very low up to over 30 mg/L, underscoring that copper exposure can vary substantially and that home plumbing already contributes copper to many households [^111ffCDb].

> Next, I should review controlled human data on copper in water. A large randomized study showed that copper at 6 mg/L in drinking water significantly increased gastrointestinal symptoms versus less than 0.01 mg/L, while lower concentrations did not produce clear symptom signals, suggesting a threshold effect around that level for acute GI tolerance, though individuals vary and homeostatic handling can blunt biochemical changes even when symptoms appear [^114ScLTw].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific leaching concern with unlined copper cups. The Wilson disease guidance explicitly advises that unlined copper mixing bowls and drinking mugs should be avoided due to copper leaching into foods and beverages, which is the clearest disease-specific directive and reflects that leaching risk is real enough to matter clinically in susceptible individuals, especially with acidic foods or drinks and prolonged contact.

> I will now examine factors that increase leaching so I can be precise. Acidity lowers the pH and increases copper solubility, heat accelerates reaction kinetics, and longer dwell time increases cumulative transfer, so using unlined copper for acidic mixers (lime juice, vinegar-based dressings), hot beverages, or storing liquids for hours is more likely to raise copper concentrations in the drink compared with brief contact with neutral, cold water [^notfound].

> Let me consider the high-risk groups where any additional copper exposure is undesirable. Wilson disease patients should avoid unlined copper cookware and mugs, infants and young children may have immature homeostatic controls and higher susceptibility to excess, individuals with cholestasis or cirrhosis have impaired biliary copper excretion, and people with metal hypersensitivity could have reactions, so for these populations unlined copper cups are particularly inappropriate [^117ALLh5] [^112c7NXa] [^117ALLh5] [^112JN5wC].

> But wait, what about antimicrobial claims? Copper surfaces do exhibit antimicrobial activity in aqueous environments and engineered copper systems can reduce pathogens, yet the EPA drinking water limit exists precisely because ingested copper can be toxic at higher levels, so antimicrobial surface science does not translate into safety for internal exposure from unlined cups used repeatedly with acidic beverages [^11589iMR] [^1158PXLJ] [^111ffCDb].

> I should double-check whether there is any credible evidence linking copper in drinking water to Alzheimer's disease. A hypothesis paper posits that inorganic divalent copper in water may contribute to Alzheimer's risk, but this remains speculative and low-credibility, so I should not overstate it while acknowledging that minimizing avoidable inorganic copper intake is a reasonable, conservative stance pending stronger data [^113f23cJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical risk assessment. For healthy adults, occasional use of unlined copper cups with cold, non-acidic water is likely low risk because homeostatic regulation and brief contact limit additional intake, but regular use with acidic drinks, hot liquids, or prolonged storage increases leaching and could approach or exceed levels associated with GI symptoms in sensitive individuals, so the risk is not zero and grows with exposure intensity and duration [^114ScLTw] [^111ffCDb].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives and mitigation. Lined copper cups with a food-grade stainless steel or nickel lining eliminate direct copper–liquid contact and are the preferred choice, and if unlined cups are used occasionally, limit to cold, non-acidic beverages, avoid prolonged storage, rinse and dry promptly, and avoid mechanical damage that could increase leaching, while Wilson disease patients and those with hepatic copper handling disorders should avoid unlined copper entirely [^116atJJG].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any authoritative body provides a blanket endorsement of unlined copper cups. I do not find high-credibility guidelines endorsing routine use of unlined copper drinking vessels for the general population, and the clearest disease-specific guidance advises avoidance, so any endorsement tends to be anecdotal or marketing-oriented rather than evidence-based [^116atJJG].

> Final answer: Unlined copper drinking cups are not categorically unsafe for occasional use by healthy adults with cold, non-acidic beverages, but they are not the safest choice for routine use because acidity, heat, and dwell time can increase copper leaching into drinks. For people with Wilson disease, infants and young children, those with cholestatic liver disease, or anyone with metal hypersensitivity, unlined copper cups should be avoided, and lined copper or non-copper vessels are preferable for everyday use [^114ScLTw] [^116atJJG] [^112c7NXa] [^117ALLh5].

Copper cups are **generally safe for healthy adults** when used occasionally with cold, non-acidic beverages, as copper is an essential nutrient and typical dietary intake is within safe limits [^113aiHJJ] [^111mXwBw]. However, **prolonged or frequent use with acidic drinks** (e.g. citrus, vinegar, carbonated beverages) can increase copper leaching and may cause gastrointestinal upset or, rarely, copper toxicity [^114ScLTw] [^116kYxYx]. People with Wilson disease, copper sensitivity, or liver disease should avoid unlined copper cups [^116atJJG]. To minimize risk, use lined cups, avoid acidic or hot liquids, and wash thoroughly after each use.

## Health risks associated with copper cups

### Copper toxicity

- **Acute toxicity**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and metallic taste [^116kYxYx].
- **Chronic toxicity**: Liver damage, kidney dysfunction, and neurological effects [^117ALLh5].
- **Fatal cases**: Rare but reported, especially with high exposure or pre-existing liver disease [^112TCiTw].

---

### Factors influencing copper leaching

- **Acidity**: Acidic beverages (e.g. citrus, vinegar, carbonated drinks) increase copper leaching.
- **Temperature**: Hot liquids accelerate copper release.
- **Duration**: Prolonged contact increases copper concentration in beverages.

---

### Populations at increased risk

Certain populations are at **increased risk** of copper toxicity from copper cups:

| **Population** | **Reason for increased risk** |
|-|-|
| Wilson disease | Impaired copper metabolism [^112Bnqzp] |
| Liver disease | Reduced copper excretion [^117ALLh5] |
| Infants and young children | Developing homeostatic mechanisms [^112c7NXa] |
| Individuals with copper hypersensitivity | Allergic reactions [^112JN5wC] |

---

## Regulatory guidelines and safety standards

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a **maximum contaminant level (MCL)** of 1.3 mg/L for copper in drinking water [^111ffCDb]. Copper cups are not specifically regulated, but this MCL serves as a useful reference for safe copper exposure levels.

---

## Scientific studies on copper cup safety

Limited studies specifically address copper cup safety; however, related research provides insights:

- **Copper leaching**: Studies show copper leaching into beverages, especially with acidic or hot liquids.
- **Antimicrobial properties**: Copper surfaces exhibit antimicrobial activity, but this does not negate potential toxicity risks [^11589iMR] [^1158PXLJ].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Controlled exposure studies report gastrointestinal symptoms at higher copper concentrations [^114ScLTw].

---

## Precautionary measures for safe use

To minimize health risks associated with copper cups, consider the following **precautionary measures**:

- **Use lined cups**: Prefer cups with stainless steel or nickel linings to prevent direct copper contact.
- **Avoid acidic beverages**: Do not use copper cups for citrus juices, vinegar-based drinks, or carbonated beverages.
- **Limit exposure**: Use copper cups occasionally rather than daily.
- **Proper cleaning**: Wash thoroughly after each use to prevent copper oxide buildup.
- **Monitor symptoms**: Discontinue use if gastrointestinal symptoms or allergic reactions occur.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Copper cups are **generally safe for occasional use** with cold, non-acidic beverages in healthy adults. However, prolonged or frequent use — especially with acidic or hot liquids — increases copper leaching and the risk of gastrointestinal upset or, rarely, copper toxicity. Individuals with Wilson disease, liver disease, or copper hypersensitivity should avoid unlined copper cups. Use lined cups, avoid acidic or hot liquids, and clean thoroughly after each use to minimize risks.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Do not use unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact.

Administration of zinc in the absence of copper may cause a decrease in serum copper levels.

Cupric chloride injection should only be used in conjunction with a pharmacy directed admixture program using aseptic technique in a laminar flow environment; it should be used promptly and in a single operation without any repeated penetrations. Solution contains no preservatives; discard unused portion immediately after admixture procedure is completed.

It is not recommended to administer copper to a patient with Wilson's Disease, a genetic disease of copper metabolism.

Drug Interactions

Cupric ion may degrade ascorbic acid in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. In order to avoid this loss of ascorbate, multivitamin additives should be added to TPN solutions immediately prior to infusion. Alternatively, the multivitamin additive may be added to one container of TPN solution, followed by copper in a subsequent container.

Laboratory Tests

Twice monthly serum assays for copper and/or ceruloplasmin are suggested for monitoring copper concentrations in long-term TPN patients. As ceruloplasmin is a cuproenzyme, ceruloplasmin assays may be depressed secondary to copper deficiency.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility

Long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of cupric chloride injection have not been performed, nor have studies been done to assess mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when cupric chloride injection is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Section.) There are limited data in infants weighing less than 1500 grams.

Pregnancy

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cupric chloride. It is also not known whether cupric chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Cupric chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly indicated.

Geriatric Use

An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^117HVgUa]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Is copper deficiency common?

Plasma copper levels appear to be an inaccurate measure of copper status since ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant that rises in illness and because plasma copper levels differ little between marginally copper-deficient and copper-sufficient subjects. Leucocyte copper may be the best measure of copper status, although this test is not commonly performed.

The RDA for copper is 0.9 mg/day for adults for both men and women. The tolerable upper intake level is much higher, at 10 mg/day for adults. In the 1980s, before a RDA was set, the suggested adequate intake range of copper was 2 to 3 mg/day, but was subsequently lowered when it appeared that few people reach this range without copper supplements. It appears that the decrease in recommended copper intake was largely based on only one study of 11 healthy men. Copper requirements may, however, vary widely depending on health status, pregnancy, age, sex and other factors. Some studies show a minimum requirement at 1.3 mg/d.

### Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nACda]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Girls and women need effective, safe, and affordable menstrual products. Single-use products are regularly selected by agencies for resource-poor settings; the menstrual cup is a less known alternative. We reviewed international studies on menstrual cup leakage, acceptability, and safety and explored menstrual cup availability to inform programmes.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Popline, Cinahl, Global Health database, Emerald, Google Scholar, Science.gov, and WorldWideScience from database inception to May 14, 2019, for quantitative or qualitative studies published in English on experiences and leakage associated with menstrual cups, and adverse event reports. We also screened the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from the US Food and Drug Administration for events related to menstrual cups. To be eligible for inclusion, the material needed to have information on leakage, acceptability, or safety of menstrual cups. The main outcome of interest was menstrual blood leakage when using a menstrual cup. Safety outcomes of interest included serious adverse events; vaginal abrasions and effects on vaginal microflora; effects on the reproductive, digestive, or urinary tract; and safety in poor sanitary conditions. Findings were tabulated or combined by use of forest plots (random-effects meta-analysis). We also did preliminary estimates on costs and environmental savings potentially associated with cups. This systematic review is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42016047845.

Findings

Of 436 records identified, 43 studies were eligible for analysis (3319 participants). Most studies reported on vaginal cups (27 [63%] vaginal cups, five [12%] cervical cups, and 11 [25%] mixed types of cups or unknown) and 15 were from low-income and middle-income countries. 22 studies were included in qualitative or quantitative syntheses, of which only three were of moderate-to-high quality. Four studies made a direct comparison between menstrual cups and usual products for the main outcome of leakage and reported leakage was similar or lower for menstrual cups than for disposable pads or tampons (n = 293). In all qualitative studies, the adoption of the menstrual cup required a familiarisation phase over several menstrual cycles and peer support improved uptake (two studies in developing countries). In 13 studies, 73% (pooled estimate: n = 1144; 95% CI 59–84, I² = 96%) of participants wished to continue use of the menstrual cup at study completion. Use of the menstrual cup showed no adverse effects on the vaginal flora (four studies, 507 women). We identified five women who reported severe pain or vaginal wounds, six reports of allergies or rashes, nine of urinary tract complaints (three with hydronephrosis), and five of toxic shock syndrome after use of the menstrual cup. Dislodgement of an intrauterine device was reported in 13 women who used the menstrual cup (eight in case reports, and five in one study) between 1 week and 13 months of insertion of the intrauterine device. Professional assistance to aid removal of menstrual cup was reported among 47 cervical cup users and two vaginal cup users. We identified 199 brands of menstrual cup, and availability in 99 countries with prices ranging US$0.72–46.72 (median $23.3, 145 brands).

Interpretation

Our review indicates that menstrual cups are a safe option for menstruation management and are being used internationally. Good quality studies in this field are needed. Further studies are needed on cost-effectiveness and environmental effect comparing different menstrual products.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113bt1iA]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — infant and child feeding — an overly restrictive solid food diet based on copper content is likely inadvisable. A wide variety of foods should be introduced as recommended by the child's pediatrician, though emphasis on low- and moderate-copper choices is prudent, and homemade baby foods made from liver as part of a baby-led weaning strategy should be avoided.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms and blood indicators of copper load in apparently healthy adults undergoing controlled copper exposure [^114ScLTw]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Mild and moderate effects of marginally low and marginally high copper exposure are poorly understood in humans.

Objective

The objective was to assess acute gastrointestinal effects and blood markers of copper status in apparently healthy adults who underwent controlled copper exposure for 2 mo.

Design

This was a 2-mo, randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 1365 apparently healthy adults in whom acute gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) were assessed as responses to copper exposure (< 0.01, 2, 4, or 6 mg/L water). Blood markers were measured in 240 participants at the end of the survey. Subjects with anemia, inflammation, or infection were excluded. Serum and erythrocyte copper, peripheral mononuclear cell copper, serum ceruloplasmin, the nonceruloplasmin bound copper fraction, superoxide dismutase activity, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum ferritin, and liver enzyme activities were measured.

Results

The percentage of subjects reporting gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in the 6-mg Cu group than in the < 0.01-mg Cu group (P < 0.02). One hundred ninety-five subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the blood studies. Although a significant relation between copper intake and total gastrointestinal symptoms was observed, no relation was found between copper intake or reported symptoms and copper-load variables.

Conclusions

Gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly in response to 6 mg Cu/L water. No detectable changes were observed in indicators of copper status, which suggests competent homeostatic regulation. The results of liver function tests remained normal in all subjects. The lack of change in superoxide dismutase activity supports the Food and Nutrition Board's latest recommendation of 0.9 mg Cu/d for adults.

### Copper-containing glass ceramic with high antimicrobial efficacy [^1154wcAF]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Toxicology and potential environmental impact

Animal toxicity studies of finely milled copper–glass ceramic particles revealed no significant concerns (Table 2; "Methods"; Supplementary Data 1; detailed reports available on request). We also evaluated the levels of leached copper from coatings to determine its potential environmental impact. The levels of Cu ions leached from paint films containing the copper–glass ceramic were studied over 5 days with higher than typical concentrations of the copper–glass ceramic (33 g L −1). The level of leached copper was ~550 ppb in the first 24 h, after which it dropped to a steady level of 20–35 ppb day −1 (Supplementary Table 4). These levels are well below the 1300 ppb Cu day −1 limit set by the EPA for drinking water.

### Contaminant metals as cardiovascular risk factors: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115FB4ww]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

MONITORING METAL EXPOSURE

The measurement of metals through environmental monitoring and biomonitoring is a critical prerequisite for public health and clinical interventions. So far, however, no regulation, public health recommendation, or clinical guideline has been developed to specifically address whether there is a need for universal or population‐specific monitoring in the context of CVD prevention.

Environmental Regulations

The Environmental Protection Agency regulates lead in ambient air as one of the criteria pollutants of the Clean Air Act, the limits of which remain unchanged since 2008 (Table S4). The Lead and Copper rule establishes that if > 10% of customer tap‐water samples in a system exceed 15 μg/L, corrosion must be controlled. Implementation of this rule often fails. In Flint, Michigan; Newark, New Jersey; and other US cities and towns, lead concentration in the water supply has exceeded federal standards.

In 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency updated clearance levels for lead in dust from old housing to protect children. Exceeding limits in air, water, dust, and soil remains common, affecting numerous populations.

Cadmium and arsenic are regulated in drinking water through the Environmental Protection Agency Safe Drinking Water Act. Both are also listed as hazardous air pollutants by the Clean Air Act, but no limits have been set. For cadmium, there is an oral minimal risk level estimated through food, based on kidney outcomes.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration limits occupational exposures, but the limits for the 3 metals are relatively high. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and other agencies have additional advisory environmental and biomonitoring guidelines at lower levels, but those are not enforceable, leaving many workers unprotected.

Despite governmental regulations, however, problems with metal exposure persist. In NHANES 2011 to 2016, for example, ≈385 775 children aged 1 to 11 years had blood lead levels ≥ 5 μg/dL.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116Bkbu9]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) dietary management — adults and adolescents: A moderately copper-restricted diet complements medical therapy, and registered dietitians (RDs) can facilitate implementation of a workable and effective personalized dietary plan. Patients with WD should try to keep intake of copper to the RDA, < 0.9 mg/day, avoid foods with very high concentrations of copper and most nondairy milk alternatives, and note that among shellfish, scallops are quite low in copper and vegetable-derived "meat" products are also high in copper. During the maintenance phase of disease management, individuals should continue to be mindful of copper intake, with emphasis on low-copper (< 0.08 mg copper/serving) and moderate-copper (0.08–0.2 mg copper/serving) foods making up the base of their diet, with serving size considered and no specific limitation per day recommended.

### Novel perspectives in mammalian copper metabolism through the use of genome-wide approaches [^115X2V1K]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

The transition metal copper plays an essential role in many biological processes but is highly toxic in excess. Recent studies have characterized a highly conserved set of proteins that mediate cellular copper import, distribution, sequestration, utilization, and export. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of copper overload and copper deficiency disorders is not well understood, and we are only beginning to comprehend the results of mild copper overload or deficiency in relation to nutritional uptake and common diseases at the population level. Technological advances open the possibility to dissect the complete genome for genetic variants predisposing to copper overload or depletion and for variations in gene expression generated by either reduced or excessive copper intake. We discuss the potential of integrated genome-wide applications to advance our knowledge of copper homeostasis and to develop molecular biomarker profiles as indicators of copper status.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^113VUwwo]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

An effective method of copper supplementation is oral administration of cocoa. Although the amount of necessary copper supplementation is not established, it is said to be 2 to 6 mg/day, which is several times the required amount of copper, which as an essential dietary micronutrient is 0.9 mg/day. However, when copper is deficient, absorption efficiency from the intestinal tract increasesif there are no problems with the intestinal tract, and thus an extreme increase may not be necessary. In this case, we chose cocoa as a copper supplement. Cocoa contains a moderate amount of copper and is a convenient beverage. This cocoa contained about 0.2 mg of copper per cup, and as such, he consumed 0.4 to 0.6 mg/day. His symptoms dramatically improved even with this small amount of supplementation.

This case report has some limitations. First, it is difficult to precisely distinguish neurological symptoms including delirium from hepatic encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal. However, treatment of hepatic encephalopathy or alcohol withdrawal did not improve his symptoms, which instead worsened. Meanwhile, his neurological symptoms such as delirium recovered from the very next day after copper supplementation. From this characteristic course, we presumed that the main pathological condition was copper deficiency. Second, we did not prove that there was a blood cell abnormality due to copper deficiency by bone marrow examination. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish from blood cell abnormalities due to alcohol toxicity. However, the dramatic progressive increase in reticulocytes in just a few days after copper supplementation by cocoa suggests that copper deficiency was the main cause.

We experienced a case of copper deficiency due to an excessive habitual alcohol consumption. We encourage clinicians to suspect copper deficiency when patients with an alcohol habit have blood cell abnormalities and neurological symptoms. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanism causing copper deficiency with excessive alcohol consumption.

Learning points

Copper deficiency should be part of the differential if patients have blood cell abnormalities and neurological symptoms.
Alcohol abuse can be a risk factor for copper deficiency.
Cocoa can easily replenish copper requirements.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116JatVc]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidance statements 19–20 — patients with WD should avoid intake of foods and water containing high concentrations of copper, especially during the first year of treatment, and supervision by a registered dietitian (RD) may help to avoid overly restrictive meal patterns or undue anxiety about diet. Patients with WD unable to maintain adequate nutritional intake require dietary management that includes supplements formulated to meet dietary needs while avoiding excess copper intake, and arranging for participation by a knowledgeable RD may be helpful.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^113g2hpd]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Copper deficiency is a disease that causes blood cell abnormalities such as anaemia and leucopaenia, and neurological symptoms such as neuropathy, myelopathy and vision loss. It needs to be differentiated from vitamin B 12 deficiency. Although the precise frequency is unknown, primary copper deficiency is relatively rare because copper is universally included in the diet. Therefore, it should be suspected when the patient has a known risk factor. Current known risk factors include special nutritional conditions such as long-term tube feedingand long-term total parenteral nutrition, gastrointestinal problems such as postgastrectomyand postobesity surgeryand other conditions, such as ingestion of zinc. There are also several copper deficiency case reports of unknown causes, which suggests that there are other risk factors. Currently in the literature, there are no case reports of alcohol abuse as a risk for copper deficiency.

### Direct uptake of nutrition and caffeine study (DUNCS): biscuit based comparative study [^114Az5uW]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Over recent years the public sector has faced immense challenges, such as the covid-19 pandemic. During difficult times, when morale and motivation have been tested, one quintessentially British refreshment has helped the nation to push through. Although the choice of hot drinks now available is extensive, a cup of tea remains the preferred choice; when paired with a biscuit, this combination is rocket fuel for the National Health Service.

Staff wellbeing is important, and optimising staff hydrationand nutrition can help to improve mood and performance. We have witnessed how NHS staff avoid breaks because of constraints on their time, often grabbing substandard refreshments in a rush. As scientific evidence is lacking on best snack practice, most healthcare workers are forced to rely on their own experience. Efficient tea making skills and a good quality accompanying biscuit are important for healthcare workers, who deserve to have a brew-tiful day.

Freshly boiled water is an important part of the tea making process, but this raises concerns about the risk of oral scalding if busy healthcare workers are tempted to consume a beverage before it reaches a safe temperature. The choice of accompanying biscuit is also important. If staff prefer dunking, will their biscuit of choice survive immersion and sustain crunchiness?

We identified the time taken to produce a safe, palatable cup of tea. In keeping with the tradition of tea paired with a biscuit, we assessed four biscuit varieties for nutritional content and durability after dunking.

Conclusion

In contrast to previous observational evidence establishing higher blood copper levels as risk-increasing factor for cardiometabolic diseases, this study suggests that genetically higher blood copper might play a protective role for CAD development and systolic blood pressure. Whether systolic blood pressure mediates the association between copper and CAD needs further investigation.

### Antimicrobial activity of copper against organisms in aqueous solution: a case for copper-based water pipelines in hospitals? [^11589iMR]. American Journal of Infection Control (2013). Low credibility.

Background

An association exists between water of poor quality and health care-associated infections. Copper shows microbiocidal action on dry surfaces; it is necessary to evaluate its antimicrobial effect against organisms in aqueous solution.

Objective

The objective was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of copper against common nosocomial pathogens in aqueous solution.

Methods

Copper and polyvinyl chloride containers were used. Glass was used as control material. Fourteen organisms isolated from hospital-acquired infections, and 3 control strains were tested. Inocula were prepared by direct suspension of colonies in saline solution and water in each container tested. Bacterial counts in colony-forming units (CFU)/mL were determined at the beginning of the experiment; at 30 minutes; and at 1, 2, 24, and 48 hours.

Results

Organisms in glass and polyvinyl chloride remained viable until the end of the experiment. Organisms in copper showed a reduction from more than 100,000 CFU/mL to 0 CFU/mL within the first 2 hours of contact (F > 4.29, P < .001).

Conclusion

Copper containers show microbiocidal action on organisms in aqueous solution. Copper may contribute to the quality of water for human use, particularly in hospitals.

### Divalent copper as a major triggering agent in Alzheimer's disease [^113f23cJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is at epidemic proportions in developed countries, with a steady increase in the early 1900s, and then exploding over the last 50 years. This epidemiology points to something causative in the environment of developed countries. This paper will review the considerable evidence that that something could be inorganic copper ingestion. The epidemic parallels closely the spread of copper plumbing, with copper leached from the plumbing into drinking water being a main causal feature, aided by the increasingly common use of supplement pills containing copper. Inorganic copper is divalent copper, or copper-2, while we now know that organic copper, or copper in foods, is primarily monovalent copper, or copper-1. The intestinal transport system, Ctr1, absorbs copper-1 and the copper moves to the liver, where it is put into safe channels. Copper-2 is not absorbed by Ctr1, and some of it bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood, where it appears to be exquisitely toxic to brain cognition. Thus, while aggregation of amyloid-β has been postulated to be the cause of AD under current dogma, the great increase in prevalence over the last century appears to be due to ingestion of copper-2, which may be causing the aggregation, and/or increasing the oxidant toxicity of the aggregates. An alternative hypothesis proposes that oxidant stress is the primary injuring agent, and under this hypothesis, copper-2 accumulation in the brain may be a causal factor of the oxidant injury. Thus, irrespective of which hypothesis is correct, AD can be classified, at least in part, as a copper-2 toxicity disease. It is relatively easy to avoid copper-2 ingestion, as discussed in this review. If most people begin avoiding copper-2 ingestion, perhaps the epidemic of this serious disease can be aborted.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^113aW7Pj]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Copper deficiency may be overlooked. Although the exact frequency of copper deficiency is unknown, primary copper deficiency is considered relatively rare as copper is included in most diets. Typically, clinician awareness is low, which makes correct diagnosis difficult. Generally, we suspect copper deficiency if the patient has a known risk factor. Known risk factors include special nutritional conditions such as long-term tube feedingand long-term parenteral nutritionor gastrointestinal problems such as postgastrectomyand postobesity surgeryor other conditions, such as zinc intake. There are several case reports about copper deficiency of unknown cause. This suggests that clinically there may be other risk factors.

This case clinically suggests that excessive alcohol consumption can be a risk factor for copper deficiency. There are three reasons supporting this. First, the patient did not have any other known risk factors, and he was not a candidate for any other remarkable cause other than excessive alcohol consumption. Moreover, he had no recurrence after abstinence and after the copper supplementation. It was possible that a decreased volume of meals might have affected the onset of copper deficiency, however, this alone could not explain the progression speed of the disease such that the condition emerged after only 3 months of not eating properly. It is most likely that prior to 3 months ago he had small meals. Moreover, he was eating fish and meat, which contain ample amounts of copper. Therefore, we think that it was less likely that he became copper deficient from diet alone. In previous reports, it takes more than a half year to 1 year for copper deficiency to emerge in long-term tube feeding or parenteral nutrition. Thus, an insufficient intake by itself would not explain the short 3-month course. Second, experimental data from rat studiesby Fields et al reported that copper deficiency with organ disorder did not occur in rats fed a copper deficient diet. However, organ disorders such as anaemia occurred in rats fed a copper deficient diet and 20% ethanol for 6 weeks. Although this was experimental rat data, it suggests that alcohol consumption causes copper deficiency. Third, there is human epidemiological data. Zhang et al reported that serum copper levels in healthy Chinese volunteers who drank regularly were significantly lower than that who did not have a drinking habit. Although it is unknown whether the organ disorder of copper deficiency occurred in this report, it suggests that drinking alcohol affects human copper metabolism. Based on these supporting studies, this case clinically suggests that alcohol abuse can be a cause of copper deficiency. Unfortunately, the exact mechanism whereby alcohol causes copper deficiency is unknown. From the point of view of rapid disease progression, new mechanisms may be considered, such as copper consumption or excretion promotion rather than a problem with intestinal absorption.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^116nL8UT]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Upper intake level exceedance with supplementation — adults and children — shows that adults typically do not have usual intakes that exceed the UL from foods alone; however, micronutrient supplement users have an increased likelihood of intakes above the UL for iron (9%), zinc (9%), folic acid (7%), calcium (6%), magnesium (6%), vitamin B-6 (3.5%), vitamin A (3%), and vitamin C (1.6%); among children, use of dietary supplements in general increases the prevalence of usual nutrient intakes above the UL for iron, zinc, copper, selenium, folate, and vitamins A and C, and of most concern are 2- to 8-year-old micronutrient supplement users who exceeded the UL for zinc (28%), folic acid (71%), and vitamin A (72%).

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^116DaJjz]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with hypercholesterolemia and supplemented with copper at 5 mg/day for 45 days had a decrease in total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides, and an increase in HDL cholesterol. The results suggest that perhaps around 40% of patients with hypercholesterolemia may have marginal copper deficiency, and that their condition could be treated with copper supplementation. In apparently healthy men with adequate copper status, copper supplementation had no effect on lipid profiles.

In rats, a diet high in saturated fat increases cholesterol levels, with unsaturated fat having a protective effect. However, in copper-deficient animals, the level of dietary iron determines hyperlipidemia, not the type of dietary fat. The group of copper-deficient animals that were fed high-iron diets either died of ruptured hearts or developed severe anaemia, enlarged hearts and livers, hypercholesterolemia and elevated triglycerides. Thus, copper deficiency ties in with the iron hypothesis of heart disease, in which excess levels of stored body iron promote IHD. Normally benign levels of body iron may increase heart disease risk factors in the face of dietary copper deficiency. More importantly, copper deficiency can lead to hepatic iron overload and cirrhosiswith iron overload being treated by copper supplementation. Iron overload also induces mild copper deficiency. The severity of copper deficiency can also be reduced with iron chelators. Thus, copper deficiency contributes to iron excess in the body and vice versa.

The ratio of zinc to copper may also be important in the production of hypercholesterolemia. In rats, high ratios of zinc to copper in drinking water resulted in higher plasma cholesterol. Inadequate copper intake in humans can also result in increased cholesterol levels even when intake is only slightly below the RDA (0.83 mg per day). In humans, copper supplementation of adult men at 2 mg/day for 4 weeks increases levels of SOD and plasma diamine oxidase and significantly increases lag times for lipoprotein oxidation in those subjects with lower levels of stored body copper.

### Cupric chloride (Copper) [^116kYxYx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Acute copper toxicity has been reported in patients with oral, intravenous, or subcutaneous administration. Clinical manifestations included metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, neurological signs, such as encephalopathy, and multi-organ failure involving kidney, liver, blood, and cardiovascular systems, which may be fatal. Chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine, can be used for treatment of acute toxicity. Long-term administration of parenteral copper above the recommended dosage may result in significant accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues with possible organ damage (see WARNINGS: Hepatic Accumulation).

### Estimating risk from copper excess in human populations [^111aRtG5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Risk assessment for nutrients assumes a single population with a normal distribution of indexes of requirements and excess. Toxic levels are by definition intakes above the upper level; for copper, however, because we lack noninvasive, sensitive biomarkers of storage or early damage from excess, excess is based on the infrequent occurrence of clinical disease, such as unexplained liver cirrhosis. We examine the limitations of this approach for copper given the very low prevalence of clinical and subclinical disease and suggest that the population risk for copper excess be based on hepatic copper loading as a potentially quantifiable measurement. The challenge ahead is to develop biomarkers that predict the population risk of elevated hepatic copper stores and thus the possibility of disease in a population.

Wilson disease (WD) dietary background — general principles: The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for copper for healthy adults is 0.9 mg/day, and the median copper intake from foods in the United States is 1–1.6 mg/day; WD cannot be treated exclusively by dietary measures. For patients with WD, a few foods with very high concentrations of copper (nuts, chocolate, most shellfish, soy-based products, mushrooms, organ meats) should be avoided, at least in the first year of treatment, and health foods and supplements should be scrutinized for copper content.

### Copper (paraGard T 380A) [^1114HS4D]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Use of Paragard is contraindicated for use in pregnant females because there is no need for pregnancy prevention in a female who is already pregnant and Paragard may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. If a female becomes pregnant with Paragard in place, there is an increased risk of miscarriage, sepsis, premature labor, and premature delivery [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Advise the female of the potential risks if pregnancy occurs with Paragard in place.

Published studies on pregnancy outcomes exposed to copper IUSs report up to 27% miscarriage when the IUS was removed compared to 77% miscarriage when the IUS remained in the uterus. Studies on Paragard and birth defects have not been conducted.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

No difference has been detected in concentration of copper in human milk before and after insertion of copper IUSs, including Paragard. There is no information on the effect of copper in a breastfed child or the effect on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Paragard and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Paragard.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Paragard have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postmenarcheal females regardless of age.

Paragard is not indicated in females before menarche.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Paragard has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population.

### Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115JRRhu]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Girls and women need effective, safe, and affordable menstrual products. Single-use products are regularly selected by agencies for resource-poor settings; the menstrual cup is a less known alternative. We reviewed international studies on menstrual cup leakage, acceptability, and safety and explored menstrual cup availability to inform programmes.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Popline, Cinahl, Global Health database, Emerald, Google Scholar, and WorldWideScience from database inception to May 14, 2019, for quantitative or qualitative studies published in English on experiences and leakage associated with menstrual cups, and adverse event reports. We also screened the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from the US Food and Drug Administration for events related to menstrual cups. To be eligible for inclusion, the material needed to have information on leakage, acceptability, or safety of menstrual cups. The main outcome of interest was menstrual blood leakage when using a menstrual cup. Safety outcomes of interest included serious adverse events; vaginal abrasions and effects on vaginal microflora; effects on the reproductive, digestive, or urinary tract; and safety in poor sanitary conditions. Findings were tabulated or combined by use of forest plots (random-effects meta-analysis). We also did preliminary estimates on costs and environmental savings potentially associated with cups. This systematic review is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42016047845.

Findings

Of 436 records identified, 43 studies were eligible for analysis (3319 participants). Most studies reported on vaginal cups (27 [63%] vaginal cups, five [12%] cervical cups, and 11 [25%] mixed types of cups or unknown) and 15 were from low-income and middle-income countries. 22 studies were included in qualitative or quantitative syntheses, of which only three were of moderate-to-high quality. Four studies made a direct comparison between menstrual cups and usual products for the main outcome of leakage and reported leakage was similar or lower for menstrual cups than for disposable pads or tampons (n = 293). In all qualitative studies, the adoption of the menstrual cup required a familiarisation phase over several menstrual cycles and peer support improved uptake (two studies in developing countries). In 13 studies, 73% (pooled estimate: n = 1144; 95% CI 59–84, I² = 96%) of participants wished to continue use of the menstrual cup at study completion. Use of the menstrual cup showed no adverse effects on the vaginal flora (four studies, 507 women). We identified five women who reported severe pain or vaginal wounds, six reports of allergies or rashes, nine of urinary tract complaints (three with hydronephrosis), and five of toxic shock syndrome after use of the menstrual cup. Dislodgement of an intrauterine device was reported in 13 women who used the menstrual cup (eight in case reports, and five in one study) between 1 week and 13 months of insertion of the intrauterine device. Professional assistance to aid removal of menstrual cup was reported among 47 cervical cup users and two vaginal cup users. We identified 199 brands of menstrual cup, and availability in 99 countries with prices ranging US$0.72–46.72 (median $23.3, 145 brands).

Interpretation

Our review indicates that menstrual cups are a safe option for menstruation management and are being used internationally. Good quality studies in this field are needed. Further studies are needed on cost-effectiveness and environmental effect comparing different menstrual products.

### Copper hypersensitivity [^112JN5wC]. Contact Dermatitis (2014). Low credibility.

The world production of copper is steadily increasing. Although humans are widely exposed to copper-containing items on the skin and mucosa, allergic reactions to copper are only infrequently reported. To review the chemistry, biology and accessible data to clarify the implications of copper hypersensitivity, a database search of PubMed was performed with the following terms: copper, dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity, contact sensitization, contact allergy, patch test, dental, IUD, epidemiology, clinical, and experimental. Human exposure to copper is relatively common. As a metal, it possesses many of the same qualities as nickel, which is a known strong sensitizer. Cumulative data on subjects with presumed related symptoms and/or suspected exposure showed that a weighted average of 3.8% had a positive patch test reaction to copper. We conclude that copper is a very weak sensitizer as compared with other metal compounds. However, in a few and selected cases, copper can result in clinically relevant allergic reactions.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^116pguM3]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Copper deficiency is a disease that causes cytopaenia and neuropathy and can be treated by copper supplementation. Long-term tube feeding, long-term total parenteral nutrition, intestinal resection and ingestion of zinc are known copper deficiency risk factors; however, alcohol abuse is not. In this case, a 71-year-old man had difficulty waking. He had a history of drinking more than five glasses of spirits daily. He was well until 3 months ago. A month before his visit to our hospital, he could not eat meals but continued drinking. He had macrocytic anaemia on admission. Copper and ceruloplasmin levels were markedly low, and we diagnosed copper deficiency. There were no other known risk factors for copper deficiency. After he began drinking cocoa as a copper supplement, the anaemia ameliorated and he was able to walk. This is the first report showing alcohol abuse as a risk factor for copper deficiency.

### Hohenheim consensus workshop: copper [^115uKy1t]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element with many physiological functions. Homeostatic mechanisms exist to allow Cu to act as a cofactor in enzymatic processes and to prevent accumulation of Cu to toxic levels. The aim of this commentary is to better understand the role of dietary Cu supply in deficiency and under physiological and pathological conditions. The essentiality of Cu can be attributed to its role as a cofactor in a number of enzymes that are involved in the defence against oxidative stress. Cu, however, has a second face, that of a toxic compound as it is observed with accumulating evidence in hepatic, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. The destructive potential of Cu can be attributed to inherent physico-chemical properties. The main property is its ability to take part in Fenton-like reactions in which the highly reactive and extremely deleterious hydroxyl radical is formed. Diseases caused by dietary Cu overload could be based on a genetic predisposition. Thus, an assessment of risk-groups, such as infants with impaired mechanisms of Cu homeostasis regarding detoxification, is of special interest, as their Cu intake with resuspended formula milk may be very high. This implies the need for reliable diagnostic markers to determine the Cu status. These topics were introduced at the workshop by the participants followed by extensive group discussion. The consensus statements were agreed on by all members. One of the conclusions is that a re-assessment of published data is necessary and future research is required.

### Relevance of serum copper elevation induced by oral contraceptives: a meta-analysis [^114TeVHR]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Study Design

It is well documented that copper (Cu) blood levels are elevated in combination oral contraceptive (COC) users. The aim of this study was to establish the range of Cu increase in OC users compared to nonusers through a systematic literature overview and quantitative data analysis.

Results

Twenty-six articles were included in the meta-analysis. The increase in Cu level exponentially decreased in COC users over time, with a rapid decline through the 1960s and 1970s. After controlling for the publication year, use of COC increases the mean serum/plasma Cu level by 0.57 mg/L (95% confidence interval 0.49–0.66 mg/L).

Conclusion

COCs commonly raise serum Cu to levels between 1.5 and 2 mg/L, which are above reference levels. Although these levels are not considered toxic, there are suggestions that such Cu increase could be implicated in oxidative pathophysiological processes in the body. Further research on safety of COCs use, including oxidative-stress-related effects, is warranted.

### Why US children use dietary supplements [^1114f7n6]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

The most common MVM products used by children provide > 50% of the daily value for vitamins (A, C, D, E, B1, B2, B3, B6, B12; folic acid, pantothenic acid) and minerals (iron, iodine, zinc, and copper), with the exception of calcium. Of note, a recent study indicates that calcium and vitamin D intakes remain low in children (2–18 y of age), even among those who use dietary supplements. However, among children who used dietary supplements, excess nutrient intake was also observed for folic acid (49%), zinc (52%), and vitamin A (45%).

Approximately 15% the of products reported to be used by children were based on the recommendations from a physician or health care provider; stated differently, 85% of the supplements used by US children are based on either self-selection or decisions made by parents, caregivers, or others who may or may not be qualified to guide the choice of when and how much to supplement a diet. Health care providers were more likely to recommend dietary supplements to children < 2 y of age than to other age groups. This is a diverse age group: those < 1 y of age may be exclusively breast or bottle fed, whereas some infants are being introduced to food at 4–6 mo of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin D and iron (after 4 mo of age) supplements to exclusively breastfed children, and the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs recommends fluoride to children at high risk of developing dental caries and whose primary source of drinking water is deficient in fluoride; however, no other formal guidelines exist on the use of dietary supplements in healthy children in any other age groups.

Trientine is effective treatment for WD and is indicated especially in patients who are intolerant of D-penicillamine, and it may be preferable for patients with WD who have severe thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that can occur with splenomegaly. Paradoxical neurologic worsening after beginning treatment with trientine appears to be less common than with D-penicillamine, although head-to-head comparison was never performed. Trientine was effective initial therapy for patients, even with decompensated liver disease at the outset, and available data suggest that trientine is safe and effective in pediatric patients with WD.

### Emergency contraception: safety and effectiveness… [^111wCLNz]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Oral mifepristone, ulipristal, levonorgestrel-releasing emergency contraception, ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel, and the copper intrauterine device are safe and effective for emergency contraception. The copper IUD is not inferior to any dose of mifepristone, but no direct comparison has been made between the copper IUD and other types of emergency contraception. Adverse effects most often include nausea and vomiting for oral medications and abdominal pain and menorrhagia for the copper IUD.

1. 2 The authors of this review sought to identify the safest and most effective emergency contraception. This Cochrane review included 115 randomized controlled trials, 92 of which were performed in China, and involved 60, 479 women who had engaged in a single act of unprotected intercourse.

A single study comparing the effectiveness of the copper IUD and moderate-dose mifepristone at preventing pregnancy revealed no significant difference between the two treatments. Users of ulipristal were more likely to experience delayed resumption of menses compared with those who took oral levonorgestrel. Women who used copper IUDs were at risk of uterine perforation and/or expulsion, abdominal pain, and menorrhagia. 3, 4 The 2015 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists practice bulletin on emergency contraception recommends ulipristal, oral levonorgestrel, and the copper IUD as effective forms of emergency contraception. 3 Because ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel is often the only method available, physicians should be familiar with its dosing regimens.

They should also be educated on all of the available methods so that they can provide compassionate and timely emergency contraception to their patients.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116V6gtL]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) dietary management — children aged 6 months and older: Once solid food is introduced (at approximately 5–6 months of age), copper intake can vary widely depending on food choices. The RDA for copper for children 1–3 years-old is 0.34 mg/day, 4–8 years-old is 0.44 mg/day, and 9–13 years-old is 0.7 mg/day; children 14–18 years-old approximate the adult value. For milk choices, cow's milk is a low-copper option at 0.06–0.09 mg/L, while nondairy milk alternatives are typically much higher in copper than cow's milk (almond: approximately three times as much copper as dairy milk; rice: approximately four times as much; soy: approximately 19 times as much; coconut: approximately 20 times as much; pea: unknown, likely to be high). If a milk alternative is desired or required, individuals should work with an RD to make nutritionally sound choices.

### Regulatory frameworks for copper considering chronic exposures of the population [^113aiHJJ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Copper is an essential nutrient that is toxic in excess. Copper intakes from a balanced diet appear to meet the needs of most healthy individuals, because overt deficiency and toxicity are rare. Some uncertainty, however, persists because of limitations in currently available biomarkers used to assess copper status and the paucity of data available to establish tolerable upper levels of intake. Current policies and regulations pertaining to food fortification, nutritional supplements, and drinking water appear to be effective in providing for adequate copper intakes in many populations, although high levels of exposure, through overzealous fortification, supplementation, or drinking water exposure, may be possible under some circumstances. Surveillance and monitoring programs to evaluate copper exposures of human populations should continue and should be refined as new biomarkers become available.

Wilson disease — household water and cookware precautions — copper content of drinking water can vary from < 0.005 mg/L to as high as 30 mg/L, and a water copper content > 100 μg/L is considered elevated for WD; water treatment to decrease the copper concentration is indicated. Residents with WD should be encouraged to flush tap water for cooking or drinking after allowing it to run for at least half a minute or until cool, and home water filtration systems may be equipped with carbon-based filters or utilize reverse osmosis for metal removal, with carbon-based home water filters able to decrease copper content if changed at recommended intervals. Unlined copper or bronze cookware can leach copper into foods, so unlined copper mixing bowls and drinking mugs should be avoided by patients with WD, whereas lined copper pots and pans are described as safe to use.

### Dietary copper restriction in Wilson's disease [^112kNVXu]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Dietary copper restriction has long been considered an important aspect of treatment for Wilson's disease (WD). However, evidence supporting this approach is limited. There are no published randomised controlled trials examining this recommendation due to rarity of the disease and variable presentation. This review summarises current knowledge on the absorption and regulation of copper in humans and its relevance to patients with WD. Studies have demonstrated that as the level of dietary copper increases, the proportion absorbed decreases. This observation implies that 'high copper' foods that WD patients are generally advised to avoid would need to be consumed in large amounts to impact markedly on the quantity absorbed. Dietary copper restriction is unlikely to reduce the amount absorbed significantly and is not only difficult to manage but restricts food groups unnecessarily, detracting from the provision of substrates essential for improving nutritional status in a nutritionally compromised group. Medical management for WD is effective in compliant patients, allowing stabilisation of the liver disease. Based on current evidence, dietary copper restrictions in stable WD patients who are adherent to medical therapy are unnecessary with two food exceptions (shellfish and liver).

### Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112FpqKH]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

The main outcome of interest was menstrual blood leakage when using the menstrual cup. Additional outcomes of interest were acceptability of use of menstrual cups, difficulty with insertion or removal, comfort of wearing, and intention to use in future. Safety outcomes of interest included serious adverse events, such as toxic shock syndrome; vaginal abrasions and effects on vaginal microflora (eg, vaginal discharge, infections); effects on the reproductive, digestive, or urinary tract; and safety in poor sanitary conditions. Other safety issues we identified only during our review were documented, and all material was re-reviewed to ensure completeness of the safety assessment.

### Copper IUDs, infection and infertility [^1136dEGA]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2002). Low credibility.

Intra-uterine devices (IUDs) that contain 300 mm2 or more of copper offer a cheap and effective form of contraception, with pregnancy rates below 1 per 100 woman-years. However, because of an association between early copper-free devices, infection and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), confidence in the use of IUDs generally has been undermined. Here we review their safety as currently used. We do not consider their use as emergency contraception.

### Associations between metals and nonmetals in drinking water, cardiovascular events, and diet [^116xHnJb]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study found that long-term exposure to higher levels of metallic (copper, manganese, aluminum, zinc, and cadmium) and nonmetallic (selenium, sulfate, and nitrate-nitrogen) elements in drinking water was associated with an elevated risk of MACE. Specific dietary patterns modified the associations. Given the growing burden of MACE, our study suggests public health policies for improving drinking water standards could impact CVD health. Further studies are needed.

### Trace elements injection 4 (tralement) [^114mzsfx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Administration of the recommended dose of Tralement in parenteral nutrition is not expected to cause major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Deficiency of trace elements may result in adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Tralement or with the individual trace elements.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk

Deficiencies of trace elements, including zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium are associated with adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women have an increased metabolic demand for trace elements. Parenteral nutrition with Tralement should be considered if a pregnant woman's nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium are present in human milk. Administration of the approved recommended dose of Tralement in parenteral nutrition is not expected to cause harm to a breastfed infant. There is no information on the effects of zinc sulfate, cupric sulfate, manganese sulfate, or selenious acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother's clinical need for Tralement and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tralement or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Tralement is approved for use in pediatric patients weighing at least 10 kg as a source of zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium for parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated. Safety and dosing recommendations in pediatric patients are based on published literature describing controlled studies of products containing zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Tralement is not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 10 kg because the product does not provide an adequate dosage of zinc, copper, or selenium to meet the needs of this subpopulation and exceeds the recommended dosage of manganese.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Reported clinical experience has not identified a difference in requirements for zinc, copper, manganese, or selenium between elderly and younger patients.

### Aluminum and copper in drinking water enhance inflammatory or oxidative events specifically in the brain [^111cznvG]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2006). Low credibility.

Inflammatory and oxidative events are up-regulated in the brain of AD patients. It has been reported that in animal models of AD, exposure to aluminum (Al) or copper (Cu) enhanced oxidative events and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of a 3-month exposure of mice to copper sulfate (8 microM), aluminum lactate (10 or 100 microM), or a combination of the salts. Results suggest that although Al or Cu may independently initiate inflammatory or oxidative events, they may function cooperatively to increase APP levels.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^111Hpt3R]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Asthma first aid supportive evidence — Inhaled bronchodilators are effective in patients with asthma and acute shortness of breath, and evidence from included studies was extrapolated from the emergency medical services (EMS) and emergency department (ED) settings to the first aid setting; no new studies specifically examining the first aid setting have been published since the prior guidelines in 2015. Bronchodilator administration is safe; treatment with albuterol/salbutamol causes no clinically significant change in heart rate, blood pressure, serum potassium, tremor, headache, nervousness, weakness, palpitation, or dry mouth. When used with a metered dose inhaler, spacer devices improve the delivery of bronchodilator medications to the lungs, and inhalers with spacer devices provide clinical effectiveness equal to that of nebulizer machines, including in community settings. Improvised spacers made with a 500-mL (~16 oz) plastic cold drink bottle or a 150-mL (~5 oz) disposable paper cup appear to provide drug delivery similar to that achieved with commercial spacer devices.

Wilson disease treatment monitoring — Zinc: Maintenance control aims for 24-h urinary Cu excretion < 100 μg/24 h, and treatment failure on chronic therapy is indicated by 24-h urinary Cu excretion > 100 μg/24 h (previously normal/near-normal). Initially, 24-h urinary copper excretion may drop below the achieved target range because of drug failure or nonadherence and then increase gradually over time; reinitiation of an oral chelator increases urinary copper excretion, whereas starting zinc decreases urinary excretion of copper.

Regarding medical management for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to complications of treatment (antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that possible complications of high-dose zinc supplements include the following:

- increased risk of hospitalizations for genitourinary causes (i.e., unspecified UTI and prostatic hyperplasia in men and stress incontinence in women) were 7.5% in those treated with zinc compared with 4.9% in those not treated with 80 mg of zinc; P = 0.001. In the AREDS2, there was no significant difference in AMD progression between 80 mg and 25 mg of zinc;

- copper-deficiency anemia (concomitant administration of copper is necessary according to the AREDS and AREDS2).

### Cupric chloride (Copper) [^113pWD6T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Copper (Cupric Chloride Injection) contains 0.4 mg of copper per mL and is administered intravenously only after dilution. The additive should be diluted in a volume of fluid not less than 100 mL.
For the adult receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage of copper is 0.3 to 0.5 mg/day.
For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage of copper is 20 mcg/kg/day (0.05 mL/kg/day) up to a maximum of 500 mcg/day.
This product is not appropriate for patients weighing less than 4 kg due to the inability to measure the appropriate amount of the product.
Do not administer Copper (Cupric Chloride Injection) intramuscularly because the acidic pH of the solution may cause considerable tissue irritation.

Copper (Cupric Chloride Injection) should only be used in conjunction with a pharmacy directed admixture program using aseptic technique in a laminar flow environment; it should be used promptly and in a single operation without any repeated penetrations. The solution contains no preservatives; discard the unused portion immediately after the admixture procedure is completed.

Copper (Cupric Chloride Injection) should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use unless the solution is clear, and the seal is intact.

Cupric ion may degrade ascorbic acid in TPN solutions. In order to avoid this loss of ascorbate, multivitamin additives should be added to TPN solutions immediately prior to infusion. Alternatively, the multivitamin additive may be added to one container of TPN solution, followed by copper in a subsequent container.

### Deferiprone (Ferriprox) [^115kkHgA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use)

Instruct patients and their caregivers to store FERRIPROX Oral Solution at 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C); excursions permitted to 59°F to 86°F (15°C to 30°C) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Store in the originally supplied bottle and carton to protect from light.
Advise patients to use the measuring cup provided with FERRIPROX Oral Solution to measure the volume prescribed. Instruct patients to add about 10–15 mL of water to the measuring cup and swirl it around to mix the water with any remaining medicine in the cup and drink the mixture. The measuring cup should be hand-washed with water after use.
Advise patients to take the first dose of FERRIPROX Oral Solution in the morning, the second dose at midday, and the third dose in the evening. Clinical experience suggests that taking FERRIPROX Oral Solution with meals may reduce nausea. If a dose of this medicine has been missed, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not catch-up or double doses.
Inform patients of the risks of developing agranulocytosis and the need for regular blood testing before and during their treatment to monitor for decreases in their ANC. Instruct them to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] in order to check their ANC within 24 hours. Advise them if they are unable to reach their physician, seek care from another provider so as not to delay medical care.
Inform patients of the risk of abnormal liver transaminases and the need for regular blood testing before and during their treatment to monitor for increases in ALT [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Inform patients of the risk of zinc deficiency and the need for regular blood testing before and during their treatment to monitor for reductions in zinc [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Advise patients to contact their physician in the event of overdose.
Inform patients that their urine might show a reddish/brown discoloration due to the excretion of the iron-deferiprone complex. This is a very common sign of the desired effect, and it is not harmful.

### Operando investigation of the synergistic effect of electric field treatment and copper for bacteria inactivation [^1158PXLJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Copper (Cu) is a historically well-known metal for its natural biocidal properties, inactivating microbes by damaging their cell membranes and attacking their intracellular components. Although Cu is currently used as a natural algaecide and secondary pathogen control measure in lakes, pools and spas, plumbing systems, cooling towers, etc. it is not popularized for typical use in drinking water disinfection. This is because high levels of Cu consumed can cause adverse health effects to humans, resulting in the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) setting strict guidelines for Cu in drinking water at a maximum contaminant level of 1.3 mg/L. Nevertheless, Cu is not only safe at lower concentrations but also an essential nutrient for human health. In our previous study, EFT was configured within a copper ionization cell, achieving ~6 log removal of E. coli with a very low effluent copper concentration (0.2 mg/L). This device operated continuously for 12 h, successfully treating a total of 7.2 liters of water, resulting in an estimated cost of the device at ~$10 and a cost of treated drinking water at ~$0.1/m 3. This system shows promising potential for point-of-use applications in treatment systems for hospitals, emergency response after disasters, rural/remote areas, and developing/marginalized communities. Because of this, it is necessary to better understand the inactivation mechanism to further scale up and potentially implement the technology later on. Although the previous study demonstrated enhanced performance in microbial inactivation, the process for EFT and antimicrobial Cu ions working synergistically has yet to be elucidated at the cellular level.

Wilson disease (WD) — pathophysiology and epidemiology — is defined by impaired ATP7B-mediated copper handling in hepatocytes where absent or impaired function decreases biliary excretion causing toxic hepatic copper accumulation and, when storage is exceeded, copper deposits in extrahepatic organs including the brain, kidneys, and cornea; loss of ATP7B also diminishes incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin leading to low circulating ceruloplasmin. Dietary context notes that the average diet contains 2–5 mg/day of copper and the recommended intake is 0.9 mg/day. WD occurs worldwide with prevalence estimated at approximately 30 per million population.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^112BBGHb]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 71-year-old man was a long-term alcoholic that drank more than five glasses of spirits daily. Beginning 3 months ago, he began to eat less at meals that consisted mostly of raw fish and meat and continued to drink alcohol. However, he had no other problems in daily life. One month ago, he could no longer eat meals but continued drinking. At about this time, he became unable to walk and managed by crawling. A day before his visit to our hospital, his behaviour became unintelligible, and he was brought to our hospital by ambulance. He had a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia and took amlodipine and rosuvastatin. He has no history of surgery and he did not take zinc medication or supplementation.

Vital signs were the following: blood pressure 96/72 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, body temperature 36.7°C, respiration rate 15/min at time of visit. He lost consciousness and could not understand where he was or respond to instructions. His ocular conjunctiva was yellow tinged and he had a flapping tremor. He had an abdominal bulge and no knock pain around his liver. He had brown diarrhoea, not tarry stool. He was unable to stand up to both knees. Babinski reflection was positive. He was uncooperative with our physical examination, and as such, a detailed neurological examination including serial exams was not possible.

### A nature-inspired hydrogen-bonded supramolecular complex for selective copper ion removal from water [^111ffCDb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Rapid population growth, industrialization, and climate variability are just a few of the factors that have contributed to pushing the global ecological balance near a threshold where immediate attention is required to ensure a future of sustainability. Addressing the inextricably linked water-energy-food security nexus is critical to promote societal stability and human prosperity. Despite intensive efforts, access to safe drinking water in particular is still at risk, due in part to unacceptable levels of toxic heavy metals found in various water streams and food webs. Heavy metals and metalloids, released from geochemical cycles and anthropogenic activities, pose major threats to environmental ecosystems and can cause severe adverse health effects in humans, plants, and microorganisms. While some of these metals are essential for biological functions, they can also escape control mechanisms — such as transport, compartmentalization, and binding to designated cell constituents — via coordination chemistry and redox pathways, leading to misregulation of trafficking machinery and ion homeostasis. Undesirable binding of heavy metals to DNA and nuclear proteins often leads to cell malfunction, oxidative deterioration of biological macromolecules, and eventually toxicity. Effective solutions for efficient remediation of trace heavy metal ions from water with low costs are key pieces of the puzzle to promote environmental and human well-being.

Copper, one of the most widely used heavy metals, is toxic to humans in large quantities, despite its essential role in our physiology. A copper imbalance can impact heart function and lipid metabolism as well as causing inflammation and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established a maximum level of copper in drinking water at 1.3 mg L −1. However, copper levels reported in drinking water in Europe, Canada, and the USA can range from ≤ 0.005 to > 30 mg L −1. Historically, there have been several outbreaks of copper poisoning from ingestion of drinks that were contaminated with copper salts. Given that millions of tons of copper are produced annually worldwide and it is ubiquitous across industries, maintaining low levels of copper contaminants in water streams is a present concern. Therefore, seeking highly efficient approaches for copper removal from water is important. Beyond human health, selective separations involving copper is a relevant area of research for which traditional metallurgical solutions are limited. For example, in electrolytic nickel refining, selective removal of copper from nickel electrolysis anolytes has long been a problem plaguing the global metallurgical industry, and requires more effective solutions.

### Update to U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use… [^111ZEoQh]. CDC (2020). Medium credibility.

What is added by this report. CDC updated recommendations in the "U. S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use" to state that progestin-only injectable contraception and intrauterine devices are safe for use without restriction among women at high risk for HIV infection. 2). In addition, WHO's updated recommendations state that IUDs are MEC category 1 with an accompanying clarification that women at high risk for HIV infection are also at risk for other STDs, and providers should refer to additional recommendations on IUD use for women at increased risk for STDs. Because of newly published studies and the WHO update, CDC initiated a process to assess whether its guidance should be updated for the U. S. context.

7), containing a total of 36 studies, 17 of which met minimum quality criteria defined in the review, and 2) a systematic review on copper IUD use and risk for HIV acquisition, containing seven studies, three of which met minimum quality criteria. The systematic reviews included primary reports of longitudinal studies identified in PubMed or Embase databases through June 2019. Among the observational evidence examining the association between progestin-only injectables and risk for HIV acquisition, results were inconsistent across studies and limited by methodologic concerns. Limited evidence on other progestin-only contraceptives, combined hormonal contraceptives, and copper IUDs did not suggest increased risk for HIV acquisition, compared with other hormonal or nonhormonal contraceptives or no method. 1).

Correct and consistent use of condoms can reduce the risk for pregnancy and acquisition of STDs, including HIV. No drug interactions between antiretroviral therapy and barrier methods are known. However, for spermicides and diaphragms, high risk for HIV is classified as category 4 because repeated and high-dose use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 is associated with increased risk for genital lesions, which might increase the risk for HIV infection. The rate of HIV acquisition in the ECHO trial was high overall, despite participants receiving comprehensive HIV prevention services (.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^114a7tZp]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

Serum copper and ceruloplasmin recovered rapidly, serum ferritin declined and blood cell count recovered after just a few days of drinking cocoa. His delirium also disappeared rapidly from the day after starting cocoa. Moreover, activity of daily life recovered rapidly (figure 1). Because he became cooperative with medical treatment, we used diuretics and BCAA sequentially. Eventually, he could walk on his own and was discharged on the 74th day and was ambulatory.

### Copper deficiency and excess in infancy: developing a research agenda [^112c7NXa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency and excess have been recognized as potential health problems for infants and children worldwide. Clinical manifestations of copper deficiency and excess are well characterized but the precise sequence by which high copper intake interacts with genetic control systems, leading to liver damage in infants, is unknown. The possibility that genetic mutations or epigenetic factors related to the functional development of copper homeostasis, could make otherwise normal infants on normal copper intake more susceptible to copper toxicity has been an issue of concern. In January 2001 a group of pediatricians and researchers interested in this area met at Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany, to reviewing the state of knowledge on the topic. They addressed six main issues: 1) The relevance of copper deficit and excess as health problems. 2) The appropriate biomarkers to identify and characterize copper status 3) The genetic variability in copper metabolism 4) The mechanisms of whole body copper homeostasis in early life and their changes with age 5) The development of experimental and animal models to address research questions on copper homeostasis in infants. 6) The safe upper and lower limits of copper intake/exposure from water and food. We present here the highlights of the discussions and the main conclusions of the meeting.

### Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jtvzj]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Menstrual cups seem to be an effective and safe alternative to other menstrual products. Information on menstrual cups should be provided in puberty education materials. Policy makers and programmes can consider this product as an option in menstrual health programmes. Further research globally can provide more information on acceptability and is needed to monitor adverse events and assess best practice to shorten the familiarisation phase required for safe and effective use, and on cost-effectiveness and environmental effects.

The menstrual cup is not commonly known, despite its long history (appendix p 2). Like tampons, menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina, but the blood is collected in the receptacle, which can hold 10–38 mL of blood. The menstrual cup should be emptied every 4–12 h, depending on menstrual flow and type of cup. Two types of cup are available, a vaginal cup, which is generally bell-shaped and placed in the vagina, and a cervical cup, which, like a diaphragm for contraception, is placed around the cervix high in the vagina. Menstrual cups are made of medical-grade silicone, rubber, latex, or elastomer and can last up to 10 years; disposable single-use menstrual cups also exist.

We aimed to summarise current knowledge about leakage, safety, and acceptability of menstrual cups and compared, when available, with other menstrual products. We compiled information on global availability and costs of menstrual cups, did preliminary estimates on costs and waste savings, and examined online guidance materials on menarche in selected regions of the world for reference to menstrual cup as a product option.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Paragard should only be inserted by a healthcare provider trained in Paragard's insertion procedures, because insertion for Paragard is different from that used for other intrauterine systems. Healthcare providers should become thoroughly familiar with the product, product educational materials, product insertion instructions, and prescribing information before attempting insertion of Paragard.
Insert one Paragard at the fundus of the uterine cavity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
Remove Paragard on or before 10 years from the date of insertion [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
May replace Paragard at the time of removal with a new Paragard if continued contraceptive protection is desired.
Before considering use of Paragard, make sure that the female is an appropriate candidate for Paragard. Exclude pregnancy (consider the possibility of ovulation and conception) prior to use [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Timing of Insertion

Refer to Table 1 for recommended timing of Paragard insertion.

Note: The inserter provided with Paragard (see Figure 1) and the Insertion Procedure described in subsection 2.4 are not applicable for immediate insertion after childbirth. For immediate insertion post childbirth, remove the inserter and Paragard from the tray, move the button forward and then completely back to release the Paragard unit from the inserter and insert Paragard.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^116qtWK4]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — composition, usage prevalence, market growth, and safety — are described as beverages that typically contain caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, vitamins, herbal extracts, proprietary blends, and/or amino acids, and are available with or without sugar and may or may not be carbonated. Since their introduction in 1987, energy drinks have become increasingly popular; use is prevalent, with up to 80% of college athletes reporting use. The global energy drink market was worth USD 39 billion in 2013 and is forecast to reach 61 billion by 2021. After reports of adverse events, concerns including trouble sleeping, anxiety, cardiovascular events, seizures, and even death have been raised, and the research about energy drinks safety and efficacy is often contradictory with much of the available literature industry-sponsored. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 400 mg d−1, or about four or five cups of coffee, is the amount of caffeine "not generally associated with dangerous, negative effects" for healthy adults.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that an extremely low serum ceruloplasmin level (< 5 mg/dL) more strongly suggests a diagnosis of WD than modestly subnormal levels, but serum ceruloplasmin by itself is insufficient for making a diagnosis of WD. Do not exclude WD based on normal serum ceruloplasmin levels.

### Cupric chloride [^1177dSnv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Copper is an essential nutrient which serves as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin, an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein, transferrin. Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation.

Providing copper during TPN helps prevent development of the following deficiency symptoms: Leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, depressed ceruloplasmin levels, impaired transferrin formation, secondary iron deficiency and osteoporosis.

Normal serum copper values range from 80 to 163 mcg/dl (mean, approximately 110 mcg/dl). The serum copper level at which deficiency symptoms appear is not precisely defined. A serum value of 9 mcg copper/dl was reported for one TPN patient who received no copper. The daily turnover of copper through ceruloplasmin is approximately 0.5 mg. Excretion of copper is through the bile (80%), directly through the intestinal wall (16%) and in urine (4%).

### Copper intrauterine device use and HIV acquisition in women: a systematic review [^112kVuFa]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2020). High credibility.

Data extraction, quality assessment and data synthesis

We used a study quality assessment framework modified from that used for a previous review of hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV. Briefly, studies that failed to adjust for condom use or had unclear exposure measurement were judged to be "unlikely to inform the primary question". All other studies could be considered to be either "informative but with important limitations" or "informative with few limitations", depending on the potential for residual or uncontrolled confounding in the studies (online supplementary appendix 2). We abstracted data from all included studies into an evidence table that included information on the study design, population, exposure and comparison groups, results, strengths and weaknesses, and quality. We synthesised the study results narratively; the small number of point estimates for specific comparisons precluded meta-analysis. For studies that reported risk estimates for a hormonal contraceptive method compared with a Cu-IUD, we report the inverse of the risk estimate so that the Cu-IUD is the exposure and the hormonal contraceptive method is the referent group.

Patient and public involvement

As this analysis was based on published data, patients and the public were not involved in the design of the study.

### Cupric chloride (Copper) [^116eDy8e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Copper is an essential nutrient which serves as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin, an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein, transferrin. Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation.

Providing copper during TPN helps prevent development of the following deficiency symptoms: Leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, depressed ceruloplasmin levels, impaired transferrin formation, secondary iron deficiency and osteoporosis.

Normal serum copper values range from 80 to 163 mcg/dl (mean, approximately 110 mcg/dl). The serum copper level at which deficiency symptoms appear is not precisely defined.

In the plasma, about 7% of copper is bound to albumin and amino acids. In the liver, about 93% of copper is bound to ceruloplasmin and released to the serum. The daily turnover of copper through ceruloplasmin is approximately 0.5 mg. Copper is primarily excreted through the bile and into the gastrointestinal tract where it is not reabsorbed. Copper is also eliminated through the kidneys.

### Macronutrients, aluminium from drinking water and foods, and other metals in cognitive decline and dementia [^1179S4Jo]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2006). Low credibility.

A possible role of the macronutrients and the basic elements of carbohydrates (glucose administration or depletion), proteins (amino acids such as tryptophan and tyrosine), and fat (unsaturated fatty acids) was recently proposed for age-related changes of cognitive function, and the cognitive decline of degenerative (AD) or vascular origin. The availability and utilization of glucose has been implicated in cognitive function not only as a result of nutritional and systemic metabolic conditions, but also, although speculatively, as a crucial phase of the mechanism of action of molecules used as cognitive-enhancers. Furthermore, many lines of evidence have focused on the importance of oxidative stress mechanisms and free radical damage in AD pathogenesis. In addition, epidemiological studies have recently reported an association between alcohol and the incidence of AD and predementia syndromes. Foods with large amounts of aluminium-containing additives or aluminium from drinking water may affect the risk of developing AD, aluminium more likely acting as a cofactor somewhere in the cascade of events leading to the demented brain. A role for other metals in dementia have been speculated, given the encouraging results reported from studies on peripheral zinc concentrations, zinc supplementation, serum copper, either bound with ceruloplasmin or not, and iron metabolism in AD. Nonetheless, more data are needed to support a possible role of these metals in dementing diseases. Healthy diets, antioxidant supplements, and the prevention of nutritional deficiencies or exposure to foods and water with high content of metals could be considered the first line of defence against the development and progression of cognitive decline.

### Bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^111QSbYf]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Micronutrient deficiency replacement after bariatric surgery — copper, iron, and zinc dosing and interactions are detailed as follows. For copper, treatment includes "3–8 mg/d oral copper gluconate or sulfate" for mild to moderate deficiency, "2–4 mg/d of IV copper for ~ one week or until blood levels, signs, and symptoms resolve", with "Maintenance dose is 1–2 mg/d". For iron, in moderate deficiency or at-risk patients, "total elemental iron oral intake is often 150–200 mg twice a day", with "Maintenance elemental iron supplementation (in patients without anemia) is ~18 mg per day", and content varies by salt: "Ferrous fumarate supplies ~33% elemental iron (Fe), ferrous sulfate ~20% Fe, ferrous gluconate ~12% Fe"; "For severe deficiency, IV iron is sometimes required". Zinc–copper considerations include that "Copper deficiency can contribute to iron deficiency" and "Zinc consumption may impair copper absorption", thus "1 mg of copper might best be given per each 10 mg of zinc administered", and typical zinc supplementation after repletion includes "zinc 30 mg/d" when malabsorption risk persists or "8–22 mg per day" if lower risk, noting "Many bariatric multivitamins have 7.5–30 mg of zinc". Clinicians are advised that "Clinicians should work closely with a pharmacist to help confirm proper dosing of vitamins and minerals for an individual patient".

Methods

Search strategy

This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines (see fig 1 and supplementary materials, table S1). We comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science electronic databases to identify studies published until 5 December 2017 (date of last search), which examined the association between arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury, and copper with primary outcomes of interest. The primary outcomes were coronary heart disease (defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, coronary revascularisation (ie, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery), or coronary heart disease death), stroke (defined as fatal or nonfatal stroke), and composite cardiovascular disease (comprised of coronary heart disease and stroke). The computer based searches combined search terms related to the toxic metal exposures (eg, arsenic*, lead*, mercury*, etc) and outcomes of interest (eg, cardiovascular disease*, myocardial infarction*, stroke*, etc), without any language restriction. Further studies were sought by manually searching reference lists of the relevant articles. When relevant information was unavailable, efforts were made to contact corresponding authors. Details of the search strategy are presented in supplementary materials, appendix 1.

Selection criteria

We included studies if they met the following initial search criteria: were prospective cohort, case-control, or nested case-control in design; had sampled from healthy (ie, participants or referents, where appropriate, were based on initially healthy participants) or general populations (ie, populations with both healthy and prevalent cases of cardiovascular disease at baseline); assessed toxic metal exposure at individual level rather than aggregate level (eg, individual-level exposure to arsenic in drinking water); or reported risk estimates for cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, or stroke, for at least one toxic metal. We excluded studies for the following reasons: they only reported on mean levels and standard deviations of toxic metals in cases and non-cases; they only assessed exposure to toxic metals using a self reported dietary measure; or were cross-sectional or ecological in design. Two independent reviewers screened the search results to assess conformity with selection criteria, with disagreement resolved with a third reviewer. In cases of multiple publications from a single study, we used the most up to date information.

Parenteral copper dosing in adult parenteral nutrition (PN) — A.S.P.E.N. recommendations: Currently, the adult parenteral multiple trace element (TE) products available in the U.S. provide approximately 1 mg/d of copper. A.S.P.E.N. recommends that the dose of copper in adult parenteral multiple TE products be lowered to 0.3–0.5 mg/d and limit the amount of contamination in a composite PN formulation to no more than 0.1 mg/d. Copper doses should be decreased or omitted in patients with significant cholestasis or hepatic dysfunction, and copper requirements are increased in severe burn patients.

### Cupric chloride (Copper) [^117ALLh5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hepatic Accumulation

Copper is primarily eliminated in the bile and excretion is decreased in patients with cholestasis and/or cirrhosis. Hepatic accumulation of copper has been reported in autopsies of patients receiving long-term parenteral nutrition containing copper at dosages higher than recommended.

Administration of copper to patients with cholestasis and/or cirrhosis may cause hepatic accumulation of copper. Administration of copper to patients with Wilson disease, an inborn error of copper metabolism with a defect in hepatocellular copper transport, may cause both increased hepatic accumulation of copper and aggravation of the underlying hepatocellular degeneration.

For patients with cholestasis, biliary dysfunction, or cirrhosis, monitor hepatic and biliary function during long-term administration of Cupric Chloride Injection. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of hepatobiliary disease during the use of Cupric Chloride Injection, obtain serum concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin, and adjust the dose as indicated (see PRECAUTIONS: Hepatic Impairment).

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Postmarket safety reporting has identified copper hypersensitivity in women receiving copper-containing intrauterine devices, providing evidence that patients may experience hypersensitivity reactions when exposed to this metal. If hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., pruritis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, urticaria) occur in patients receiving Cupric Chloride Injection in parenteral nutrition, discontinue the product, and initiate appropriate medical treatment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Aluminum Toxicity

This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

### Typhoid in a Kenyan village: its impact, its prevention [^115iQuGJ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Although contaminated food and water are the major causes of typhoid, a range of other factors have been associated with outbreaks in endemic settings such as poor sanitation, close contact with typhoid cases or carriers, proximity to contaminated water, flooding, personal hygiene, and densely populated areas. Unfortunately, these were inevitable conditions surrounding my life in Kenya. In addition, climate variables such as rainfall, vapor pressure, and temperature intensify the risks of typhoid transmission and distribution of typhoid infection in human populations.

According to the latest Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, 66.9% of Kenyans have an improved water source, but less than half the rural population in Kenya has access to safe drinking water. The situation is no different in my village where most people still rely on water from unsafe and contaminated sources including the river and nearby streams. In Tongaren, most women have to trek more than a kilometer to fetch drinking water. The same water is used by livestock. This water is often contaminated by human sewage because of the lack of proper sanitation. Less than 25% of the population in Kenya is using an improved sanitation facility. The situation in rural areas like Tongaren is even worse; perhaps less than 15% have improved sanitation.

Poor sewage disposal, often next to waterways, leads to runoff that eventually ends up in rivers and ponds. Water drawn from such rivers and ponds is rarely treated because of a lack of awareness and, to some extent, poverty and scarcity of fuelwood to boil water. Although it is likely that most water is contaminated at the source, as shown in many studies conducted in Kenya, there is often re-contamination during collection, storage, and use at home. In the village, residents typically collect water from rivers in 20-L plastic containers and then store water in the house in large pots for several days. A cup or tin is frequently dipped into the pot to draw drinking water. Multiple people often use the cup, which is rarely cleaned, thus, introducing contaminants, chief among them bacteria such as Escherichia coli and typhoid-causing Salmonella, into the water.
