## Question

What is the recommendation treatment of patient with scd present with ascites and nephrotic syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a management plan for a patient with sickle cell disease who presents with ascites and nephrotic syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify the underlying etiologies, distinguishing sickle-related nephropathy from other causes and characterizing the ascites. Next, I will outline disease-modifying therapy for SCD, followed by nephrotic syndrome–directed management including RAAS blockade, diuretics, and immunosuppression. After that, I need to address ascites management and monitoring. Finally, I should plan longitudinal care, transplant evaluation, and special considerations such as pregnancy and pediatric nuances, while continuously checking for contraindications and safety issues throughout [^113Tssao] [^113qEJRb].

> Let me first confirm the clinical priorities and stabilize the patient; I need to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are intact, and I should promptly evaluate for life-threatening complications of SCD such as acute chest syndrome or sepsis while initiating supportive care for severe edema and hypoalbuminemia, including strict intake and output, daily weights, and close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes, with early nephrology and hematology involvement given the complexity of combined nephrotic syndrome and SCD [^113Tssao] [^115MJh5m].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome before I anchor on it; I should confirm nephrotic-range proteinuria with a first-morning urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 2 g/g in children or equivalent adult thresholds, document hypoalbuminemia, and assess for hyperlipidemia and edema, while also checking for hematuria, RBC casts, and complement levels to help distinguish primary glomerular disease from sickle-related glomerulopathy, and I should remember that KDIGO endorses spot UPCR as standard in children and that albumin ≤ 3 g/dL is an accepted threshold in current pediatric guidance even though some continue to use ≤ 2.5 g/dL historically [^111mmo9a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to check for alternative or additional causes of nephrotic syndrome such as post-infectious glomerulonephritis, lupus, HIV-associated nephropathy, and diabetic kidney disease, and I should consider renal biopsy if the presentation is atypical, there is rapid progression, or there is no response to initial therapy, because sickle-related glomerulopathy is common but not the only cause of heavy proteinuria in SCD [^113Tssao] [^113ADjJJ].

> I will now examine the ascites; at first glance I thought this could reflect sickle hepatopathy or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, but wait, I should verify that in the context of nephrotic syndrome the ascites is most likely secondary to severe hypoalbuminemia and third-spacing rather than primary liver disease, though I still need to assess liver function, obtain abdominal imaging, and exclude portal hypertension or SOS/VOD, and if SOS/VOD is suspected I should follow fluid and sodium restriction with careful diuretic use and escalate to ICU-level care and definitive therapy such as defibrotide when indicated [^115cVoTA] [^116TGBBb].

> Next, I should review disease-modifying therapy for SCD because controlling hemolysis and vaso-occlusion may mitigate ongoing renal injury; hydroxyurea remains foundational and should be optimized to maximal tolerated dosing with close monitoring of CBC and reticulocytes, and in patients with CKD-related anemia I should consider adding an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent with a conservative hemoglobin ceiling of 10 g/dL to avoid hyperviscosity, while also ensuring vaccinations are up to date and NSAIDs are avoided given renal risks in glomerulopathy [^115qxwmy] [^112m1gH4] [^116iWz6N] [^115A2rRS] [^1131Pw8c].

> Let me think about antiproteinuric therapy; I should confirm albuminuria with repeat testing and then initiate an ACE inhibitor or ARB, starting low and rechecking serum creatinine and potassium within about a week, with dose titration to effect and temporary holds during intercurrent illness, contrast exposure, or surgery, recognizing that while evidence in SCD is limited, guidelines suggest RAAS blockade as reasonable given potential to slow progression and a generally favorable safety profile when monitored [^112ooudg] [^117VEBTf] [^114zPPRM].

> I need to ensure blood pressure is tightly controlled because hypertension accelerates CKD progression in SCD; I should target ≤ 130/80 mm Hg in adults using RAAS agents as first-line when appropriate, monitor for hyperkalemia and AKI, and avoid over-diuresis that could precipitate vaso-occlusive episodes, adjusting therapy based on tolerance and kidney function [^1154N5QM] [^113Yg122].

> For edema and ascites, I should confirm a cautious diuretic strategy; loop diuretics such as furosemide or ethacrynic acid can be used with attention to intravascular volume and renal perfusion, and in severe hypoalbuminemia I should consider cautious albumin infusion to improve diuretic responsiveness, while remembering that ethacrynic acid is indicated for edema in renal disease including nephrotic syndrome and is available in IV form when rapid effect is needed, all with close monitoring of electrolytes and kidney function [^112XEZVt] [^112BscAa].

> But wait, what if the nephrotic syndrome reflects a steroid-responsive process; I should double-check for features suggesting minimal change disease or another steroid-sensitive lesion, and if indicated, initiate a standard pediatric regimen such as daily prednisone 60 mg/m²/day for 4–6 weeks followed by alternate-day therapy to complete 8–12 weeks, or use adult-equivalent protocols, while planning a taper and discontinuation after sustained remission and considering renal biopsy if there is steroid resistance or atypical features [^113hQAku].

> I should confirm that we are not missing infectious triggers; if there is evidence of post-infectious glomerulonephritis or ongoing infection, I need to treat the infection and provide supportive care including salt restriction and blood pressure control, reserving immunosuppression for rapidly progressive disease or crescentic glomerulonephritis after biopsy confirmation [^113ADjJJ].

> Next, I should review longitudinal kidney care; I will monitor renal function, proteinuria, blood pressure, and CBC every 3–6 months, screen annually for albuminuria starting at age 10 in SCD, and refer early to nephrology for persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria, declining eGFR, or resistant hypertension, with transplant evaluation considered once CKD is advanced given superior outcomes compared with dialysis in SCD [^117VEBTf] [^111AxGsH] [^112xRFF7].

> Hold on, I should verify special situations; in pregnancy, I need to balance maternal-fetal risks and benefits, and after the first trimester it may be reasonable to continue or restart hydroxyurea with multidisciplinary input, while in pediatrics I should apply nephrotic syndrome protocols tailored to age and ensure growth and developmental monitoring, and in older adults with SCD I should maintain a low threshold for disease-modifying therapy and comprehensive comorbidity review [^112hHMah] [^113hQAku] [^116Ruy3S].

> I should double-check safety caveats throughout; avoid nephrotoxic agents including NSAIDs in patients with glomerulopathy, monitor closely for hyperkalemia with ACEi/ARB therapy, and use diuretics judiciously to prevent dehydration and vaso-occlusion, adjusting plans as kidney function and clinical status evolve [^115A2rRS] [^1131Pw8c] [^112ooudg].

> In summary, I need to ensure a coordinated approach: confirm nephrotic syndrome and its etiology, optimize SCD disease-modifying therapy, initiate guideline-directed antiproteinuric and blood pressure management, manage edema and ascites with careful diuresis and albumin support, consider immunosuppression when a steroid-responsive glomerulopathy is likely, and plan for early nephrology involvement and transplant evaluation, all while continuously reassessing for complications and contraindications to maintain safety and efficacy [^113Tssao] [^113qEJRb] [^112xRFF7].

---

For a patient with SCD presenting with ascites and nephrotic syndrome, prioritize **early nephrology and hematology co-management** [^113CNA7y] to confirm the diagnosis, stage CKD, and coordinate care. Start **ACEi/ARB therapy** [^114zPPRM] to reduce proteinuria and slow renal progression, and initiate or optimize **hydroxyurea** [^114ETKKc] to reduce hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. Manage ascites with salt restriction, cautious diuretics, and albumin as needed, while avoiding nephrotoxic drugs and maintaining strict blood pressure control (target ≤ 130/80 mmHg) [^1154N5QM]. Consider renal biopsy if the etiology is unclear or if there is no response to initial therapy, and refer early for kidney transplantation if advanced CKD or ESRD develops [^111AxGsH] [^112xRFF7].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm nephrotic syndrome**: Document proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g/day in adults or ≥ 40 mg/m²/h in children, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema [^notfound].

- **Assess renal function**: Measure serum creatinine, eGFR, and electrolytes; monitor for hyperkalemia and renal impairment [^115MJh5m].

- **Evaluate SCD-related complications**: Screen for pulmonary hypertension, retinopathy, and other organ involvement [^notfound].

- **Consider renal biopsy**: If etiology is unclear or there is no response to initial therapy, biopsy may be indicated [^113ADjJJ].

---

## Medical management

### Renal management

- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Initiate and titrate to reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression; monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function changes [^113qEJRb] [^112ooudg].

- **Blood pressure control**: Target ≤ 130/80 mmHg to reduce renal and cardiovascular risk [^1154N5QM] [^113Yg122].

- **Avoid nephrotoxic drugs**: Minimize use of NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic agents [^115A2rRS].

---

### Sickle cell disease management

Initiate or optimize **hydroxyurea** [^114m3mKg] to reduce hemolysis, vaso-occlusion, and proteinuria. Use **exchange transfusions** for acute complications or severe anemia, and consider chronic transfusion if hydroxyurea is contraindicated or ineffective.

---

### Ascites management

- **Salt restriction**: Limit sodium intake to reduce fluid retention.

- **Diuretics**: Use cautiously; loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may be preferred; monitor for electrolyte disturbances and renal function changes [^115cVoTA].

- **Albumin infusion**: Consider in cases of severe hypoalbuminemia to improve circulatory volume and diuretic response.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly **monitor renal function** with serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes, and urinalysis, and track hematologic parameters — hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and markers of hemolysis. Closely monitor blood pressure, and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed [^1124fvJm].

---

## Advanced interventions

Consider **renal transplantation** for advanced CKD or ESRD, as it improves survival compared to dialysis [^111AxGsH] [^115ZBFxf]. Evaluate for **curative therapies** such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy in eligible patients.

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Coordinate **nephrology and hematology** co-management to optimize renal and hematologic outcomes, and involve nutrition, cardiology, and hepatology as indicated. Provide patient education on medication adherence, dietary restrictions, and symptom monitoring.

---

## Prognosis

Renal prognosis is guarded, with a **high risk of progression to ESRD** and increased mortality; early intervention and strict blood pressure control improve outcomes [^115Q37LB]. Overall prognosis depends on the severity of renal disease, response to therapy, and management of complications.

---

Management of SCD with ascites and nephrotic syndrome requires **coordinated, multidisciplinary care**, with ACEi/ARB therapy, hydroxyurea optimization, strict blood pressure control, and careful ascites management; early nephrology involvement and transplant evaluation are essential.

The application of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is currently primarily driven by clinical expertise and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to guide decision-making. A summary of SCD management principles in the areas of health care maintenance, transfusion therapy, treatment and prevention of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, renal disease, contraception and pregnancy, and priapism is predominantly based on the authors' interpretation of available observational studies as well as the opinions of experts in SCD. RCTs impacting current practices address use of hydroxyurea to prevent painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, intensity of pre-operative transfusion, transfusion during pregnancy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for proteinuria, but most issues in adult SCD care have not been rigorously studied and management may not be appropriately extrapolated from pediatric data. While challenging clinical problems need to be addressed by RCTs, there is also the need for development of practice guidelines using formal methodological strategies. This brief review is not a substitute for the process but provides a literature-based approach to making treatment decisions when caring for adults with SCD.

### How I treat renal complications in sickle cell disease [^117H1gKe]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Renal disease is one of the most frequent and severe complications experienced by patients with sickle cell disease; its prevalence is likely to increase as the patient population ages. We recommend regular monitoring for early signs of renal involvement and a low threshold for the use of hydroxyurea as preventative measures for end-stage renal disease. Once renal complications are detected, a careful assessment of the patient is required to rule out other causes of renal disease. Proteinuria and hypertension should be managed aggressively and the patient referred to a specialist nephrology center when progressive decline in renal function is noted. For the few patients who develop advanced chronic kidney disease, timely planning for dialysis and transplantation can significantly improve outcome, and we recommend an exchange blood transfusion policy for all patients on the transplant waiting list and for those with a functioning graft. Alongside the invasive treatment regimes, it is important to remember that renal failure in conjunction with sickle cell disease does carry a significant burden of morbidity and that focusing on symptom control has to be central to good patient care.

Evidence review and development of recommendations — For each guideline question, a GRADE EtD framework using the GRADEPro Guideline Development Tool was prepared, and the EtD table summarized results of systematic reviews performed for this guideline. The certainty of the body of evidence was categorized into 4 levels ranging from very low to high. Clinical recommendations were developed during a 2-day in-person meeting followed by online communications and conference calls, and agreement was by consensus or, in rare instances, by voting, for which an 80% majority was required for a strong recommendation. The final guidelines, including recommendations, were reviewed and approved by all members of the panel.

### Nephrotic syndrome on sickle cell disease: the impact of hydroxyurea [^112QKEzP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Nephropathy is a common under-recognised complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and one of the main factors of poor prognosis in these patients. The association between nephrotic syndrome and SCD in children is rare. Strategies for sickle cell nephropathy prevention are still poorly established. Blood pressure control as well as monitoring of microalbuminuria and renal function are mandatory. The use of antiproteinuric drugs, such as anti-ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and hydroxyurea, should be considered in early stages. Here, we report a case of a female adolescent with SCD and inaugural nephrotic syndrome who, after an initial treatment failure with corticotherapy, had a remarkable recovery after treatment with hydroxyurea and ACEis.

Screening justification criteria — general principles for deciding when screening is warranted emphasize that the condition should be an important health problem; management should differ by positive vs negative test; the condition should have an understood natural history with a latent or early symptomatic stage; there should be an effective treatment/prevention that improves outcomes if applied before clinical presentation; outcome improvements from management based on screening should outweigh harms of screening; there should be high- or moderate-quality evidence for sufficient test accuracy; and screening should be cost-effective, acceptable to patients, and feasible to implement.

Limitations and updating of these ASH guidelines — development notes that the limitations of these guidelines are inherent in the low or very low certainty in the evidence identified for many of the questions, and where appropriate and specifically indicated in the guidelines, the panel relied on indirect evidence from the general population to inform decision-making and derive recommendations in the absence of evidence from the SCD population. In rare instances, where explicitly described, final recommendations were derived through voting by panel members when there were differences in opinion on the certainty of evidence or the relevance/application of evidence to a specific question. After publication of these guidelines, ASH will maintain them through surveillance for new evidence, ongoing review by experts, and regular revisions, and adaptation of these guidelines will be necessary in many circumstances with adaptations based on the associated EtD frameworks.

### Sickle cell nephropathy-a practical approach [^111tn44o]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Despite its apparently simple molecular aetiology, sickle cell disease (SCD) has long been known to have a remarkably variable clinical course, with complications involving many organs including the kidneys. Whilst many affected individuals show no evidence of renal involvement into late adulthood, others develop renal dysfunction in childhood or early adult life with a significant proportion eventually requiring renal replacement therapy. This review explores the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) and discusses how each complication can be investigated, monitored and managed in the outpatient setting. We summarize current knowledge of genetic modulation of sickle-related renal dysfunction. We outline the evidence for various treatment options and discuss others for which little evidence currently exists.

Future research

We recognize the paucity of scientific evidence in the field of CNS. Indeed, during our literature search we identified 54 relevant articles but no randomized controlled trials. Compelling clinical questions remain unanswered and we propose a number of research themes to address these questions (Box 10).

Box 10 Future research

Develop a comprehensive registry for children with CNS to evaluate the variations in treatment and natural history of the disease, including rare complications.
Evaluate the impact of CNS on schooling, social life and professional activity.
Evaluate phenotype–genotype correlations in CNS.
Define the optimal indications, dose and frequency of albumin infusions to use once patients have achieved a stable disease state.
Evaluate the risk versus benefit ratio of approaches to preventing and/or treating CNS complications, such as use of anticoagulation, immunoglobulin infusion and vaccinations.

Sickle cell disease — management after abnormal echocardiography (ECHO): For asymptomatic children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and an isolated peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) of ≥ 2.5 to 2.9 m/s, the panel suggests against right-heart catheterization (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects). For children and adults with SCD and a peak TRV of ≥ 2.5 m/s who also have a reduced 6MWD and/or elevated NT-BNP, the panel suggests right-heart catheterization (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Good practice statements note it is good practice to consult a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or PH expert when referring SCD patients for right-heart catheterization, interpreting results, and/or considering therapy options, and to base decisions on ECHOs obtained at steady state and not during acute illness such as hospitalization for pain or acute chest syndrome.

### How I treat the older adult with sickle cell disease [^116Ruy3S]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

With increasing survival, cumulative complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), which develop insidiously over time, are becoming more apparent and common in older patients, particularly those in their fifth decade and beyond. The older patient is also more likely to develop other age-related nonsickle conditions that interact and add to the disease morbidity. A common misconception is that any symptom in a SCD patient is attributable to their SCD and this may lead to delays in diagnosis and appropriate intervention. We recommend regular comprehensive reviews and monitoring for early signs of organ damage and a low threshold for the use of hydroxyurea and blood transfusions as preventative measures for end-organ disease. Treatable comorbidities and acute deterioration should be managed aggressively. Although the primary goal in management of the older adult with SCD is improving anemia and minimizing organ damage, the time has come for us to be more proactive in considering curative therapies previously offered to the younger patient. Curative or experimental interventions should be discussed early, before complications render the patients ineligible for these treatments.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^111zwHLT]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Methodological considerations for screening questions — Test accuracy results informing screening questions were often lacking or, when available, had serious limitations, so the systematic review team identified other data mostly in the form of association studies, and the ASH guideline panel developed a framework to form recommendations based on association studies. The framework was informed by the GRADE diagnosis EtD framework, the World Health Organization, and the US Preventive Services Task Force, and Table 3 summarizes the framework and the criteria used to determine when screening is justified. The panel used 2 criteria for a screening test to be considered: (1) the panel must have high certainty that individuals with a positive screening test would receive different management than those with a negative test and (2) the panel must have high certainty that there is an effective treatment or management for the condition that improves outcomes if administered earlier than when the condition is clinically apparent.

Management of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children is based on a series of clinical trials. The trial by Sinha and colleagues in this issue is 1 of many needed to improve the evidence base for induction and maintenance therapies in this population. While key questions remain about identifying the appropriate therapy for each patient, clinical trials provide an opportunity to extend evidence-based practice that minimizes toxicity and optimizes patient health.

### The glomerulopathy of sickle cell disease [^113CNA7y]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Table III
Evaluation and Treatment of Albuminuria in Sickle Cell Disease

Therapies that improve RBC survival, such as hydroxyurea, or those that improve endothelial function may be beneficial. In a retrospective study, three HbSS children with nephrotic range proteinuria on treatment with enalapril had a near-normal urine protein-creatinine ratio following the addition of hydroxyurea. Further observational studies suggest that hydroxyurea may reduce albuminuria and slow the development of hyperfiltration. Young age at start of chronic RBC transfusion has also been suggested to provide protection against the development of albuminuria, although there are no controlled studies in this setting.

As nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents can produce significant declines in the rates of glomerular filtration and renal blood flow in SCD, and can increase the rate of progression to ESRD, these agents should be used with caution in patients with evidence of glomerulopathy. In addition, effective treatment of hypertension has been reported to delay the progression to ESRD in SCD patients, and careful attention to blood pressure control is important in these patients. Despite reports of relative hypertension and its possible association with renal insufficiency as well as other complications, there are no guidelines for its treatment in patients with SCD. SCD patients can generally be treated like other adults with hypertension, although diuretics should be used with caution to avoid dehydration, which may precipitate acute painful episodes in these patients.

In SCD patients who develop ESRD, renal replacement therapies (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) as well as renal transplantation are available treatment modalities. Predialysis nephrology care in patients with ESRD is associated with a lower death rate compared with those not receiving such care, and early referral to a nephrologist is recommended. While some reports have indicated poor allograft survival as well as a variety of disease-specific problems, others have found graft and patient survival rates comparable to those of other nondiabetic ESRD patients. Short-term allograft results have been reported to be comparable in SCD patients and age-matched African-American kidney transplant recipients with other causes of ESRD, although there was a somewhat shorter cadaveric graft survival and a greater adjusted 3-year risk of graft loss in SCD patients beyond 1 year. Furthermore, there was a trend toward improved survival when renal transplantation was compared to chronic dialysis in patients with ESRD secondary to sickle cell nephropathy.

Preexisting endothelial dysfunction and vascular injury sustained during allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) increases risk for endothelial injury-related complications such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We report two patients with SCD who developed PRES following allogeneic HCT. In both patients, PRES-related symptoms resolved only after a diagnosis of TA-TMA was established and eculizumab therapy was initiated. Renal manifestations at diagnosis included non-nephrotic range proteinuria and hypertension. This report highlights the importance of screening PRES-affected SCD HCT recipients for TA-TMA as usual treatment strategies may be inadequate.

Case 2

A 12-year-old White male, who had also been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, sought treatment for a 20-day history of non-productive cough and lower limb oedema, which had evolved to anasarca, together with a new onset of hypertension. He had previously experienced one episode of pain and had undergone one transfusion. He reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, he was found to be pallid (+ 3/+ 4) and hypertensive (blood pressure, 160/90 mmHg), with a heart rate of 112 bpm, a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.

Blood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 5.9 g/dl; haematocrit, 17.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; negative result on the Coombs direct antibody test; reticulocyte fraction, 4.26%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 970 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.65 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 17,330 cells/mm³; neutrophil count, 13,100 cells/mm³; lymphocyte count, 1700 cells/mm³; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm³; and urea, 45 mg/dl. He also showed signs of hyperfiltration, with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.65 mg/dl, and an eGFR, as determined with the Schwartz formula, of 140.0 ml/min/1.73 m², although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. An urine sample obtained at submission was found to contain 20 leucocytes/field and > 100 erythrocytes/field; 24-h proteinuria was 12.5 g. Metabolic analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 6.1 g/dl; albumin, 2.6 g/dl; globulins, 3.1 g/dl; total cholesterol, 211 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 118 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 66 mg/dl; triglycerides, 133 mg/dl; C4, 25 mg/dl (normal range, 10–38 mg/dl); C3, 106 mg/dl (normal range, 73–149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 2.1 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Tests for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were also negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and signs of mild pulmonary congestion. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.

Management of hypertension/albuminuria in sickle cell disease — For children and adults with SCD and albuminuria, the ASH guideline panel suggests the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi's) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The initiation of ACEi's and ARBs for patients with SCD requires adequate follow-up and monitoring of side effects. When prescribing ACEi's or ARBs, recommended renal safety steps are to start medication at a lower dose in individuals with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess GFR and measure serum potassium within 1 week of starting medication or following any dose escalation, and temporarily suspend medication during interval illness, planned IV radiocontrast administration, or bowel preparation for colonoscopy or prior to major surgery. The panel did not assess evidence to guide albuminuria screening; Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines state albuminuria should be confirmed by either a first morning urine sample or 2 consecutive untimed urine samples.

What are others saying and what is new in these ASH guidelines — comparative positions for cardiopulmonary and renal care indicate that there is consistency for the recommendation of ACEi therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and evidence of albuminuria, and although the 2014 NHLBI report recommends either renal transplant or dialysis for patients with SCD and end-stage renal disease, the ASH guidelines emphasize a preference for renal transplant. The panel's recommendation against routinely performing screening PFT in asymptomatic children and adults with SCD aligns with the recommendation available in the 2014 NHLBI report, and existing recommendations related to screening for sleep-disordered breathing were not available in the 2014 NHLBI report or elsewhere for direct comparison with our recommendation against routine screening in asymptomatic patients with SCD. Finally, the panel's recommendations for management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in individuals with SCD are aligned with the anticoagulation recommendations for individuals with chronic risk factors discussed in the 2018 ASH Guidelines for Management of VTE: Optimal Management of Anticoagulation Therapy and the 2016 Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report.

### Atypical presentation of acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis in patients with sickle cell disease: report of two cases [^113ADjJJ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute Post-Infectious Glomerulonephritis is a disease that classically affects children among between 4 and 14 years and it occurs most commonly after skin or upper airway infection by group A β-hemolytic streptococci. In its usual course, APIGN presents with lower limb edema, hypertension, haematuria, non-nephrotic proteinuria, however some atypical cases that may progress to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or present with nephrotic proteinuria and/or nephrotic syndrome. There is usually activation of the complement alternative pathway, evidenced by the consumption of C3. APIGN treatment is supportive, with low salt diet, antihypertensive therapy, diuretics, and antibiotic treatment to eradicate the nephritogenic strain. Immunosuppression is only indicated in cases of rapidly progressive course. In both cases we opted for the initiation of ACE inhibitor since the patients did not show progressive worsening of renal function during the event, hydroelectrolytic disorders or significant reduction in urinary volume. In addition, there are some studies showing that the use of ACE inhibitor promoted better blood pressure control compared to other classes of anti- hypertensive. Regarding the use of steroids for treatment, we chose to wait for the biopsy result to follow guided therapy, since both patients were treating infection beyond the fact that they did not present significant worsening of renal function. The disease is usually self-limiting, with clinical resolution and normalization of laboratory tests in about 6–8 weeks. In children with typical clinical features, renal biopsy may be dispensed, however, atypical clinical presentation or non-resolution of clinical and laboratory abnormalities within 8 weeks are indications of renal biopsy. In the presented cases, both patients already had evidence of renal hyperfiltration before acute APIGN (Patient 1: 134.9 ml/min/1,73 m² and Patient 2: 121 ml/min/1,73 m²). In this context of a pre-existing structural change caused by sickle cell anemia, we believe that inflammatory changes would act on glomerular permeability and exacerbate this hyperfiltration and trigger a significant increase overlapping sub-nephrotic proteinuria already commonly observed in patients with APIGN.

Curative therapy

The first step in the treatment of SOS/VOD is symptomatic. Given SOS/VOD is a life-threatening disease, therapy must be started as soon as possible. Fluid and sodium balance and careful use of diuretics (spironolactone or furosemide), should be introduced at the first suspicion, when SOS/VOD is still only probable. Several symptomatic measures can be used to reduce the discomfort produced by massive ascites or pleural effusions, starting with oxygen therapy. In particular, in infants, when massive ascites is threatening respiration via pulmonary displacement, early peritoneocentesis can be extremely helpful to avoid complications associated with assisted ventilation. When fluid accumulation and renal failure cannot be controlled, hemodialysis/hemofiltration is required. Severe SOS/VOD treatment requires transfer into an intensive care unit. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should be discussed for patients with less advanced SOS/VODand hepatic transplantation in most severe diseases. Besides these symptomatic measures for SOS/VOD, the only proven curative treatment so far is DF.

American Society of Hematology 2019 sickle cell disease — evidence and benefit–harm profile for hydroxyurea plus erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chronic kidney disease: Safety was examined in 3 studies (total n = 56), with only 1 of 56 patients (1.8%) experiencing worsening SCD-related symptoms or other adverse events, while hemoglobin improvement was reported in 5 observational studies (total n = 29), including an increase in tagged red blood cell mass in 2 patients and increased hemoglobin in 3 patients. Potential benefits are described as moderate based on a case series (n = 52), and 1 case report showed reduced transfusion needs. Potential harms are probably minimal, with no observed blood clots, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, or hypertension, and the panel notes hemoglobin treatment thresholds may need to be lower in SCD. Despite these signals, the panel concludes the overall certainty in the evidence of effects is very low, emphasizing hydroxyurea's importance while weighing theoretical hyperviscosity risks with careful monitoring.

### Interventions for chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease [^11353YFj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, and increases in prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of any intervention in preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with SCD (including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)), either alone or in combination with each other.

Search Methods

We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 05 April 2016. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 13 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with SCD. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias.

Main Results

We included two trials with 215 participants. One trial was published in 2011 and included 193 children aged 9 months to 18 months, and compared treatment with hydroxyurea to placebo. The second trial was published in 1998 and included 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria and compared ACEI to placebo. We rated the quality of evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials having: a high or unclear risk of bias including attrition and detection bias; indirectness (the available evidence was for children aged 9 months to 18 months in one trial and a small and select adult sample size in a second trial); and imprecise outcome effect estimates of significant benefit or harm. Hydroxyurea versus placebo We are very uncertain if hydroxyurea reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease (assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate), or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged 9 to 18 months, mean difference (MD) 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76 (mL/min per 1.73 m²)) (one study; 142 participants; very low-quality evidence). In children aged 9 to 18 months, hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine, MD 42.23 (95% CI 12.14 to 72.32 (mOsm/kg)) (one study; 178 participants; low-quality evidence). Hydroxyurea may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events including: incidence of acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.39 (99% CI 0.13 to 1.16); painful crisis, RR 0.68 (99% CI 0.45 to 1.02); and hospitalisations, RR 0.83 (99% CI 0.68 to 1.01) (one study, 193 participants; low-quality evidence). No deaths occurred in the trial. Quality of life was not reported. ACEI versus placeboWe are very uncertain if ACEI reduces proteinuria in adults with SCD who have normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria, MD -49.00 (95% CI -124.10 to 26.10 (mg per day)) (one study; 22 participants; very low-quality evidence). We are very uncertain if ACEI reduce or prevent kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance. The authors state that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but no comparative data were provided (very low-quality evidence). All-cause mortality, serious adverse events and quality of life were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

In young children aged 9 months to 18 months, we are very uncertain if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration, but it may improve young children's ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference on the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises and hospitalisations. We are very uncertain if giving ACEI to adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications. This review identified no trials that looked at red cell transfusions nor any combinations of interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on the management of either children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately-designed and powered studies, and no ongoing trials which address this critical question. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEI or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction kidney complications in people with SCD.

### The glomerulopathy of sickle cell disease [^111q2nEJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) produces many structural and functional abnormalities in the kidney, including glomerular abnormalities. Albuminuria is the most common manifestation of glomerular damage, with a prevalence between 26 and 68% in adult patients. The pathophysiology of albuminuria in SCD is likely multifactorial, with contributions from hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertension, ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and endothelial dysfunction. Although its natural history in SCD remains inadequately defined, albuminuria is associated with increased echocardiography-derived tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, systemic blood pressure, and hypertension, as well as history of stroke, suggesting a shared vasculopathic pathophysiology. While most patients with albuminuria are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, there are no published long-term data on the efficacy of these agents. With the improved patient survival following kidney transplantation, SCD patients with end-stage renal disease should be considered for this treatment modality. Given the high prevalence of albuminuria and its association with multiple SCD-related clinical complications, additional studies are needed to answer several clinically important questions in a bid to adequately elucidate its pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment.

### How I approach disease-modifying therapy in children with sickle cell disease in an era of novel therapies [^1135sPRp]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, after decades of stagnation, the therapeutic landscape for sickle cell disease (SCD) is changing with an increasing number of novel therapeutics. Hydroxyurea remains the primary disease-modifying therapy and, when started early in life with maintenance of an optimal dose, can reduce many SCD-related complications. To complement hydroxyurea, there are a growing number of pharmacologic options with additional efforts focused on the development and optimization of curative therapies. Here, we review current treatment options and provide recommendations as to how to approach the treatment of children and adolescents within this evolving therapeutic landscape to allow for full and healthy lives.

### The nephropathy of sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease [^115Q37LB]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Sickle cell syndromes, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait, are associated with multiple kidney abnormalities. Young patients with SCD have elevated effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, which decrease to normal ranges in young adulthood and subnormal levels with advancing age. The pathophysiology of SCD-related nephropathy is multifactorial - oxidative stress, hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension are all contributing factors. Albuminuria, which is an early clinical manifestation of glomerular damage, is common in individuals with SCD. Kidney function declines more rapidly in individuals with SCD than in those with sickle cell trait or in healthy individuals. Multiple genetic modifiers, including APOL1, HMOX1, HBA1 and HBA2 variants are also implicated in the development and progression of SCD-related nephropathy. Chronic kidney disease and rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate are associated with increased mortality in adults with SCD. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are the standard of care treatment for albuminuria in SCD, despite a lack of controlled studies demonstrating their long-term efficacy. Multiple studies of novel therapeutic agents are ongoing, and patients with SCD and kidney failure should be evaluated for kidney transplantation. Given the high prevalence and severe consequences of kidney disease, additional studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology, natural history and treatment of SCD-related nephropathy.

### Interventions for chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease [^111XqS3Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, is caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta-globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Kidney disease is a frequent and potentially severe complication in people with SCD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than three months. Sickle cell nephropathy refers to the spectrum of kidney complications in SCD. Glomerular damage is a cause of microalbuminuria and can develop at an early age in children with SCD, with increased prevalence in adulthood. In people with sickle cell nephropathy, outcomes are poor as a result of the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency. Up to 12% of people who develop sickle cell nephropathy will develop end-stage renal disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Possible interventions include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), either alone or in combination.

Search Methods

We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two other trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD. We applied no restrictions related to outcomes examined, language, or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE).

Main Results

We included three RCTs with 385 participants. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology, downgrading for risk of bias concerns, indirectness, and imprecision. Hydroxyurea versus placebo One RCT published in 2011 compared hydroxyurea to placebo in 193 children aged nine to 18 months. We are unsure if hydroxyurea compared to placebo reduces or prevents progression of kidney disease assessed by change in glomerular filtration rate (mean difference (MD) 0.58 mL/min /1.73 m², 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.60 to 15.76; 142 participants; very low certainty). Hydroxyurea compared to placebo may improve the ability to concentrate urine (MD 42.23 mOsm/kg, 95% CI 12.14 to 72.32; 178 participants; low certainty), and may make little or no difference to SCD-related serious adverse events, including acute chest syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 99% CI 0.13 to 1.16; 193 participants; low certainty), painful crisis (RR 0.68, 99% CI 0.45 to 1.02; 193 participants; low certainty); and hospitalisations (RR 0.83, 99% CI 0.68 to 1.01; 193 participants; low certainty). No deaths occurred in either trial arm and the RCT did not report quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo One RCT published in 1998 compared an ACEI (captopril) to placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if captopril compared to placebo reduces proteinuria (MD -49.00 mg/day, 95% CI -124.10 to 26.10; 22 participants; very low certainty). We are unsure if captopril reduces or prevents kidney disease as measured by creatinine clearance; the trial authors stated that creatinine clearance remained constant over six months in both groups, but provided no comparative data (very low certainty). The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus vitamin C One RCT published in 2020 compared an ACEI (lisinopril) with vitamin C in 170 children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. It reported no data we could analyse. We are unsure if lisinopril compared to vitamin C reduces proteinuria in this population: the large drop in microalbuminuria in both arms of the trial after only one month on treatment may have been due to an overestimation of microalbuminuria at baseline rather than a true effect. The RCT did not report serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if ACEI compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No RCTs assessed red blood cell transfusions or any combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD. We have identified a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although we found four ongoing trials since the last version of this review. Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Trials of hydroxyurea, ACEIs or red blood cell transfusion in older children and adults are urgently needed to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^113Yg122]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 sickle cell disease — blood pressure management in adults recommends a blood pressure goal of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg over ≤ 140/90 mm Hg (strong recommendation, moderate certainty), notes that no identified studies reported any of the outcomes of interest in relationship to different strategies of blood pressure control, and that the evidence reviewed included a total of 5 observational studies (total n = 4495) including both children and adults; one study suggested that a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic 70 to 89 mm Hg defines relative systemic hypertension in SCD that is associated with increased risk of PH and renal dysfunction; remarks state there is a lack of evidence to suggest that blood pressure goals should differ for individuals with and without SCD and that the impact of hypertension on patient-important outcomes for African American individuals requires adherence to guidelines developed for the general population independent of having SCD; potential benefits of targeting ≤ 130/80 are based on indirect evidence from the general population showing decreases in cardiovascular mortality, stroke, major cardiovascular events, and heart failure, while potential harms are small and may include hypotension, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, drug interactions, and other side effects.

In contrast to the chronic nephropathy associated with sickle cell syndromes, acute renal failure and multiorgan dysfunction caused by acute sickling crisis are encountered infrequently. The authors present the first case of extensive multiorgan failure during a sickling episode in a patient with sickle/beta+thalassemia. The authors also review the interaction of the thalassemias with sickle cell disease and outline the distinctive course of their patient in comparison with previous reports.

### The glomerulopathy of sickle cell disease [^115PGHm4]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment

Improved medical care for individuals with SCD has prolonged their survival, resulting in an increased prevalence of end-organ damage. Albuminuria occurs more commonly with increasing age and may progress to ESRD. Progression to ESRD is often preceded by increasing proteinuria, worsening anemia, and/or the appearance of hypertension. There are no large, controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of any interventions for albuminuria in SCD. However, treatment of 10 HbSS patients who had proteinuria (0.8–10.8 g/day) with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, for 2 weeks decreased the rate of urinary protein excretion in all patients at the end of the treatment period. This observation was confirmed in a 6-month study in eight HbSS patients with albuminuria. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 22 HbSS patients with microalbuminuria, treatment with captopril resulted in a decrease in microalbuminuria from baseline, while an increase in microalbuminuria was observed in the placebo group. Based on these limited data, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers have become the "standard of care" for the treatment of albuminuria in SCD (Table III). However, adequately powered controlled studies of these agents are required to evaluate whether they can halt the progression of SCD glomerulopathy and subsequent chronic kidney disease. Hyperkalemia and renal tubular acidosis may occur as manifestations of SCD nephropathy and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may increase the likelihood of hyperkalemia. As such, other effective agents without this side effect are needed in patients with albuminuria. Angiotensin receptor blocking agents are increasingly used instead of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors because of their improved tolerability, although there are no published data in SCD to date. Two clinical trials of the angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan, are ongoing (NCT01989078, NCT01479439).

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^114zPPRM]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for albuminuria in sickle cell disease (SCD) are supported by very low certainty evidence, with the panel stating that there is very low certainty of evidence for a net health benefit among children and adults with SCD and albuminuria; however, treatment is justified given the potential for decreasing risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease through reduction of albuminuria and a favorable side-effect profile. Safety observations included that no hypotension was reported with either ACEi or ARB therapy, while in 1 randomized controlled trial and 4 observational studies assessing potassium (total n = 92), potassium was elevated in 12 of 92 patients (13%); in 3 observational studies of renal function (total n = 140), two found no significant change and one showed a slower decline in estimated GFR that disappeared after adjusting for hydroxyurea use, and although no angioedema was reported, its incidence in SCD patients receiving ACEi's or ARBs is expected to be similar to that in the general African American population. The effect of ACEi's/ARBs on reducing the risk of end-stage renal disease is unknown for patients with SCD, but implementation was judged feasible and acceptable given low costs, low monitoring needs, once daily dosing that could enhance adherence, availability of generics, and provider familiarity. Research priorities include prospective studies to define the temporal relationship between moderate albuminuria (30–300 mg/g) and progression to severe albuminuria (> 300 mg/g) in SCD.

### Natural history and variability in albuminuria in pediatric and murine sickle cell anemia [^115LEyms]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and patients who progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) experience a high mortality. Albuminuria is a well-established risk factor for progression to ESKD and early mortality. However, currently the SCA field is lacking longitudinal studies from birth through adulthood to confirm the association of early albuminuria with ESKD and mortality. Of concern, data show that ∼20% of adolescent patients with SCA develop albuminuria and 20% of patients with sickle cell who develop ESKD are aged < 30 years. Furthermore, patients with SCA who progress to ESKD are at an increased risk for early mortality and experience disparities in access to renal transplantation. With the observation of established pathophysiology in other diseases that albuminuria progresses to ESKD, experts in SCA continue to emphasize the need to prevent the development and progression of albuminuria as a vital component of care.

Several guidelines highlighted monitoring and treating albuminuria as a key component of care; however, each guideline cited a lack of evidence to describe the natural history of the progression to CKD in SCA. The current National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Evidence-Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease provides a consensus opinion suggesting that annual screening for albuminuria in patients with SCA should begin by the age of 10 years. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) Sickle Cell Guidelines for cardiopulmonary renal complications, based on very low certainty in the evidence regarding effects, suggest initiating therapeutic interventions for patients with albuminuria. Finally, the ASH/U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expert panel on clinical trial end points suggests using a percent decline in albuminuria as an end point for future SCA trials. Of concern, these guidelines discussed limited evidence in patients with SCA and relied heavily on extrapolating findings from studies of albuminuria in non-SCA populations. Therefore, it is critical that evidence from patients with SCA confirms these opinions and suggestions for the diagnosis and management of albuminuria.

American Society of Hematology guideline scope and methods — The purpose of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations for cardiopulmonary and renal complications of SCD. The target audience includes patients, hematologists, general internists, other clinicians, and decision-makers. Policy makers interested in these guidelines include those involved in developing local, national, or international approaches with the goal of improving the lives of people living with SCD. This document may also serve as the basis for adaptation by local, regional, or national guideline panels. The guideline panel developed and graded the recommendations and assessed the certainty of the supporting evidence following the GRADE approach. The overall guideline development process, including funding of the work, panel formation, management of conflicts of interest, internal and external review, and organizational approval, was guided by ASH policies and procedures derived from the GIN-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist (http://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidecheck.html) and was intended to meet recommendations for trustworthy guidelines by the Institute of Medicine and the GIN.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^116BbXTZ]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

In this modern era with rapid advances in the treatment of SCA, whether pharmacological or genetic, we must remain mindful of the safe and broadly effective disease-modifying therapy provided by hydroxyurea - now with the express goal of preventing chronic organ damage that can develop while awaiting genetic or curative therapy. Simultaneously, we must modernize our use of hydroxyurea and not continue to prescribe it as we did several decades ago. The greater risk, by far, is under-treatment of a severe and unforgiving disease. Hydroxyurea should be offered much more widely and at optimal doses, ideally using precision dosing. As we have opined about hydroxyurea: do not leave for tomorrow what you can do today; prescribe it early and often.

### Baseline characteristics of Ghanaian children and adults enrolled in PIVOT, a randomised clinical trial of hydroxyurea in HbSC disease in sub-saharan Africa [^114emhrQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria is a recommended clinical trial end‐point for organ dysfunction in SCD, but evidence of sickle nephropathy with microalbuminuria was present in only a few children and adults enrolled in PIVOT. Our results are slightly lower than a previous cross‐sectional study at KBTH in which 9% of children with HbSC had proteinuria. Our methods were semi‐quantitative and unable to determine a precise urine albumin/creatine ratio. The rate of macroalbuminuria detectable by urine dipstick is often lower in HbSC than in HbSS and increases with age. In children with HbSC in high‐income countries, macroalbuminuria occurred in only 1%–2%, whilst macroalbuminuria was identified in 10%–20% of adults with HbSC. Overt renal failure can occur in HbSC, but the prevalence, cumulative incidence, and progression of albuminuria in HbSC is poorly defined. Even if hydroxyurea cannot reverse existing glomerular damage, early treatment might decrease sickling within the kidney and slow the development of proteinuria.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^111rPQKB]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy — evidence and panel judgment indicate that indirect evidence from a meta-analysis suggests benefit in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) for several PAH drug classes, but applicability to SCD is uncertain, and harms were considered moderate from limited trials; in the only completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) in SCD, sildenafil was stopped early due to more pain hospitalizations in the treatment arm. The panel concluded that the balance of benefits vs harms is against PAH‑specific therapy in individuals with SCD without PAH confirmed by right-heart catheterization, while the balance probably favors PAH‑specific therapy when PAH is confirmed by right-heart catheterization; overall certainty was rated low for sildenafil and very low for other PAH‑specific or disease‑modifying therapies, with only 2 RCTs and 5 observational studies and additional concerns about imprecision and indirectness.

To address the global burden of sickle cell disease and the need for novel therapies, the American Society of Hematology partnered with the US Food and Drug Administration to engage the work of 7 panels of clinicians, investigators, and patients to develop consensus recommendations for clinical trial end points. The panels conducted their work through literature reviews, assessment of available evidence, and expert judgment focusing on end points related to patient-reported outcome, pain (non-patient-reported outcomes), the brain, end-organ considerations, biomarkers, measurement of cure, and low-resource settings. This article presents the findings and recommendations of the end-organ considerations, measurement of cure, and low-resource settings panels as well as relevant findings and recommendations from the biomarkers panel.

B. Post systematic review RCTs and observational studies

One double-blind RCT(N = 193) was conducted in 13 centres in the United States. It enrolled children aged 9–18 months with HbSS (homozygous type of SCA) or Hb S/ β-thalassaemia irrespective of clinical severity. HU was administered as a standard dose of 20 mg/kg without escalating to maximum tolerated dose. The primary end points were changes in spleen and renal function. There were no significant differences between the HU and the placebo groups in these end points: 19 of 70 (27%) patients had decreased spleen function at exit in the HU group versus 28 of 74 (38%) patients in the placebo group (mean difference −11%, 95% CI −26% to 5%, p = 0.21) and a difference in the mean increase in the diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid glomerular filtration rate in the HU group versus the placebo group of 2 mL/min per 1.73 m², 95% CI −16 to 20, p = 0.84. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes was rated as low (table 2).

Data relevant to the critical and important outcomes that are the subject of this review are drawn from the two multicentre RCTs and 14 observational studies, and are summarised below.

Mortality

Two studies reported on this outcome; in the RCT there were no deaths in the 24 months of follow-up. Nzouakou et al (n = 123) reported four deaths in a retrospective cohort study during follow-up, though the patients had stopped taking HU 1–5 years before their deaths. The deaths were attributed to toxic shock, severe vaso-occlusive crises, heart failure and non-specified cardiac failure.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^112GvvWz]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Goals of treatment

The purpose of hydroxyurea treatment should be maximized therapeutic benefits, which are pleiotropic. By using a fixed, low dose of hydroxyurea or titrating the dose to a partial clinical effect (e.g. earliest detectable reduction in painful episodes or subjective improvement), the opportunity to prevent or mitigate chronic organ injury is likely lost. As previously discussed, the overt complications of SCA considered when assessing "clinical effect" represent only a fraction of the disease morbidity. A choice to focus mainly on decreasing overt manifestations of the disease is also a choice to discount the insidious and inexorable progression of organ injury, which often becomes apparent only in adulthood. As an analogy, one would not treat hypertension with the lowest dose needed to prevent hypertensive encephalopathy; rather, treatment is titrated to normalize the condition and prevent or mitigate as much disease-related morbidity as possible. Accordingly, the goal of hydroxyurea therapy should be to minimize or prevent all SCA complications, both overt and covert, and improve quality of life.

### The glomerulopathy of sickle cell disease [^115B5im5]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of albuminuria in SCD increases with age, varying between 4.5 and 26% in patients up to 21 years, and between 26 and 68% in older patients. Although a prospective, 25-year case-control study reported that 9 of 21 HbSS patients with nephrotic syndrome developed chronic renal failure, the natural history of albuminuria in SCD remains inadequately defined. A small study of 38 patients, 30 of whom had microalbuminuria and eight with macroalbuminuria, showed progression of albuminuria in two patients with microalbuminuria and two patients with macroalbuminuria after approximately 20 months of follow-up. In a retrospective study of 14 patients, with estimated GFR at the time of kidney biopsy ranging from 24 to 158 mL/min per m² and urine albumin excretion at the time of kidney biopsy ranging from 0.4 to 33 g/day, seven patients had chronic kidney disease and three patients required chronic intermittent hemodialysis due to ESRD after an average follow-up of 28 months (range, 4–79 months). Evaluation for proteinuria was only available in 12 patients, and a decrease in urinary protein was noted in 67% of patients treated with ATII receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In a more recent retrospective, single center study of 98 SCD patients, grade A3 albuminuria (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–24.3; P = 0.0480) and each 1 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure (adjusted OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.0–1.07; P = 0.039) were associated with the development and progression of chronic kidney disease on multivariate analysis after 5 years of follow-up. In this study, grade A3 proteinuria was defined as a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg/g, based on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guidelines.

### Sickle cell disease and CKD: an update [^115ZBFxf]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is an inherited red blood cell disorder that affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States and 25 million people worldwide. Vaso-occlusion and chronic hemolysis lead to dysfunction of vital organ systems, with the kidneys being among the most commonly affected organs.

Summary

Early renal manifestations include medullary ischemia with the loss of urine-concentrating ability and hyperfiltration. This can be followed by progressive damage characterized by persistent albuminuria and a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. The risk of sickle nephropathy is greater in those with the APOL1 G1 and G2 kidney risk variants and variants in HMOX1 and lower in those that coinherit α-thalassemia. Therapies to treat sickle cell disease-related kidney damage focus on sickle cell disease-modifying therapies (e.g., hydroxyurea) or those adopted from the nonsickle cell disease kidney literature (e.g., renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors), although data on their clinical efficacy are limited to small studies with short follow-up periods. Kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease improves survival compared to hemodialysis but is underutilized in this patient population.

Key Messages

Kidney disease is a major contributor to early mortality, and more research is needed to understand the pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies to improve kidney health in sickle cell disease.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^116Ryknn]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Management of abnormal echocardiography in sickle cell disease — For asymptomatic children and adults with SCD and an isolated peak TRV of ≥ 2.5 to 2.9 m/s, the ASH guideline panel suggests against right-heart catheterization. For children and adults with SCD and a peak TRV of ≥ 2.5 m/s who also have a reduced 6MWD and/or elevated NT-BNP, the ASH guideline panel suggests right-heart catheterization. Repeating ECHOs documenting elevated peak TRV are important prior to referral for right-heart catheterization under the guidance of a PH expert. Remarks note that NT-BNP value of ≥ 160 pg/mL and 6MWD values of < 333 m represent reasonable thresholds for adults with SCD; for patients with peak TRV of ≥ 2.5 m/s who have normal 6MWD and NT-BNP, serial noninvasive monitoring with ECHOs should be considered if clinically indicated; and consultation should be considered for patients with TRV of > 2.9 m/s who have normal 6MWD and NT-BNP. PH is defined hemodynamically by right-heart catheterization using a mean pulmonary artery pressure threshold of > 20 mm Hg, with additional PAH criteria including pulmonary artery wedge pressure of ≤ 15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance of ≥ 3 Wood units (240 dyn × seconds × cm⁻⁵).

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^112muCE4]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Prevention and management of end-organ disease represent major challenges facing providers of children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Uncertainty and variability in the screening, diagnosis, and management of cardiopulmonary and renal complications in SCD lead to varying outcomes for affected individuals.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about screening, diagnosis, and management of cardiopulmonary and renal complications of SCD.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 2 patient representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews up to September 2017. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE evidence-to-decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of cardiopulmonary and renal complications of SCD. Recommendations related to anticoagulation duration for adults with SCD and venous thromboembolism were also developed.

Conclusions

Most recommendations were conditional due to a paucity of direct, high-quality evidence for outcomes of interest. Future research was identified, including the need for prospective studies to better understand the natural history of cardiopulmonary and renal disease, their relationship to patient-important outcomes, and optimal management.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^111mmo9a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

### Management of liver complications in sickle cell disease [^116TGBBb]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Liver disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite this, the natural history of liver disease is not well characterized and the evidence basis for specific therapeutic intervention is not robust. The spectrum of clinical liver disease encountered includes asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function; acute deteriorations in liver function, sometimes with a dramatic clinical phenotype; and decompensated chronic liver disease. In this paper, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of patients with acute and chronic liver disease will be outlined. Advice will be given regarding initial assessment and investigation. The evidence for specific medical and surgical interventions will be reviewed, and management recommendations made for each specific clinical presentation. The potential role for liver transplantation will be considered in detail.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^1124fvJm]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Blood pressure management in adults with sickle cell disease — The panel states the balance of benefits vs harms favors the intervention targeting a blood pressure goal of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg, and the overall certainty in the evidence was considered to be moderate based on indirect evidence from the general population for outcomes related to intensive vs standard blood pressure targets. The panel determined that there is very low certainty of evidence for a net health benefit related to patient-important outcomes associated with maintaining a blood pressure of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg in adults with SCD, and also felt that there was no compelling reason that blood pressure goals should be different for individuals with SCD vs the general population. The panel identified research needs including studies to define treatment thresholds and targets, implementation studies to evaluate adherence to guidelines, and prospective studies on the natural history of blood pressure changes and mechanisms underlying blood pressure regulation in children and adults with SCD.
