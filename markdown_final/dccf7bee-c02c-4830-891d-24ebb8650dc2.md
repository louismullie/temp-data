## Question

Is a 200 mg dose of Seroquel XR adequate for maintenance therapy in bipolar depression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether 200 mg of Seroquel XR (quetiapine extended-release) is adequate for maintenance therapy in bipolar depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA labeling and what doses are actually approved for bipolar depression and for maintenance in bipolar disorder. Then, I should verify the randomized controlled trial evidence, particularly the dose ranges studied for acute bipolar depression and for maintenance. Next, I will review major guidelines to see if they specify doses for maintenance or allow dose reductions. After that, I need to consider pharmacologic rationale that might support or argue against 200 mg for maintenance. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and outline practical clinical actions, including exceptions if any, with appropriate monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory labeling to anchor the discussion, because if 200 mg is below labeled maintenance ranges, that already sets a strong boundary. The FDA-prescribing information for quetiapine ER in bipolar depression specifies a titration to 300 mg by Day 4, with 300 mg/day as both the recommended and maximum dose for the depressive episode indication, and it lists 300 mg/day as the maintenance dose for that indication, which means 200 mg would be below the labeled maintenance dose for bipolar depression [^115GbAZU] [^112GpSHL]. I should also check the labeling for general bipolar maintenance and for mania, because those may inform the mood-stabilizing dose band; for maintenance in bipolar disorder and for manic/mixed episodes, the labeled maintenance range is 400–800 mg/day ER, which again places 200 mg below any labeled maintenance range in bipolar disorder overall [^113T3Uza] [^1162W81S]. Wait, let me verify I'm not conflating immediate-release and extended-release tables; yes, these references are specifically for the ER formulation where maintenance for bipolar depression is 300 mg/day and general bipolar maintenance is 400–800 mg/day ER, so 200 mg sits under both thresholds [^115GbAZU] [^113T3Uza].

> Next, I should review the acute bipolar depression RCT evidence to see what doses were actually efficacious, because maintenance choices are usually tethered to acute-response dosing. The pivotal trials for acute bipolar depression, including EMBOLDEN II, demonstrated efficacy at 300 mg/day and 600 mg/day, with no added benefit of 600 mg over 300 mg on core depression outcomes, and importantly, they did not test 200 mg/day as a target therapeutic dose for the depressive episode itself [^117Y6dNh]. Similarly, XR monotherapy trials in acute bipolar depression used 300 mg/day as the effective fixed dose and showed separation from placebo from Week 1 onward, again not utilizing 200 mg/day as a maintenance or target dose, and placing 200 mg outside the studied efficacious range in acute bipolar depression [^1167ykot] [^1173xtv9]. Hold on, let me double-check the older immediate-release bipolar depression trial too; it likewise studied 300 mg/day and 600 mg/day, not 200 mg/day, aligning with the same effective window [^117ETyJf].

> I will now examine maintenance-phase evidence, because dose requirements for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder may differ from acute-phase dosing. The largest maintenance studies for quetiapine involved combination therapy with lithium or divalproex and utilized 400–800 mg/day ER with significant prevention of recurrence across mood poles over up to 104 weeks, indicating that when quetiapine is used to maintain stability, studied doses have sat at or above 400 mg/day in combination regimens rather than as low as 200 mg/day [^113u9r4D] [^1144XuPM]. Wait, I should verify whether any randomized maintenance study specifically evaluated 200 mg/day for bipolar depression; I can't find a major RCT targeting 200 mg/day for maintenance in bipolar depression, and the only signal for doses near 200 mg appears in acute, comorbidity-focused trials, not in maintenance designs, which does not establish 200 mg as an evidence-based maintenance target [^112hw83C] [^1128a7yD].

> But wait, what if lower doses are "good enough" based on dose–response meta-analysis for acute bipolar depression; am I prematurely ruling out 200 mg? A meta-analysis comparing lower versus higher doses of selected second-generation antipsychotics in acute bipolar depression found no additional benefit at higher doses, but the "lower dose" band for quetiapine in those analyses still included 300 mg/day rather than 200 mg/day, so extrapolating down to 200 mg is not supported by those data; I almost concluded that "lower is fine", but I should correct that inference since 200 mg was not the lower-dose boundary in that literature [^112km4rE].

> Next, I should review contemporary guidelines and see if any endorse 200 mg for maintenance or explicitly allow dose relaxation to that level. The VA/DoD guideline recommends quetiapine as a maintenance option for preventing recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes, and also supports combinations such as quetiapine plus lithium or valproate, but it does not specify or endorse a 200 mg maintenance dose, aligning with FDA labeling and trial evidence rather than with a sub-300 mg approach [^114Sibcw] [^116xoXvR]. The AAFP review likewise lists quetiapine among first-line maintenance options without specifying a 200 mg target, implying adherence to labeled and trial-based dose ranges for ongoing therapy [^115YhL1h]. CANMAT/ISBD notes that doses may be lowered somewhat in maintenance to address tolerability, but it does not provide evidence that 200 mg/day is an efficacious maintenance dose for bipolar depression, and any such dose reduction should be tempered by the absence of supportive maintenance data at 200 mg/day [^115m8nwC] [^112rsK5c]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not missing a maintenance-dose table in those guidelines; I do not see endorsement of 200 mg/day for maintenance bipolar depression in these documents [^114Sibcw] [^115YhL1h].

> I need to consider pharmacologic plausibility because it may clarify why 300 mg/day has been the floor in trials and labeling. Quetiapine's clinical effects relate to a complex profile including D2 and 5-HT2A antagonism and norquetiapine's activity; dose correlates with D2 receptor occupancy, and while the exact plasma level–occupancy–response relationship is not crisply defined, lower daily doses generally yield lower D2 engagement, which may undermine mood-stabilizing and antimanic properties that become relevant in maintenance settings [^113owziY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought about specifying an exact D2 occupancy threshold at 300 mg/day, but I should avoid over-precision here because the review notes a dose–occupancy correlation without defining a neat therapeutic plasma range, so I will stick to the more cautious interpretation that 200 mg/day likely yields less dopaminergic engagement than doses with established maintenance efficacy in trials [^113owziY]. I should also flag that case reports describe low-dose quetiapine inducing or worsening hypomania/mania, reminding us that subtherapeutic mood-stabilizing exposure can carry risk in bipolar populations if downward titration overshoots the effective threshold [^117KJP3L].

> I will now synthesize the 200 mg/day question directly against the evidence. 200 mg/day is below all FDA-labeled maintenance doses for bipolar disorder and below the labeled maintenance dose for the bipolar depressive episode indication, it has not been established as an efficacious dose for maintenance in randomized trials, and supportive acute data at doses near 200 mg/day come from short-term, comorbidity-focused, or uncontrolled designs that are not adequate to ground a maintenance recommendation for bipolar depression; taken together, this argues that 200 mg/day should not be considered adequate for standard maintenance therapy in bipolar depression [^115GbAZU] [^112GpSHL] [^113T3Uza] [^112hw83C] [^1128a7yD]. Hold on, I should verify whether adjunctive maintenance would make 200 mg reasonable; even as adjunct to lithium or divalproex, the key maintenance RCTs used 400–800 mg/day, so 200 mg/day as adjunct lacks direct evidence as well, and the comparative effectiveness literature indicating quetiapine can be comparable to lithium pertains to standard dosing ranges rather than sub-300 mg maintenance [^113u9r4D] [^1144XuPM] [^111jko4W].

> Let me consider exceptions, because clinical care is not one-size-fits-all. If a patient cannot tolerate 300 mg/day due to sedation, orthostasis, or metabolic effects, a pragmatic, individualized, off-label attempt at 200 mg/day could be considered with explicit documentation of rationale, but it should be framed as a suboptimal dose with increased relapse risk and paired with close monitoring and a low threshold to re-escalate, especially given the lack of maintenance efficacy data at 200 mg/day and the potential for destabilization at lower dopamine engagement [^113owziY] [^117KJP3L]. I should also review alternatives with better tolerability profiles or established maintenance roles for depressive polarity, such as lurasidone for acute bipolar depression and lamotrigine for maintenance prevention, both supported by high-quality evidence and guideline endorsement, which can help either replace or complement quetiapine if dose-limiting adverse effects emerge at or above 300 mg/day [^111M7pCo] [^113MfWrV] [^1167QH1L] [^116xoXvR]. Wait, I should not mix MDD labeling into bipolar decisions; although quetiapine XR has 150–300 mg/day dosing in MDD adjunctive indications, that MDD range does not establish adequacy for bipolar maintenance and should not be misapplied to bipolar depression maintenance targets [^1157TTWQ].

> Final check and recommendation: I should double-check the labels one more time to ensure internal consistency with the conclusion, and they do corroborate 300 mg/day as the maintenance dose for the bipolar depressive indication and 400–800 mg/day for general bipolar maintenance, leaving 200 mg/day below labeled and evidence-based maintenance dosing for bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression [^115GbAZU] [^113T3Uza]. Therefore, my bottom line is that 200 mg/day of Seroquel XR is not considered adequate for standard maintenance therapy in bipolar depression; if used at all, it should be reserved for exceptional, closely monitored, and explicitly off-label scenarios, with a plan to optimize dose or pivot to alternative maintenance strategies if early warning signs of relapse appear [^115GbAZU] [^114Sibcw] [^113MfWrV] [^111M7pCo].

---

In general, 200 mg of Seroquel XR is **insufficient for maintenance** of bipolar depression because the FDA-approved [^115GbAZU] and guideline-supported [^115YhL1h] maintenance dose is 300 mg daily [^112GpSHL]. While 200 mg may help some patients with milder symptoms or tolerability issues, **it is not the standard maintenance dose** and may increase relapse risk. If 300 mg is not tolerated, consider combination therapy or alternative agents, and monitor closely for relapse [^116xoXvR] [^114gzNYy].

---

## Recommended maintenance dose of seroquel xr

- **FDA-approved maintenance dose**: 300 mg daily [^115GbAZU] [^115YhL1h].
- **Recommended titration**: 50 mg on day 1, 100 mg on day 2, 200 mg on day 3, and 300 mg on day 4 [^115GbAZU].
- **Maximum recommended dose**: 300 mg daily [^112GpSHL].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 300 mg maintenance dose

Multiple randomized controlled trials demonstrate that 300 mg daily is effective for both acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar depression. Furthermore, quetiapine 300 mg daily significantly improves depressive symptoms and reduces relapse risk versus placebo. Additionally, international guidelines (CANMAT/ISBD) **support 300 mg** as first-line maintenance therapy.

---

## Efficacy of 200 mg daily dose

Evidence supporting 200 mg daily for maintenance is limited because most trials evaluated 300 mg [^117Y6dNh] [^1173xtv9]. Some patients with milder symptoms or tolerability concerns may benefit from 200 mg [^112km4rE], but it is not the standard regimen [^112GpSHL]. Compared with the recommended 300 mg, a 200 mg dose **may increase relapse risk**.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Regulatory labeling and international guidelines recommend **300 mg daily** for maintenance treatment [^115GbAZU] [^112GpSHL]. The VA/DoD 2023 guideline recommends quetiapine for maintenance but does not specify a lower maintenance dose [^114Sibcw] [^116xoXvR]. Similarly, expert consensus supports 300 mg daily as the standard maintenance dose.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dose adequacy

Dose adequacy **depends on individual response**, tolerability, and adverse effects, which may necessitate dose adjustments [^112GpSHL] [^114gzNYy]. Those with severe symptoms or frequent relapses may require higher doses or combination therapy [^114vSSs2]. Conversely, those with milder symptoms or significant side effects may use lower doses with close monitoring [^114gzNYy].

---

## Risks and benefits of 200 mg daily dose

At a 200 mg daily dose, the **benefits** include fewer side effects (sedation, weight gain, metabolic issues) than higher doses [^112GpSHL] [^112km4rE], whereas the **risks** include increased relapse risk and potentially less symptom control compared with 300 mg.

---

## Alternative strategies if 200 mg is insufficient

- **Increase to 300 mg daily if tolerated** [^112GpSHL].
- **Combine with mood stabilizers** (lithium, valproate, lamotrigine) [^1144XuPM].
- **Consider alternative antipsychotics** (lurasidone, olanzapine) [^116xoXvR] [^112XCjjQ].
- **Use adjunctive psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions** [^114gzNYy].

---

## Monitoring and assessment

- **Regularly assess** depressive symptoms, side effects, and adherence [^114gzNYy].
- **Use standardized scales** (MADRS, HDRS) to track response [^114gzNYy].
- **Adjust dose** based on clinical response and tolerability.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Overall, **200 mg daily is generally insufficient** for maintenance [^112GpSHL], whereas **300 mg is the standard dose** [^115GbAZU]. Use 200 mg only when 300 mg is not tolerated, with close monitoring for relapse. If 200 mg is inadequate, increase to 300 mg or add a mood stabilizer or an alternative antipsychotic [^116xoXvR].

### Maintenance treatment for patients with bipolar I disorder: Results from a North American study of quetiapine in combination with lithium or divalproex (trial 127) [^113u9r4D]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of quetiapine plus lithium or divalproex in the prevention of mood events in patients with stabilized bipolar I disorder.

A total of 1,953 patients received open-label quetiapine (400–800 mg/day in flexible, divided doses) with either lithium or divalproex (target serum concentrations 0.5–1.2 mEq/liter and 50–125 µg/ml, respectively) for up to 36 weeks. After at least 12 weeks of clinical stability, 628 patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with quetiapine or placebo, in combination with lithium or divalproex, for up to 104 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was time to recurrence of any mood event (mania, depression, or a mixed episode).

Fewer patients in the quetiapine group experienced a mood event compared with the placebo group (20.3% versus 52.1%). The hazard ratio for time to recurrence of a mood event was 0.32. Hazard ratios were similar for mania and depression events (0.30 and 0.33, respectively). Sedation, weight increase, and hypothyroidism occurred more frequently in the quetiapine group, as did discontinuations due to adverse events. The incidence and incidence density of a single emergent blood glucose value ≥ 126 mg/dl were higher in the quetiapine group (12.6% versus 5.4%; 18.44 versus 9.56 patients per 100 patient-years). Adverse events were generally consistent with the known tolerability profile of quetiapine.

In patients stabilized on quetiapine plus lithium or divalproex, continued treatment was associated with significant improvements in mood stability.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^117LqWFq]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Although treatment guidelines have commonly recommended maintenance therapy with lamotrigine or quetiapine as first-line treatments in bipolar disorder patients at risk for depressive episode recurrence, there clearly is a need for additional options that are safe, well-tolerated, and effective for the maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder patients at risk for depression recurrence.

Lurasidone has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Three randomized, double-blind, 6-week trials have been completed: a monotherapy trial comparing two flexible-fixed doses of lurasidone (20–60 mg/day; 80–120 mg/day), and two flexible dose trials of lurasidone (20–120 mg/day) administered adjunctively with lithium or valproate. We report here the results of the 6-month, open-label, uncontrolled extension of the three 6-week studies, designed to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of lurasidone in patients with bipolar depression. A secondary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of lurasidone in maintaining improvement in depressive symptoms.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of quetiapine XR and divalproex ER monotherapies in the treatment of the anxious bipolar patient [^112hw83C]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders complicate the treatment of bipolar disorder but are seldom the focus of bipolar treatment studies.

- **Methods**: The anxiolytic effect of quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/day) compared to divalproex ER (500–3000 mg/day) was tested in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in 149 patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occurring panic disorder or GAD. The primary efficacy measure was the Clinician Global Improvement-21 Anxiety Scale (CGI-21). Secondary measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Sheehan Panic Disorder Scale (SPS).

- **Results**: Repeated measures last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses of variance demonstrated significant treatment-by-time interaction effects on three of the four anxiety measures. Quetiapine XR, at a mean endpoint dose of 186 mg/day, produced rapid and sustained improvements relative to baseline, divalproex ER, and placebo on anxiety. Mean baseline-to-endpoint improvement was significantly greater for quetiapine XR compared to divalproex ER and placebo on the HAM-A and SPS. Both active medications were well tolerated, but weight gain was higher with quetiapine XR.

- **Limitations**: The study was limited to 8 weeks and to patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid panic disorder or GAD. The results may not be applicable to quetiapine XR as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers or to bipolar disorder comorbid with other anxiety disorders.

- **Conclusions**: Quetiapine XR in a dose range of 50–300 mg/day appears to reduce anxiety in bipolar patients with comorbid panic disorder or GAD treated for 8 weeks.

### Efficacy and safety of quetiapine-XR as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to a mood stabilizer in acute bipolar depression with generalized anxiety disorder and other comorbidities: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112fJ45Y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine-XR, used either as monotherapy or in conjunction with a mood stabilizer, in treating acute bipolar I or II depression with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and other comorbidities. Conducted between January 2007 and November 2011, the study utilized the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview to confirm diagnoses of DSM-IV bipolar disorder, GAD, and other Axis I disorders. Participants meeting eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive either quetiapine-XR or placebo for up to 8 weeks. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 items (HDRS-17) served as the primary outcome measure to evaluate differences between the two groups, assessing changes from baseline to the study's conclusion. Analyses involved last observation carried forward and mixed-effects modeling for repeated measures for both primary and secondary outcomes.

Of the 120 patients screened, 100 were randomized to either the quetiapine-XR group (n = 50) or the placebo group (n = 50). Study completion was achieved by 26 patients in the quetiapine-XR group and 18 in the placebo group. The mean dose for quetiapine-XR was 276 ± 50 mg/day (range 50–300 mg/day). No significant difference was observed between the groups regarding change from baseline to study end in HDRS-17 total score, with an effect size of 0.19 favoring quetiapine-XR. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the groups in secondary efficacy and safety outcomes.

The results indicate that quetiapine-XR was not significantly superior to placebo in treating bipolar I or II depression with GAD and other comorbidities, suggesting the necessity for further research in this area.

### Asenapine for long-term treatment of bipolar disorder: A double-blind 40-week extension study [^1125vHSp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Asenapine is approved in the United States for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features. We report the results of long-term treatment with asenapine in patients with bipolar I disorder.

- **Methods**: Patients completing either of two 3-week efficacy trials and a subsequent 9-week double-blind extension were eligible for this 40-week double-blind extension. Patients in the 3-week trials were randomized to flexible-dose asenapine (5 or 10 mg BID), placebo, or olanzapine (5–20 mg QD; included for assay sensitivity only). Patients entering the extension phase maintained their preestablished treatment; those originally randomized to placebo received flexible-dose asenapine (placebo/asenapine). Safety and tolerability endpoints included adverse events (AEs), extrapyramidal symptoms, laboratory values, and anthropometric measures. Efficacy, a secondary assessment, was measured as a change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score from the 3-week trial baseline to week 52 with asenapine or olanzapine; the placebo/asenapine group was assessed for safety only.

- **Results**: Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was 71.9%, 86.1%, and 79.4% with placebo/asenapine, asenapine, and olanzapine, respectively. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were headache and somnolence with placebo/asenapine; insomnia, sedation, and depression with asenapine; and weight gain, somnolence, and sedation with olanzapine. Among observed cases, mean ± SD changes in YMRS total score at week 52 were -28.6 ± 8.1 and -28.2 ± 6.8 for asenapine and olanzapine, respectively.

### Bipolar depression: A new role for atypical antipsychotics [^111PEYHY]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression, the most common phase of bipolar disorder, causes significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional drugs such as lithium, lamotrigine, or antidepressants each offer some clinical efficacy; however, efficacy can be limited, and side effects are sometimes problematic. Thus, there is a major unmet need for effective, well-tolerated agents for the treatment of bipolar depression. The atypical antipsychotics, with their proven efficacy against manic symptoms, are emerging as candidates for use against the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Several studies have shown that some atypicals improve depressive symptoms in mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder; however, few studies have been performed in patients specifically with bipolar depressive episodes.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute bipolar I depression, olanzapine monotherapy and an olanzapine-fluoxetine combination significantly improved Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) with corresponding effect sizes (improvement of active treatment over placebo divided by pooled standard deviation) of 0.32 and 0.68, respectively. Importantly, there were no significant differences in rates of switch into mania among the three groups. Recent results from an 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with bipolar I and II disorder who were experiencing a bipolar depressive episode showed that quetiapine (300 and 600 mg/day) had significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo in improving the core symptoms.

### Extended release quetiapine fumarate in patients with major depressive disorder: Suicidality data from acute and maintenance studies [^115zKisK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

The objective was to prospectively analyze the effects of extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) on suicidality in major depressive disorder (MDD).

- **Method**: Data were pooled from randomized, acute studies including four monotherapy and two adjunct therapy studies. The participants were adult patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD, not considered at high risk of suicide at baseline. They received quetiapine XR at dosages of 50 mg/d (n = 181), 150 mg/d (n = 910), or 300 mg/d (n = 685), or placebo (n = 957). Data were also collected from an acute monotherapy study in elderly patients receiving quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/d; n = 166) or placebo (n = 172) and from maintenance data up to 52 weeks for patients receiving quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/d; n = 391) or placebo (n = 385). Overall incidences and relative risks for suicidality (suicidal behavior/ideation) were assessed by Columbia-type review and classification. The proportion of patients with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) item 10 (suicidal thoughts) score ≥ 4 was analyzed.

- **Results**: The incidence of suicidality during acute treatment in adults was 1.1%, 0.7%, 0.7%, and 0.7% for those receiving quetiapine XR 50 mg/d, 150 mg/d, 300 mg/d, and placebo, respectively. The proportion of patients with a MADRS item 10 score ≥ 4 during acute treatment in adults was 1.8% for quetiapine XR (all doses combined) and 2.4% for placebo. In elderly patients, the incidence of suicidality during acute treatment was 0.6% in both treatment groups; the proportion of patients with a MADRS item 10 score ≥ 4 was 0% with quetiapine XR (all doses combined) and 1.2% with placebo.

### Extended-release quetiapine as adjunct to an antidepressant in patients with major depressive disorder: Results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study [^116oMq7d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

This 6-week, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive extended-release (XR) quetiapine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had an inadequate response to at least one antidepressant.

Male or female patients aged 18 to 65 years with DSM-IV-TR MDD were randomly assigned to receive either quetiapine XR (150 or 300 mg/day) or a placebo as adjunctive to their continuing antidepressant. The primary endpoint was the change from randomization to week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Secondary variables included the MADRS response (a reduction of 50% or more in score from randomization) at weeks 1 and 6, MADRS remission (total score of 8 or less) at week 6, and the week 6 change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety total scores. Safety was assessed throughout the study, which was conducted from May 8, 2006, to April 7, 2007.

Four hundred ninety-three patients were randomly assigned. The mean change from randomization to week 6 in the MADRS score was -15.26 and -14.94 for quetiapine XR 150 mg/day and 300 mg/day, respectively (both p < .01 vs. placebo [-12.21]). Quetiapine XR showed separation from the placebo in the MADRS score from week 1 (p < .001) onward. The MADRS response rates were 55.4%, 57.8%, and 46.3% for quetiapine XR 150 mg/day (p = .107 vs. placebo), 300 mg/day (p < .05), and placebo, respectively. The MADRS remission rates were 36.1% (p < .05 vs. placebo), 31.1% (p = .126), and 23.8% for quetiapine XR 150 mg/day, 300 mg/day, and placebo, respectively.

Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were not completed in the provided text.

### Bipolar disorder maintenance treatment: monitoring effectiveness and safety [^114gzNYy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment, with the goal of shortening or preventing mood episodes without increasing cycle frequency, thereby increasing the length of well periods. Treatment guidelines recommend mood stabilizers as first-line medications, and several atypical antipsychotics are also approved as monotherapy or as adjuncts to mood stabilizers for maintenance treatment. Combination therapy with two mood stabilizers or with a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic may be necessary to achieve or maintain remission of the patient's symptoms.

When treating patients with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics during the maintenance phase, physicians should systematically monitor for adverse effects, particularly weight gain and tolerability issues, and address those issues in a timely manner to enhance treatment adherence and improve patient outcomes.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine and paroxetine as monotherapy in adults with bipolar depression (EMBOLDEN II) [^117Y6dNh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine and paroxetine monotherapy for major depression in bipolar disorder.

- **Method**: 740 patients (478 with bipolar I, 262 with bipolar II) experiencing major depressive episodes (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to receive quetiapine 300 mg/d (n = 245), quetiapine 600 mg/d (n = 247), paroxetine 20 mg/d (n = 122), or placebo (n = 126) for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline. The study was conducted from May 2005 to May 2007.

- **Results**: Mean MADRS score change from baseline at 8 weeks was -16.19 for quetiapine 300 mg, -16.31 for quetiapine 600 mg, -13.76 for paroxetine, and -12.60 for placebo (P < .001 for both quetiapine doses, P = 0.313 for paroxetine compared to placebo). Patients treated with quetiapine (both doses), but not paroxetine, showed significantly greater improvements (P ≤ .05) in most secondary outcome measures at week 8 versus the placebo group. Paroxetine significantly improved Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores versus placebo (P < .05) but did not show significant improvements in MADRS or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores. Both quetiapine doses were associated with greater improvements than paroxetine regarding MADRS and HDRS scores. The most common adverse events associated with quetiapine were dry mouth, somnolence, sedation, and dizziness. Paroxetine was associated with dry mouth, sedation, headache, insomnia, and nausea. The incidence of treatment-emergent mania/hypomania was lower with quetiapine compared with paroxetine and placebo.

### Bipolar disorders: Evaluation and treatment [^115YhL1h]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, more specifically with respect to maintenance therapy, AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend offering lithium, quetiapine, or a combination of quetiapine with lithium or valproic acid for the maintenance of bipolar disorder.

- **Step 2: Initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence**: The choice of agent or agents used in maintenance treatment should be discussed with the patient and their caregivers, as appropriate, based on knowledge of prior medication use, response, safety, and tolerability of each agent, predominant episode polarity, and clinical features that may influence prognosis (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices"). As with treatment for mania and acute depression, we recommend that treatment choices for maintenance treatment of BD should follow the hierarchy listed in Table 17 unless patient preference or other considerations, such as previous response/non‐response, tolerability, or predominant polarity, justify other choices. Similarly, as a general rule, if a patient has been treated for an acute mood episode and responded to a first-line maintenance treatment, we recommend continuing that treatment for maintenance even if lower down in the hierarchy. For example, if a patient responded to asenapine in an acute manic episode, asenapine should be continued, even if it is lower in the hierarchy for maintenance treatment. It may be necessary to lower the dose to some degree once in maintenance treatment, as patients often experience greater side effects once out of the acute episode.

There is evidence that the risk of recurrence is reduced when an antipsychotic is combined with lithium/divalproex. When a combination therapy of an atypical antipsychotic with lithium/divalproex was used to treat acute mania, continuing the atypical antipsychotic in maintenance therapy may be beneficial.

### Quetiapine in the treatment of acute bipolar mania: Efficacy across a broad range of symptoms [^116ofhmU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

An ideal antimanic therapy is well tolerated and offers full multidimensional symptom relief. The efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of acute bipolar mania has previously been established. This post-hoc analysis aims to extend our understanding of quetiapine's antimanic efficacy by evaluating its therapeutic effect across the full spectrum of manic symptoms.

- **Methods**: Patient-level data from four similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were combined to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine in bipolar disorder patients with DSM-IV acute mania. Two trials investigated quetiapine as monotherapy (twice daily), and two trials assessed the combination of quetiapine with either lithium (Li) or divalproex (DVP). Changes in scores on the total Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and each of the 11 items comprising the YMRS were the primary measures of interest. Changes in the Supplemental Aggression and Agitation subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were secondary measures analyzed.

- **Results**: Quetiapine as monotherapy, or in combination with Li or DVP, was a highly effective treatment for acute mania, as shown by overall change scores in the total YMRS. Patients treated with quetiapine monotherapy exhibited a significantly greater reduction versus placebo in YMRS total scores at Day 4 (-3.5 versus -2.2; p = 0.021), with an increasing between-group difference reported throughout the duration of the trials at Day 21 (-13.6 versus -7.8; p < 0.001) and at study endpoint on Day 84 (-19.0 versus -9.6; p < 0.001).

### Lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [^113MfWrV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of mania or hypomania, as well as depressive episodes, which eventually result in marked impairment in overall functioning and health-related quality of life. A worldwide prevalence rate of 2.4% has been reported. The risk of suicide is higher in people with bipolar disorder than in those with other mental disorders. Therefore, effective management of bipolar disorder during the maintenance period is essential to minimize the risk of relapse or recurrence. Although lithium has been the standard treatment for bipolar disorder for many years, it is associated with adverse effects and teratogenicity. Lamotrigine is approved for the prevention of recurrence during the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. In addition, lamotrigine is as effective as lithium. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to confirm the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

- **Search methods**: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialized Register (CCMDCTR), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to May 21, 2021. We also searched international trial registries and contacted experts in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling adults with bipolar disorder who were treated with lamotrigine, placebo, or lithium.

### Extended release quetiapine fumarate monotherapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo- and duloxetine-controlled study [^116md79N]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) as monotherapy treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).

This 8-week study, consisting of a 6-week active-treatment randomized phase and a 2-week posttreatment drug-discontinuation/tapering phase, was multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled, phase 3 trial conducted between April 2006 and May 2007. A total of 612 patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)-defined MDD were randomly assigned to receive quetiapine XR 150 mg/day or 300 mg/day, duloxetine 60 mg/day (active control), or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.

At week 6, both doses of quetiapine XR showed significantly greater reductions in MADRS total scores compared to placebo, with clinical response rates (defined as ≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score) being significantly higher for both doses of quetiapine XR (p < .01) and duloxetine (p < .05) versus placebo. Remission rates (MADRS score ≤ 8) were significantly higher for quetiapine XR 300 mg/day and duloxetine versus placebo (p < .05), but not for quetiapine XR 150 mg/day. Additional measures, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness total scores, were also evaluated but were not fully reported in this excerpt.

### The role of pharmacologic treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder [^117T7Lwt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

With the growth in the number of pharmacologic options available for the treatment of bipolar disorder, clinicians face a challenge in appropriately selecting and sequencing newer and older treatments. Evidence-based practice has been suggested as a way to improve outcomes across specialties in medicine; therefore, several practice guidelines and treatment algorithms for bipolar disorder have been developed to aid clinical decision-making. Most of these guidelines and algorithms are based on detailed reviews of the medical literature, with an emphasis on systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Some guidelines incorporate a consensus of expert opinion when the literature does not provide clear evidence. This review examines areas of overlap and discordance in practice guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, as well as treatment algorithms developed by the Expert Consensus Guideline Series and the Texas Medical Algorithm Project.

### Effectiveness of quetiapine in rapid cycling bipolar disorder: a preliminary study [^1128a7yD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The authors examined long-term effectiveness and study retention during open-label quetiapine treatment for rapid cycling bipolar disorder. An open-label, nonrandomized trial was conducted in 41 patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (type I = 33, type II = 7, NOS = 1) who received flexibly dosed quetiapine monotherapy (n = 19) or add-on therapy (n = 22) for up to one year. Linear growth curves were calculated to assess longitudinal changes in depression and mania.

Linear growth curves demonstrated highly significant reductions in manic (p < 0.0001) and depressive (p < 0.0001) symptoms. Effect sizes were large against manic symptoms (add-on therapy: Cohen's d = 0.66; monotherapy: Cohen's d = 0.75) but small-to-moderate against depression (monotherapy: d = 0.29; add-on therapy: d = 0.40). Most patients (68%) prematurely terminated the protocol (mean duration: 18.0 ± 16.9 weeks, mean dose: 195.6 ± 196.1 mg/day), most often because of the need for additional psychotropic treatments.

- **Limitations**: The study protocol involved an open-label design with no placebo or active comparator group. The sample size provided adequate statistical power to detect large but not medium or small within-group effects. Premature dropout during the first six months precluded inferences about longer-term treatment outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: These observational findings provisionally suggest some benefit with quetiapine for both manic and depressive symptoms in rapid cycling bipolar disorder, at dosages somewhat lower than previously described either for mania or bipolar depression.

### Pooled analysis of sustained response rates for extended release quetiapine fumarate as monotherapy or adjunct to antidepressant therapy in patients with major depressive disorder [^111XnehE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical trials are not generally powered to analyze outcomes such as sustained response. We evaluated sustained response rates for patients with major depressive disorder receiving quetiapine XR as monotherapy or adjunct therapy.

- **Method**: Post hoc analyses of pooled data from four previously reported randomized, placebo-controlled studies of quetiapine XR 150 and 300 mg/day as monotherapy or adjunct therapy to ongoing antidepressant. Sustained response rates (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score at specific timepoint and each subsequent visit until Week 6) were calculated at Weeks 1, 2, and 4; rates were compared using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis.

- **Results**: In the monotherapy studies, the proportion of patients experiencing sustained response was greater with quetiapine XR 150 mg/day versus placebo at Week 2 (20.0% vs. 13.3%; p < 0.05) and Week 4 (33.3% vs. 23.3%; p < 0.01) (observed cases [OC]). The corresponding sustained response rates for quetiapine XR 300 mg/day were 18.0% (p = 0.104) and 29.7% (p = 0.063), respectively (OC). The proportion of patients experiencing sustained response was greater in the adjunct studies versus placebo at Weeks 2 and 4 for quetiapine XR 150 (Week 2, 30.1% vs. 15.2%, p < 0.001; Week 4, 40.1% vs. 32.0%, p < 0.05) and 300 mg/day (Week 2, 29.0% vs. 15.2%, p < 0.001; Week 4, 42.0% vs. 32.0%, p < 0.05) (OC).

- **Limitations**: Post hoc analyses, acute treatment period; no active comparator.

- **Conclusions**: Quetiapine XR as monotherapy (150 mg/day at Weeks 2 and 4) or adjunct to ongoing antidepressant therapy (150 and 300 mg/day at Weeks 2 and 4).

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^117MVWsG]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

In a randomized pilot trial conducted by Wang et al, 56 participants with BD and mixed features (defined as 2 or 3 manic symptoms during an MDE) received quetiapine monotherapy for two weeks. They received 100 mg on day 1, with the dose increased by 100 mg each day until day 3. The dose range was then adjusted to 300–600 mg/day. Participants who responded (MADRS score reduction ≥ 20%) to quetiapine monotherapy continued their treatment for another 6 weeks. Those who did not respond sufficiently (MADRS score reduction < 20%) were randomly assigned to either quetiapine combined with valproate or quetiapine combined with lithium for 6 weeks.

- **Quetiapine + lithium group**: Received 300 mg on day 1, then increased to 600–900 mg/day within 3 days.
- **Quetiapine + valproate group**: Started at 500 mg/day, and the dose was adjusted to 1000 mg/day within 3–5 days.

Study assessments included MADRS, YMRS, Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale supplemented with questions for the DSM-5 mixed features specifier (CUDOS-M), and HAMA.

No significant differences in changes of MADRS, YMRS, or CUDOS scores were observed between the quetiapine + valproate group and the quetiapine + lithium group between baseline and week 8. The quetiapine + lithium group showed a significant reduction in mean MADRS (–7.18, p = 0.025) and YMRS (–4.82, p = 0.047) scores from baseline to week 8. All measures at each visit were lower than the previous visit. For the quetiapine + valproate group, a significant reduction was only observed in the mean MADRS (–8.6, p = 0.027) score.

### Medicating mood with maintenance in mind: Bipolar depression pharmacotherapy [^116UMpX8]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is a core feature of bipolar disorder, a phase in which many patients spend the majority of their time and one that confers a significant degree of burden and risk. The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the evidence base for the pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression and to discuss the recommendations for its optimal management.

A detailed literature review was undertaken with a particular emphasis on pharmacological treatment strategies for bipolar depression across the acute and maintenance phases of the illness. Electronic library and web-based searches were performed using recognized tools (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) to identify the pertinent literature. A summary of the evidence base is outlined and then distilled into broad clinical recommendations to guide the pharmacological management of bipolar depression.

Partitioning treatment into acute and maintenance therapy is difficult based on the paucity of evidence. The evidence from treatment trials favors the use of lithium and lamotrigine as first-line treatments in preference to valproate and indicates that, for acute episodes, quetiapine and olanzapine have perhaps achieved equivalence, at least in terms of efficacy. However, the effectiveness of the atypical antipsychotics in maintenance therapy is constrained by the potential for significant side effects of individual agents and the lack of both long-term research data and clinical experience in treating bipolar disorder as compared to other agents. Conversely, lithium and the anticonvulsants…

### Olanzapine versus lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder: a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial [^112XCjjQ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The authors compared the efficacy of olanzapine and lithium in the prevention of mood episode relapse or recurrence in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (manic/mixed). Patients with a history of two or more manic or mixed episodes within six years and a Young Mania Rating Scale total score of 20 or higher entered the study. They received open-label co-treatment with olanzapine and lithium for 6–12 weeks. Those meeting symptomatic remission criteria (Young Mania Rating Scale score less than 12 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score less than 8) were randomly assigned to receive either olanzapine or lithium for 12 months.

- **Results**: In the double-blind phase, relapse or recurrence (defined as a score of 15 or higher on either the Young Mania Rating Scale or Hamilton Depression Scale) occurred in 30.0% of olanzapine-treated patients and 38.8% of lithium-treated patients. The primary objective, the noninferiority of olanzapine relative to lithium in preventing relapse or recurrence, was met. The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval on the 8.8% risk difference (-0.1% to 17.8%) exceeded the predefined noninferiority margin (-7.3%).

- **Secondary results**: Compared with lithium, olanzapine was associated with significantly lower risks of manic episode and mixed episode relapse or recurrence. Depression relapse or recurrence occurred in 15.7% of olanzapine-treated patients and 10.7% of lithium-treated patients. Mean weight gain during open-label co-treatment was 2.7 kg. During double-blind monotherapy, weight gain was significantly greater with olanzapine (1.8 kg).

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^112T6Byd]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence from RCTs is at the core of the recommendations in these guidelines. Nonetheless, RCTs are not the only source of clinically useful information, particularly when evaluating maintenance therapy. RCTs offer relatively limited follow-up time frames while, for some patients, maintenance therapy may extend across decades. Furthermore, new medications are often assessed in studies with an enriched design (including only patients who have responded to the medication under study in the acute phase), limiting the generalizability of positive findings to patients who responded to the medication acutely.

Useful data can be obtained from large, often whole-population databases constructed from electronic medical records or electronic patient registries with large numbers of patients that would be difficult to obtain in RCTs. In some instances, they allow comparisons of multiple treatments. These large numbers make it possible to evaluate differences in rates of rare events such as less common side effects or suicide.

Patient cohorts followed in a specific setting provide another source of informative data. Their main advantage usually is the length of observation, in some instances reaching several decades. This comes at the cost of generalizability, in terms of both patient selection and non-random treatment allocation.

### Efficacy and safety of quetiapine in combination with lithium or divalproex for maintenance of patients with bipolar I disorder (international trial 126) [^1144XuPM]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

This study examined the efficacy and safety of quetiapine in combination with lithium or divalproex, compared with placebo with lithium or divalproex, in the prevention of mood events in bipolar I patients, whose most recent episode was mania, depression, or mixed.

- **Methods**: Patients received open-label quetiapine (400–800 mg/day, with flexible, divided doses) in combination with lithium or divalproex (target serum concentrations of 0.5–1.2 mEq/L and 50–125 microg/mL, respectively) for up to 36 weeks to achieve at least 12 weeks of clinical stability. Subsequently, patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (400–800 mg/day) plus lithium/divalproex or placebo plus lithium/divalproex for up to 104 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to recurrence of any mood event.

- **Results**: Treatment with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex significantly increased the time to recurrence of any mood event compared to placebo plus lithium/divalproex. The proportion of patients experiencing a mood event was markedly lower in the quetiapine group than in the placebo group (18.5% versus 49.0%). The hazard ratio for the time to recurrence of a mood event was 0.28 (P < 0.001). Common adverse events occurring in ≥ 5% of the quetiapine group included somnolence, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Insomnia was more common in the placebo group. During the randomization phase, there was an increase in weight of 0.5 kg in the quetiapine group.

### All studies are not created equal: A systematic narrative review of bipolar depression clinical trial inclusion/exclusion rules and baseline severity scores [^112MhJZZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Several bipolar depression treatment guidelines have been designed to assist clinicians with medication selection. When ranking medications, none explicitly considered the inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline severity scores of the reviewed clinical trials. This article aimed to determine if sufficient differences exist in these variables to justify their consideration when designing treatment guidelines.

- **Methods**: Using Ovid and PubMed databases in May and September 2022, all published short-term crossover or parallel-group design studies comparing second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), mood stabilizers, or antidepressants versus placebo in bipolar depressed patients were identified. Included studies must have enrolled adult bipolar I/II depressed patients, randomized patients into two or more treatment groups, utilized a double-blind, prospective design written in English, and had primary outcome results that were statistically significant in favor of the investigational treatment.

- **Results**: Thirty studies met eligibility criteria, comprising a total of 8791 patients. Among those studies, there were seventeen antipsychotic trials, six lithium trials, one lamotrigine trial, three valproate trials, two carbamazepine trials, and two antidepressant trials. The analysis revealed substantial differences among the studies. Although this was seen among all the different drug classes, these differences are clearest when comparing the lithium trials to those of the SGAs.

- **Limitations**: Limitations included the selection of severity scores from the treatment arm.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of lithium versus quetiapine augmentation for treatment-resistant depression: a pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled superiority trial in the UK [^1148uZCa]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Lithium and quetiapine are first-line augmentation options for treatment-resistant depression; however, few studies have compared them directly, and none have lasted longer than 8 weeks. This study aimed to assess whether quetiapine augmentation therapy is more clinically effective and cost-effective than lithium for patients with treatment-resistant depression over 12 months.

- **Methods**: This pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled superiority trial was conducted at six National Health Service trusts in England. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) experiencing an episode of major depressive disorder that met DSM-5 criteria. They had a score of 14 or higher on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at screening and had responded inadequately to two or more therapeutic antidepressant trials. Exclusion criteria included having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or psychosis. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lithium or quetiapine. This was stratified by site, depression severity, and treatment resistance, using block randomization with randomly varying block sizes. After randomization, pre-prescribing safety checks were conducted as per standard care before trial medication initiation. The co-primary outcomes were depressive symptom severity over 12 months, measured weekly using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and time to all-cause treatment discontinuation. Economic analyses compared the cost-effectiveness of the two treatments from both an NHS and personal social services perspective.

### Pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression: An update [^1154Cds8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar affective disorder is a virulent illness characterized by high rates of recurrence, disability, social impairment, and suicide. Although the disorder is defined by manic or hypomanic episodes, depressive episodes are more numerous and less responsive to treatment. Initial depressive episodes are often misdiagnosed, leading to delayed initiation of therapy with mood stabilizers and an increased likelihood of treatment-emergent affective switches on antidepressant monotherapy. The empirical basis for selecting treatments for bipolar depression is weak, with only the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine having received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Conventional mood stabilizers are preferred for first-line therapies, although atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used, with the FDA approval of quetiapine pending. Antidepressants — particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bupropion — are indicated when mood stabilizers are ineffective and for "breakthrough" depressions.

### Treatment of bipolar disorder: Review of evidence regarding quetiapine and lithium [^111jko4W]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Lithium, the prototypical mood stabilizer, and quetiapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, are widely used acute and maintenance pharmacotherapies for bipolar disorder. The Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar CHOICE) study was the first comparative effectiveness assessment of lithium versus quetiapine (in combination with adjunctive personalized treatment). It found no overall significant differences in efficacy and safety/tolerability outcomes between lithium and quetiapine. Completion of Bipolar CHOICE offers a timely opportunity to review the evidence regarding lithium and quetiapine for bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: Controlled clinical trials and real-world observational studies that included quetiapine and lithium as monotherapy or in combination therapy were identified via literature search. Selected studies were reviewed in detail.

- **Results**: Review of the available trials suggested comparable efficacy of quetiapine and lithium in acute mania, and possibly greater efficacy for quetiapine compared with lithium in acute bipolar depression and in the prevention of recurrent (particularly depressive) episodes. Combination therapy including quetiapine and lithium was generally more effective than either agent alone in acute mania and bipolar maintenance, although adding lithium to quetiapine did not increase efficacy in acute bipolar depression. Safety data for quetiapine and lithium were consistent with the established profiles of the two treatments.

- **Limitations**: Limitations include those of the available studies, such as…

### Low-dose quetiapine induced or worsened mania in the context of possible undertreatment [^117KJP3L]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a mental illness with a lifetime prevalence of 2% and has a dramatic impact on quality of life. Mania is a distinct period of abnormal and sustained elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and an increase in goal-directed activity or energy that lasts at least 1 week and is present for most of each day. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic approved for the treatment of bipolar depression and mania. For the treatment of acute mania, a dose of 600 to 800 mg/day is recommended.

There has been concern about the potential induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at low doses via the ratio of 5HT2A/D2 receptor antagonism. At lower doses, this mechanism favors greater 5HT2A receptor blockade, thus increasing dopamine concentrations. This article describes a case report of hypomania worsening to mania with psychotic features in a drug-naïve patient who was started on low-dose quetiapine. This case adds to the existing literature of case reports indicating that low-dose quetiapine may be associated with induction or worsening of hypomanic/manic symptoms, while acknowledging the difficulty of suggesting a causal relationship.

Paliperidone ER monotherapy was efficacious in treating acute mania in two 3-week studies in patients with bipolar I disorder. We assessed its efficacy in a study investigating maintenance treatment of clinically stable patients with this disorder.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 766), aged 18 to 65 years inclusive, with manic or mixed episodes were initially randomized (4:1) to flexibly-dosed paliperidone ER (3–12 mg/day) or olanzapine (5–20 mg/day; 3-week acute treatment phase). Responders continued the same treatment (12-week continuation phase). Patients on paliperidone ER who achieved remission during this phase were randomized (1:1) to fixed-dose paliperidone ER (n = 152) or placebo (n = 148); those on olanzapine continued to receive that at a fixed dose (n = 83) (maintenance phase).

- **Results**: Median time to recurrence of any mood symptoms (primary endpoint) was: 558 days (paliperidone ER), 283 days (placebo), and not observed with olanzapine (< 50% of patients experienced recurrence). Time to recurrence of any mood symptoms was significantly longer with paliperidone ER than placebo (p = 0.017; based on weighted Z-test at 0.0198 significance level; hazard ratio [placebo: paliperidone ER; unweighted 95% confidence interval]: 1.43 [1.03; 1.98]); the difference was significant for preventing recurrence of manic, but not depressive, symptoms. Treatment-emergent adverse events (maintenance phase) occurred more often in the olanzapine group (64%) than in the placebo (59%) or paliperidone ER groups (55%).

- **Limitations**: Responder-enriched design prevents extrapolation of data to patients.

### Efficacy and tolerability of extended release quetiapine fumarate monotherapy as maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112vmqm8]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, specifically the time to recurrence of depressive symptoms, of once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) as a maintenance monotherapy treatment to prevent relapse in major depressive disorder (MDD).

- **Methods**: This study was a time-to-event (maximum 52 weeks), double-blind, multicenter, randomized withdrawal, placebo-controlled trial of quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/day). It comprised four treatment phases: enrollment (up to 28 days), open-label run-in (4–8 weeks), open-label stabilization (12–18 weeks), and randomization (up to 52 weeks). Seven hundred seventy-six patients stabilized on quetiapine XR were eligible for randomization (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score ≤ 12 and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness [CGI-S] score ≤ 3); 391 received quetiapine XR and 385 received placebo (same dose as last open-label visit). The primary endpoint was the time to recurrence of depressive event from randomization. Secondary outcomes included changes from randomization in MADRS total, CGI-S, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global, and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total scores. Adverse events were recorded throughout.

- **Results**: The risk of recurrence of depressive event was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced by 66% (HR = .34; 95% CI: .25, .46) in patients randomized to continue with quetiapine XR versus patients randomized to switch to placebo. During the randomized phase, quetiapine XR maintained improvements in secondary outcomes (p < 0.001 for all): MADRS (0.15 versus 2.03), CGI-S (-0.03 versus 0.23), and PSQI global (0.06 versus 1.35).

### Peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor changes along treatment with extended release quetiapine during acute mood episodes: An open-label trial in drug-free patients with bipolar disorder [^116whgNk]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Molecules involved in neuronal intercommunication and the adaptability of neural networks, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are targets of pathophysiological investigation in bipolar disorder (BD). Quetiapine is an established treatment for this disorder, used during acute mood episodes. The aim of this study was to report prospective changes in serum BDNF levels in drug-free patients experiencing acute mood episodes of BD who received treatment with extended-release quetiapine over a 16-week follow-up. Assessments were performed at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16 with the Young Mania Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale. During these visits, serum BDNF levels were measured. Mixed effect models were utilized to investigate longitudinal changes. Twenty-five patients were included in this analysis, with seventeen in a depressive episode and eight in a manic/mixed episode. A significant improvement from baseline to endpoint was observed. In the mixed model, significant main effects for episode and time were detected, as well as a time versus episode interaction indicating increasing BDNF levels over time in those with a depressive episode, but a decrease in BDNF levels over time in those with a manic/mixed episode. BDNF may serve as a biomarker with differential response according to the polarity of mood episodes.

### Relationship between daily dose, plasma concentrations, dopamine receptor occupancy, and clinical response to quetiapine: A review [^113owziY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

To assess the relationships among quetiapine blood concentration, daily dose, dopamine receptor occupancy, and clinical outcome, researchers aimed to define a target plasma level range in which therapeutic response is enhanced and adverse events are minimized.

A search of the Embase database from 1974 to March 2009 and the MEDLINE and PubMed databases from 1966 to March 2009 was conducted. The drug name quetiapine was searched alongside terms such as plasma levels, plasma concentration, therapeutic drug monitoring, and dopamine occupancy.

The search uncovered 42 relevant articles. All published reports of quetiapine plasma or serum concentration were considered for inclusion if they reported information related to dose, clinical outcome, or dopamine occupancy. After applying exclusion criteria, 20 articles remained.

Trials primarily investigating interactions between quetiapine and other medications were excluded, as were those comparing methods of blood sample analysis.

There was a weak correlation between quetiapine dose and measured plasma concentration (from trough samples). Quetiapine dose was correlated with central dopamine D(2) occupancy, although the relationship between plasma level and D(2) occupancy is less clear.

The dose-response relationship for immediate-release quetiapine is established. However, data on plasma concentration-response relationships are not sufficiently robust to determine a therapeutic plasma level range for quetiapine.

### Extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) monotherapy and quetiapine XR or lithium as add-on to antidepressants in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder [^1151r6nw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) remain a common clinical challenge.

- **Methods**: This 6-week, randomised, open-label, rater-blinded trial evaluated once-daily extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR; 300 mg/day) as add-on to ongoing antidepressant and quetiapine XR monotherapy (300 mg/day) compared with add-on lithium (0.6–1.2 mmol/L) in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. The primary efficacy measure was the change in the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from randomisation to week 6, with a pre-specified non-inferiority limit of 3 points on the MADRS.

- **Results**: At week 6, both add-on quetiapine XR (n = 231) and quetiapine XR monotherapy (n = 228) were non-inferior to add-on lithium (n = 229); the least squares means (LSM) differences (97.5% CI) in MADRS total score changes were -2.32 (-4.6, -0.05) and -0.97 (-3.24, 1.31), respectively. The LSM MADRS total score change was numerically greater at day 4 for both quetiapine XR groups (add-on and monotherapy; p < 0.01) compared with add-on lithium. At week 6, the differences between groups for the secondary endpoints of MADRS response (≥ 50% reduction in total score), MADRS remission (total score ≤ 10, add-on quetiapine XR only), and Clinical Global Impressions ('much'/'very much' improved) were numerically similar. Overall tolerability was consistent with the known profiles of both treatments.

- **Limitations**: Limitations included the open-label study design (although MADRS and laboratory measurements were performed by treatment-blinded raters) and the relatively short study duration.

### Efficacy and acceptability of lurasidone for bipolar depression: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^111M7pCo]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

The optimal dose of lurasidone for bipolar depression is unclear. This study examined its dose–response relationship for efficacy, acceptability, and metabolic/endocrine profiles.

- **Study selection and analysis**: Five databases and grey literature published until 1 August 2024 were systematically reviewed. The outcomes included efficacy (changes in depression, anxiety, clinical global impression, disability, and quality of life), acceptability (dropout, manic switch, suicidality, and side effects), and metabolic/endocrine profiles (changes in body weight, glucose, lipid, and prolactin levels). Effect sizes were calculated using a one-step dose–response meta-analysis, expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs), risk ratios (RRs), and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Findings**: Five randomized clinical trials (2032 patients, mean treatment duration 6 weeks) indicated that the optimal therapeutic dose of lurasidone (40–60 mg) improved depression (50 mg: SMD −0.60, 95% CI −0.89 to −0.30), anxiety (50 mg: SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.42 to −0.21), clinical global impression (50 mg: SMD −0.67, 95% CI −1.03 to −0.30), and disability (50 mg: SMD −0.38, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.08). Side effects increased with higher doses (50 mg: RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.25; 100 mg: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.36), but dropout, manic switch, and suicidality did not show a dose–effect relationship. Weight increased at doses above 70 mg (100 mg: increase of 3.16 mg/dL, 95% CI 0.76 to 5.57). Prolactin levels increased in both males (50 mg: increase of 3.21 mg/dL).

### Maintenance therapy with second-generation antipsychotics for bipolar disorder - A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Jq4JL]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) are frequently used for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder. We systematically reviewed the efficacy and long-term effects of treatment with SGA, regardless of treatment strategy (SGA administered either as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy), in comparison to placebo, lithium, or valproate. Primary outcomes were relapses (mood episode recurrence) and discontinuation.

- **Method**: Clinical studies were identified through database searching in PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Library and critically appraised based on the Cochrane Handbook. Full data extraction of raw data was performed and analyzed with meta-analyses, and the level of evidence was graded using GRADE. Only randomized controlled studies (RCT) and observational studies were included, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Comparators used were restricted to placebo, lithium, valproate, or other anti-epileptic drugs.

- **Results**: We identified 15 RCTs on SGA in bipolar disorder with follow-up times of 6 months up to 2 years, and one observational study reporting long-term effects of up to 4 years. A total of 6,142 patients were included in the randomized trials. No long-term RCTs beyond 2 years of follow-up were identified. All RCTs except for one included patients with bipolar disorder type I only. All RCTs except for two included patients pre-stabilized on the drug under investigation prior to randomization (enrichment design). For SGA as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, meta-analyses showed that treatment with either aripiprazole (RR: 0.65, 95% CI 0.50–0.85).

### Combination therapy versus monotherapy in bipolar disorder [^114vSSs2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder should first be assessed to ensure they are receiving an optimal dose of the first-line medication. If further intervention is needed, one option is to combine an atypical antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. The decision to use a particular combination should be made on the basis of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication for individual patients. Psychosocial therapy as an adjunct to medication is also useful in delaying relapse.

### Extended release quetiapine fumarate in major depressive disorder: Analysis in patients with anxious depression [^115yp31a]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

A pooled analysis was performed on data from two studies evaluating the efficacy of once-daily extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) monotherapy for patients with major depressive disorder. Through these analyses, based on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) measures, we aim to further evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine XR in depressed patients with high levels of anxiety symptoms.

- **Methods**: Secondary analyses were conducted of pooled individual patient data from two 8-week studies, which included a 6-week randomized phase and a 2-week drug discontinuation phase. These studies were double-blind and placebo-controlled, evaluating quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/day). The outcomes measured the change from randomization at Week 6 in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score for patients with anxious and nonanxious depression.

- **Results**: Of 968 patients included in the analysis, 788 (81.4%) were classified as anxious depressed (defined as HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7) and 180 (18.6%) as nonanxious. For patients with anxious and nonanxious depression, statistically significant differences versus placebo in MADRS total score were recorded for quetiapine XR 150 mg/day (-3.24, P < .001 and -4.82, P < .01, respectively) and 300 mg/day (-3.57, P < .001 and -3.39, P < .05, respectively) at Week 6. In the second analysis using an alternate definition of anxious depression (baseline HAM-A total score ≥ 20), quetiapine XR 150 and 300 mg/day resulted in significant differences versus placebo in MADRS total score reduction.

### Molecular mechanisms of quetiapine bidirectional regulation of bipolar depression and mania based on network pharmacology and molecular docking: Evidence from computational biology [^116YLz7d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Quetiapine monotherapy is recommended as the first-line option for acute mania and acute bipolar depression. However, the mechanism of action of quetiapine is unclear. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were employed to determine the molecular mechanisms of quetiapine's bidirectional regulation of bipolar depression and mania.

- **Methods**: Putative target genes for quetiapine were collected from the GeneCard, SwissTargetPrediction, and DrugBank databases. Targets for bipolar depression and bipolar mania were identified from the DisGeNET and GeneCards databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was generated using the String database and imported into Cytoscape. DAVID and the bioinformatics platform were employed to perform Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of the top 15 core targets. The drug-pathway-target-disease network was constructed using Cytoscape. Finally, molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interactions between quetiapine and potential targets.

- **Results**: Targets for quetiapine actions against bipolar depression (126 targets) and bipolar mania (81 targets) were identified. Based on PPI and KEGG pathway analyses, quetiapine may affect bipolar depression by targeting the MAPK and PI3K/AKT insulin signaling pathways via BDNF, INS, EGFR, IGF1, and NGF, and it may affect bipolar mania by targeting the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway via HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, DRD2, and GRIN2B. Molecular docking revealed good binding affinity between quetiapine and potential targets.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112ufPqE]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

For several decades, lithium has been and remains the "gold standard" first-line treatment for patients living with BP-I, followed by other oral medications such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone orally disintegrating tablet. Despite declining prescription rates during the past decade due to the adverse-event and toxicity burden, lithium is used because of its effectiveness in both BP-I and BP-II, including for the prevention of suicidal behavior. In recent years, long-acting injectables (LAIs) such as aripiprazole and risperidone have emerged as potential maintenance treatment options for patients living with BP-I, including early in the course of the illness. At present, aripiprazole and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, the use of LAIs for bipolar disorder is currently off-label in Europe according to European Medicines Agency recommendations. Compared to oral antipsychotics that are shorter acting and must be taken more frequently, LAIs are designed to provide relief of symptoms by slowly releasing the drug over an extended period (weeks to months). Studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggest that LAIs may provide additional benefits over oral antipsychotics by reducing the rates of re-hospitalization and risk of relapse, improving overall quality of life, and improving adherence to treatment. However, LAIs are not routinely offered to patients living with BP-I, for reasons that will be explored in this expert consensus report.

The main objectives of this article are to highlight the potential benefits of LAIs in the management of BP-I.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115m8nwC]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Quetiapine (level 1), lithium (level 2), lamotrigine (level 2), and lurasidone (level 2) are all recommended as first-line treatment options with evidence for efficacy as monotherapy.

Lurasidone (level 1) and lamotrigine (level 2) are also recommended as first-line adjunctive treatments. Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination in patients who experience depression when optimized on one of these medications.

Recommendations as to which first-line treatment should be considered first are outlined in our hierarchy. We recommend that the agents listed first in the hierarchy be tried first, in the order listed, unless there are patient-specific reasons for choosing an agent lower down in the order, such as previous history of response/non-response or clinical features. For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and is not taking any treatment and has not been treated for this episode, that patient should be commenced on quetiapine monotherapy if there is no previous history of non-response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine.

### Benefits and harms of low and high second-generation antipsychotics doses for bipolar depression: A meta-analysis [^112km4rE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to test whether low versus high doses of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are associated with different clinical benefits and harms for the acute treatment of bipolar depression. We included clinical trials comparing different doses of the same SGA monotherapy for bipolar depression. SGAs' defined daily doses were used to define high and low doses. Clinical benefit outcomes included improvement, response, and remission rates on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Clinical harm outcomes included all-cause and adverse effect-related discontinuation rates.

Data from seven clinical trials testing high and low doses of quetiapine (4 trials), cariprazine, lurasidone, and ziprasidone (1 trial each) showed no differences between lower and higher doses of selected SGAs on improvement, response, and remission rates, without significant heterogeneity across studies (I² = 0%). Subgroup analyses based on single SGAs confirmed the clinical benefit comparability between low and high doses. However, clinical harm outcomes favored low doses, with significant differences in all-cause (p = 0.01) and adverse effects-related discontinuation (p = 0.001).

In sum, this meta-analysis showed that, although no benefits were found in terms of symptoms' improvement, response, and remission rates, there were clear disadvantages in prescribing higher rather than lower doses of selected SGAs. The uniform methodological strength of studies increases confidence in our findings. These data need to be integrated with individual patient characteristics.

### Guidelines for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder: Are there discrepancies between European and North American recommendations [^114QABdy]. Bipolar Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Practice policies and guidelines for the long-term management of bipolar patients have appeared in many parts of Europe and North America. Although recommendations in most areas do concur, remarkable differences are apparent regarding both diagnostic practice and pharmacological management. These differences point towards professional and cultural distinctions between Europe and North America, but also highlight areas with unresolved research questions and a lack of scientific evidence.

### Comparative evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination versus quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid versus placebo) in bipolar depression (CEQUEL): a 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial [^116GDwQv]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Depressive symptoms are a major cause of disability in bipolar disorder, and there are few safe and effective treatments. The combination of lamotrigine plus quetiapine potentially offers improved outcomes for people with bipolar depression. We aimed to determine if combination therapy with quetiapine plus lamotrigine leads to greater improvement in depressive symptoms over 12 weeks than quetiapine monotherapy plus lamotrigine placebo.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2 × 2 factorial trial (CEQUEL), patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder I or II, who were aged 16 years or older and required new treatment for a depressive episode, were enrolled from 27 sites in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an adaptive minimization algorithm to lamotrigine or placebo and to folic acid or placebo. Participants and investigators were masked to the treatment groups. The primary outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-self report version 16 (QIDS-SR16). Analysis was by modified intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with EUdraCT, number 2007–004513–33.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 21, 2008, and April 27, 2012, 202 participants were randomly assigned; 101 to lamotrigine and 101 to placebo. The mean difference in QIDS-SR16 total score between the group receiving lamotrigine versus the placebo group at 12 weeks was -1.73 ([95% CI -3.57 to 0.11]; p = 0.066) and at 52 weeks was -2.69 ([-4.89 to -0.49]; p = 0.017). Folic acid was not superior to placebo.

### Quetiapine alone and added to a mood stabilizer for serious mood disorders [^115sxgpc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Use of antipsychotic medication intermittently or over the long term may be necessary in treating patients with bipolar disorder whose symptoms have responded suboptimally to standard mood-stabilizing agents. Quetiapine fumarate is an effective novel antipsychotic with mixed serotonergic (5-HT2) and dopaminergic (D2) activity. This open-label, 12-week prospective study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine in the treatment of patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorder who were suboptimally responsive to mood stabilizers alone.

- **Method**: Participants in the study were inpatients or outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar or schizoaffective disorder. Baseline psychopathology was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Involuntary movements were rated with the Simpson-Angus Neurologic Rating Scale. Quetiapine was added on an open-label basis and increased to optimum clinical dosage. Psychopathology and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ratings were repeated weekly for the first 4 weeks and then again at weeks 8 and 12.

- **Results**: Ten individuals with bipolar disorder and 10 with schizoaffective disorder received quetiapine therapy. Overall, patients improved, with significant improvement in BPRS (p < .001), YMRS (p = .043), and HAM-D scores (p = .002). The Simpson-Angus score also significantly decreased (p = .02). Quetiapine was well tolerated by patients in this group with serious mood disorders.

### A pooled analysis of two randomised, placebo-controlled studies of extended release quetiapine fumarate adjunctive to antidepressant therapy in patients with major depressive disorder [^1155sZtQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Two positive studies evaluated adjunctive extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) showing inadequate response to antidepressant treatment. This preplanned, pooled analysis provides an opportunity for subgroup analyses investigating the influence of demographic and disease-related factors on observed responses. Additional post hoc analyses examined the efficacy of quetiapine XR against specific depressive symptoms, including sleep.

- **Methods**: Data were analysed from two 6-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies, prospectively designed to be pooled. Patients received once-daily quetiapine XR 150 mg/day (n = 309), 300 mg/day (n = 307), or placebo (n = 303) adjunctive to ongoing antidepressant therapy. The primary endpoint was change from randomisation to Week 6 in MADRS total score. Other assessments included MADRS response (≥ 50% decrease in total score) and remission (total score ≤ 8), change from randomisation in HAM-D, HAM-A, PSQI global, and CGI-S scores.

- **Results**: Quetiapine XR (150 and 300 mg/day) reduced MADRS total scores versus placebo at every assessment, including Week 6 (-14.5, -14.8, -12.0; p < 0.001 each dose) and Week 1 (-7.8, -7.3, -5.1; p < 0.001 each dose). For quetiapine XR 150 and 300 mg/day and placebo, respectively, at Week 6: MADRS response 53.7% (p = 0.063), 58.3% (p < 0.01), and 46.2%; MADRS remission 35.6% (p < 0.01), 36.5% (p < 0.001), and 24.1%. Quetiapine XR 150 and 300 mg/day significantly improved HAM-D, HAM-A, PSQI, and CGI-S scores at Week 6 versus placebo.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of quetiapine in the treatment of bipolar I or II depression [^117ETyJf]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

There is a major unmet need for effective options in the treatment of bipolar depression.

- **Method**: Five hundred forty-two outpatients with bipolar I (N = 360) or II (N = 182) disorder experiencing a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of quetiapine (600 or 300 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the mean change from baseline to week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. Additional efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression of severity and improvement, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire.

- **Results**: Quetiapine at either dose demonstrated statistically significant improvement in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total scores compared with placebo from week 1 onward. The proportions of patients meeting response criteria (≥ 50% Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score improvement) at the final assessment in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine were 58.2% and 57.6%, respectively, compared to 36.1% for placebo. The proportions of patients meeting remission criteria (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ≤ 12) were 52.9% in the groups taking 600 and 300 mg/day of quetiapine versus 28.4% for placebo. Quetiapine at 600 and 300 mg/day significantly improved 9 of 10 and 8 of 10 Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale items, respectively, compared to placebo, including the core symptoms of depression. Treatment-emergent mania rates were.

### Effectiveness of the extended release formulation of quetiapine as monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression [^1167ykot]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release once daily in bipolar depression, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in acutely depressed adults with bipolar I or II disorder, with or without rapid cycling. Patients were randomized to 8 weeks of quetiapine extended-release (XR) 300 mg daily monotherapy or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to Week 8 in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.

Quetiapine XR 300 mg once daily (N = 133) showed significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared with placebo (N = 137) from Week 1 (p < 0.05). Rates of response (50% reduction in MADRS total score) and remission (MADRS total score ≤ 12) at Week 8 were significantly higher with quetiapine XR (p < 0.001) compared with placebo (p < 0.05). Quetiapine XR improved core symptoms of depression. The most common adverse events associated with quetiapine XR were dry mouth, somnolence, and sedation. Greater weight gain was observed in patients on quetiapine XR relative to placebo.

Limitations of the study include the fewer number of patients with bipolar II disorder included, the testing of only one fixed dose, and the lack of an active comparator.

In conclusion, quetiapine XR (300 mg) once daily monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo for treating episodes of depression in bipolar I disorder throughout the 8-week study, with significance observed as early as Day 7. Adverse events were consistent with the known profile of the medication.

### Effectiveness of the extended release formulation of quetiapine as monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression [^1173xtv9]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine extended release once daily in treating bipolar depression. It was conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in acutely depressed adults with bipolar I or II disorder, with or without rapid cycling. Patients were randomized to receive eight weeks of quetiapine extended release (XR) 300 mg daily as monotherapy or a placebo.

The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to Week 8 in the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Results showed that quetiapine XR 300 mg once daily (N = 133) demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared to placebo (N = 137) from Week 1 (p < 0.001) through Week 8 (p < 0.001). The mean change in MADRS total score at Week 8 was 17.4 for the quetiapine XR group and -11.9 for the placebo group (p < 0.001). Response (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score) and remission (MADRS total score ≤ 12) rates at Week 8 were significantly higher with quetiapine XR compared to placebo (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Quetiapine XR effectively improved core symptoms of depression.

- **Adverse events**: The most common adverse events associated with quetiapine XR were dry mouth, somnolence, and sedation. Greater weight gain was observed in patients on quetiapine XR relative to placebo.

- **Limitations**: This study included fewer patients with bipolar II disorder, tested only one fixed dose, and lacked an active comparator.

Quetiapine XR (300 mg) once daily monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo for treating episodes of depression in bipolar I disorder throughout the 8-week study, with significant results observed as early as Day 7. Adverse events were consistent with the known effects of the medication.
