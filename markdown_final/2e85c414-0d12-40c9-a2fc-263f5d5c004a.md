## Question

Drugs to reduce elevated bilirubin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about which drugs can reduce elevated bilirubin and how to approach their use step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiology of hyperbilirubinemia and whether we are dealing with unconjugated versus conjugated bilirubin. Then, I should verify which pharmacologic options meaningfully lower bilirubin in neonates versus adults. Next, I will examine drugs that indirectly reduce bilirubin by treating the underlying cause, and I must be careful not to conflate drugs that raise bilirubin with those that lower it. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious algorithm and highlight special populations and monitoring considerations, including Hy's law and drug–drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework: bilirubin elevation is not a single entity, and management hinges on fractionating total bilirubin into direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated) components because the mechanisms and treatments differ substantially. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia reflects overproduction, decreased uptake, or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinemia suggests hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, or biliary obstruction, so I need to ensure I classify the pattern before proposing drugs that "reduce bilirubin" [^113iG5vj] [^113BpbEZ].

> Now, I will examine neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, where pharmacologic options can be justified in select contexts. Phenobarbital induces UGT1A1 and can lower indirect bilirubin, with randomized data showing reduced peak bilirubin and shorter phototherapy duration, though long-term neurodevelopmental benefits remain uncertain and sedation is a trade-off, so I should confirm that its use is reserved for specific scenarios such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or when phototherapy access is limited, and I need to remember that a loading dose may be important for efficacy [^1147jBaJ] [^114UafK3] [^113Q6jKf].

> Wait, let me verify another neonatal adjunct: clofibrate has been studied as an add-on to phototherapy and appears to accelerate bilirubin decline and shorten phototherapy, but the evidence base is limited and heterogeneous, so I should not overstate its role. It remains investigational in many settings and should not replace standard phototherapy or exchange transfusion protocols when indicated [^117CoMv1].

> Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions about metalloporphyrins. Although heme oxygenase inhibitors like tin-mesoporphyrin can reduce bilirubin formation and have shown short-term bilirubin lowering in small trials, concerns about photosensitivity and lack of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome data mean they are not recommended for routine neonatal care at this time, so I need to be explicit that this is not a standard option despite mechanistic appeal [^1174fqTA].

> Next, I should review the mainstay for neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia: phototherapy remains first-line and is highly effective at rapidly lowering bilirubin via photoisomerization, with guideline-driven escalation thresholds and structured monitoring. I need to ensure I emphasize that phototherapy is nonpharmacologic yet the most reliable, evidence-based "treatment" for reducing bilirubin in newborns, and that treatment thresholds are risk-stratified by gestational age and neurotoxicity risk factors [^112Jscfn] [^1149kqgg] [^111y5X1n].

> Shifting to adults, I should confirm that there are essentially no approved drugs whose primary indication is to lower bilirubin. Instead, bilirubin reduction is achieved by treating the underlying liver disease or cholestasis, so I need to check which therapies actually improve cholestatic liver tests and, by extension, bilirubin in specific diseases. For primary biliary cholangitis, ursodeoxycholic acid improves liver biochemistries and slows fibrosis progression, and obeticholic acid as second-line therapy can further improve ALP and bilirubin in incomplete UDCA responders, though pruritus and hepatotoxicity require monitoring, so I should frame these as disease-directed therapies that secondarily lower bilirubin rather than "bilirubin-lowering drugs" per se [^112Yf7bw] [^114boJVx] [^113QdkG3].

> But wait, what if the hyperbilirubinemia is drug-induced from UGT1A1 or transporter inhibition rather than hepatocellular injury? In that case, the most effective "drug to reduce bilirubin" is to stop the offending agent when feasible, and I should double-check common culprits such as atazanavir, pazopanib, and enasidenib, where bilirubin elevations are typically indirect and reversible after withdrawal. Importantly, dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended for bilirubin management because efficacy is unproven at lower doses, so discontinuation or switching is preferred when clinically appropriate [^116o69Dj] [^115XrrFZ] [^116ABCUE] [^116MNBKy].

> I need to ensure I do not conflate drugs that raise bilirubin with those that lower it. Atazanavir predictably increases indirect bilirubin via UGT1A1 inhibition and can cause jaundice, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir can transiently elevate bilirubin via OATP1B1/3 and weak UGT1A1 inhibition, and sarilumab-associated bilirubin rises are largely explained by UGT1A1 genetics rather than liver injury, so these are not candidates for bilirubin reduction and may necessitate dose adjustment or alternative therapy if hyperbilirubinemia is problematic [^116o69Dj] [^113ezzr2] [^116zhHhD].

> Let me consider supportive and indirect strategies that can modestly influence bilirubin handling. Optimizing nutrition, avoiding fasting, and minimizing hemolysis or intercurrent illness can reduce bilirubin load or improve conjugation, and in selected inherited unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias such as Gilbert syndrome, phenobarbital can induce UGT1A1 and lower bilirubin, though cosmetic benefit must be balanced against sedation and is rarely pursued in adults unless jaundice is socially distressing. I should confirm that adult Gilbert syndrome is otherwise benign and typically requires no pharmacologic treatment [^113iG5vj] [^117Wc6tQ].

> I should double-check safety signals and monitoring so we do not miss serious liver injury masquerading as "benign" hyperbilirubinemia. Hy's law remains a cornerstone for predicting severe DILI when ALT or AST are greater than three times the upper limit of normal accompanied by bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of normal without an alternative explanation, so any bilirubin rise with hepatocellular enzyme elevations warrants urgent evaluation and drug cessation rather than attempts to "treat the bilirubin" [^114zraiE] [^115yQeip].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach: first, fractionate total bilirubin and classify the pattern. Second, identify and treat the underlying cause, including stopping hepatotoxic or UGT1A1-inhibiting drugs when possible. Third, in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, use phototherapy per AAP thresholds and consider phenobarbital or clofibrate only in defined scenarios with careful monitoring. Fourth, in adults with cholestatic disease, use UDCA and consider OCA for PBC to improve cholestasis and bilirubin. Fifth, avoid attempting to "treat the number" in isolation and prioritize etiologic therapy and safety monitoring, including INR and albumin when liver injury is suspected [^113iG5vj] [^112Jscfn] [^112Yf7bw] [^114zraiE].

> Finally, I should confirm special populations and caveats: in pregnancy, atazanavir-related indirect hyperbilirubinemia is common but neonatal kernicterus has not been reported, though some guidelines recommend neonatal bilirubin monitoring. In oncology, several chemotherapeutics require bilirubin-based dose modifications, so I need to check labels for agents like irinotecan and asparaginase. And in critical illness, early cholestatic patterns may reflect systemic inflammation rather than primary hepatobiliary disease, so I must avoid premature anchoring and address the underlying insult while monitoring trajectory [^112bVHDY] [^111uVvte] [^111JLAzm] [^112WfMKs].

The main drugs that reduce bilirubin are **phenobarbital** (induces UGT1A1, useful in neonatal jaundice and Crigler-Najjar) [^1147jBaJ] [^114UafK3], **ursodeoxycholic acid** (UDCA, for cholestatic liver disease) [^112Yf7bw], and **obeticholic acid** (OCA, for primary biliary cholangitis) [^114boJVx]. Phototherapy is first-line for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112Jscfn] [^116hPpvt], and exchange transfusion is reserved for severe cases [^113ucFkm]. Atazanavir and other UGT1A1 inhibitors can cause **benign indirect hyperbilirubinemia** [^116o69Dj]; stop or switch the drug if needed [^116MNBKy]. Management should be tailored to the cause, with monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^113iG5vj] [^114zraiE].

## Pharmacological agents that reduce bilirubin levels

Key characteristics of pharmacological agents that reduce bilirubin levels:

| **Aspect** | **Phenobarbital** | **Ursodeoxycholic acid (udca)** | **Obeticholic acid (oca)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Induces hepatic microsomal enzymes, including UGT1A1, increasing bilirubin conjugation and excretion [^1147jBaJ]. | Reduces cholesterol saturation in bile, stabilizes hepatocyte membranes, and improves bile flow, thereby reducing cholestasis and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^notfound]. | Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist that increases bile flow, reduces bile acid synthesis, and decreases inflammation, thereby reducing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^112Yf7bw]. |
| Clinical indications | Neonatal jaundice, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and Gilbert syndrome [^notfound]. | Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and other cholestatic liver diseases [^113QdkG3]. | Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in patients with inadequate response to UDCA or intolerance to UDCA [^114boJVx]. |
| Efficacy | Significantly reduces serum bilirubin levels, particularly in neonates and patients with genetic disorders of bilirubin metabolism [^113Q6jKf]. | Significantly reduces serum bilirubin levels and improves liver function tests in cholestatic conditions [^notfound]. | Significantly reduces serum bilirubin levels and improves liver biochemistry in PBC patients [^112uYw4r]. |
| Limitations | Sedation, respiratory depression, and potential neurodevelopmental effects limit long-term use [^111eZgz3]. | Gastrointestinal side effects, hepatotoxicity in rare cases, and contraindications in patients with complete biliary obstruction [^notfound]. | Pruritus, hepatotoxicity, and contraindications in patients with complete biliary obstruction [^112Yf7bw]. |

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Phototherapy

Phototherapy uses blue-light wavelengths (425–475 nm) to convert unconjugated bilirubin into water-soluble photoisomers for excretion [^111eZgz3]. It is **first-line therapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia** [^116hPpvt]. Phototherapy effectively reduces serum bilirubin levels and prevents bilirubin neurotoxicity [^116DTMgR]. Prolonged exposure may cause skin rash, dehydration, and potential long-term neurodevelopmental effects [^111eZgz3].

---

### Exchange transfusion

Exchange transfusion rapidly removes unconjugated bilirubin and antibodies from circulation. It is **reserved for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia** unresponsive to phototherapy or when bilirubin levels approach neurotoxic thresholds [^113ucFkm]. This approach provides rapid reduction of bilirubin levels and prevents kernicterus [^notfound]. Risks include infection, electrolyte disturbances, and hemodynamic instability [^notfound].

## Drugs associated with elevated bilirubin levels

Several drugs can cause hyperbilirubinemia, either through hepatotoxicity or inhibition of bilirubin metabolism:

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of hyperbilirubinemia** |
|-|-|-|
| Antiretrovirals | Atazanavir, indinavir | Inhibition of UGT1A1, leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^116o69Dj] [^116MNBKy] |
| Antineoplastics | Irinotecan | Inhibition of UGT1A1, leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^notfound] |
| Antibiotics | Rifampin, ceftriaxone | Hepatotoxicity or biliary sludge formation [^notfound] |
| Anticonvulsants | Valproic acid | Hepatotoxicity, leading to mixed hyperbilirubinemia [^notfound] |
| Immunosuppressants | Azathioprine | Hepatotoxicity, leading to mixed hyperbilirubinemia [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia**: Phototherapy is first-line, with exchange transfusion reserved for severe cases. Phenobarbital may be considered in specific neonatal conditions [^113Q6jKf] [^112Jscfn].
- **Cholestatic liver diseases**: UDCA is first-line therapy, with OCA as second-line in PBC patients with inadequate response to UDCA [^112Yf7bw] [^114boJVx].
- **Drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia**: Discontinuation or dose adjustment of the offending drug is recommended, with alternative therapies considered based on clinical context [^112yic8T] [^111JLAzm].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Regular monitoring of **liver function tests**, including bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALP, is essential during pharmacological treatment [^114zraiE]. Clinicians should watch for adverse effects such as sedation, gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatotoxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions [^notfound]. Drug-drug interactions should be assessed — particularly with UGT1A1 inhibitors and inducers — to prevent adverse outcomes [^116MNBKy].

---

Pharmacological agents such as phenobarbital, UDCA, and OCA effectively reduce bilirubin levels, while phototherapy and exchange transfusion remain critical non-pharmacological interventions. Management should be **tailored to the underlying cause**, with careful monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^116o69Dj].

Monitoring

In general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the ULN in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above 2 times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of EPIDIOLEX treatment.

Prior to starting treatment with EPIDIOLEX, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with EPIDIOLEX, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within 1 month following changes in EPIDIOLEX dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver. Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with EPIDIOLEX, as appropriate. Discontinue EPIDIOLEX in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than 3 times the ULN and bilirubin levels greater than 2 times the ULN. Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN should also have treatment discontinued. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes. Consider dosage adjustment of any coadministered medication that is known to affect the liver (e.g., valproate and clobazam).

### UGT1A1 genetic variants are associated with increases in bilirubin levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with sarilumab [^111Y2JzR]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent cause of safety-related postmarketing drug withdrawals and is the most common reason for acute liver failure in the United States. DILI shares many clinical features with other forms of liver injury, making a definitive DILI diagnosis challenging. A DILI diagnosis is usually determined by ruling out other common forms of liver injury, such as gall bladder disease, malignancy, and concomitant hepatotoxic drugs. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin are routinely measured in clinical trials to detect potential signals of drug-induced liver abnormalities. Drug-induced elevations in aminotransferases > 3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) in combination with total bilirubin elevations > 2 × ULN have been termed "Hy's law", and may be indicative of severe hepatocellular injury and DILI. However, a number of drugs can cause transient aminotransferase elevations without progressing to severe liver injury (e.g. aspirin, statins, heparin), and genetic factors can predispose some individuals to hyperbilirubinemia.

The uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 gene (UGT1A1) encodes the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1–1, responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin and glucuronic acid, forming a water-soluble glucuronide that is excreted into the bile. Genetic variation in UGT1A1 has been linked to Gilbert's syndrome, a common benign condition characterized by elevations in unconjugated bilirubin and jaundice in the absence of aminotransferase elevations. The underlying genetic variation responsible for the majority of cases has been identified as a TA repeat polymorphism (UGT1A1 *28 allele) located in the promoter region. UGT1A1 *28 carriers have seven copies of the TA repeat polymorphism [A(TA) 7 TAA] and ~70% reduced UGT1A1 gene expression versus individuals with the more common allele featuring six copies of the TA repeat [A(TA) 6 TAA]. Gilbert's syndrome patients are typically homozygous carriers of the UGT1A1 *28 allele, and have lower UGT1A1 gene expression and diminished bilirubin metabolism. Other variants have been identified that influence UGT1A1 function and are associated with Gilbert's syndrome but are less common than the UGT1A1 *28 allele.

### Phototherapy – traditional and nontraditional [^115eMUz9]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

An observation by an English nurse in 1956 led to the discovery that visible light could lower serum bilirubin levels in newborn infants, and subsequent research showed how photons of light energy are absorbed by the bilirubin molecule converting it into isomers that are readily excreted by the liver and the kidney. Understanding the dose-response effect and other factors that influence the way light works to lower bilirubin levels has led to the effective use of phototherapy and has eliminated the need for exchange transfusion in almost all jaundiced infants.

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of cholestasis in newborn infants [^114vNufD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We will use the following measures of treatment effect.

Binary outcomes (e.g. resolution of cholestasis, mortality): risk ratios (RR) and absolute risk differences (ARD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Continuous outcomes (e.g. serum bilirubin levels, liver enzyme concentrations): mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs if measurement units are consistent across studies; otherwise, standardised mean differences (SMD).
Time‐to‐event outcomes (e.g. time to resolution of hyperbilirubinemia): hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs.
Ordinal outcomes (e.g. severity of cholestasis): analysed as continuous data if assumptions about linearity hold; otherwise, handled appropriately based on data availability and clinical relevance.

Interpretation of effect sizes

Binary outcomes: we will interpret RR values as follows. RR < 1 suggests a lower probability of the event with UDCA. RR > 1 suggests a higher probability of the event with UDCA. The clinical significance of effect sizes will be determined based on credible minimally important differences (MID) identified from published literature relevant to neonatal cholestasis or, if unavailable, from closely related neonatal or paediatric liver disease populations. If we cannot identify suitable published MIDs, we will explicitly state this and justify post‐hoc interpretation using expert consensus and clinical judgement.
Continuous outcomes We will categorise effect sizes using Cohen's SMD thresholds: 0.2 = small effect; 0.5 = moderate effect; 0.8 = large effect. Where possible, we will apply published MIDs to guide interpretation. If no published MIDs exist for a given outcome, we will document this and interpret effect sizes in consultation with clinical experts, ensuring transparency in the review.

Re‐expression of results

If synthesised results need to be expressed using a different effect measure, we will adopt the following approaches.

Convert risk ratios into absolute risk reductions (ARR) based on assumed comparator risks from included studies or external sources.
Use standardised conversion formulas (e.g. log HR to RR) following Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Cardiovascular events as a function of serum bilirubin levels in a large, statin-treated cohort [^114Bqzp4]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Serum bilirubin is an endogenous antioxidant that is routinely measured before a statin is prescribed primarily to assess liver function, but the association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population has not been explored.

Method and Results

We identified patients from a United Kingdom primary care database (The Health Improvement Network) with measurements of serum total bilirubin levels recorded 3 months before the first statin treatment between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, and no history of liver disease or CVD. In total, 130 052 patients met the inclusion criteria, and after a median follow-up of 43 months, there were 7850 CVD events. In men, the incidence of CVD in the lowest decile category of bilirubin (1–6 μmol/L [0.06–0.35 mg/dL]) was 215 per 10 000 person-years compared with 163 per 10 000 person-years in the highest decile (19–40 μmol/L [1.1–2.3 mg/dL]). Similar differences were seen for women. After conventional CVD risk factors were accounted for, the associations with bilirubin were nonlinear (L shaped), and the models predicted that, compared with patients with a bilirubin level of 10 μmol/L (0.6 mg/dL), those with a similar CVD risk profile but a bilirubin level of 5 μmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) had an 18% (95% confidence interval, 9–27) higher risk of any CVD event, a 34% (95% confidence interval, 13–56) higher risk of myocardial infarction, and a 33% (95% confidence interval, 21–46) higher risk of death resulting from any cause.

Conclusions

Serum bilirubin level measured before a statin prescription to assess liver function is an independent risk factor for CVD and death in both men and women.

### Longitudinal blood pressure control, long-term mortality, and predictive utility of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin in hypertensive patients [^115NCifu]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The effect of bilirubin and ALT on longitudinal SBP seems to be more prominent in the older age, in the overweight, and in those who consume alcohol, whereas both ALP and GGT show consistent effect on BP change in all subgroups in the opposite direction. It is possible that the variation in SBP seen with ALT and bilirubin may be because of alteration in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters that are reflected in ALT and bilirubin levels. The results for DBP indicate that both ALT and bilirubin have no effect, whereas there is a clear positive effect of ALP and GGT. There are 2 explanations for these findings: (1) the annual reduction in DBP is much lower than the annual reduction in SBP, so we may not be powered to find any additional BP lowering effect of bilirubin or ALT; (2) bilrubin and ALT do not have a truly causal effect on DBP change, and their effects on outcomes are unrelated to their effect on BP. Nevertheless, these are interesting findings showing the heterogeneity in liver biochemistry effects on BP and require validation in independent controlled studies.

The strengths of the current study include a large cohort of nearly 12 000 hypertensive adults, 35 years of follow-up, high event rates, inclusion of the entire circulating range of liver enzymes (except levels suggestive of significant hepatocyte damage or obstructive liver disease). The generalizability of our findings is limited to middle-aged hypertensive patients of European ancestry. We acknowledge the exclusion of individuals without liver enzymes assessed at baseline from our analysis. However, other baseline demographic characteristics of the excluded population were not different from those included in the study (data not shown). The long period over which our cohort was recruited means there will be variation in laboratory methods and reference values over time. We incorporated a variable on year of first visit strata (epochs) to adjust for secular trends in mortality and biochemical profiles. We have used a nonconventional metric of alcohol use because the coding for alcohol use was not consistent over time — this precluded analyses of alcohol dose effect. One of the inherent limitation of the continuous NRI is that it captures minor shifts in probabilities of outcomes and may be challenging to interpret in terms of clinical utility. Finally, most of the patients were on combination antihypertensive therapy, and the BP control reflects overall BP reduction in a tertiary care clinic and does not inform on the effect of specific antihypertensive drug class.

### Phototherapy: from ancient Egypt to the new millennium [^114FEGMf]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Phototherapy with ultraviolet light was widely and successfully used in the past for treatment of a variety of diseases. Phototherapy with visible light alone has no benefit except in the therapy and prophylaxis of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. For this purpose, radiation in the region of approximately 480 to 500 nm is most effective and radiation above approximately 550 nm is useless. The principle effect of the treatment is not photodegradation of bilirubin, but conversion of the pigment to structural isomers that are more polar and more readily excreted than the normal, more toxic "dark" form of the pigment. This, coupled with some photooxidation of bilirubin, diminishes the overall pool of bilirubin in the body and lowers plasma levels. In the future, phototherapy may be supplanted by pharmacologic treatment, but in the near future, the most likely advance will be the introduction of novel forms of light production and delivery.

### Vadadustat (Vafseo) [^115gTq82]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1	Increased Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction (MI), Stroke, Venous Thromboembolism, and Thrombosis of Vascular Access

VAFSEO increases the risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events, that may be fatal, including myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism and vascular access thrombosis [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of these events. Avoid use in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, or acute coronary syndrome within the 3 months prior to starting VAFSEO.

A rate of hemoglobin rise of greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks may contribute to these risks.	Targeting a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events, as occurs with ESAs, which also increase erythropoietin levels.

No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, dose of VAFSEO, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Adherence to dosing and hemoglobin monitoring recommendations is important to avoid excessive erythropoiesis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, or thrombosis of vascular access. Evaluate and manage promptly if these occur.

5.2	Hepatotoxicity

VAFSEO may cause hepatotoxicity. In clinical trials, hepatocellular injury attributed to VAFSEO was reported in less than 1% of patients, including one case of severe hepatocellular injury with jaundice. All events were asymptomatic and resolved after discontinuation of VAFSEO. The time to onset was generally within the first 3 months of treatment.

Elevated serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin were seen in 1.8%, 1.8% and 0.3% of CKD patients treated with VAFSEO, respectively.

Measure ALT, AST and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months and then monitor as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Discontinue VAFSEO if there is persistent ALT or AST greater than 3 times ULN or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN.

VAFSEO is not recommended in patients with cirrhosis or active, acute liver disease.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes / transporters [^111xNTs2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Elevations in serum bilirubin during drug treatment may indicate global liver dysfunction and a high risk of liver failure. However, drugs also can increase serum bilirubin in the absence of hepatic injury by inhibiting specific enzymes/transporters. We constructed a mechanistic model of bilirubin disposition based on known functional polymorphisms in bilirubin metabolism/transport. Using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model‐predicted drug exposure and enzyme/transporter inhibition constants determined in vitro, our model correctly predicted indinavir‐mediated hyperbilirubinemia in humans and rats. Nelfinavir was predicted not to cause hyperbilirubinemia, consistent with clinical observations. We next examined a new drug candidate that caused both elevations in serum bilirubin and biochemical evidence of liver injury in rats. Simulations suggest that bilirubin elevation primarily resulted from inhibition of transporters rather than global liver dysfunction. We conclude that mechanistic modeling of bilirubin can help elucidate underlying mechanisms of drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia, and thereby distinguish benign from clinically important elevations in serum bilirubin.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115Q7rVJ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HBV/HIV coinfection — ARV-associated transaminase elevations and evaluation: Some ARV agents (especially older drugs, such as nevirapine, tipranavir, and high-dose ritonavir) can increase liver transaminase levels, and the incidence and magnitude of these increases were higher with HBV/HIV coinfection than with HIV mono-infection. Nevertheless, some experts suspend the suspected agent(s) when the serum alanine transferase (ALT) level increases to 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal, or at a lower threshold if the person has symptoms of hepatitis and/or new elevations in bilirubin. However, increased transaminase levels in people with HBV/HIV coinfection may indicate HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen) seroconversion due to immune reconstitution; thus, the cause of the elevations should be investigated before medications are discontinued, HBeAg seroconversion should be evaluated by testing for HBeAg and anti-HBe as well as HBV DNA levels, and other causes of ALT elevation — such as HCV or HIV coinfection, alcohol use, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and hepatotoxicity from non-ARV agents — should also be considered.

### Gilbert syndrome, UGT1A1*28 allele, and cardiovascular disease risk: possible protective effects and therapeutic applications of bilirubin [^113eMugF]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

Serum bilirubin has been shown to be inversely related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both retrospective and prospective studies. Meta-analysis of existing studies has also confirmed that serum bilirubin concentrations are inversely related to CVD. Less information is known about the protective effects of slightly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations. In this review, we will focus primarily on the association of serum bilirubin and CVD and the possible protective roles of bilirubin, heme oxygenase (HO), and bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1). HO and biliverdin reductase control the formation of bilirubin, whereas UGT1A1 controls bilirubin conjugation and clearance. Because of the health and therapeutic implications of slightly elevated serum bilirubin concentrations, we will discuss the recent prospective studies on cardiovascular risk in individuals with Gilbert syndrome (GS) as well as those with the UGT1A1*28 allele. Such individuals have decreased hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, decreased bilirubin clearance, and increased serum bilirubin concentrations. Lastly, we will discuss some of the therapeutic approaches that could be used to increase serum bilirubin concentrations to prevent CVD and other oxidative and inflammatory diseases.

### Therapy in congenital hyperbilirubinemia: phenobarbital and diethylnicotinamide… [^117Wc6tQ]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Two different drugs, phenobarbital and diethylnicotinamide, were compared for their efficacy in treating congenital hyperbilirubinemia. Phenobarbital is known to be effective in reducing bilirubin levels in children and adults. The therapeutic effect of oral diethylnicotinamide has not been evaluated; the drug has only been used intramuscularly in newborn twins. Two sisters, ages 4 and 10, with the clinical picture of the Crigler-Najjar syndrome were given therapeutic trials of phenobarbital and diethylnicotinamide. Both drugs lowered the serum bilirubin levels, but there were quantitative differences in their lowering effect. Phenobarbital caused a marked drop of the total bilirubin, and both children became anicteric. Diethylnicotinamide was less effective in lowering their bilirubin.

The lowest levels achieved in these two patients were 13. 2 mg/100 mL and
8. 8 mg/100 ml, respectively, and both remained jaundiced. There was also an enhanced lowering effect observed with a larger dose of phenobarbital which was not observed when a larger dose of diethylnicotinamide was administered. These studies suggest that phenobarbital is the agent of choice for therapy of congenital hyperbilirubinemia. The medical indications for therapy are the prevention of kernicterus and the psychological advantage of rendering these children anicteric. Comments.

Estrogen therapy, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, are sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia. In such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia. Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of fenofibrate if lipid levels fall significantly below the targeted range. Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 145 mg once daily.
2. 2 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia.

Many patients had concurrent elevations of total bilirubin, serum alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. DILI has been characterized as hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis has occurred in association with chronic active hepatitis. In clinical trials, fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 96 mg to 145 mg fenofibrate daily has been associated with increases in serum AST or ALT. The incidence of increases in transaminases may be dose related. Discontinue fenofibrate if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop or if elevated enzyme levels persist. Do not restart fenofibrate in these patients if there is no alternative explanation for the liver injury. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is rapid and sustained.

The clinical significance of this decrease in HDL-C is unknown. It is recommended that HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline, and fibrate therapy should not be re-initiated.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes / transporters [^111AfHzz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Bilirubin, the product of heme breakdown from red blood cells, is exclusively eliminated by the liver. Thus, circulating bilirubin is widely used as a diagnostic biomarker for liver function. Large postmarketing studies of patients with drug‐induced liver injury (DILI) show that ∼10% of subjects with hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice die or require a liver transplant. 1, 2, 3 In the setting of a clinical trial of a new drug candidate, elevations in serum bilirubin may also indicate severe liver injury with global hepatic dysfunction. The 2009 US Food and Drug Administration guidance on assessing liver safety in clinical trials defines the "Hy's Law Case" as a trial subject who experiences a hepatocellular injury with concomitant elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and serum total bilirubin (TB) elevation > 2× ULN when there is no more likely cause than the study drug. The existence of Hy's Law Cases in a clinical trial database is interpreted as indicating that the study drug is capable of causing liver failure, a conclusion that can lead to termination of the development program, requirement of extended clinical trials to assess risk management strategies, or restricted indications. Therefore, the observation of hyperbilirubinemia during clinical trials or postmarketing can raise concern about irreversible liver injury with serious regulatory consequences.

### Effects of phenobarbitone on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^111eZgz3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal jaundice is a significant global health concern. Neonatal jaundice is a significant concern due to its potential association with neurotoxicity, making it a source of anxiety for both parents and physicians. If left untreated or inadequately managed, it can result in neonatal mortality or severe complications, including seizures in the temporal and occipital lobes, commonly known as bilirubin encephalopathy.

While phototherapy remains a primary treatment, exchange transfusion is employed in cases of severe jaundice. However, exchange transfusion carries substantial risks, including morbidity and mortality, as well as complications associated with blood product exposure. The risk is further exacerbated in small and preterm infants. Therefore, a prophylactic intervention capable of preventing total serum bilirubin (TSB) from reaching dangerous levels would be a more effective approach for both term and preterm neonates.

Among these approaches, phototherapy has become the most widely used non-pharmacological method for preventing and treating unconjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Its widespread adoption is attributed to its simplicity, non-invasiveness, cost-effectiveness, and ease of application. Phototherapy converts bilirubin into a water-soluble form that is easily eliminated, leading to a reduction in total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels. Light in the blue-green spectrum, with wavelengths ranging from 425 to 475 nm, interacts biochemically with bilirubin deposited in the skin of jaundiced neonates, promoting its breakdown and excretion.

Phototherapy units are widely used to treat unconjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, they are challenging and costly to maintain. However, it might induce hyperthermia, skin rash, diarrhea, dehydration, and retinal damage and does not prevent the accumulation of bilirubin and the need for ET in all cases. As an alternative for the prevention and treatment of jaundice, phenobarbitone has been shown to be both safe and effective in lowering serum bilirubin levels in neonates. Phenobarbitone reduces jaundice by promoting the excretion of bilirubin. It enhances glucuronidation through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes and increases the production of receptor proteins for bilirubin uptake. However, Phenobarbitone also has some side effects, such as hypotension and respiratory depression, and it can lead to cognitive decline in infants. We will also provide an analysis of the potential adverse effects of phenobarbital.

Both phenobarbitone and phototherapy are effective in reducing the peak serum bilirubin (PSB) level.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of phenobarbitone on reducing the need for phototherapy, the duration of phototherapy, peak bilirubin levels, the likelihood of exchange transfusion, and weight loss.

### Inhibition of OATP1B1 / 3 rather than UGT1A1 may Be the major cause of the bilirubin elevation after atazanavir administration [^1115HCxB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Atazanavir is generally safe and well‐tolerated. However, total bilirubin elevation is common after atazanavir administration and is manifested in virtually every patient treated with atazanavir/ritonavir (atazanavir/r). Grade ≥ 3 and 4 bilirubin elevation occurred with a frequency of ~40% and ~4–8%, respectively, with atazanavir/r treatment. Up to ~9‐fold total bilirubin increase was reported when administering 300 mg atazanavir alone twice daily (b.d.). Anti‐HIV regimens containing atazanavir/r were downgraded to alternative status based on a large comparative trial showing a greater rate of toxicity‐related (primarily hyperbilirubinemia) discontinuation than those with either darunavir/ritonavir (darunavir/r) or raltegravir. As the risk for bilirubin‐related discontinuation is highest among UGT1A1 poor metabolizers (PM), the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) recommended prescribing atazanavir based on UGT1A1 genetic status and considering an alternative agent for PM.

Diagnostic approach to DILI

DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, relying on a detailed medical history including medication exposure, the pattern and course of liver biochemistry tests before and after drug discontinuation, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. The initial laboratory testing for DILI includes serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and total and direct bilirubin levels, whereas serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) levels are a marker of severity (Figure 1). Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: (1) serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; (2) total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl along with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP level; or (3) INR > 1.5 with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI may present with lower levels of laboratory abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries because of NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Aging and liver health: liver chemistries and associated factors in community-dwelling older adults [^1141WAyt]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Liver chemistries can detect liver health or damage, as they are affected by physiological, biological, and medical factors. For example, AST is released at elevated levels from injured liver cells; ALP is released excessively when cholestasis occurs. Total bilirubin reflects hepatobiliary excretion, which can be elevated by infection, chemical toxicity, and some cancers. Other tests evaluate the liver's synthetic and metabolic capabilities (e.g. albumin) and are thus true assessments of liver function. Biological factors also play a part, as variations occur by age and sex; some experts call for separate reference ranges for children, adults and older adults, and for men and women. ALT, albumin, and total protein levels are reported as higher in men relative to women, and lower in older adult population compared to younger adults. Albumin levels differ among older people, with lower levels associated with lower household incomes, poor nutritional status, and loss of muscle mass. Certain liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and drug-induced liver injury tend to be more common in older adults due to the increased metabolic risk with aging. Some long-term medications used by older people with medical conditions, e.g. for hyperlipidemia and gout, are recognized for their potential to cause liver toxicity.

In recent years, statins, used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and in patients with cardiovascular disease, have received significant social media and internet coverage, with messaging focused on the risks rather than the benefits. Public awareness and knowledge of statin effects remains poor and possibly influenced by these media outlets. In Singapore, statins are widely prescribed for treatment of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disorders, particularly in older people. A local study highlighted concerns that statins may have adverse effects, with up to 70% believing that statins will cause them liver or kidney damage, which naturally would compromise on compliance of these drugs. The efficacy of statin use, particularly in the older population, has been called into question, but meta-analysis has shown statin benefits in reduction of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. However, statin dosing still needs to be individualized with consideration of a risk-benefit ratio.

### Doxorubicin pharmacokinetics and toxicity in patients with aggressive lymphoma and hepatic impairment [^111tED3t]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Aggressive lymphomas are curable with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. In patients presenting with elevated serum bilirubin, doxorubicin is commonly dose reduced or delayed based on limited pharmacokinetic data. We evaluated plasma pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol as well as toxicity in 59 patients with normal bilirubin levels and 10 patients with elevated bilirubin levels. Patients received full-dose EPOCH ± rituximab. Median (range) age was 51 (18–75) years. Patients with elevated bilirubin levels had higher international prognostic index and poorer performance status. Although median doxorubicin clearance was lower and median plasma doxorubicin and doxorubicinol concentrations were higher in patients with elevated bilirubin levels, values were within the concentration range observed in patients with normal levels. Rates of febrile neutropenia were similar between groups, but there was greater grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia during the first but not subsequent treatment cycles in patients with elevated bilirubin. More grade 3/4 gastrointestinal and neurotoxicity occurred in patients with elevated bilirubin during the first but not subsequent cycles. Although toxicity was greater on cycle 1, the adverse effects were managed safely. These results show that empiric dose reductions of continuous infusion doxorubicin may not be necessary in patients with elevated bilirubin levels. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00001337, #NCT00069238, and #NCT00005780.

Although the inhibitory potential for bilirubin enzyme/transporters can be assessed using in vitro studies, it remains a challenge to translate these in vitro data to in vivo and to predict the net effects of inhibition of multiple steps involved in bilirubin disposition. In addition, interpretation is not straightforward when hyperbilirubinemia is observed with and without concomitant serum ALT elevations in clinical trials. This is because some drugs without hepatic liabilities can cause high and frequent elevations in serum ALT. 1 In such cases, distinguishing hyperbilirubinemia that is mediated by liver injury from enzyme/transporter‐mediated interaction is challenging.

### Cholestatic alterations in the critically ill: some new light on an old problem [^112WfMKs]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Liver dysfunction and jaundice are traditionally viewed as late features of sepsis and other critical illnesses and are associated with a complicated ICU stay. However, study results suggest that cholestatic alterations occur early in the course of critical illnesses, perceived only as minor abnormalities in routinely used biochemical liver tests. Inflammation-induced alterations in the transport of bile acids (BAs) appear to drive BAs and bilirubin toward the systemic circulation. Ongoing BA synthesis with an, at least partial, loss of feedback inhibition further contributes to elevated circulating BAs and bilirubin. To what extent these changes reflect a biochemical epiphenomenon, true illness-induced liver dysfunction, or a beneficial and adaptive response to illness should be investigated further. Because of the lack of specificity of standard laboratory tests, especially in the context of a complex systemic condition such as critical illness, identifying true cholestatic liver dysfunction remains a great challenge. However, high levels of cholestatic markers that are sustained in patients with prolonged critical illness almost always indicate a complicated illness course and should be monitored closely. Preventing cholestatic liver dysfunction comprises minimizing inflammation and hypoxia in the liver and preventing hyperglycemia, avoiding early use of parenteral nutrition, and reducing the administration of avoidable drugs. Future research on the effects of BAs and on modulating underlying drivers of cholestasis induced by critical illness is warranted as this could open perspectives for a targeted diagnostic approach and ultimately for novel therapies to improve outcome.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^115yQeip]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) terminology and definitions — Table 3 defines intrinsic DILI as hepatotoxicity with potential to affect all individuals and idiosyncratic DILI as affecting only rare susceptible individuals; chronic DILI is failure of return of liver enzymes or bilirubin to baseline 6–9 mo after DILI onset. Latency is time from medication or herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) start to DILI onset, washout/resolution/dechallenge is time from onset to return of enzymes and/or bilirubin to baseline, and rechallenge is readministration of the agent after a prior DILI. Hy's law notes 8–10% mortality or need for LT when DILI presents with serum ALT or AST > 3×ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2×ULN without initial cholestasis and no alternate explanation. Temple's corollary identifies an imbalance of ALT > 3×ULN between active and control arms in randomized trials and is used to assess hepatotoxic potential, although its specificity for predicting DILI liability is limited. The R-value is ALT/ULN ÷ Alk P/ULN and classifies patterns as hepatocellular (R > 5), mixed (R = 2–5), or cholestatic (R < 2). RUCAM is a diagnostic algorithm using clinical data, pre-existing hepatotoxicity literature, and rechallenge.

### Atazanavir: new option for treatment of HIV infection [^111GhY4k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Atazanavir is a recently approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor that has an important role in the treatment of both antiretroviral-naive and antiretroviral-experienced individuals. Atazanavir (400 mg) can be administered once per day and requires only 2 capsules. Drug exposure can be safely increased with coadministration of a once-daily regimen of atazanavir (300 mg) and ritonavir (100 mg). Atazanavir is not associated with elevations in serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides, potentially reducing the need for lipid-lowering agents. Atazanavir is associated with elevations in unconjugated bilirubin levels, which are usually not dose limiting. For treatment-naive patients receiving atazanavir who experience virologic rebound, the I50L mutation in HIV protease arises, which does not confer cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors. In treatment-experienced patients with high-level resistance to other protease inhibitors, susceptibility to atazanavir is usually reduced, and optimal effects of atazanavir are seen when it is administered with ritonavir. Similar to other protease inhibitors, careful attention must be paid to drug interactions when administering atazanavir with concomitant medications.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^111y5X1n]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — scope and updates since 2004 emphasize universal predischarge screening and refined treatment thresholds: The 2004 guideline focused on infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and clarified distinctions between "hyperbilirubinemia risk factors" and "hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors", adding universal predischarge bilirubin screening with measures of total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) linked to specific follow-up. Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia was defined as TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL, and its incidence decreased in at least 3 large US health systems after adoption of universal predischarge bilirubin screening with closer postdischarge follow-up. Because newer evidence was insufficient to set fully new thresholds, the committee began with the previous AAP guidelines, raised the phototherapy thresholds by a narrow range considered to be safe, revised the risk-assessment approach based on the hour-specific bilirubin concentration, and defined rapid response to elevated bilirubin concentrations as "escalation of care".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Gilbert syndrome and the development of antiretroviral therapy-associated hyperbilirubinemia [^112t2hog]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from Gilbert syndrome and from antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing protease inhibitors. An understanding of the interaction between genetic predisposition and ART may help to identify individuals at highest risk for developing jaundice.

Methods

We quantified the contribution of UGT1A1*28 and ART to hyperbilirubinemia by longitudinally modeling 1386 total bilirubin levels in 96 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals during a median of 6 years.

Results

The estimated average bilirubin level was 8.8 micromol/L (0.51 mg/dL). Atazanavir increased bilirubin levels by 15 mu mol/L (0.87 mg/dL), and indinavir increased bilirubin levels by 8 micromol/L (0.46 mg/dL). Ritonavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir had no or minimal effect on bilirubin levels. Homozygous UGT1A1*28 increased bilirubin levels by 5.2 micromol/L (0.3 mg/dL). As a consequence, 67% of individuals homozygous for UGT1A1*28 and receiving atazanavir or indinavir had ≥ 2 episodes of hyperbilirubinemia in the jaundice range (> 43 micromol/L [> 2.5 mg/dL]), versus 7% of those with the common allele and not receiving either of those protease inhibitors (P < .001). Efavirenz resulted in decreased bilirubin levels, which is consistent with the induction of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1.

Conclusions

Genotyping for UGT1A1*28 before initiation of ART would identify HIV-infected individuals at risk for hyperbilirubinemia and decrease episodes of jaundice.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^1149UGfc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards. Our protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42019145747).

Data sources and searches

We searched MEDLINE® and Embase databases using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019) for peer-reviewed, English language studies. The search strategy for the MEDLINE® search is provided in Additional file 1: Appendix 1.

Study selection

Two authors (AKB and DMM) independently reviewed each study at the abstract and full-text level to determine eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and evaluation by a third reviewer, if needed.

Reports were eligible if they were randomized or observational (cohort, cross-sectional, case control) studies that enrolled participants greater than 18 years of age. We did not exclude studies based on pulmonary function or pulmonary diagnoses and included studies conducted in both general populations and in samples restricted to those with obstructive lung disease. We excluded case reports and case series, studies published in only abstract form, and those without a full text publication in English. We did not have a numerical cutoff for bilirubin levels because there are no defined criteria for what constitutes a pathologic elevation in bilirubin, but we excluded studies evaluating elevations in serum bilirubin in the context of hepatobiliary diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Eligible studies reported serum bilirubin levels and any outcome of interest related to our three key questions.

Outcome measures

We examined clinically important outcomes by cross sectional measures and longitudinal measures. Clinical effect sizes are included in Additional file 1: Appendix 2.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Phototherapy: current methods and future directions [^116hPpvt]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Phototherapy is the most common therapeutic intervention used for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. Although it has become a mainstay since its introduction in 1958, a better understanding of the photobiology of bilirubin, characteristics of the phototherapy devices, the efficacy and safety considerations of phototherapy applications, and improvements in spectroradiometers and phototherapy devices are necessary for more predictable and improved clinical practices and outcomes. A step forward in instituting consistent, uniform, and effective use of phototherapy is the recent American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guideline on the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation, which outlines a clinical strategy for the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia and contains direct recommendations for the application of phototherapy. This article reviews the parameters that determine the efficacy of phototherapy, briefly discusses current devices and methods used to deliver phototherapy, and speculates on future directions and studies that are still needed to complement our presently incomplete knowledge of the facets of this common mode of therapy.

### Phototherapy for neonatal jaundice – therapeutic effects on more than one level? [^116DTMgR]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Phototherapy for jaundice is a common treatment in neonatal medicine and is used to prevent the neurotoxic effects of bilirubin. Studies have assessed the optimal wavelength of phototherapy light, the importance of irradiance and spectral power, and the types of light source, including the use of single versus multiple light sources. Outcome measures have been duration of need for phototherapy or rate of reduction of serum bilirubin over a given time. An apparent resurgence of kernicterus in recent years has forced us to focus on the emergency management of severely jaundiced infants. Several studies have shown that very rapid reductions of total serum bilirubin levels are possible. The speed with which photoisomers are formed appears to be important both from this perspective and theoretically may also be neuroprotective because of the more polar nature of the photoisomers. This work reviews the evidence concerning the speed of photoisomer formation, as well as the evidence regarding the relative neurotoxicity of bilirubin isomers.

### UGT1A1 genetic variants are associated with increases in bilirubin levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with sarilumab [^116zhHhD]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin (IL)-6Rα that has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Mild liver function test abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with sarilumab. We describe a genome-wide association study of bilirubin elevations in RA patients treated with sarilumab. Array genotyping and exome sequencing were performed on DNA samples from 1075 patients. Variants in the UGT1A1 gene were strongly associated with maximum bilirubin elevations in sarilumab-treated patients (rs4148325; p = 2.88×10–41) but were not associated with aminotransferase elevations. No other independent loci showed evidence of association with bilirubin elevations after sarilumab treatment. These findings suggest that most bilirubin increases during sarilumab treatment are related to genetic variation in UGT1A1 rather than underlying liver injury.

### Targeting inflammation to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in people with HIV infection [^113567yG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin

Bilirubin has been shown to have antiatherogenic characteristics attributed, in part, to its antioxidant properties. 142 Individuals with Gilbert syndrome, who have a hereditary inability to conjugate bilirubin and elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin as a result, have lower rates of stroke, coronary artery disease, and other inflammatory conditions. 143 This property has been studied as a possible intervention to reduce the risk of CVD for HIV‐negative individuals with diabetes mellitus. Through the use of pharmacological interventions, which increase serum bilirubin levels, several studies have shown a decrease in CVD with elevated bilirubin levels in patients with diabetes mellitus. 144, 145, 146 More recently, analyses of 96,381 participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, one‐third of whom were HIV positive, showed that an elevated bilirubin level is inversely correlated with CVD among both HIV‐positive and ‐negative individuals. 147 Bilirubin elevations are common during treatment with the protease inhibitor, atazanavir. In a prospective RCT on CIMT, elevated bilirubin in study participants receiving atazanavir appeared to favorably influence CIMT progression rates. 148 These findings raise the interesting prospect of harnessing the protective effect of elevated bilirubin to reduce cardiovascular risk in PLWH.

### Effects of phenobarbitone on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^114UafK3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of phenobarbitone in managing hyperbilirubinemia in both preterm and term neonates. Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction was observed in peak serum bilirubin levels, duration of phototherapy, the need for phototherapy, and the likelihood of exchange transfusion with phenobarbitone use, although no significant effect was found on weight loss.

Phenobarbitone reduces the occurrence of jaundice primarily by enhancing hepatic enzyme activity, especially by inducing the expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). This enzyme plays a critical role in the conjugation and subsequent excretion of bilirubin. By accelerating bilirubin metabolism, phenobarbitone facilitates its conversion into a water-soluble form, promoting elimination through bile and reducing its accumulation in the bloodstream. Furthermore, phenobarbitone enhances hepatic uptake and clearance of unconjugated bilirubin, further lowering serum bilirubin levels. These mechanisms contribute to its effectiveness in preventing and managing jaundice, particularly in neonates at risk of hyperbilirubinemia.

As there is only one study investigating the adverse effects, making it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis. However, Phenobarbital requires a loading dose of 10 mg/kg/day in two divided doses 1 to 2 h apart to achieve equilibration in the various body compartments. In addition, phenobarbital has a very long half-life (t1/2), and it may be necessary to monitor serum levels.

One of the five included studies have used loading dose of phenobarbitone. Two intervention groups were used, with one group receiving a loading dose of 20 mg/kg. The study reported that the beneficial effects of phenobarbitone were more pronounced when the loading dose was administered at the start of phototherapy. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of phenobarbitone administered without a loading dose showed an increase in plasma drug levels throughout the treatment period, with no achievement of a steady state even after 7 days of therapy. Therefore, the administration of a loading dose and its appropriate amount may be crucial for achieving the clinical benefits of phenobarbitone. The collected data did not include studies on side effects, as only one study analyzed adverse effects, preventing the possibility of a meta-analysis on this topic. This highlights the need for further research to conduct a comprehensive safety assessment of phenobarbitone therapy.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (indications for discontinuation), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing phototherapy when the total serum bilirubin has decreased by at least 2 mg/dL below the hour-specific threshold at the initiation of phototherapy. Consider continuing phototherapy for a longer period if there are risk factors for rebound hyperbilirubinemia (such as gestational age < 38 weeks, age < 48 hours at the start of phototherapy, hemolytic disease).

Elevated Aminotransferases and Risk of Liver Injury

Zimmermanobserved that drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice potentially predicted serious and even fatal outcomes. Subsequently, "Hy law" was coined and defined as serum ALT levels > 3×ULN combined with total bilirubin levels > 2×ULN, after the exclusion of other underlying causes to help identify patients most likely to progress to serious liver injury. Elevated ALT levels are sensitive for liver injury and, although not entirely specific, are viewed as being more predictive than AST levels. Healthy liver tissue has excess bilirubin-excreting capacity; therefore, hepatic injury sufficient to cause hyperbilirubinemia (ie, 2×ULN) represents a degree of hepatocyte loss that may become irreversible.

Hy law criteria have been historically useful for predicting serious drug-induced hepatocellular liver injury, with ~1 in 10 Hy law cases leading to death from liver-related causes or the need for liver transplant. Failure to detect a Hy law case in clinical trials does not imply an acceptable hepatocellular safety profile because large clinical trials (> 3000 patients) are needed for a high probability of detection, trial sizes that are rare in oncology. However, the detection of ≥ 2 Hy law cases in clinical trials is a strong predictor of significant risk and may prevent further development.

Even when Hy law cases are detected during clinical evaluation, the risk:benefit to the population must be considered before determining whether clinical trials should continue. In oncology, some degree of hepatotoxicity may be acceptable given the potential benefit provided. The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) general recommendations for evaluating and monitoring symptomatic DILI in clinical trials suggest that modification for special patient populations (eg, oncology) may be needed, particularly for those with underlying hepatic involvement. Recent approvals of oncotherapeutics demonstrate that a certain degree of hepatotoxicity, with careful monitoring of hepatic function, is acceptable to bring novel potentially life-prolonging drugs to market (Table 1). For instance, the risk of hepatotoxicity among all new drug classes was highest for oncotherapeutic agents approved by the FDA in recent years.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the 2000s: what should we do next? [^113T214o]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in healthcare policy mandating early discharge of healthy, full-term infants and the higher prevalence of breast-feeding of newborns have contributed to an increased number of term infants being readmitted to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia. At high levels, total serum bilirubin causes kernicterus, which is associated with severe neurological sequelae. This article provides a review of prior studies that have examined whether and at what levels total serum bilirubin affects neurodevelopmental outcome in term infants. In addition, the article reviews some approaches in the literature that suggest means of preventing high levels of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes / transporters [^113ofpM1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

However, drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia is not always indicative of hepatotoxicity. Drugs may also increase serum bilirubin in the absence of hepatic injury by inhibiting enzymes/transporters that are involved in hepatic elimination of bilirubin. Serum bilirubin consists of conjugated bilirubin (CB) and unconjugated bilirubin (UB). UB is released to the circulation with red blood cell degradation and is taken up into hepatocytes by active transport (organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1/1B3) and passive diffusion. 4, 5, 6 Once inside the hepatocytes, UB is metabolized to CB (glucuronide conjugate, primarily) by UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1. 7 Liver‐generated CB is excreted into bile by multidrug resistance‐associated protein (MRP)2, or transported back to sinusoidal blood by the efflux transporter MRP3, and then taken up again by downstream hepatocytes by OATP1B1/1B3. 6, 8, 9, 10 Patients with inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism and/or transport (e.g. Rotor Syndrome (RS), Gilbert's Syndrome (GS), Crigler‐Najjar Syndrome (CNS), and Dubin‐Johnson Syndrome (DJS)) exhibit elevated serum bilirubin, suggesting that modulation of any of these enzyme‐mediated and transport‐mediated processes by drugs may increase serum bilirubin (Figure 1). 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 Several studies have reported that drugs with potent in vitro inhibition for enzyme/transporters that mediate bilirubin disposition at clinical exposure levels are associated with hyperbilirubinemia. 15, 16, 17

### Prognostic value of bilirubin and drug interactions [^113upVkd]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 infection entails a hyperinflammatory response. The increase in inflammatory activity may impact on indirect bilirubin levels. According to pre-clinical models, inflammation decreases UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and UGT2B5 mRNA expression. This might be related to specific cytokine changes. Glucuronidation was inhibited 51% by IL-6 expression at 24 hours in porcine hepatocytes. As COVID-19 is associated with increased IL-6 levels, glucuronidation in COVID-19 patients is expected to be further dampened. Hence, by logic, indirect bilirubin levels increase with disease severity. There is also evidence of cholangiocyte injury due to higher ACE2 expression - a key target of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to that a substantial proportion of patients experienced GGT elevation, direct bilirubin should also increase. It is therefore interesting why only a small proportion of the cohort experienced total bilirubin elevation. An even more surprising note is that only total bilirubin elevation and hypoalbuminaemia were significantly correlated with COVID-19-related mortality. Total bilirubin elevation was not significantly associated with severe COVID-19.

Such interesting correlations can be explored further by elucidating the changes of direct and indirect bilirubin levels in patients with COVID-19. There is a possibility that the increase of either is compensated by the decrease of the other, via different mechanisms. Another point of interest is the role of drugs. The authors have commented that since at-admission (baseline) parameters were used for prognostication, drug-induced liver injury is unlikely. Adjustment was also made for comorbidities. However, since many patients have chronic diseases (arterial hypertension: 53.0%; diabetes mellitus type II: 23.5%; coronary artery disease: 19.8%), it is likely that chronic medication is taken. Such medications can introduce variations to the study findings by interacting with COVID-19-related medication, and/or causing liver injury. Moreover, drug regimens can lead to fluctuations in bilirubin levels. The importance of investigating direct and indirect bilirubin levels separately is augmented by recent studies showing that direct bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin/direct bilirubin ratio are predictive of disease severity.

There is thus an attraction to clarify the prognostic value of bilirubin levels in COVID-19 infection, preferably by analysing direct and indirect bilirubin levels separately.

Regarding medical management for acute lymphoblastic leukemia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of drug toxicity (asparaginase, specific toxicities), NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to continue asparaginase for direct bilirubin levels ≤ 3.0 mg/dL. For direct bilirubin levels between 3.1–5.0 mg/dL, hold asparaginase until levels are < 2.0 mg/dL, then resume. For direct bilirubin levels > 5.0 mg/dL, either discontinue asparaginase or hold until levels are < 2.0 mg/dL, then resume with consideration for dose reduction and close monitoring.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111BhffF]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV/HBV coinfection — antiretroviral therapy (ART)-associated hepatotoxicity risk and management: Flares are more among people with more severe liver disease, especially those with cirrhosis, and risk is associated with elevated pre-ART aminotransferases and the presence of HBV or HCV coinfection; in HIV/HBV coinfection, baseline elevated HBV DNA levels are predictive of hepatotoxicity. Despite this increased risk, most (90%) people with HIV/HBV coinfection do not have ART-associated hepatotoxicity, and clinically significant hepatotoxicity is rare; aminotransferase levels return to baseline in most cases even if the offending medication is continued, so discontinuing ART usually is not necessary unless hypersensitivity, symptomatic hepatitis, or elevations in serum aminotransferase levels > 10 times the upper limit of normal (AIII) are observed. If aminotransferases increase > 2 times the baseline level, the Panel recommends monitoring aminotransferases weekly and also obtaining bilirubin and INR until the aminotransferases begin declining (AIII); other noninfectious causes of abnormal liver tests that should be considered include use of drugs or alcohol and steatotic liver disease.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Positive association between serum bilirubin within the physiological range and serum testosterone levels [^117352pq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, mildly elevated bilirubin is beneficial to the human body. Individuals with Gilbert's Syndrome (GS), characterized by mild bilirubin elevation due to UGT1A1 gene abnormalities, exhibit lower body weight and reduced rates of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The role of bilirubin in reducing inflammation and metabolic complications may account for its anti-aging benefits, especially in overweight individuals. Our subgroup analysis revealed a protective effect of STB in preventing TD among obese males over 60 years old. This finding suggests that bilirubin may play a crucial role in maintaining healthier TT levels by mitigating chronic inflammation and oxidative stress linked to obesity and aging.

Furthermore, our findings revealed a significant negative correlation between STB and TD among non-smokers and non-drinkers. The reported effects of smoking on TT levels are inconsistent and contradictory. Some studies have identified a positive correlation between smoking and TT levels, while others have observed a non-significant association between the two. Another study found that the positive correlation between smoking and TT weakened in individuals over 60 years old. Our study found that among current or former smokers, subgroup analysis did not reveal a significant inverse correlation between STB and TD, suggesting that smoking may interfere with bilirubin's protective influence on TT secretion. Additionally, evidence suggests that chronic excessive alcohol consumption could increase the risk of TD. Alcohol consumption elevates oxidative stress, damaging interstitial cells and Sertoli cells, leading to decreased TT levels. Our research highlights the significant protective effect of STB against TD, particularly in non-drinkers, indicating that alcohol consumption may interfere with the relationship between STB and TT. The precise mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be elucidated.

It is essential to recognize certain limitations of our study. The cross-sectional design of the NHANES survey prevents establishing causality between serum bilirubin and TT levels. The absence of data on direct and indirect bilirubin leaves ambiguity about which type is more significantly associated with TT levels. Additionally, the majority of TT is closely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), with only a small fraction existing in a free form with metabolic effects. The assessment of free TT is considered more precise for identifying male TD. However, this survey lacks data on free TT, necessitating further research to investigate its correlation with bilirubin. Furthermore, there may have been insufficient control over potential confounders such as medication use and dietary habits, which could impact bilirubin and TT levels.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Primary biliary cholangitis drug evaluation and regulatory approval: where do we go from here? [^112uYw4r]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

At the heart of this conundrum is a paradox. We have a series of drugs that clearly improve liver blood tests that when elevated are associated with the risk of liver complications and death in PBC, but have struggled to prove directly that these new agents actually reduce that risk. There are 2 potential explanations for this paradox, and understanding which is correct will be crucial in the next stage of the journey of PBC therapy.

The first potential explanation is that our understanding of the association between liver biochemical tests and the risk of death for OCA is incorrect. The association has been proven for patients who are untreated and those who are treated with UDCA but may not hold true for OCA as a second-line therapy. At face value, this "null hypothesis" feels implausible and difficult to explain biologically. The blood test–based improvement with OCA is multifaceted, with benefits for ALP, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase that are unrelated in terms of their transcription or formation and elimination. Moreover, any effect of OCA in terms of transcription of ALP (as opposed to modification of the biological process of cholestasis) actually leads to underestimation rather than overestimation of its benefits.

We provide an approach to the use of phototherapy and exchange transfusion in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants of < 35 weeks of gestation. Because there are limited data for evidence-based recommendations, these recommendations are, of necessity, consensus-based. The recommended treatment levels are based on operational thresholds for bilirubin levels and represent those levels beyond which it is assumed that treatment will likely do more good than harm. Long-term follow-up of a large population will be needed to evaluate whether or not these recommendations should be modified.

Study participants

The design and results of both studies have been published. Inclusion criteria in both studies included age ≥ 40 years, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 70%, FEV 1 < 80% of predicted, ≥ 10 pack-year smoking history, and an increased risk of AECOPD (defined as home oxygen use, systemic corticosteroid or antibiotic usage for AECOPD, or having an emergency department visit or hospitalization for AECOPD in the year prior to study entry). Exclusion criteria included alcoholism and active liver disease (defined as transaminase elevations > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal in STATCOPE, and > 3 times the upper limit of normal in MACRO). STATCOPE additionally excluded those already treated with statins, those with indications to be on a statin according to the Adult Treatment Panel III risk stratification, and those with contraindications to statins. MACRO additionally excluded those with asthma, a resting heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, a prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval (> 450 msec), the use of QT-prolonging medications, or hearing impairment.

STATCOPE was performed at 45 sites, and study follow-up time ranged from 21 to 1263 days, with a median (interquartile range) of 635 (329 to 990) days. The wide range of follow-up time in STATCOPE was largely due to the recommendation by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board for early termination of the trial, at a time when participants were still being actively recruited into the study. In contrast, MACRO continued to its planned closure date and had a follow-up time that ranged from 0 to 380 days, with a median of 200 (IQR 60 to 357) days. MACRO was performed at 17 sites.

Data collection

AECOPD was defined identically in both studies as a complex of respiratory symptoms (increased or new onset) of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with a duration of at least three days requiring treatment with antibiotics or systemic steroids. Study personnel assessed AECOPD status monthly via clinic visits or telephone contacts.

Bilirubin concentrations were measured at baseline in both studies. In STATCOPE follow-up bilirubin was measured at months 6, 12, 18, and 24. In MACRO, follow-up bilirubin was measured more frequently, at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of antiviral therapy [^112yic8T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common side effect of antiviral medications. The mechanisms underlying its development are multiple and unique to each therapy. During administration of antiviral medications, the hyperbilirubinemia observed in the absence of liver injury is most frequently manifested by isolated increases in the indirect-reacting fraction. Relevant mechanisms leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia in this setting include hemolysis, decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance as a result of impairment of bilirubin conjugation, or circumstances in which both processes occur simultaneously. Underlying genetic susceptibilities may potentiate these side effects of antiviral therapy. Conjugated (direct-reacting) hyperbilirubinemia can be a consequence of generalized hepatocellular injury, selective cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, or, rarely, genetic disorders of bilirubin transport. In the specific setting of antiviral therapy, preexisting liver disease or antiviral hepatotoxicity, such as is encountered with the use of the nucleoside and non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the most frequent causes of direct-reacting or mixed direct- and indirect-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. Modification in antiviral drug choice or dose may be required in cases of liver injury or of brisk hemolysis leading to significant anemia. The mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with impairment in conjugation tends to be well tolerated and of little consequence. The decision to continue or discontinue antiviral therapy in the face of hyperbilirubinemia should be made after an assessment of the cause of the elevated bilirubin level and a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy.

### Association of lower total bilirubin level with statin usage: the United States national health and nutrition examination survey 1999–2008 [^115qRDKM]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

A low circulating level of bilirubin is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. As statins can stimulate heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which increases bilirubin production, we investigated whether statins in routine use increase total bilirubin levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.

Methods

Data from 3290 subjects with self-reported history of hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2008 were analyzed.

Results

Subjects taking statins (n = 1156) had lower total bilirubin levels than those not taking any lipid-lowering medication (n = 2134) after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and survey period (adjusted mean = 0.699 vs 0.729 mg/dl respectively, P = 0.001). The association remained significant after adjusting for more covariates (P = 0.002), but was attenuated after further adjusting for glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin resistance index, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = 0.043). The use of lovastatin, rosuvastatin, and cerivastatin was associated with lower total bilirubin levels in the full adjustment model (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

The use of statins was associated unexpectedly with lower total bilirubin levels. This could be explained at least partly by the effect of statins on glycemia and LDL cholesterol. Our results do not suggest that the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of statins are due to HO-1 induction and increased serum bilirubin levels.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^115vRBgs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

RAL — bilirubin binding and neonatal findings: In vitro, RAL had minimal effect on bilirubin–albumin binding at 5 μM and 10 μM, caused a small but statistically significant increase in unbound bilirubin at 100 μM, and caused potentially harmful increases at 500 μM and 1,000 μM; however, these data suggest that the effect of RAL on neonatal bilirubin binding is unlikely to be clinically significant at typical adult recommended-dose peak concentrations (geometric mean Cmax 4.5 μM, median Cmax 6.5 μM, maximum observed Cmax 10.2 μM). Clinically, in the P1097 study, 1 of 19 infants (5.3%) received phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia, and in a retrospective series of 31 pregnant women with a median gestational age of 34 weeks, mild elevation of transaminase levels was reported in 35% of neonates.

### Lapaquistat acetate: development of a squalene synthase inhibitor for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia [^1143LaMX]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lapaquistat acetate is a squalene synthase inhibitor investigated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.

Methods and Results

This report summarizes the phase 2 and 3 results from the lapaquistat clinical program, which was halted at an advanced stage as a result of potential hepatic safety issues. Efficacy and safety data were pooled from 12 studies (n = 6151). These were 6- to 96-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo- or active-controlled trials with lapaquistat monotherapy or coadministration with other lipid-altering drugs in dyslipidemic patients, including a large (n = 2121) 96-week safety study. All studies included lapaquistat 100 mg daily; 5 included 50 mg; and 1 included 25 mg. The main outcome measures were the percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, secondary lipid/metabolic parameters, and overall safety. Lapaquistat 100 mg significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 21.6% in monotherapy and by 18.0% in combination with a statin. It also reduced other cardiovascular risk markers, such as C-reactive protein. Total adverse events were higher for lapaquistat than placebo, although individual events were generally similar. At 100 mg, there was an increase in alanine aminotransferase value ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal on ≥ 2 consecutive visits (2.0% versus 0.3% for placebo in the pooled efficacy studies; 2.7% versus 0.7% for low-dose atorvastatin in the long-term study). Two patients receiving lapaquistat 100 mg met the Hy Law criteria of alanine aminotransferase elevation plus increased total bilirubin.

Conclusions

Squalene synthase inhibition with lapaquistat acetate, alone or in combination with statins, effectively lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase, combined with a rare increase in bilirubin, presented potential hepatic safety issues, resulting in termination of development. The lapaquistat experience illustrates the current challenges in lipid-altering drug development.

### Clofibrate in combination with phototherapy for unconjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia [^117CoMv1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There are many pathological conditions leading to an elevated unconjugated bilirubin level (hyperbilirubinaemia) in neonates. Currently the standard therapies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia include phototherapy and exchange transfusion. In addition to phototherapy, clofibrate has been studied as a treatment for hyperbilirubinaemia in several countries.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of clofibrate in combination with phototherapy versus phototherapy alone in unconjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials were identified by searching MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) before being translated for use in The Cochrane Library, EMBASE 1980 to April 2012 and CINAHL databases. All searches were re-run on 2 April 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included trials where neonates with hyperbilirubinaemia received either clofibrate in combination with phototherapy or phototherapy alone or placebo in combination with phototherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and analysed independently by two review authors (MG and HM). Treatment effects on the following outcomes were determined: mean change in bilirubin levels, mean duration of treatment with phototherapy, number of exchange transfusions needed, adverse effects of clofibrate, bilirubin encephalopathy and neonatal mortality. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Studies were analysed for methodological quality in a 'Risk of bias' table.

Main Results

Fifteen studies (two including preterm neonates and 13 including term neonates) were included in this review. All but one of the included studies were conducted in Iran. For preterm neonates, there was a significantly lower bilirubin level in the 100 mg/kg clofibrate group compared to the control group with a mean difference of -1.37 mg/dL (95% CI -2.19 mg/dL to -0.55 mg/dL) (-23 µmol/L; 95% CI -36 µmol/L to -9 µmol/L) after 48 hours. For the term neonates, there were significantly lower bilirubin levels in the clofibrate group compared to the control group after both 24 and 48 hours of treatment with a weighted mean difference of -2.14 mg/dL (95% CI -2.53 mg/dL to -1.75 mg/dL) (-37 µmol/L; 95% CI -43 µmol/L to -30 µmol/L] and -1.82 mg/dL (95% CI -2.25 mg/dL to -1.38 mg/dL) (-31 µmol/L; 95% CI -38 µmol/L to -24 µmol/L), respectively. There was a significantly lower duration of phototherapy in the clofibrate group compared to the control group for both preterm and term neonates with a weighted mean difference of -23.82 hours (95% CI -30.46 hours to -17.18 hours) and -25.40 hours (95% CI -28.94 hours to -21.86 hours), respectively. None of the studies reported on bilirubin encephalopathy rates, neonatal mortality rates, or the levels of parental or staff satisfactions with the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data from different countries on the use of clofibrate in combination with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinaemia to make recommendations for practice. There is a need for larger trials to determine how effective clofibrate is in reducing the need for, and duration of, phototherapy in term and preterm infants with hyperbilirubinaemia.

### Induction of mild hyperbilirubinemia: hype or real therapeutic opportunity? [^114L17es]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Observational epidemiological studies showed that mild hyperbilirubinemia has beneficial effects on the prevention of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. In mammals, bilirubin plays a major role as a potent antioxidant. Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1 variants coding for bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl transferase resulting in mild hyperbilirubinemia (as in Gilbert syndrome (GS)) may confer a strong genetic advantage. Strategies to boost bioavailability of bilirubin or to mimic GS represent an attractive approach to prevent many oxidative stress and inflammation-mediated diseases. Even a tiny, micromolar increase in serum bilirubin concentrations substantially decreases the risk of oxidative stress-mediated diseases. There are several possible ways to achieve this, including lifestyle changes, changes in dietary patterns, regular physical activities, or use of chemical drug or of specific plant products either in the form of regular food items or nutraceuticals. Further basic and experimental research is required to fully uncover this promising therapeutic field.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^111dZomZ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Atazanavir (ATV) in pregnancy — formulations, pharmacokinetics, and use: Capsules 100 mg (generic product only), 150 mg (generic product only), 200 mg, and 300 mg are listed, plus an oral powder 50-mg packet. ATV concentrations are reduced during pregnancy and are further reduced with concomitant tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or an H2-receptor antagonist; intracellular ATV levels in women taking the standard boosted dose (ATVr 300 mg/100 mg) without concomitant TDF appear reassuringly stable throughout pregnancy. Use in pregnancy notes low placental transfer to fetus and no evidence of human teratogenicity (can rule out 1.5-fold increase in overall birth defects). ATV must be combined with low-dose ritonavir (RTV) boosting in pregnancy, and it must be given with RTV boosting in pregnancy; the effect of in utero ATV exposure on infant indirect bilirubin is unclear, with nonpathologic elevations of neonatal bilirubin observed in some, but not all, clinical trials to date.

### Bilirubin as an indicator of cardiometabolic health: a cross-sectional analysis in the UK biobank [^114BCxfH]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin and associations with blood lipid patterns

Bilirubin was linearly inversely associated with PC1 lipids, similarly among men and women. Non-linear positive associations were observed with PC2 lipids, exhibiting a steep increase from low to median levels of bilirubin and a null association from median to higher levels of bilirubin. Similar non-linear positive associations were observed with PC3 lipids. Bilirubin was non-linearly inversely associated with PC4 lipids. These associations were most pronounced between low to median levels of bilirubin, among men and women, and flattened off between median to elevated levels of bilirubin (Fig. 2 A and B).

Bilirubin and associations with components of the MetS

Men and women with bilirubin levels ≥ 17.1 µmol/L, compared to bilirubin < 10 µmol/L had 32% (99% CI 29%-34%) and 46% (99% CI 43%-49%) lower odds of exceeding the clinical cut off for WC (> 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women), respectively. Similar inverse associations were observed for exceeding the upper clinical cut off for TG (Table 2). Furthermore, men and women with bilirubin levels ≥ 17.1 µmol/L, compared to bilirubin < 10 µmol/L had 13% (99% CI 10%–17%) and 11% (99% CI 6%–15%) lower odds of exceeding systolic BP levels of ≥ 130 mm Hg (i.e. hypertension), respectively.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^112m39UT]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Raltegravir (RAL) in neonates — The primary toxicity of concern has been the potential increase in bilirubin levels, but at recommended dosing, RAL appears safe; UGT enzyme activity is low at birth and RAL elimination is prolonged in neonates, with RAL binding to albumin raising concern that displacement of bilirubin could lead to hyperbilirubinemia, and in IMPAACT P1101, safety evaluation in 52 infants of 34 weeks gestational age and older found no adverse events attributed to RAL and no bilirubin levels exceeded 16 mg/dL.

### Longitudinal blood pressure control, long-term mortality, and predictive utility of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin in hypertensive patients [^1161nV8k]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Our finding of a negative relationship between ALT and mortality is independent of all other concomitant liver tests. Previous studies, including a large systematic review, have shown variable associations. The reason for the increased risk seen with lower ALT is not clear. A recent study in the elderly (> 70 years) showed that the increased risk associated with low ALT disappeared after adjustment for frailty, indicating that ALT may be a marker of aging and frailty. ALT levels are known to reduce with increasing age, suggesting that ALT may be a marker of functioning hepatocyte (and muscle mass) because ALT is primarily produced by the liver (with a small proportion from skeletal muscle). If this is true, then we speculate that the observed greater reduction in BP in this cohort with higher ALT levels may indicate better antihypertensive efficacy because the commonly used antihypertensive drugs, ACEI and ARBs, are prodrugs which require hepatic activation. Despite strong correlation between AST and ALT, the pattern of risk is U-shaped with AST in contrast to ALT. However, we are limited by our data to dissect this further.

Both ALP and GGT are associated with increased mortality risk, which is significant only at the higher end of the distribution. The novel finding in our study is the consistent association of both GGT and ALP with higher longitudinal BP. The magnitude of BP increase is higher with ALP than GGT, and this increase is over and above the 4 mm Hg annual decline in SBP seen in this cohort, which is related to antihypertensive treatment. GGT has pro-oxidant effects because of its role in the extracellular catabolism of glutathione, and high GGT has been associated with incident diabetes mellitusmetabolic syndrome and fatty liver. Recent prospective studies and a systematic review show that high GGT is positively associated with increased mortality or incidence of CVD,– and our results reflect this. However, we do not see a clear association between GGT and cardiovascular mortality once the effects of other liver tests are accounted for in the model. There is a linear increase of bilirubin with GGT levels, and the 24% excess risk of cardiovascular mortality associated with the highest quartile of GGT disappears once bilirubin is included in the model. The pro-oxidant and antioxidant properties, respectively, of GGT and bilirubin associated with opposite effects on cardiovascular risk when considered jointly indicates that GGT does not have a major independent impact on cardiovascular mortality. This is also supported by the lack of any incremental predictive utility when GGT is added to conventional clinical risk factors.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112GAG71]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of newborns is affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

### FENOFIBRATE capsule… [^115jcWki]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Estrogen therapy, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, are sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia. In such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia. Many patients had concurrent elevations of total bilirubin, serum alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. DILI has been characterized as hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis has occurred in association with chronic active hepatitis. In clinical trials, fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 130 mg fenofibrate daily has been associated with increases in serum AST or ALT. The incidence of increases in transaminases may be dose related.

Discontinue fenofibrate if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop or if elevated enzyme levels persist. Do not restart fenofibrate in these patients if there is no alternative explanation for the liver injury.
5. 11 Paradoxical Decreases in HDL Cholesterol Levels There have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of severe decreases in HDL cholesterol levels occurring in diabetic and non-diabetic patients initiated on fibrate therapy. The decrease in HDL-C is mirrored by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. This decrease has been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is rapid and sustained. The clinical significance of this decrease in HDL-C is unknown.

It is recommended that HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline, and fibrate therapy should not be re-initiated. Increases in Liver Enzymes In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal in ALT occurred in 5. 3% of patients taking fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 130 mg fenofibrate daily versus

1. 1% of patients treated with placebo.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^114hHtjY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and higher serum bilirubin levels have been associated with improved COPD outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the association between serum bilirubin levels and lung function (FEV 1), prevalence/incidence of COPD, acute exacerbations of COPD, respiratory health status, and mortality.

Methods

MEDLINE® and Embase were searched using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019). We included studies that measured serum bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest in adults with or without underlying lung disease. We excluded studies of those with liver disease or drug-induced elevations in bilirubin. We used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale to assess individual study risk of bias (ROB) and the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality — Evidence Based Practice tool to assess overall strength of evidence (SOE). Two authors independently determined eligibility, performed data abstraction, assessed ROB, and determined SOE.

Results

Thirteen studies (5 low risk of bias, 3 moderate and 5 high risk) were included. We found low strength of evidence for the association between higher bilirubin levels and lower risk of acute exacerbations of COPD (2 studies), mortality (3 studies), COPD diagnosis (4 studies), and lung function (FEV 1) (8 studies). We found insufficient evidence on the relationship between serum bilirubin and respiratory health status/exercise capacity (1 study) and airflow obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC ratio) (4 studies).

Conclusion

Higher bilirubin levels may be associated with lower mortality and improved COPD outcomes. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the effect of medications that raise serum bilirubin on COPD outcomes.

### Effect of phenobarbital on hyperbilirubinemia and glucuronide formation in newborns… [^1147jBaJ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Twenty full-term newborns given phenobarbital 8 mg/kg/day for the first four days of life had significantly lower concentrations of serum indirect bilirubin than a group of 20 control infants by the fourth and fifth day of life. Similarly, ten infants with elevated serum indirect bilirubin levels treated from the fifth to ninth day showed significantly lower values by day 10 than controls. In vivo glucuronidation studies using salicylamide as the substrate showed a more pronounced average increase in the glucuronide fraction between the fifth and tenth day of life in ten infants pretreated with phenobarbital as compared to a group of 14 controls, suggesting that the effect of phenobarbital in reducing serum bilirubin levels is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced glucuronide formation.

DILI in acute liver failure — epidemiology and outcomes are described: most patients with l-DILI are women (66%–71%), and patterns have shifted from advanced coma grade ≥ 2 (68%) to most (66.4%) presenting with lower-grade encephalopathy. Most patients have deep jaundice with bilirubin levels generally > 15 mg/dL, liver aminotransferases in most (72.9%–78%) demonstrate a predominantly hepatocellular pattern, and aminotransferase levels are generally < 1,000 IU/L. Those progressing to ALF have transplant-free survival of 23.5%–38.7% at 3 weeks and an overall survival rate of 66%. Complementary and alternative medicine–induced ALF shows higher transplantation rates (61% vs 36%, P < 0.05) and lower 21-day transplant-free survival (17% vs 34%, P = 0.041) compared with prescription medication–related ALF.

Laboratory Abnormalities

Serum bilirubin elevations in su bjects wit h chronic HCV infection

Elevations of total bilirubin at least 2 times the ULN occurred in 3.5% of adult subjects treated with MAVYRET versus 0% in placebo; these elevations were observed in 1.2% of adult subjects across the Phase 2 and 3 trials.

In adult subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), 17% experienced early, transient post-baseline elevations of bilirubin above the ULN. These bilirubin elevations were typically less than 2 × ULN, generally occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolved with continued treatment. The subjects with compensated cirrhosis and bilirubin elevations did not have concurrent increases in ALT or AST, or signs of liver decompensation or failure, and these laboratory events did not lead to treatment discontinuation. MAVYRET inhibits OATP1B1/3 and is a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1 and may have the potential to impact bilirubin transport and metabolism, including direct and indirect bilirubin. Few subjects experienced jaundice or ocular icterus and total bilirubin levels decreased after completing MAVYRET.

Liver tests in subjects with acute HCV infection

Elevations of total bilirubin at least 2 times ULN occurred in 2.8% of subjects treated with MAVYRET. Subjects with total bilirubin elevations did not have concurrent increases in ALT or AST, or signs of liver decompensation or failure, and these laboratory events did not lead to treatment discontinuation. All subjects with baseline ALT > 3 × ULN improved from baseline by the final treatment visit.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MAVYRET. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Pazopanib hydrochloride (pazopanib) [^115XrrFZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitor liver tests at baseline; at weeks 3, weeks 5, weeks 7, and weeks 9; at month 3 and month 4; and then periodically as clinically indicated. Increase to weekly monitoring for patients with elevated ALT until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. Withhold pazopanib and resume at reduced dose with continued weekly monitoring for 8 weeks, or permanently discontinue with weekly monitoring until resolution based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Gilbert's Syndrome

Pazopanib is a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert's syndrome [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. In patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia known as Gilbert's syndrome, manage elevation in ALT > 3 × ULN per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Concomitant Use of Simvastatin

Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and pazopanib.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112Jscfn]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Phototherapy — treatment principles and thresholds: Intensive phototherapy requires a narrow-spectrum LED blue light with an irradiance of at least 30 μW/cm2 per nm at a wavelength around 475 nm, and light outside the 460 to 490 nm range provides unnecessary heat and potentially harmful wavelengths. The advantage of intensive phototherapy is that it can quickly lower the TSB and should shorten the duration of treatment, and the primary goal of phototherapy is to decrease the likelihood of further increases in the TSB concentration that would lead to a need for escalation of care, including exchange transfusion. The recommended phototherapy thresholds are far below those at which overt acute bilirubin neurotoxicity or kernicterus occurs, and the committee determined that new evidence justified raising the phototherapy treatment thresholds by a narrow range. Phototherapy should not be used solely with a goal of preventing subtle adverse neurodevelopmental findings, and there is some evidence that phototherapy may lead to a small increase in the risk of subsequent childhood epilepsy; however, the committee believes that the benefit of phototherapy exceeds the small potential risk of epilepsy when the TSB is at or above the phototherapy threshold. Although direct exposure to sunlight can decrease TSB, practical limitations mean it is not recommended as a reliable therapeutic tool.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (escalation of treatment), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure total serum bilirubin at least every 2 hours from the start of the escalation-of-care period until the escalation-of-care period ends. Proceed with monitoring once the total serum bilirubin is lower than the escalation-of-care threshold.

### Effects of phenobarbitone on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^113Q6jKf]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that beneficial effect of phenobarbitone in reducing hyperbilirubinemia, need of treatment and treatment related morbidities may be of special relevance to a resource-restricted setting where availability of working phototherapy units and adequately trained manpower to perform exchange transfusion is limited. However, due to the quality of the included studies and the limitations of the sample sizes, the long-term efficacy of this therapy requires further confirmation through high-quality, long-term research.

### Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for UGT1A1 and atazanavir prescribing [^116MNBKy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The antiretroviral protease inhibitor atazanavir inhibits hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, thereby preventing the glucuronidation and elimination of bilirubin. Resultant indirect hyperbilirubinemia with jaundice can cause premature discontinuation of atazanavir. Risk for bilirubin-related discontinuation is highest among individuals who carry two UGT1A1 decreased function alleles (UGT1A1*28 or *37). We summarize published literature that supports this association and provide recommendations for atazanavir prescribing when UGT1A1 genotype is known (updates at www.pharmgkb.org).

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Metalloporphyrins for treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates [^1174fqTA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Metalloporphyrins are heme analogues that inhibit heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme to bilirubin. By preventing the formation of bilirubin, they have the potential to reduce the level of unconjugated bilirubin in neonates and thereby reduce the risk of neonatal encephalopathy and long term neurodevelopmental impairment from bilirubin toxicity to the nervous system.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of metalloporphyrins in reducing bilirubin levels, reducing the need for phototherapy or exchange transfusion and reducing the incidence of bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia when compared to placebo, phototherapy or exchange transfusion. 2. To determine the nature and frequency of side effects of metalloporphyrins when used to treat unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.

Search Strategy

We searched Medline (1966 - January 2003) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library (2003, issue 1). We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication obtained. We hand searched the abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research (USA) (published in Pediatric Research) for the years 1985–2002.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled studies, in which preterm or term neonates (age 28 days of life or less) with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to any cause were randomly allocated to receive a metalloporphyrin in the treatment arm(s), and to receive a placebo or a conventional treatment (phototherapy or exchange transfusion) or no treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in the comparison arm(s). Any preparation of metalloporphyrin could be used, in any form, by any route, at any dose.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data independently. Data were entered into Revman by one author and checked by a second author. Prespecified subgroup analyses were planned in term versus preterm infants, hemolytic versus non-hemolytic causes of jaundice and according to the type of metalloporphyrin used.

Main Results

Three small studies, enrolling a total of 170 infants, were eligible for inclusion in this review. None blinded intervention or outcome assessment. In all three studies some patients were excluded after randomization. Metalloporphyrin-treated infants appeared to have short-term benefits compared to controls, including a lower maximum plasma bilirubin level in one study, a lower frequency of severe hyperbilirubinemia in one study, a decreased need for phototherapy, fewer plasma bilirubin measurements and a shorter duration of hospitalization. None of the enrolled infants required an exchange transfusion in the two studies that described this outcome. None of the studies reported on neonatal kernicterus, death, long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes or iron deficiency anemia. Though a small number of metalloporphyrin-treated as well as control infants developed a photosensitivity rash, the trials were too small to rule out an increase in the risk of photosensitivity or other adverse effects from metalloporphyrin treatment. No subgroup analyses were possible due to the small number of included trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with metalloporphyrins may reduce neonatal bilirubin levels and decrease the need for phototherapy and hospitalization. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus or of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that cutaneous photosensitivity is increased with metalloporphyrin treatment. Routine treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a metalloporphyrin cannot be recommended at present.

### Enasidenib mesylate (Idhifa) [^116ABCUE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated Bilirubin

IDHIFA may interfere with bilirubin metabolism through inhibition of UGT1A1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Thirty-seven percent of patients (80/214) experienced total bilirubin elevations ≥ 2 x ULN at least one time. Of those patients who experienced total bilirubin elevations ≥ 2 x ULN, 35% had elevations within the first month of treatment, and 89% had no concomitant elevation of transaminases or other severe adverse events related to liver disorders. No patients required a dose reduction for hyperbilirubinemia; treatment was interrupted in 3.7% of patients, for a median of 6 days. Three patients (1.4%) discontinued IDHIFA permanently due to hyperbilirubinemia.

Noninfectious Leukocytosis

IDHIFA can induce myeloid proliferation resulting in a rapid increase in white blood cell count.

Tumor Lysis Syndrome

IDHIFA can induce myeloid proliferation resulting in a rapid reduction in tumor cells which may pose a risk for tumor lysis syndrome.

Other Clinical Trials Experience

The following adverse reactions occurred in other clinical trials of IDHIFA at the recommended dosage: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, stomatitis, renal failure, fatigue, dyspnea, and QT prolongation.

### Chenodiol (Ctexli) [^1123XFjj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hepatotoxicity: Obtain baseline liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels in all patients and monitor yearly and as clinically indicated. Interrupt treatment until the levels have returned to baseline values. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI. (5.1)

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Chenodiol, including CTEXLI, has been associated with hepatotoxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In Trial 1, one CTEXLI-treated patient (7%) had increased ALT levels > 3 times ULN, which led to treatment interruption. Patients with pre-existing liver disease or bile duct abnormalities may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity during treatment with CTEXLI. Published reports suggest patients who are poor sulfators of lithocholic acid are more likely to develop chenodiol-induced serum aminotransferase elevations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain baseline liver transaminase (ALT, AST) and total bilirubin levels in all patients prior to treatment initiation with CTEXLI. If liver transaminase levels are elevated > 3 times ULN or total bilirubin level is > 2 times ULN, interrupt treatment with CTEXLI until the levels have returned to baseline values. Monitor liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels yearly and as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI.

Inform the patient of the symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., abdominal pain, bruising, dark-colored urine, fatigue, bleeding, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with hepatotoxicity occur, have the patient discontinue CTEXLI immediately.

### Drug interaction with UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes is a predictor of drug-induced liver injury [^117NT2rM]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

UGT enzymes catalyze the transfer of UDP-glucuronic acid to substrates with suitable functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, and carboxylic acid groups in a conjugation reaction called glucuronidation. Generally, glucuronidation is a detoxification reaction, producing metabolites with reduced chemical and biologic reactivity and higher renal clearance. However, for UGT substrates, the formation of toxic reactive metabolites following glucuronidation by UGT may induce DILI. This mechanism may account for the toxicity of some molecules with carboxylic acid functional groups that form acyl glucuronide metabolites, which subsequently bind covalently to proteins, as observed with diclofenac. Our analysis revealed that UGT metabolism had a mixed effect on DILI. Although the effects were not statistically significant, pure UGT substrates are slightly more likely to have high DILI concern (Table 5), but less likely to have higher DILI severity levels (Supplemental Table S7). Drugs that are pure UGT substrates in the data set (Supplemental Table S9,) have a wide range of DILI concern: from tapentadol, a phenol-containing opioid agonist with no-DILI concern, to trovafloxacin, a carboxylic acid-containing fluoroquinolone antibiotic that was withdrawn from the European market for its hepatotoxicity.

In addition to parent drugs and drug metabolites, UGT enzymes conjugate many endogenous molecules, including bilirubin (UGT1A1), bile acids (UGT1A3, 2B7), serotonin (UGT1A6), steroid hormones, eicosanoids, and vitamin D (UGT1A3, 1A4). – Reduced UGT enzyme activity can disrupt the normal metabolic clearance of these substances, leading to bioaccumulation and sustained biological effects. Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert syndrome are genetic disorders that lower the activity of UGT1A1, resulting in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. – Drugs can also inhibit UGT activity and disrupt bilirubin homeostasis in the liver. Hy's law reveals that drugs that induce elevated serum bilirubin levels together with hepatocellular injury, where other causes of liver injury are ruled out, are likely to cause severe DILI as suggested by the FDA guidance for DILI. This may account for the observation made that many UGT inhibitors in our data set cause severe DILI. Similarly, genetic mutations and drugs that inhibit UGT enzyme activity have been linked with disruption of bile acid homeostasis and cholestatic liver injury. Accordingly, our data set contains many UGT inhibitors with a pattern of liver injury that ranges from hepatocellular to mixed and cholestatic (Supplemental Table S9).

### False-positive paracetamol levels in a patient with hyperbilirubinaemia: clinical perspectives [^1176bv4e]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

​Serum concentrations of paracetamol are measured to investigate the cause of acute hepatitis, monitor the clearance of paracetamol from the body and to determine if supratherapeutic levels warrant treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). ​A 49-year-old man treated for ischaemic colitis developed worsening renal and liver function tests. As part of the investigation of hepatorenal failure, paracetamol levels were requested, which were elevated at 14 mg/L (normal < 4 mg/L) resulting in treatment with NAC. Despite treatment, levels of paracetamol remained elevated and the link between hyperbilirubinemia and false-positive paracetamol levels was identified. ​Bilirubin and its by-products have intense absorbance in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, causing interference in the enzymatic colorimetric assay most commonly used to measure paracetamol concentration, resulting in false-positive paracetamol levels. Laboratories correct for this interference above a predetermined bilirubin concentration, termed the Icteric Index; however, in our case this interference occurred at a lower level of hyperbilirubinaemia than previously identified as significant. This interaction was found to be more significant at lower bilirubin levels when low or no paracetamol levels were present in the serum, resulting in a change to laboratory practice and development of a 'Sliding Scale' approach to analysis. ​Concurrent bilirubin or Icteric Index measurement is recommended for all laboratories that use the enzymatic colorimetric assay for paracetamol measurement. Lower Icteric Index or bilirubin thresholds are required when low or no paracetamol levels are present in the serum to prevent false-positive paracetamol results. We describe a new 'Sliding Scale' approach to analysis, and highlight an important interaction for clinicians to be aware of.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112Yf7bw]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Obeticholic acid (OCA) approval, mechanism, and efficacy include Food and Drug Administration approval in May 2016 for use with UDCA in patients with inadequate response to at least 1 year of UDCA, or as monotherapy in those intolerant to UDCA; OCA is a farnesoid X receptor agonist that is 100 times more potent than the endogenous ligand chenodeoxycholic acid. In a phase 2 randomized controlled trial of 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg OCA versus placebo for 3 months in 165 patients, a 21% to 25% reduction in ALP occurred versus 3% with placebo. Another phase 2 monotherapy study in 59 patients showed serum ALP reductions of 53.9% with 10 mg and 37.2% with 50 mg versus 0.8% with placebo; pruritus led to discontinuation of 38% of subjects in the 50-mg arm. A larger phase 3 trial included 210 patients treated for 1 year with an optional 6-year extension while continuing UDCA, and the primary endpoint combined ALP less than 1.67 times the upper limit of normal, a reduction from baseline greater than 15%, and normal bilirubin.
