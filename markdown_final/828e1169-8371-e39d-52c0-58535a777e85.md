## Question

What does it mean on CBC
"Unable to report PLT count due to significant PLT clumping" and pt has abdominal pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when a CBC reports "unable to report platelet count due to significant platelet clumping" in a patient with abdominal pain, and how to interpret and manage this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the instrument flag truly signifies and whether it reflects a spurious artifact or true thrombocytopenia. Then, I should verify the mechanism of platelet clumping and why it causes undercounting. Next, I will consider the clinical context of abdominal pain and whether it changes the urgency or differential. After that, I need to outline the immediate confirmatory steps, including smear review and alternative anticoagulant sampling. Finally, I will synthesize the implications for bleeding risk, procedural planning, and follow-up, making sure I don't jump to conclusions about transfusion thresholds or invasive procedures before the artifact is excluded.

> Let me first confirm what the analyzer is telling us: "unable to report platelet count due to significant platelet clumping" is a spurious thrombocytopenia phenomenon, not a true decrease in circulating platelets, and it mandates verification by peripheral smear before any clinical decision-making is anchored to that number [^e5e0a189] [^e112a632].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism so I don't misattribute this. Platelet clumping in EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia is typically due to autoantibodies against cryptic epitopes on platelet glycoproteins, especially GPIIb/IIIa, that become exposed in EDTA and cause in vitro agglutination; this reduces the single platelet count on automated counters and can even be mistaken for leukocytes, producing a spurious leukocytosis, which is why a manual smear is indispensable [^97462515] [^e112a632].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance. I initially thought "this is just an artifact, so no bleeding risk", but I should double-check that assertion. Pseudothrombocytopenia itself is benign and not associated with increased bleeding or thrombosis, yet it can coexist with true thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction, so I need to ensure we confirm the true platelet count before concluding there is no bleeding risk at all [^705cc4a3] [^e5e0a189].

> Next, I should review the clinical context. Abdominal pain does not directly explain platelet clumping, but it does raise concern for conditions that can secondarily affect platelets, such as liver disease, sepsis, DIC, TTP/HUS, HELLP, or medication effects; therefore, I need to ensure we do not anchor on the artifact and miss a concurrent true hematologic process that could be life-threatening if unrecognized [^c9475176] [^6950a17d].

> I will now examine the immediate confirmatory steps. First, I should request a peripheral blood smear review to visualize platelet clumps and estimate a manual platelet count; second, I should repeat the platelet count in a sodium citrate tube (and consider heparin or magnesium sulfate if citrate also clumps) to circumvent EDTA-dependent agglutination; third, I should review the CBC histograms and instrument flags for clues like abnormal platelet size distribution or spurious leukocytosis that support pseudothrombocytopenia [^e112a632] [^c9475176] [^232724dd].

> But wait, what if the clumping persists across anticoagulants or the smear shows large/giant platelets or other abnormalities? In that case, I should reconsider the differential to include inherited macrothrombocytopenia, type 2B von Willebrand disease, or other entities where platelet size and in vitro behavior confound automated counting, and I should tailor further testing accordingly rather than forcing a single explanation [^953cf692] [^1b3138f9].

> Let me think about procedural implications, because this is where errors commonly occur. I should confirm the true platelet count before any invasive procedure; if the corrected count is above 50 × 10⁹/L, routine procedures are generally safe, whereas if it is below 20 × 10⁹/L, prophylactic platelet transfusion may be indicated depending on the procedure and bleeding risk, but I need to ensure I am not reacting to a spurious value before transfusing [^c9475176] [^735677ba] [^e9df1923].

> I should confirm follow-up and documentation. Once pseudothrombocytopenia is verified, I need to communicate this clearly in the chart and with nursing and procedural teams to prevent future misinterpretation; in parallel, I should continue evaluating the cause of abdominal pain with appropriate labs and imaging, because the artifact does not explain the pain and should not delay necessary diagnostic workup [^c9475176] [^ca81ec2a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: the CBC flag indicates a spurious low platelet count from in vitro clumping, not true thrombocytopenia; confirm with a smear and repeat testing in citrate, then proceed with standard evaluation of abdominal pain while avoiding unnecessary interventions driven by a falsely low platelet value [^e5e0a189] [^e112a632] [^c9475176].

The CBC note "unable to report PLT count due to significant PLT clumping" means the **automated platelet count is unreliable** because platelets are sticking together, causing a spuriously low count [^e5e0a189]. This is a **benign lab artifact** (pseudothrombocytopenia) [^705cc4a3] and does not explain abdominal pain. Confirm with a **manual smear** [^e112a632] and repeat the count in citrate or heparin [^c9475176]; if the true platelet count is normal, manage the abdominal pain based on clinical evaluation and standard diagnostic pathways [^ca81ec2a].

## Clinical significance of platelet clumping

- **Definition**: Platelet clumping is an in vitro artifact where platelets aggregate, often due to anticoagulant-dependent antibodies (commonly EDTA-dependent) [^97462515], causing spurious thrombocytopenia [^e5e0a189].

- **Prevalence**: Occurs in ~0.1% of CBCs [^e5e0a189]; more frequent in certain populations (e.g. autoimmune disease, viral infections) [^705cc4a3].

- **Clinical impact**: No bleeding risk; the true platelet count is normal, so no platelet transfusion or special hemostatic precautions are needed [^705cc4a3].

---

## Relationship between platelet clumping and abdominal pain

There is **no causal relationship** — platelet clumping is a lab artifact and does not cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain should be evaluated independently based on history, exam, and appropriate diagnostics [^ca81ec2a].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

### Confirm pseudothrombocytopenia

- **Manual smear**: Visualize clumps and estimate a true platelet count [^e112a632].

- **Alternative anticoagulant**: Repeat CBC in sodium citrate or heparin to obtain an accurate platelet count [^c9475176] [^232724dd].

- **Document**: Record the artifact to prevent future misinterpretation and unnecessary interventions [^e5e0a189].

---

### Evaluate abdominal pain independently

- **History and examination**: Assess for red flags (e.g. peritonitis, hemodynamic instability) and localize pain [^9985c86c].

- **Laboratory tests**: Consider CBC, liver enzymes, lipase, urinalysis, pregnancy test, and inflammatory markers as indicated [^ca81ec2a].

- **Imaging**: Use ultrasound or CT based on suspected etiology and patient factors (e.g. radiation exposure, pregnancy) [^0035915f].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **No immediate hemostatic risk**: The true platelet count is normal, so no platelet transfusion is indicated [^705cc4a3].

- **Procedural safety**: If procedures are planned, confirm the true platelet count first; routine thresholds for transfusion do not apply to pseudothrombocytopenia [^c9475176].

- **Patient reassurance**: Explain that the low platelet count is a lab artifact and not a bleeding disorder [^e5e0a189].

## Potential underlying conditions associated with platelet clumping

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Autoimmune disorders | Systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome [^705cc4a3] |
| Viral infections | Infectious mononucleosis, COVID-19, hepatitis C [^bb6e060d] [^682699e5] |
| Medications | Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (e.g. abciximab) [^ee63a473] |
| Genetic predisposition | Familial pseudothrombocytopenia [^e5e0a189] |

## Conclusion

"Unable to report PLT count due to significant PLT clumping" reflects a **benign lab artifact** [^e5e0a189] that does not explain abdominal pain. Confirm with a smear and repeat testing in citrate or heparin [^c9475176]; if the true platelet count is normal, proceed with standard evaluation of abdominal pain [^ca81ec2a].

### Pseudothrombocytopenia due to phagocytosis of platelets by polymorphonuclear leukocytes [^493f9e2b]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to platelet clumping which frequently occurs in routine blood counts, platelet phagocytosis is seen mainly during severe illness such as infection, thrombosis, and malignant hypertension. Our patient's case is, to our knowledge, the first report of pseudothrombocytopenia occurring in pseudomembranous colitis.

This case illustrates an important cause of spurious thrombocytopenia in the acutely ill patient. Awareness of this phenomenon can prevent unnecessary measures such as platelet transfusions, postponement of invasive interventions, or discontinuation of medications.

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management [^c9475176]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150 × 10³ per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 10³ per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50 × 10³ per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10 × 10³ per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 10³ per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50 × 10³ per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding.

A 75‐year‐old woman presented to the emergency department with progressive abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea after taking levofloxacin for a respiratory tract infection. On evaluation, she was in clinical shock, with blood pressure 88/58 mmHg and heart rate 122 beats per minute. A complete blood count provided by the Sysmex XN‐1000 analyzer showed leukocytosis (13.8 × 10⁹/L, 95% neutrophils) and thrombocytopenia (22 × 10⁹/L). She had acidosis, renal impairment, coagulopathy, and elevated C‐reactive protein level. Because of the thrombocytopenia, an examination of a peripheral‐blood smear was performed in the hematology laboratory, which showed vacuolated neutrophils that contained phagocytized platelets. Of 200 neutrophils examined, 161 (80%) contained between one and six platelets (Figure 1). These findings indicated spurious thrombocytopenia. The emergency department staff were notified by the laboratory that the patient's platelet count was normal. Subsequently, she underwent internal jugular‐vein catheterization for fluid resuscitation without oozing or hematoma. Pseudomembranous colitis was diagnosed on the basis of a positive Clostridioides difficile stool test. She was treated with metronidazole and vancomycin, but her course was complicated by renal failure necessitating hemodialysis. Eventually, she made a full recovery. During hospitalization, multiple routinely prepared films from EDTA‐anticoagulated blood consistently demonstrated platelet phagocytosis but with the resolution of the colitis, the phenomenon became progressively less pronounced. The automated platelet count became normal within 30 days.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^b519ddbb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

Platelet count testing before endoscopy — use and frequency — indicates that a platelet count is not routinely advised unless there is a suspicion of thrombocytopenia based on the history or physical examination, and that thrombocytopenia occurs in less than 1% and results in altered care in 0.3% or less of surgical patients.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^53b5bbef]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^e5e0a189]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Pseudothrombocytopenia

Pseudothrombocytopenia (PTCP) is characterized by spuriously low single platelet counts in blood samples collected in tubes containing an anticoagulant to prevent in vitro blood clotting, caused by time-dependent in vitro formation of platelet clumps during sample storage at room temperature (Figure 3). Although the condition is sometimes referred to as EDTA-PTCP because EDTA is the in vitro anticoagulant that most often causes PTCP, it is referred to simply as PTCP in this review, in order to avoid confusion potentially generated by the fact that, in a substantial percentage of cases, EDTA is not the only anticoagulant associated with platelet plug formation in vitro, as will be documented later in this review. Platelet counts in PTCP samples may vary widely, from severe thrombocytopenia to mild thrombocytopenia, both among different subjects, and when tested on different occasions in the same subject. The platelet count could be within the normal range in mild cases of platelet clumping, and in cases of concomitant thrombocytosis, which could be masked by PTCP. Although PTCP is an artefact without clinical relevance, failure to distinguish it from real thrombocytopenia may trigger unnecessary investigations and potentially dangerous treatments.

Epidemiology

The prevalence of PTCP in the general population is about 0.1% of all blood cell counts, with uncertain evidence of sex and age differences;, cases of familial PTCP have been reported. The frequency of PTCP within blood samples with pathologically low platelet counts collected from outpatients varies between 15.3% and 17%, representing the second most frequent cause of detected thrombocytopenia. The condition can be persistent or transient.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pain in labor and delivery, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, ASA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a platelet count based on the patient's history, physical examination, and clinical signs, such as preeclampsia with severe features. Do not obtain a routine platelet count in healthy parturients.

### Thrombocytopenia… [^5bb97551]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Family physicians often see patients who present with a low platelet count. Although further inquiry may elicit additional signs and symptoms of systemic disease, the etiology of thrombocytopenia usually is not immediately apparent. A low platelet count may be the only hematologic abnormality. In adults, thrombocytopenia is a platelet count less than 150 × 10. 1 Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 10³ per μL often are asymptomatic. Patients with a count from 30 to 50 × 10³ per μL rarely present with purpura, although they may have excessive bleeding with trauma. Spontaneous bleeding is more likely in patients with platelet counts less than 5 × 10³ per μL, and is considered a hematologic emergency.
2. Factitious Thrombocytopenia Pseudothrombocytopenia is secondary to platelet clumping and has no clinical significance.

It occurs in one in 1, 000 persons in the general population, and can be confirmed by a peripheral blood smear. 3 Causes include use of abciximab or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid–dependent agglutinins. 17, 18 The platelet count should be repeated by collecting blood in a tube with a non-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulant, such as heparin or sodium citrate. If the complete blood count still shows thrombocytopenia, other causes should be investigated. PREECLAMPSIA AND HELLP SYNDROME Pregnant patients beyond 20 weeks' gestation with thrombocytopenia or signs and symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, or elevated blood pressure should be evaluated for preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Laboratory abnormalities may include anemia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and proteinuria. 16 Reassessment should be performed immediately if patients become symptomatic during the surveillance period.

Additional laboratory evaluation should be performed as clinically indicated, and a trial of discontinuing agents known to decrease platelet counts is recommended. Patients with chronic alcohol abuse or known nutritional deficiencies with stable thrombocytopenia can be treated by a primary care physician.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of GPI‐associated thrombocytopenia usually begins with the report of a low platelet count from of an automated cell counter, but sometimes it begins with the onset of hemorrhagic symptoms resulting in the ordering of an unscheduled platelet count. Because thrombocytopenia may occur rapidly and be asymptomatic, a platelet count should be performed 2 to 4 hours after the bolus dose of the GPI and 24 hours later. Low platelet counts should be confirmed with inspection of the blood smear. The presence of red blood cell schistocytes would suggest the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation, whereas platelet clumps would indicate that the automated count is likely an underestimate, most likely due to platelet clumping induced by the standard blood cell count anticoagulant EDTA. Because the platelet aggregates may be mistaken for leukocytes by the automated counter, a reciprocal increase in white blood cells may be observed. This anticoagulant‐dependent platelet clumping phenomenon is termed pseudothrombocytopenia and the presumptive diagnosis is usually confirmed by finding a higher platelet count and loss of the platelet clumps upon repeating the platelet count with blood anticoagulated with citrate. Platelet clumping may also be present in citrated blood, and this may be more common with GPI‐associated pseudothrombocytopenia, and under these conditions, heparin or magnesium sulfate may be better anticoagulants.

7.1 Laboratory Test Interference

Platelet Tests

ADAKVEO interferes with automated platelet counts (platelet clumping) in particular when blood samples are collected in tubes containing EDTA, which may lead to unevaluable or falsely decreased platelet counts. Run blood samples within 4 hours of blood collection or collect blood samples in tubes containing citrate. When needed, estimate platelet count via peripheral blood smear.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^835f97e0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a common cause for emergency admission. While some patients have serious abdominal pathology, a significant group of those patients have no specific cause for the pain. This study was conducted to identify those who have non-specific abdominal pain who can be either admitted short term for observation or reassured and discharged for outpatient management.

Patients and Methods

A prospective documentation of clinical and laboratory data was obtained on a consecutive cohort of 286 patients who were admitted to a surgical unit over a nine month period with symptoms of abdominal pain regarded severe enough for full assessment in the casualty department and admission to a surgical ward. The patients were followed until a definite diagnosis was made or the patient's condition and abdominal pain improved and the patient discharged. The hospital where the study took place is a small peripheral general hospital draining a population of 120,000 people in a rural area in New Zealand.

Results

There were 286 admissions to the emergency department. Logistic regression multivariate statistical analysis showed that guarding raised white cells count, tachycardia and vomiting were the only variables associated with significant pathology.

Conclusion

Patients with no vomiting, no guarding, who have normal pulse rates and normal white cell counts are unlikely to have significant pathology requiring further active intervention either medical or surgical.

### Vortexing specimens to disaggregate platelet clumps in EDTA specimens [^435f09bf]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare platelet count results of specimens that yield platelet clump flags to platelet count results on these specimens after vortexing.

Method

Specimens that generated platelet count flags on Sysmex XN 3000 instruments were vortexed and rerun. Only data from specimens demonstrating elimination of platelet clump flags were used in this study. Pearson r analysis was performed on data.

Results

Comparison of complete blood count results (white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count) all yielded Pearson r scores > 0.9.

Conclusion

Additional patient comfort and safety concerns, as well as concerns over additional specimen collection and processing costs, may be avoided by vortexing and rerunning specimens flagged for platelet clumps when the platelet count is normal.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^1ac85f0c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Maternal thrombocytopenia — initial workup is outlined as follows: The differential diagnosis in pregnancy includes gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, pseudothrombocytopenia, viral infection, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and congenital thrombocytopenias. These disorders usually can be determined with a detailed medical and family history and a physical examination, with attention to current medication use, blood pressure, splenomegaly, viral serology, and adjunctive laboratory studies as appropriate, and a complete blood count (CBC) and examination of the peripheral blood smear generally are indicated in the evaluation of maternal thrombocytopenia; a CBC helps to exclude pancytopenia, evaluation of the peripheral smear serves to rule out platelet clumping that may be a cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, and bone marrow biopsy to distinguish between inadequate platelet production and increased destruction generally is not indicated.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^1a1b083a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^97462515]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of formation of platelet clumps (platelet aggregates or platelet agglutinates?)

Platelet clumping in PTCP is induced by binding of acquired or, more likely, naturally-occurring autoantibodies against cryptic epitopes that become accessible in the presence of EDTA. Antibodies of the IgG class are more commonly identified, followed by IgM and, very rarely, IgA. In the vast majority of cases, these antibodies behave as cold agglutinins, as they bind platelets most efficiently at 4–20°C, while they are practically inactive at 37°C. In the remaining rarer cases, agglutinins (usually IgM) cause platelet clumping also at 20–37°C. Serum or plasma from PTCP subjects induces platelet clumping and a decrease in single platelet counts in EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples from normal subjects, but not from patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, whose platelets do not express the GPIIb-IIIa complex. It is now well established that GPIIb-IIIa is the most common target for the agglutinins, which react with an epitope on GPIIb, upon dissociation of the glycoprotein complex by EDTA. Other platelet antigens may rarely be targeted by the agglutinins, including a 78-kD membrane glycoproteinand negatively charged membrane phospholipids. The in vitro decrease in platelet count consequent to the formation of platelet clumps occurs in the very first minutes after incubation of the blood sample at room temperature, reaches a nadir at about 2 hours, and does not reverse spontaneously, or upon rewarming the blood sample at 37°C. The addition of aminoglycoside antibiotics (such as amikacin or kanamycin) partially reverses the low platelet counts in some, but not all samples.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^5fe1df3e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm³ (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm³, platelet count 88,000/mm³, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^20ae21a0]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10⁹/L, and platelet count 582 × 10⁹/L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10⁹/L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^6950a17d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

5.1 Thrombocytopenia

TEGSEDI causes reductions in platelet count at any time during treatment that may result in sudden and unpredictable thrombocytopenia that can be life-threatening. In Study 1 [see Clinical studies (14)], platelet counts below 100 × 10⁹/L occurred in 25% of TEGSEDI-treated patients, compared with 2% of patients on placebo. Platelet counts below 75 × 10⁹/L occurred in 14% of TEGSEDI-treated patients, compared to no patient on placebo. In Study 1 and its extension study, 39% of TEGSEDI-treated patients with a baseline platelet count below 200 × 10⁹/L had a nadir platelet count below 75 × 10⁹/L, compared to 6% of patients with baseline platelet counts 200 × 10⁹/L or higher.

Three TEGSEDI-treated patients (3%) had sudden severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 25 × 10⁹/L), which can have potentially fatal bleeding complications, including spontaneous intracranial or intrapulmonary hemorrhage. One patient in a clinical trial experienced a fatal intracranial hemorrhage.

In clinical trials, all 3 patients with severe thrombocytopenia had treatment-emergent antiplatelet IgG antibodies detected shortly before or at the time of the severe thrombocytopenia. In 2 patients, platelet clumping caused uninterpretable platelet measurements that delayed the diagnosis and treatment of severe thrombocytopenia. Platelet clumping can be caused by a reaction between antiplatelet antibodies and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^51c4fb37]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Results

There were 286 patients over three months period of the study, 201(70%) females). Median age is 37 years. The causes of abdominal pain are shown in (table 1). Non-specific abdominal pain was the diagnosis in 98 patients (34% of total). 72 (73%) of them were females; the non-specific nature of the pain was made by clinical resolution of the symptoms or diagnostic laparoscopy. None of those patients with nonspecific pain had guarding or vomiting, and only five of them had raised white cells count. Non-surgical cause was seen in 47 patients (table 2).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to evaluation of thrombocytopenia, ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to do not use the platelet count alone as a bleeding predictor. Take into account the cause of thrombocytopenia, platelet function, and patient- and procedure-related risk of bleeding when deciding on the need for prophylactic platelet transfusion.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^953cf692]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Presence of large/giant platelets

The presence of large (diameter > 4 µm) or giant (diameter > 7 µm) platelets in the circulation is a common feature of many forms of inherited thrombocytopenia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, post-splenectomy states and myelodysplastic syndromes, and acquired conditions associated with increased platelet destruction by immune or non-immune mechanisms, leading to compensatory stimulation of the bone marrow to produce "stress" platelets, which differ from normal platelets by their increased size and function. Morphological examination of blood smears by light microscopy is of utmost value to detect the presence of large/giant platelets (Figure 10), which in some cases rosette around neutrophils (Figure 11). Because electronic counters distinguish platelets from other blood cells based on their smaller size (diameter 1.5–3 µm), the platelet count of these patients may be underestimated because large/giant platelets are not recognized as such. Indeed, platelet counts in these patients measured by electronic counters tend to be lower than those measured manually by optical microscopy (Table 2), which is the recommended method for these patients.

Type 2B von Willebrand disease

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common congenital bleeding disorder associated with quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of von Willebrand factor (VWF), comprising a spectrum of many subtypes. Type 2B VWD is a rare VWD subtype characterized by gain-of-function mutations in the VWF gene that result in heightened interaction of 2B VWF with the platelet GPIbα, spontaneous binding of VWF to platelets, in vivo platelet clumping, clearance of the VWF large molecular weight multimers and mild thrombocytopenia. The platelet count of patients with type 2B VWD may be underestimated because of the presence of large/giant "stress" platelets, produced by compensatory bone marrow stimulation consequent to heightened platelet consumption in vivo. Conditions characterized by increased synthesis or release of type 2B VWF in the circulation, such as pregnancyand infusion of desmopressin, aggravate the clinical picture. In case reports, the presence of platelet clumps in EDTA blood also contributed to underestimation of the platelet count (Figure 12). Although the involvement of large/ giant platelets in EDTA platelet clumps differentiates type 2B VWD from PTCP, the cornerstone of the differential diagnosis between the two conditions must rely on the presence of a bleeding diathesis, which should impose the need for further diagnostic investigations, including the measurement of plasma VWF with immunological and functional tests and determination of the composition of the VWF multimers.

### Spurious rise in the automated platelet count because of bacteria [^cc8c9c36]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The era of automation in haematology, although improving the accuracy and precision of results, has also introduced the laboratory haematologist to a vast array of spurious parameters. The identification of these results is important so that inappropriate management decisions are avoided. The case presented here illustrates a spuriously raised automated platelet count resulting from bacterial overgrowth in the blood sample.

### Assessment of the reliability of the sysmex XE-5000 analyzer to detect platelet clumps [^c3ef6ed5]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Platelet counts generated by automated analyzers on blood specimens that contain platelet clumps are often inaccurate and require verification by blood-smear review. In this study, we assessed the reliability of the Sysmex XE-5000 instrument to detect platelet clumps.

Method

We reviewed automated complete blood count (CBC) results and the findings of the microscopic review of corresponding blood smears of 600 blood specimens specifically selected from the routine laboratory workload. The sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of its 2 platelet-associated flags (abnormal platelet-size distribution [PAD] flag and platelet-clumps [CLP] flag) were determined.

Results

The respective values for the sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, and PPV were 42%, 83%, 63%, and 1% for the PAD flag and 57%, 99%, 78%, and 37% for the CLP flag. The NPV was 100%.

Conclusion

The overall reliability of the CLP flag is superior than that of the PAD flag but there is room for further improvement.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^0035915f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Essential thrombocythemia with portal vein thrombosis and splenic infarction successfully treated with platelet apheresis [^9912270c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 63-year-old diabetic woman presented to the outpatient clinic with a 1-week history of abdominal pain. On complete evaluation, she was diagnosed to have essential thrombocythemia. Abdominal imaging revealed portal vein thrombosis with a large splenic infarct. The patient was started on anticoagulant, antiplatelet and cytoreductive therapy. In view of persistent high platelet count, plasma apheresis was done, following which the patient's platelet counts were reduced. Essential thrombocythemia has a high rate of complications, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Few cases of this disease and its treatment have been described in the literature, especially pertaining to the Indian scenario. Further studies are needed to establish a multidisciplinary algorithm for its diagnosis and to elucidate the guidelines for the successful treatment of the condition.

### Platelet transfusion international clinical practice guidelines… [^d17e0be9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20 × 10³/μL. In patients with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to Dengue without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is not recommended. The following recommendations are conditional recommendations with low/very low–certainty evidence. Recommendation 1. 4: in patients with Dengue-related consumptive thrombocytopenia in the absence of major bleeding, the panel recommends no platelet transfusion. See the Supplement for details of identified evidence. Twelve RCTs in patients with HPT compared restrictive vs liberal platelet transfusion strategies on all-cause mortality or bleeding. 12–23 For mortality, the ARD was 1. 8%.

In the predefined clinical populations mentioned below, certainty of evidence was low or very low, with the exception of CVC placement at compressible anatomic sites. The panel made conditional recommendations in favor of restrictive over liberal platelet transfusion. Recommendation 2. 7: in adult patients with spontaneous or traumatic, nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage when the platelet count is greater than 100 × 10³/μL, including for those receiving antiplatelet agents, the panel recommends no platelet transfusion.

Although the upper bounds of the CIs for mortality and/or bleeding included important harm for a restrictive strategy in autologous SCT, CVC placement at compressible anatomic sites, cardiovascular surgery, and spontaneous ICH, there remained no clear evidence of a benefit to a liberal transfusion strategy. Relative effects appeared consistent, and the panel saw no compelling reason for relative effects to vary by population. For CVC placement, a 2023 RCT showed variation in grade 2–4 bleeding by anatomic site, with no difference in event rates at compressible sites using restrictive or liberal strategies. 31 The Instrument for Assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses judged the effect modification to be of moderate credibility. However, the importance of reported bleeding events in this study is unclear, with small numbers of mixed populations enrolled.

A larger international RCT evaluating multiple platelet thresholds is ongoing. 68, 69.

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions/Antibody Formation

TEGSEDI can cause hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical studies, 6 of 161 (4%) TEGSEDI-treated patients stopped treatment because of a hypersensitivity reaction. Antibodies to TEGSEDI were present when the reactions occurred. These reactions generally occurred within 2 hours of administration of TEGSEDI and included headache, chest pain, hypertension, chills, flushing, dysphagia, palmar erythema, eosinophilia, involuntary choreaform movements, arthralgia, myalgia, and flu-like symptoms.

If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of TEGSEDI, and initiate appropriate therapy. Do not use in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reaction to TEGSEDI.

5.8 Uninterpretable Platelet Counts: Reaction between Antiplatelet Antibodies and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA)

In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)], 23% of TEGSEDI-treated patients had at least 1 uninterpretable platelet count caused by platelet clumping, compared to 13% of patients on placebo. In 2 cases of severe thrombocytopenia with platelet count below 25 × 10⁹/L, one of which resulted in death, clumped platelet samples caused a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Both subjects had tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-platelet IgG antibodies detected shortly before, or at the time of the severe reduction in platelet count.

Although platelet clumping can have a variety of causes (e.g., incompletely mixed or inadequately anticoagulated samples), platelet clumping can be caused by a reaction between antiplatelet antibodies and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA). In Study 1, 7 of the 9 (78%) TEGSEDI-treated patients with treatment-emergent positive antiplatelet antibody testing had at least 1 clumped platelet sample.

If there is suspicion of EDTA-mediated platelet clumping, perform a repeat platelet count using a different anticoagulant (e.g., sodium citrate, heparin) in the blood collection tube. Recheck the platelet count as soon as possible if a platelet measurement is uninterpretable. Hold TEGSEDI dosing until an acceptable platelet count is confirmed with an interpretable blood sample.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) presenting as pancreatitis [^1fc45926]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare clinical entity. It is a multi-systemic disorder characterized by a clinical pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, diffuse and nonfocal neurologic symptoms, decreased renal function, and fever. Abdominal pain is an uncommon presenting symptom for TTP. Pancreatitis may occur from TTP or, in a few cases, may trigger TTP. The clinical diagnosis of TTP is generally difficult because there are many varied clinical presentations and the full expression of the pentad may be prolonged. However, once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, immediate plasmapherseis with plasma exchange must be performed to reduce the severe morbidity from neurologic disability.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^b6edf734]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations — procedure-related platelet management in cirrhosis state that we do not recommend prophylactic platelet transfusions before common procedures such as routine variceal banding or paracentesis outside of significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl) or sepsis. Existing data suggest there is a somewhat tenuous relationship between bleeding risk and platelet count. In vitro studies demonstrate adequate thrombin production with platelet levels ≥ 50,000/mL. Infusion of a single adult platelet dose does not improve thrombin generation. Higher platelet levels may be more appropriate for higher risk procedures such as removal of large polyps and major surgery, but will probably require higher doses of platelet infusions; if the procedure is elective, the use of TPO agonists may be more appropriate (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

Clinical Presentation

A pregnant woman (third trimester) presented with intense abdominal pain, nausea and myalgia. The patient was obese (body mass index 38) and was being treated for high blood pressure, hyperuricemia and hypothyroidism. She had chronic renal deficiency related to focal segmental glomerular sclerosis requiring dialysis. The physical examination at admission revealed a fever of 39°C and an acute abdomen with abdominal guarding in the right upper quadrant without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. There were no clinical signs of pre-eclampsia. Fetal ultrasound and a Doppler of the umbilical vessels were normal. Laboratory tests showed normal liver and liver function (total protein 95%, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin normal). The white cell count was 10×10⁹ /l (90% neutrophils), with a normal platelet count. Blood, urine and vaginal cultures were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed isolated thickening of the gallbladder wall without cholelithiasis. Empirical antibiotic treatment was begun with intravenous amoxicillin. Six days later, the patient's condition had worsened with increased abdominal pain, persistent fever and liver test abnormalities (AST-ALT 6N). However, bilirubin, hepatic synthesis tests, as well as leucocyte and platelet counts were still normal. A caesarean section followed by coelioscopy was decided. Coelioscopy revealed a liver with numerous necrotic spots (see figure 1).gutjnl;66/11/1911/GUTJNL2016313097F1F1GUTJNL2016313097F1Figure 1Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a liver surface covered with numerous white necrotic spots.

### A UK population-based case-control study of blood tests before cancer diagnosis in patients with non-specific abdominal symptoms [^8a649330]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Abnormal results in commonly used primary care blood tests could be early markers of cancer in patients presenting with non-specific abdominal symptoms.

Methods

Using linked data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and national cancer registry we compared blood test use and abnormal results from the 24-months pre-diagnosis in 10,575 cancer patients (any site), and 52,875 matched-controls aged ≥ 30 presenting, with abdominal pain or bloating to primary care.

Results

Cancer patients had two-fold increased odds of having a blood test (odds ratio(OR):1.51–2.29) and 2-3-fold increased odds of having an abnormal blood test result (OR:2.42–3.30) in the year pre-diagnosis compared to controls. Raised inflammatory markers were the most common abnormality (74–79% of tested cases). Rates of blood test use and abnormal results progressively increased from 7 months pre-diagnosis in cancer patients, with relatively small corresponding increases in symptomatic controls. In cancer patients, the largest increases from baseline were raised platelets in males with abdominal pain (increased 33-fold), raised white blood cell count in males with abdominal bloating (increased 37-fold) and low albumin in females with either symptom (increased 22–41 fold).

Conclusions

Common blood test abnormalities are early signals of cancer in some individuals with non-specific abdominal symptoms and could support expedited cancer diagnosis.

Initial workup included a complete blood count (CBC) that showed a normal white blood cell count without anemia or platelet derangements but with a small elevation in eosinophils. While possibly incidental, the elevation was notable given her recent immigration, lack of prior testing or prophylactic treatment, and mother's concern for parasitosis. An abdominal ultrasound was unable to visualize the appendix. Urinalysis showed elevated ketones but was otherwise unremarkable. Based on the elicited history, a stool ova and parasite test was sent and the patient was discharged home with strict return precautions. This course of action was taken as she was low risk for appendicitis based on the Pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC), her pain improved with oral acetaminophen, and the family lived near the hospital and had the ability to return quickly if needed. No abdominal computed tomography (CT) was ordered in favor of watchful waiting. Her pARC score of 14% was based on her sex, age, white blood cell count and neutrophilic percentage, duration of symptoms, maximal tenderness in her right lower abdominal quadrant, positive guarding without pain migration from the periumbilical region or demonstrated pain with walking. The following day, the stool ova and parasite test resulted positive for Dientamoeba fragilis. The patient's family was contacted, and due to her persistent pain, she was prescribed metronidazole 3 times daily for 10 days with appropriate resolution of her symptoms.

Obstetric thrombocytopenia — laboratory assessment notes test characteristics and limitations. The complete blood count (CBC) provides "the absolute platelet count with approximately ± 3% coefficient of variation", and EDTA-related clumping can be addressed such that "once the sample has been collected in a tube with an alternative anticoagulant (eg, citrate) or counted manually on peripheral blood smear, the platelet count will be normal". Unless a factor defect is suspected, "the PT and aPTT have no utility in predicting bleeding risk in a pregnant woman with thrombocytopenia". Viscoelastic testing observations include neuraxial cases with ROTEM/TEG and normal parameters "without spinal epidural hematoma formation", but in other settings there is "no correlation between TEG and ROTEM parameters and clinical bleeding except at very low platelet counts (< 50,000 × 10⁶/L)". For platelet function testing, PFA-100 abnormalities may occur with "platelet < 100,000 × 10⁶/L" or "hemoglobin < 10 g/dL", yet it "lacks specificity and predictive value for a specific disorder and does not correlate with degree of bleeding risk". In preeclampsia, some data show patients with normal platelet counts "appear to be hypercoagulable", with "70,000–75,000 × 10⁶/L as the cutoff below which TEG suggests hypocoagulability", but there is "a notable degree of inconsistency… and lack of data showing correlation between these laboratory tests and the risk of spinal epidural hematoma".

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^3238e3a0]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^1bee8fa8]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is of fundamental importance to identify conditions that are associated with spuriously low platelet counts in order to avoid unnecessary, expensive and/or potentially dangerous diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Four important recommendations can be made in order to reach a correct diagnosis: (i) strictly control all the pre-analytical and analytical variables of platelet counting; (ii) always consider the possibility of spurious thrombocytopenia when the bleeding history of the subject is negative, even though "true" congenital and acquired thrombocytopenias may not always be associated with a positive bleeding history;, (iii) bear in mind that spuriously low platelet counts are more frequently encountered in patients with "true" thrombocytopenia than in normal subjects, due to the presence of large/giant platelets and/or platelet agglutinates, which form more commonly than in normal subjects, thus deceptively aggravating the severity of the condition; and (iv) always examine an anticoagulated peripheral blood smear under a light microscope, which is the recommended first indispensable step in the diagnostic workup of any hematologic abnormality.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^a85e605f]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate measurements of the platelet count are necessary to diagnose thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia correctly, gauge the severity of clinical risk and identify the most appropriate therapeutic intervention. Despite increased diagnostic accuracy with electronic counters, counting is still unsatisfactory in rare situations. Conditions causing spurious thrombocytopenia include the following. (i) Pre-analytical errors, such as difficult venipuncture, over-/under-filling of blood collection tubes, insufficient mixing of blood with the anticoagulant (EDTA), which may cause fibrin formation.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^bf87db52]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate measurements of the platelet count are necessary to diagnose thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia correctly, gauge the severity of the clinical risk and identify the most appropriate therapeutic intervention. Despite increased diagnostic accuracy with the electronic counters, it is still unsatisfactory in rare situations. Conditions causing spurious thrombocytopenia include the following. 1) Pre-analytical errors, such as difficult venipunctures, over-/under-filling of blood collection tubes, insufficient mixing of blood with the anticoagulant (EDTA), which may cause fibrin formation; 2) EDTA-induced, temperature- and time-dependent, antibody-mediated in vitro platelet agglutination, with consequent reduction in the number of single platelets in the sample; the condition, referred to as Pseudothrombocytopenia, is benign and does not need follow-up or medical interventions; the use of alternative in vitro anticoagulants does not prevent agglutinates formation in all samples; accurate platelet counts could be obtained by testing EDTAsamples immediately after blood collection. 3) EDTA-induced in vitro platelet adherence to leukocytes (Platelet Satellitism), caused by bridging IgG antibodies binding to GPIIb-IIIa on platelets and the Fc receptor-III on leukocytes; occasionally, leukocytes may phagocytose platelets and/or form platelets/leukocytes clumps. 4) Presence of large/giant platelets (commonly from patients with congenital or acquired thrombocytopenia) that are not recognized as such by electronic counters, which distinguish platelets from other cells based on their smaller size. 5) Blood from patients with type 2B von Willebrand Disease, which may display large/giant platelets and platelet agglutinates.

Diagnosis of pseudothrombocytopenia

PTCP must be suspected in subjects with severely decreased platelet counts and no bleeding diathesis. In cases of mildly or moderately decreased platelet counts, which are not usually associated with an overt bleeding diathesis even in patients with true thrombocytopenia, the presence of platelet clumps in blood samples could be suspected based on specific warning flags and histogram patterns provided by electronic counters. However, the accuracy of currently available counters at detecting platelet clumps has been shown to be inadequate,20, lacking acceptable sensitivity and specificity. For example, small platelet clumps may be mistaken for leukocytes by the counter, resulting in the lack of platelet flags and in spurious leukocytosis, Although strategies are being implemented to increase their sensitivity, the absence of platelet flags will likely never allow the certain exclusion of PTCP in a sample with a low platelet count. For these reasons, the diagnosis of PTCP must rely solely on the microscopic examination of blood smears of EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples (possibly the same one on which blood cell counts had been performed), which allows the visual detection of platelet clumps (Figure 3). After all, therefore, the diagnosis of PTCP does not require any specific diagnostic procedure in addition to those recommended for thrombocytopenia and any other kind of abnormalities in the complete blood cell count, which all require the visual inspection of blood smears as the first step in the diagnostic work-up. According to the consensus of the Groupe Francophone d'Hématologie Cellulaire, a clump of platelets is defined as a cluster of at least five attached platelets, which are usually easily detected at the margins and the tail of the blood smear. Visual inspection of blood smears carrying platelet clumps in the primary care laboratories that first identify a subject displaying a low platelet count will decrease the undue referral of patients to specialized centers for the diagnostic work-up of thrombocytopenia.

Results

Of the patients, 15 were male (50%) and 15 female (50%); their mean age was 71.4 (29–94) years. Of the patients, 22 (73.3%) had a history of comorbid disease and cardiovascular disorders were the most common (n = 16; 72.7%). Abdominal pain was the chief complaint in all patients (100%) and mean time from pain onset to hospital admission was 21 (1–72) h. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and the use of intravenous contrast agent was avoided in 5 (16.6%) patients due to impaired renal function (creatinine > 2.5).

Hemogram and biochemical analysis results of all patients are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Hemogram and biochemical analysis results of all patients

In the abdominal exploration, 6 (20%) patients were found to have diffuse small bowel (SB) ischemia and necrosis, and 17 (56.6%) had subtotal (> 100 cm) SB ischemia; of the 17, 8 (47.0%) had right colonic ischemia. Five (16.6%) patients only had segmental SB ischemia and necrosis (< 100 cm) and 1 (3.3%) patient had isolated right-sided colonic ischemia and necrosis. The operation was terminated without performing further intervention in patients suffering from diffuse SB ischemia and necrosis (total necrosis), whereas various resections were performed in the remaining 23 patients (76.6%): 9 (9/23; 39.1%) patients underwent subtotal SB resection, 8 (8/23; 34.7%) underwent subtotal SB resection plus right hemicolectomy, 5 (5/23; 21.7%) underwent segmental SB resection, and 1 (1/23; 4.3%) patients underwent a right hemicolectomy.

Section I. A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia: second-line treatment options

The patient's history

A 20-year-old female returns home from college. She notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist sees that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts show mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5 × 10⁹/L The internist sends her urgently to the emergency room concerned that she might possibly have leukemia. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

Review of a peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL) and several of her very few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with ITP and given prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she has typical steroid-related side effects: feeling "a little crazy", insomnia and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone 40 mg; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147 × 10⁹/L and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL. She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure, and also thalassemia trait or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Similarly, the normal hemoglobin and neutrophil count do not suggest Evans syndrome. Her platelet counts remain in the normal range and her hemoglobin improves to the normal range. At her next visit, her platelet count has decreased to 80 × 10⁹/L. One month later, her platelet count is 28 × 10⁹/L with continued normal hemoglobin and infrequent small bruises. With her platelets trending downward, second-line treatment for her ITP is considered.

There is less urgency to consider secondary ITP or a missed diagnosis since she is doing well but at any change of management, it is good practice to re-evaluate. Below we consider some of the " what if " clinical scenarios for this young female.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia associated with infectious mononucleosis [^682699e5]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A 22-year-old man was hospitalized for assessment of thrombocytopenia and fever. Examination showed that he had infectious mononucleosis and moderately severe thrombocytopenia that was asymptomatic. Examination of blood smears revealed that the thrombocytopenia was caused by the clumping of platelets. We made a diagnosis of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia after excluding other infectious mononucleosis-related mechanisms of thrombocytopenia. When the patient recovered from infectious mononucleosis 2 months later, his thrombocytopenia improved, and no platelet clumping in peripheral blood smears was noted. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia should always be considered as a possible cause of reported low platelet counts, even in patients with infectious mononucleosis and splenomegaly.

### Platelet transfusion: 2025 AABB and ICTMG international clinical… [^e9df1923]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20 × 10³/μL. In patients with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to Dengue without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is not recommended. The following recommendations are conditional recommendations with low/very low–certainty evidence. Recommendation 1. 4: in patients with Dengue-related consumptive thrombocytopenia in the absence of major bleeding, the panel recommends no platelet transfusion. See the Supplement for details of identified evidence. Twelve RCTs in patients with HPT compared restrictive vs liberal platelet transfusion strategies on all-cause mortality or bleeding. 12–23 For mortality, the ARD was 1. 8%.

In the predefined clinical populations mentioned below, certainty of evidence was low or very low, with the exception of CVC placement at compressible anatomic sites. The panel made conditional recommendations in favor of restrictive over liberal platelet transfusion. Recommendation 2. 7: in adult patients with spontaneous or traumatic, nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage when the platelet count is greater than 100 × 10³/μL, including for those receiving antiplatelet agents, the panel recommends no platelet transfusion.

Although the upper bounds of the CIs for mortality and/or bleeding included important harm for a restrictive strategy in autologous SCT, CVC placement at compressible anatomic sites, cardiovascular surgery, and spontaneous ICH, there remained no clear evidence of a benefit to a liberal transfusion strategy. Relative effects appeared consistent, and the panel saw no compelling reason for relative effects to vary by population. For CVC placement, a 2023 RCT showed variation in grade 2–4 bleeding by anatomic site, with no difference in event rates at compressible sites using restrictive or liberal strategies. 31 The Instrument for Assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses judged the effect modification to be of moderate credibility. However, the importance of reported bleeding events in this study is unclear, with small numbers of mixed populations enrolled.

A larger international RCT evaluating multiple platelet thresholds is ongoing. 68, 69.

### Thinking out of the: a case of obscure lower GI bleeding [^49d183bd]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

A middle-aged man was admitted for episodes of fresh per-rectal bleeding, which were not associated with defecation. He was recently investigated for macrocytic anaemia in the outpatient haematology clinic. Examination of the perineum revealed grade 1 internal haemorrhoids with no signs of bleeding. Initial laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.5g/dL, normal 12.9–17.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin 95.3fL, normal 80.0–95.0 fL). Peripheral blood film showing blasts, dysplastic neutrophils, nucleated red blood cells and hypogranular platelets. The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy and rubber band ligation of the internal haemorrhoids after persistent fresh per-rectal bleeding. The bleeding persisted with the development of hypotension and a significant drop of haemoglobin to 4.8g/dL requiring blood transfusions and intensive care monitoring. Repeated endoscopy, including intubation of the terminal ileum, revealed uncomplicated right-sided diverticulosis. CT mesenteric angiography performed during an episode of significant bleeding revealed extravasation of contrast in the ileum, but mesenteric angiography was unsuccessful, possibly due to a temporary cessation of bleeding. Bleeding subsequently recurred and in light of the persistent bleeding with no clear source and with a total of 12units of packed cell transfused, exploratory laparotomy, on-table enteroscopy (figure 1) with small bowel resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen was performed (figures 2–4).gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F1F1GUTJNL2016313252F1Figure 1Multiple ileal lesions with stigmata of recent bleed.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F2F2GUTJNL2016313252F2Figure 2Area of ulceration associated with atypical mononuclear infiltrate.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F3F3GUTJNL2016313252F3Figure 3Atypical mononuclear infiltrate composed of cells with enlarged, irregular nuclei containing variably prominent nucleoli.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F4F4GUTJNL2016313252F4Figure 4Atypical cells displayed cytoplasmic expression of myeloperoxidase.

What is the diagnosis?

### Lead poisoning; a neglected potential diagnosis in abdominal pain [^3b7ca90c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Before analysis, it was presumed that patients' dependence on opium and their tendency to continue opium even after being aware of its consequences would correlate with daily amount of opium intake. However, statistical analysis did not show an association. This may be due to an inaccurate history of daily opium intake.

Significant difference in gender and lead poisoning in this study was found. In this cohort, 83 patients with positive addiction history were make, 78 males and five females. This may demand further evaluation of role of gender in development of lead poisoning.

In our study, there was a significant correlation between lead poisoning and lab tests. In the poisoned group, anemia (Hgb < 13 mg/dL) was 6.3 times more common compared to the normal group. Simultaneous presence of lead poisoning and anemia has also been mentioned in the previous studies. Lead interferes with the production of heme. In fact, during the heme production, two pivotal enzymes (5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase) are inhibited. There was also a connection between BLL and RBC count which is similar to the results withdrawn by previous authors. Terayama suggested that lead exposure would result in cell membrane changes that reduced the lifetime of erythrocytes. In addition, lead is linked with lower level of erythropoietin both of which mechanisms can cause a reduction in RBC count. Decreased amounts of erythropoietin, decreased RBC life span, and deformability besides the decrease in heme production justify the correlation of decreased hematocrit and higher BLLs.

There was also an association between platelet (PLT) count and BLL. In some previous studies, BLL was associated with decreased platelet count while in some others, increased PLT number has been mentioned. However, complete blood count (CBC) profile of our patients demonstrated a higher PLT count in lead-poisoned patients. It has also been mentioned that the risk of stroke is higher in the patients with abnormal BLL. Higher PLT numbers in these patients can be a potential explanation for this finding.

WBC count more than 9050 per mm³ had an 8.1-time higher frequency of lead poisoning. Similar findings have been reported by Katavolos et al. in 2007; however, they considered leukocytosis as an accidental finding. Paucity of studies in this field warrants further studies to elucidate the association between higher BLL and leukocytosis.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^6a06df54]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that the platelet clumps in PTCP are the result of platelet aggregation, rather than platelet agglutination. The hypothesis involving platelet aggregation was based on the finding that, in EDTA-anticoagulated blood, platelets time-dependently express markers of platelet activation, such as CD62 and CD63, which are normally associated with the membranes of intracytoplasmic platelet granules and are exposed on the plasma membrane as a consequence of activation-dependent platelet degranulation. Platelet aggregation would ensue as a consequence of the action of physiological agonists (such as adenosine diphosphate, ADP), secreted by the platelet granules. However, whatever the mechanism(s) responsible for the expression of activation markers on the plasma membrane by EDTA, it must be argued that platelet aggregation cannot occur in the presence of EDTA, which inactivates and disrupts the platelet GPIIb-IIIa complex, which is essential for platelet aggregation to occur. This interpretation is corroborated by the finding that a cold agglutinin of the IgM class, which was isolated from a patient with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count of about 100 × 10⁹/L), caused degranulation of normal platelets by binding to GPVI both in EDTA- and citrate-anticoagulated blood samples, but caused an in vitro decrease in platelet count at 22°C accompanied by the formation of GPIIb-IIIa- and plasma fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregates in citrate-anticoagulated, but not in EDTA-anticoagulated samples. Indeed, citrate, being a weaker Ca²+ chelator compared to EDTA, does not disrupt GPIIb-IIIa and, for this reason, can be generally used as the in vitro anticoagulant to study platelet aggregation. Similarly, rare cases of pseudo-gray platelet syndrome or pseudo-storage pool deficiency (which mimic congenital disorders characterized by defects of platelet α-granules and/or δ-granules) have been described, which are characterized by antibody-dependent in vitro platelet degranulation of EDTA-anticoagulated samples, usually without formation of platelet clumps and development of spurious thrombocytopenia, unless the combined action of the antibody and EDTA also causes PTCP-like platelet agglutination. In contrast, it was shown that aggregates of platelets with normal granularity formed in a citrate-anticoagulated blood sample from one of the patients with EDTA-dependent pseudo-gray platelet syndrome (Figure 4). Platelet aggregates in citrate- but not in EDTA-anticoagulated blood, which possibly formed as a consequence of increased platelet activation, were observed in patients with previous episodes of arterial thrombosis. Based on the aforementioned evidence, it can be safely concluded that PTCP is caused by platelet agglutination and not by platelet aggregation. This conclusion has important implications: for instance, it implies that, in order to prevent the in vitro formation of platelet plugs causing PTCP, it is unreasonable to use anticoagulant mixtures containing substances inhibiting platelet aggregation (such as prostaglandin E₁, adenosine, dipyridamole, pyridoxal phosphate) as alternatives to EDTA (see later).

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^3349a924]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — initial assessment and stabilization: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of patient presentation to assess the severity of bleeding and its possible location and etiology, and initial patient assessment and hemodynamic resuscitation should be performed simultaneously. Patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation with the goal of optimization of blood pressure and heart rate before endoscopic evaluation/ intervention. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an UGIB source, and an upper endoscopy should be performed if the suspicion is high to exclude a proximal source of bleeding. Endoscopic hemostasis can be considered safe and effective in patients who have an INR of 2.5 or less. Platelets should be administered in the setting of severe LGIB to maintain a platelet count of > 30 × 10⁹/L, and a higher threshold of > 50 × 10⁹/L can be considered if endoscopic procedures are required, and there is no benefit to routine platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelets.

### Amikacin can be added to blood to reduce the fall in platelet count [^ae7f9e92]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Our objective was to develop an effective method to prevent the fall in platelet count for patients with anticoagulant-dependent (AD) pseudothrombocytopenia, a spurious phenomenon due to anticoagulant-induced aggregation of platelets. We report a case of insidious multianticoagulant-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia in which AD pseudothrombocytopenia may be caused by 4 anticoagulants, eg, EDTA, sodium citrate, heparin, and sodium fluoride (NaF). Multianticoagulant-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia was confirmed by finding clumped platelets on microscopic evaluation in 4 anticoagulated blood samples. With this case, we tried a variety of reagents, including aminoglycosides, eg, gentamicin and amikacin, vitamin B₆, and aminophylline to inhibit pseudothrombocytopenia. Except for amikacin, all reagents failed to prevent pseudothrombocytopenia. Microscopic examination of K₂-EDTA-, heparin-, sodium citrate-, and NaF-anticoagulated blood samples showed massive platelet clumping, but no aggregate was seen in the anticoagulated blood with amikacin. When amikacin was added within 1 hour after blood sample withdrawal, platelet, WBC, and RBC counts and hemoglobin level, mean corpuscular volume, and mean platelet volume remained unchanged for up to 4 hours at room temperature. These findings suggest that amikacin could inhibit and dissociate pseudo platelet aggregation in multianticoagulant-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia and EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia.

### Comparison of dengue, chikungunya, and zika among children in Nicaragua across 18 years: a single-centre, prospective cohort study [^7ad9d82d]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

The PAHO report suggested using the occurrence of thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and haematocrit increases to distinguish dengue; arthralgia to distinguish chikungunya; and pruritus to distinguish Zika. Our findings agree with using thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and arthralgia as key factors for differential diagnosis. Moreover, we found that the presence of basophilia, monocytopenia, abdominal pain, and leukopenia best distinguished dengue; the presence of arthralgia and absence of papular rash and conjunctival injection best distinguished chikungunya; and the presence of generalised erythematous rash and absence of fever, headache, myalgia, and lymphocytopenia best distinguished Zika. We further found that accounting for age and day of illness could improve diagnoses. Notably, the near total absence of several clinical features (ie, papular rash, conjunctival injection, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, and monocytopenia) for one disease but not the others indicates that they could be used to exclude diseases during differential diagnosis. Our findings and PAHO's report concur that complete blood counts are important sources of highly discriminating clinical features. In practice, physicians could compare a patient's clinical features to our and PAHO's lists of distinguishing characteristics to better inform differential diagnosis. This process could be automated by using computer algorithms to predict disease status based on a weighted combination of distinguishing features. Although medical care for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika is strictly supportive, better informed diagnoses would aid case management. Suspected dengue cases could receive closer monitoring and enhanced fluid management to limit severity, whereas suspected chikungunya cases could be advised to seek medical care if chronic polyarthralgia occurs.

### Kanamycin supplement for the disaggregation of platelet clumps in EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia specimens [^232724dd]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To indicate the ability to disaggregate platelet clumps by vortex mixing and kanamycin supplementation in EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia (EDTA-PTCP) specimens.

Materials and Methods

For patients with EDTA-PTCP, citrate-anticoagulated, primary EDTA-anticoagulated, vortex-mixed, and kanamycin-treated specimens were tested for complete blood count and platelet-related parameters.

Results

Forty-eight specimens were included. Nineteen (39.6%) of the vortex-mixed specimens and 42 (87.5%) of the kanamycin-treated specimens revealed platelet counts more than those of the primary EDTA specimens, with levels exceeding 100 × 10⁹/L. The platelet count and platelet recovery of the kanamycin-treated specimens were higher than those of the vortex-mixed specimens.

Conclusion

Kanamycin supplementation to EDTA-PTCP blood may be considered as an alternative approach when the recollection of specimens is impractical. Only platelet-related parameters from kanamycin treatment were suitable for guiding patient management. Further studies about the impact of these methods in patients with various conditions, such as in patients with advanced kidney disease, should be conducted.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^ecb443d7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Gastrointestinal Disorders That Overlap the Abdominal Symptoms of HAE

Episodic abdominal pain; recurrent small bowel obstruction without a surgical history and no clear etiology; or nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea with complete resolution between episodes warrant consideration of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis. Pertinent history may include recurrent episodes of cutaneous angioedema without pruritus and urticaria. Factors to consider in recognizing HAE in patients with GI symptoms are summarized in Table 3. Although most HAE attacks have no identifiable trigger, in females, HAE attacks may be brought on by normal hormonal fluctuations or the use of medications such as estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. In HAE, recurrent abdominal pain may vary in severity but typically occurs as severe intermittent episodes lasting 2 to 5 days if untreated, with normal asymptomatic periods between attacks. Abdominal pain in HAE is often described as cramping, colicky, tiring, or exhausting. During an attack, patients may have abdominal distension, tenderness, and possibly ascites. Ascites was detected in 92% of HAE patients who underwent abdominal ultrasound during an abdominal HAE attack. In our clinical experience, fever, peritoneal signs, or elevated white blood cell counts are not common during HAE attacks. These signs and symptoms would be more common with an acute abdominal pathology or familial Mediterranean fever. Elevated neutrophil counts (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, and hemoconcentration have been reported in severe attacks. Nonresponse to glucocorticoids, antihistamines, or epinephrine is an additional indication that a mechanism other than histamine-mediated angioedema is involved.

### A million-dollar work-up for abdominal pain: is it worth it? [^7c89526c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Pain-predominant-functional gastrointestinal disorders (PP-FGIDs) are common. The diagnosis is clinical and there are no biological markers to characterize these conditions. Despite limited evidence, investigations are commonly performed. The aim of the study was to investigate diagnostic practices, yield, and costs in children with PP-FGIDs.

Patients and Methods

Charts of all of the children older than 4 years diagnosed as having abdominal pain were reviewed. Results and costs of diagnostic investigations were analyzed.

Results

Of 243 children with abdominal pain, 122 (50.2%) had PP-FGIDs (79 girls, mean age 12.7 years). All of the children underwent diagnostic work-up. Complete blood cell count was done in 91.8% of patients. None had elevated white blood cells, platelets, and low albumin. Six had either elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, but none had elevation of both; 4 of these 6 cases underwent endoscopies with normal results in 3 cases; Helicobacter pylori was found in 1 case. One child had elevated tissue transglutaminase 1 only antibodies with normal endoscopy. Amylase, lipase, direct bilirubin, stool cultures, and ova or parasites were always normal. One child had intermittent elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase. There were no significant abnormalities in urinalysis or electrolytes. Abdominal x-rays were done in 38.5%, showing only retained stools in 13% of these patients. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan were done in 23.7% and 9% of cases, respectively, but were of no clinical value; 33.6% patients had esophagogastroduodenoscopy (9.7% abnormal: Helicobacter pylori, chemical gastritis, esophagitis) and 17.2% had colonoscopy (9.5% abnormal: rare fork crypts, lymphoid hyperplasia). Total costs: $744,726. Average cost per patient: $6104.30.

Conclusions

In children with PP-FGIDs, investigations are common, costs are substantial, and yield is minimal.

### Etiologies of thrombocytopenia in the community hospital: the experience of 1 hematologist [^9268048c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients is a common cause for hematologic consultation. Our experience in the community hospital setting can inform treating physicians of the causes for and need to treat thrombocytopenia. Here we describe our clinical experience from 2 community hospitals over a 22-month period, wherein a single hematologist was consulted for 97 cases of thrombocytopenia in 93 patients.

Methods

Referred patients underwent history, physical, review of old records and imaging, relevant laboratory testing, review of the peripheral smear, and a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy if clinically indicated.

Results

Thirty-five patients had a primary hematologic cause for their thrombocytopenia. Fifty-one had secondary causes for thrombocytopenia. Eleven patients had no discernible etiology for their thrombocytopenia. The most common hematologic diagnoses were immune thrombocytopenia purpura (n = 12), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (n = 6), in vitro platelet clumping (n = 4), quite remarkably acute progranulocytic leukemia (n = 4), and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (n = 3). The latter 3 were immediately diagnosed by reviewing the peripheral smear, which led to appropriate therapy. The most common nonhematologic etiologies were liver disease (n = 21), bacterial sepsis (n = 12), and oral medication (n = 7). Although the thrombocytopenia was mostly nonacute, immediate hematologic interventions were needed for 21 patients. Four patients died, none from complications of thrombocytopenia.

Conclusions

Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients requires consideration of multiple etiologies and review of the peripheral smear. Liver disease is often overlooked as a cause for thrombocytopenia.

Peripheral blood smears from a patient with EDTA-dependent pseudo-gray platelet syndrome. Blood was taken from a 6-year-old patient with phenylketonuria. The platelet count in EDTA was 167 × 10⁹/L but the electronic counter showed reduced refraction indicating hypogranular platelets. (A) A smear of peripheral blood anticoagulated in EDTA showed agranular and large platelets which, despite having undergone degranulation with consequent secretion of pro-aggregatory molecules such as ADP, did not form aggregates. (B) A smear from peripheral blood anticoagulated in citrate showed platelets that retained normal granularity and size, but formed small clumps. EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; ADP: adenosine diphosphate. Reproduced, with permission, from Pancione Y, et al.

Several alternative in vitro anticoagulants (both Ca²⁺-chelating and non-chelating) have been proposed and tested for collecting blood samples in subjects with PTCP, aiming to avoid the occurrence of platelet clumping. Some of them have been selected for their capacity to inhibit platelet aggregation. One of these is magnesium sulphate (MgSO₄), which partially inhibits platelet aggregation, probably interfering with the essential role played by Ca²+ in this platelet function. MgSO₄ did indeed inhibit the full development of PTCP (Figure 5), but the hypothesis that it did so by inhibiting platelet aggregation, is incongruous, because the anticoagulant that is most effective at inhibiting platelet aggregation in vitro is EDTA (Figure 5), which causes PTCP instead of preventing it, thus supporting the interpretation that platelet clumps are not platelet aggregates but, rather, platelet agglutinates. The good performance of MgSO₄ in avoiding PTCP, can be explained by the fact that it preserves the integrity of the GPIIb-IIIa complex (Figure 5), thus keeping the cryptoantigen on GPIIb inaccessible to agglutinins.

### H. pylori-induced thrombocytopenia in a caucasian female: a case report [^9607d9e3]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

We present a rare, but increasingly recognised, cause of thrombocytopenia in a 69-year-old Caucasian female. Complete haematological investigation, including blood films and autoantibody screen, did not reveal a cause for her thrombocytopenia. Omission of potentially offending medication did not improve the low platelet count. She had no features of systemic infection or inflammatory disease on history and examination. In light of persistent thrombocytopenia, Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was tested, and found to be positive. Platelet count improved after eradication therapy for H pylori. This prevented the need for steroid and immunoglobulin treatment in this patient.

### After the embo: predicting non-hemorrhagic indications for splenectomy after angioembolization in patients with blunt trauma [^16cfca54]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Successful non-operative management (NOM) of blunt splenic trauma has increased with the use of splenic angioembolization (SAE). The reported splenectomy rate for hemorrhage after SAE is about 3% to 22%. However, patients may still require splenectomy post-SAE due to symptomatic splenic infarction and necrosis. To our knowledge, this specific scenario has not been studied. Prompt recognition of these non-hemorrhagic complications can be challenging due to the non-specific symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and tachycardia. Trends in white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), and PLT:WBC ratio have been previously described for identifying patients with infection after splenectomy. However, no studies have evaluated symptomatic splenic infarction and necrosis using these findings prior to splenectomy in patients who have undergone SAE. We theorized that the alterations in these values may indicate clinically significant splenic infarction and thus facilitate the management of these patients.

### Massive intravascular haemolysis due to… [^b51a3dbf]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Description

A 68-year-old woman came to our hospital because of a disturbance in consciousness the previous day and fever 3 days prior. She had no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea prior to admission. She had diabetes and haemoglobin A1c of 7.0%. Vital signs at the time of her visit were as follows: body temperature 40.5°C, blood pressure 137/63 mm Hg, heart rate 120 bpm and a respiratory rate of 50/min. She had jaundice. Chest examination revealed pan-inspiratory crackles and she had blood sputum. There was no knocking pain around the liver, nor Murphy's sign. The blood test revealed a white cell count of 3100/μL (normal range 4000–9000/μL). Her haemoglobin was 6.9 g/dL (normal range 13.5–17.6 g/dL). Her mean corpuscular volume (MCV) could not be measured because of significant haemolysis; however, there was no erythrocyte fragmentation in her peripheral blood smear. The platelet count was 16 × 10⁹/L (normal range 150 × 10⁹–400 × 10⁹/L). Aspartate aminotransferase was 1905 IU/L (normal range 7–97 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase was 690 IU/L (normal range 6–43 IU/L), total bilirubin was 8.1 mg/dL (normal range 0.3–1.2 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen was 27.0 mg/dL (normal range 10–20 mg/dL) and creatinine was 2.0 mg/dL (normal range 0.6–1.0 mg/dL); that is, liver and kidney dysfunctions were also observed. The blood glucose level was 278 mg/dL. The prothrombin time – international normalised ratio was 2.82 (normal range 0.85–1.15), activated partial thromboplastin time was 54.6 s (normal range 24.3–36.0 s), fibrinogen was 130.1 mg/dL (normal range 150–400 mg/dL) and D-dimer was 195.4 µg/mL (normal range < 1.0 µg/mL). In a urine test, her urine had macroscopic haematuria. These data and a bleeding tendency showed disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Acute splenic infarction presenting as an unusual manifestation of essential thrombocythaemia with normal platelet count [^f570677f]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is characterised by elevated platelet count by a clonal stem cell disorder of megakaryocytes. Although thrombosis is a common complication of ET, splenic infarction (SI) is extremely rare. Here, we present the case of a 31-year-old Japanese man who presented with sudden-onset severe pain at the left hypochondrium on the day before admission. Enhanced abdominal CT revealed SI. The laboratory test results revealed a normal platelet count (439 × 10⁹/L). Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with ET because the platelet count gradually increased to 50.0 × 10⁴/μL, and JAK2 V617F mutation was identified. Accordingly, low-dose aspirin was initiated, and no thrombotic episode occurred. Nevertheless, 6months postdischarge, the platelet count gradually increased to > 650 × 10⁹/L, and anagrelide was initiated. This case demonstrates an unusual complication of acute SI due to ET under the rare situation of the normal platelet count.

### Platelet-induced clumping of plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes from Malawian patients with cerebral malaria-possible modulation in vivo by thrombocytopenia [^486687ed]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Platelets may play a role in the pathogenesis of human cerebral malaria (CM), and they have been shown to induce clumping of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (PRBCs) in vitro. Both thrombocytopenia and platelet-induced PRBC clumping are associated with severe malaria and, especially, with CM. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of the clumping phenomenon in patients with CM by isolating and coincubating their plasma and PRBCs ex vivo. Malawian children with CM all had low platelet counts, with the degree of thrombocytopenia directly proportional to the density of parasitemia. Plasma samples obtained from these patients subsequently induced weak PRBC clumping. When the assays were repeated, with the plasma platelet concentrations adjusted to within the physiological range considered to be normal, massive clumping occurred. The results of this study suggest that thrombocytopenia may, through reduction of platelet-mediated clumping of PRBCs, provide a protective mechanism for the host during CM.

### EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia up to 9 months after initial COVID-19 infection associated with persistent anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM / IgG seropositivity [^bb6e060d]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The prevalence of EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia is estimated to be 0.03% to 0.27% of the general outpatient population and does not appear to be related to age and sex. Pseudothrombocytopenia may also be induced by viral infection. As such, hepatitis A virus infection has been the most common culprit, followed by cytomegalovirus and influenza A H1N1 infections. Transient EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia has also been associated with infectious mononucleosis; the pseudothrombocytopenia phenomenon resolved after 2 months, when the patient recovered from the infection. Furthermore, pseudothrombocytopenia may be linked to dengue virus infectionor after an acute viral gastroenteritis. Kuhlman et alreported a patient with pan-pseudothrombocytopenia and suggested that it may represent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy in COVID-19-caused critical illness. COVID-19 may result in thrombocytopenia via the enhanced activation of platelets, because SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased surface expression of the GPIIb/IIIa complex of nonstimulated platelets of patients with COVID-19 and the GPIIb/IIIa complex remains upregulated after stimulation. Consequently, platelet agglutination and clump formation indicate abnormal in vivo platelet activity that increases the risk of microthrombotic disorder. In contrast, in COVID-19 disease, a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody can bind to the cryptic platelet antigen, which causes a cross-reaction of the antigen-antibody, leading to EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia. It has also been speculated that inflammation may be essential to the generation of this phenomenon. Notably, platelet clumping may resolve with the use of citrate and patient recovery.

Although no other viral testing was performed in our patient, he had no clinical signs or symptoms of any other viral illness that may have caused this pseudothrombocytopenia. In another patient with COVID-19, transient pseudothrombocytopenia was detected along with the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and disappeared by day 17, when there were no detectable antibodies in the patient anymore. In the current patient, pseudothrombocytopenia was observed at 9 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were still present. Further, although there has already been 1 previous report on the association between COVID-19 and EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia, this phenomenon may be a coincidence and should not be considered as an evidence of a causal relationship.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: imaging findings [^66817030]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Malaria

Malaria is a serious parasitic infectious disease that is caused by Plasmodium species. Plasmodium species are transmitted through infected female mosquitoes that bite humans. These parasites grow within erythrocytes and are released by cyclic hemolysis.

The main symptom of malaria is episodic fever. One of the most commonly involved systems during acute malaria is the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children with falciparum malaria. Abdominal symptoms of malaria are vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and intestinal hemorrhage. Acute pancreatitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and subacute intestinal obstruction are rare complications of the falciparum malaria. The precise mechanism of these complications is not clearly defined. Plasmodium falciparum infection was stipulated to have resulted in microvascular obstruction and consequently result in affected organ ischemia. Rarely perforation can also occur. Splenomegaly is the most common finding on CT examination in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (Fig. 15). Other findings are hepatomegaly, splenic infarction, spontaneous splenic rupture and hemorrhage, ascites, and periportal edema. In patients with malaria and acute abdominal pain, CT is the mainstay imaging technique in the differentiation between splenic infarction and spontaneous rupture. Discontinuation of splenic contours, heterogeneous enhancement of splenic parenchyma, and perisplenic and intraabdominal free fluid with density levels ranging between 35 and 60 HU that suggests hemoperitoneum and presence of highest attenuation of the intraabdominal free fluid (sentinel clot) nearest to spleen should suggest splenic rupture in patients with suspicion of malaria due to travel history to the endemic areas. Patients with malaria have also been reported to develop non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to increased capillary permeability or endothelial damage (Fig. 15).

Fig. 15
A 39-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a 1-week history of mild abdominal pain and fever. Physical examination was unremarkable except for splenomegaly. Blood analysis demonstrated thrombocytopenia. a Axial contrast-enhanced CT image shows splenomegaly (asterisk). There was no sign of splenic infarction, hematoma, and rupture at the time of diagnosis. b, c CT scan of the chest showed bilateral mild pleural effusion (asterisks, b) and centrally located ground-glass opacities (arrows, c). The findings raised suspicion for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The imaging findings were not specific for any particular type of disorder. Nevertheless, the final diagnosis was made by a peripheral blood smear examination showing the plasmodium falciparum infection

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of hereditary macrothrombocytopenia [^1b3138f9]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Low platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, is a common haematological abnormality, with a wide differential diagnosis, which may represent a clinically significant underlying pathology. Macrothrombocytopenia, the presence of large platelets in combination with thrombocytopenia, can be acquired or hereditary and indicative of a complex disorder. In this review, we discuss the interpretation of platelet count and volume measured by automated haematology analysers and highlight some important technical considerations relevant to the analysis of blood samples with macrothrombocytopenia. We review how large cohorts, such as the UK Biobank and INTERVAL studies, have enabled an accurate description of the distribution and co-variation of platelet parameters in adult populations. We discuss how genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genetic associations with platelet count and mean platelet volume, which in aggregate can explain large fractions of phenotypic variance, consistent with a complex genetic architecture and polygenic inheritance. Finally, we describe the large genetic diagnostic and discovery programmes, which, simultaneously to genome-wide association studies, have expanded the repertoire of genes and variants associated with extreme platelet phenotypes. These have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of hereditary macrothrombocytopenia and support a future clinical diagnostic strategy that utilises genotype alongside clinical and laboratory phenotype data.

IM inflammatory marker, WBC white blood cell count.

Among cancer patients presenting with either abdominal symptom, the frequency of abnormalities differed by sex and test type. In males, raised inflammatory markers and anaemia were the most common abnormalities (Table 2), which markedly increased from 5–6 months pre-diagnosis. In females, raised inflammatory markers were also most common, with comparable increases to those seen in males from 5 months pre-diagnosis, but anaemia was less common than in males (Figs. 2 and 3). The biggest increases in abnormalities from the baseline rate were for raised platelets in males with abdominal pain (increased 33-fold), raised total WBC count in males with abdominal bloating (increased 37-fold) and low albumin in females with either symptom (increased 22-fold in abdominal pain and 41-fold in abdominal bloating patients). In symptomatic controls, monthly rate ratios for abnormalities compared to baseline remained ≤ 5 throughout the same period (Figs. 2 and 3).

Clinical aspects

PTCP is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding, thrombotic events or other relevant clinical complications: no clinical manifestation of disease occurred after up to 10 years (average 4.7 years) of follow-up of 112 PTCP cases, suggesting that they do not need to be followed up with any kind of specific clinical or laboratory monitoring. However, in a retrospective case-control study of 104 PTCP and 208 control subjects, not well balanced in terms of prevalence of neoplastic diseases which were twice as common among the PTCP cases, the mortality rate at a median of 208 days of follow-up was significantly higher at multivariate analysis among PTCP subjects.

PTCP has been described in healthy subjects but also in patients with a vast variety of pathological conditions, including neoplastic, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. In general, it appears that the association of PTCP with the aforementioned heterogeneous disorders is casual and explicable by the need of affected patients to be repeatedly monitored by laboratory tests, including blood cell counts, thus increasing the chances of detecting this rare condition. However, a specific association with autoimmune disorders was highlighted in a study of 192 patients with PTCP, suggesting that the condition can be assimilated to polyautoimmunity syndromes, but this association was not documented in other reports. One report described a high percentage (35%) of PTCP among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, representing a relevant confounding factor for monitoring the effects of cytotoxic treatment in these patients.
