## Question

guideline on rsv age 60

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about current RSV vaccination guidance for adults aged 60 years and older. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitive source for U.S. recommendations and how they evolved over 2023–2024. Then, I should verify the current 2024 tiered recommendations by age and risk. Next, I will check how "increased risk" is defined and supported by surveillance data. After that, I need to review vaccine efficacy, safety signals, and booster policy. Finally, I should consider timing, coadministration, special populations, and synthesize the actionable guidance.

> Let me first anchor on the authoritative guidance, because I need to ensure I am not extrapolating beyond ACIP's votes and CDC's published recommendations. ACIP publishes in MMWR, and the 2023 initial recommendation using shared clinical decision-making and the 2024 update refining to an age- and risk-based approach are the primary documents I should rely on before I discuss implementation or product differences [^114mGq12] [^112qndgU] [^115wnmhF].

> I should confirm the historical timeline to avoid misstatements. In June 2023, after FDA approvals of Arexvy and Abrysvo, ACIP recommended that adults aged 60 years and older may receive a single dose using shared clinical decision-making; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this was not a routine universal recommendation but rather SCDM tailored to individual risk and preference. Then, on June 26, 2024, ACIP updated to a tiered strategy with routine vaccination for those 75 and older and targeted vaccination for 60–74 at increased risk, reflecting accumulating effectiveness and safety data and a desire to maximize benefit where risk is highest [^114mGq12] [^112qndgU] [^115wnmhF].

> Now, I need to verify the current age-based recommendations as of 2024, and I should double-check the product list. Adults aged 75 years and older should receive a single dose of any FDA-approved RSV vaccine as a routine recommendation, and adults aged 60–74 years should receive a single dose if they have increased risk for severe RSV disease; wait, let me verify the vaccine portfolio — ACIP lists Arexvy (GSK), Abrysvo (Pfizer), and mResvia (Moderna), and importantly, no revaccination is recommended at this time for those who already received an RSV vaccine dose [^112qndgU].

> Next, I will examine what "increased risk" means for those 60–74 years old because clinical decisions hinge on this. ACIP specifies increased risk as including chronic medical conditions such as COPD, congestive heart failure, diabetes, moderate or severe immunocompromise, and residence in nursing homes or long-term care facilities; I should confirm that surveillance corroborates this concentration of severe outcomes in older age groups and LTCF residents, which RSV-NET data clearly demonstrate, with over half of hospitalizations in those 75 and older and a substantial proportion among LTCF residents, supporting the targeted strategy [^115wnmhF] [^11597Zgk] [^114jCL67] [^114ebnTj].

> I will now review vaccine efficacy and safety because benefit-risk drives the tiered recommendation. For Arexvy, efficacy against symptomatic RSV-LRTD was 82.6% in season one and 56.1% in season two with 74.5% overall across two seasons; for Abrysvo, efficacy was 88.9% in season one and 78.6% in a partial season two with 84.4% overall, while trials were underpowered for hospitalization outcomes; safety was generally acceptable, but rare inflammatory neurologic events including GBS and ADEM were observed across trials, with causality uncertain — this uncertainty is why I should not overstate universal benefit and why ACIP initially used SCDM and now targets highest-risk groups [^114KX6u9] [^112U2ukP] [^114mGq12].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation details clinicians will ask about, particularly timing and coadministration. Optimal timing is before the RSV season, yet because seasonality has been atypical post-COVID, offering vaccination as supply is available and continuing through the season is reasonable; coadministration with other adult vaccines, including influenza, is acceptable, although antibody titers can be somewhat lower when given with influenza vaccine and reactogenicity may be higher — clinical significance of titer differences remains uncertain, so shared discussion about coadministration logistics and tolerance is prudent [^113u1Hg4].

> Let me consider the rationale for the tiered approach to ensure coherence of the recommendation. Disease burden and hospitalization risk increase sharply with age — especially at 75 and older — and concentrate among people with comorbidities and LTCF residents, so the absolute benefit is greatest there; at the same time, potential rare neurologic safety signals support a conservative focus while postlicensure monitoring proceeds. But wait, what if a healthy 60–64-year-old strongly prefers vaccination? ACIP still allows shared clinical decision-making for 60–74, especially when risks are borderline or patient preference weighs strongly, maintaining flexibility while prioritizing those most likely to benefit [^11597Zgk] [^114mGq12] [^112qndgU] [^115wnmhF].

> I should outline a practical clinical workflow for adults 60–74 because implementation often falters without a clear process. First, assess for increased risk: chronic cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or LTCF residence; second, weigh benefits (substantial efficacy against LRTD) versus uncertainties (rare neurologic events, unknown need for revaccination) and document a shared decision; third, schedule vaccination ideally before local RSV circulation, with coadministration as appropriate and counseling on expected reactogenicity. For adults 75 and older, recommend vaccination by default unless contraindicated, given the high burden and favorable benefit-risk in this age stratum [^115wnmhF] [^112qndgU] [^113u1Hg4].

> Let me double-check special populations and exclusions so I do not miss caveats. Adults who have already received any RSV vaccine should not receive another dose at this time; persons under 60 are not covered by these adult recommendations, although immunogenicity and safety in 50–59-year-olds look comparable to those 60 and older, suggesting potential future scope expansion; pregnancy follows a distinct maternal immunization pathway and is outside this adult 60+ framework; immunocompromised adults are included among increased-risk groups, though pivotal adult trials largely enrolled immunocompetent participants, so individualized judgment is appropriate [^112qndgU] [^115wnmhF] [^114CmLtR] [^112XJ5Vz].

> I should synthesize the final guidance succinctly while keeping the verification points in mind. Current ACIP recommendations are: give a single dose of any FDA-approved RSV vaccine to all adults aged 75 years and older; for adults aged 60–74 years, give a single dose if they have increased risk for severe RSV disease, using shared clinical decision-making where needed; offer ideally before the RSV season but continue throughout if unvaccinated; coadministration with other adult vaccines is acceptable; no booster or repeat dosing is recommended at this time, with ongoing postlicensure surveillance to inform future updates [^112qndgU] [^113u1Hg4] [^115wnmhF].

---

For adults aged ≥ 60 years, the CDC/ACIP recommends a **single RSV vaccine dose** for all ≥ 75 years and for 60–74 years with increased risk (chronic heart/lung disease, diabetes, CKD, moderate/severe immunocompromise, or long-term care residency) [^115wnmhF]. Vaccination should be given **before RSV season** (typically fall) and is not currently repeated; coadministration with influenza or COVID-19 vaccines is acceptable, though reactogenicity may increase [^113u1Hg4]. Both Arexvy and Abrysvo are approved and effective in preventing RSV lower respiratory tract disease in this population [^114KX6u9] [^112U2ukP].

---

## Epidemiology and burden of RSV in adults aged ≥ 60 years

RSV causes **substantial morbidity and mortality** in older adults, with an estimated 60,000–160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths annually in the United States among adults aged ≥ 65 years [^114ebnTj]. The risk of severe RSV infection increases with age — particularly among those aged ≥ 75 years — and is further elevated in individuals with chronic medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^114jCL67].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

RSV infection in adults aged ≥ 60 years typically presents as **acute respiratory illness**, often indistinguishable from other viral respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19. Common clinical features include cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and fever. Severe cases may progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and exacerbation of underlying chronic conditions [^114zCeTP]. Diagnosis of RSV infection in older adults relies on laboratory confirmation, primarily through **reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing**. Rapid molecular testing provides timely, accurate diagnosis and facilitates appropriate clinical management and infection control measures [^115ov3ak].

---

## Risk factors for severe RSV disease

Several **risk factors** have been identified that increase the likelihood of severe RSV disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years:

- **Age**: Particularly ≥ 75 years [^114jCL67].
- **Chronic medical conditions**: COPD, CHF, diabetes, CKD [^114jCL67].
- **Immunocompromised status**: Moderate or severe immunocompromise [^115wnmhF].
- **Long-term care residency**: Residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities [^115wnmhF].

## Preventive measures and vaccination guidelines

### Vaccination recommendations

Adults aged **≥ 75 years** should receive a **single dose** of any FDA-approved RSV vaccine (Arexvy [GSK], Abrysvo [Pfizer], or mResvia [Moderna]) [^115wnmhF], while **adults aged 60–74 years** should receive a **single dose** if they are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, including those with chronic medical conditions, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or residence in long-term care facilities [^115wnmhF]. These updates aim to **maximize vaccination coverage** by clarifying high-risk populations and reducing implementation barriers associated with previous shared clinical decision-making approaches [^115wnmhF].

---

### Timing and administration of vaccination

Vaccination should ideally occur **before the onset of the RSV season** (typically in the fall); because seasonality varies, clinicians should offer vaccination as soon as supply becomes available and continue vaccinating eligible adults who remain unvaccinated [^113u1Hg4]. RSV vaccines may be coadministered with other adult vaccines, such as influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, though coadministration may increase local or systemic reactogenicity; clinicians should inform patients accordingly [^113u1Hg4].

---

### Vaccine efficacy and safety

Clinical trials demonstrate **moderate to high efficacy** of RSV vaccines in preventing symptomatic RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in adults aged ≥ 60 years. The vaccines have acceptable safety profiles; however, rare inflammatory neurologic events (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome) have been reported. Ongoing postmarketing surveillance continues to monitor vaccine safety and effectiveness [^113u1Hg4].

---

## Clinical management of RSV infection

Currently, **no specific antiviral treatments** are approved for RSV infection in adults. Clinical management primarily involves supportive care, including oxygen therapy, hydration, and management of exacerbations of underlying chronic conditions. Hospitalization may be required for severe cases, particularly those involving respiratory failure or significant comorbidities [^114zCeTP].

---

## Public health implications and future directions

The recent approval and recommendation of RSV vaccines for adults aged ≥ 60 years represent a **significant advancement** in reducing RSV-associated morbidity and mortality in this population. Continued surveillance, research, and public health efforts are essential to monitor vaccine effectiveness, safety, and uptake, and to address remaining knowledge gaps regarding long-term protection and cost-effectiveness [^115NgJzQ].

---

RSV infection poses a significant health risk to adults aged ≥ 60 years, particularly those with chronic medical conditions or residing in long-term care facilities. The CDC and ACIP recommend a **single dose of RSV vaccine** for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV disease. Vaccination, along with supportive clinical management, is essential in reducing the burden of RSV-associated morbidity and mortality in this population.

- **Vaccine efficacy and safety**: Evaluated efficacy evidence for the GSK RSV vaccine consisted of data from one ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 17 countries. This study included 24,973 immunocompetent participants aged ≥ 60 years, randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of vaccine (intervention group, 120 μg preF protein with AS01 E adjuvant) or saline placebo (control group).

	- Efficacy findings were based on analyses of data collected during May 2021–March 2023, including two complete RSV seasons for Northern Hemisphere participants and one complete RSV season for Southern Hemisphere participants. Efficacy analyses for season one spanned May 2021–April 2022, while efficacy analyses for season two spanned August 2022–March 2023. Exact study-defined season dates were site-dependent. The mean time from vaccination to the end of efficacy follow-up across both seasons was approximately 15 months per participant.

	- The efficacy of one dose of the GSK vaccine in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was 82.6% (96.95% CI = 57.9%–94.1%) during the first RSV season and 56.1% (95% CI = 28.2%–74.4%) during the second season. Efficacy of one dose over two seasons was 74.5% (97.5% CI = 60.0%–84.5%) in preventing RSV-associated LRTD and 77.5% (95% CI = 57.9%–89.0%) in preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTD. The study was not powered to estimate efficacy against hospitalization (intervention group = one event; control group = five events) or severe RSV illness requiring respiratory support.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113u1Hg4]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

- **RSV vaccination timing**: RSV vaccination is currently approved and recommended for administration as a single dose; sufficient evidence does not exist at this time to determine the need for revaccination. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of the RSV season; however, typical RSV seasonality was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned to prepandemic patterns. For the 2023–24 season, clinicians should offer RSV vaccination to adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making as early as vaccine supply becomes available and should continue to offer vaccination to eligible adults who remain unvaccinated.

- **Vaccine administration, including coadministration with other vaccines**: Coadministration of RSV vaccines with other adult vaccines during the same visit is acceptable. Available data on immunogenicity of coadministration of RSV vaccines and other vaccines are currently limited. Coadministration of RSV and seasonal influenza vaccines met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity with the exception of the FluA/Darwin H3N2 strain when the GSK RSV vaccine was coadministered with adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. RSV and influenza antibody titers were somewhat lower with coadministration; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown.

Administering the RSV vaccine with one or more other vaccines at the same visit might increase local or systemic reactogenicity. Data are only available for coadministration of RSV and influenza vaccines, and evidence is mixed regarding increased reactogenicity.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, particularly concerning immunization in adults, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend offering a single dose of an approved RSV vaccine to all adults aged ≥ 75 years. This recommendation also applies to adults aged 60–74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, such as those with certain chronic medical conditions, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or those living in nursing homes.

Pfizer vaccine

The evaluated efficacy evidence for the Pfizer vaccine consisted of data from an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial. This trial was conducted in seven countries and included 36,862 immunocompetent participants aged ≥ 60 years, randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either one dose of the vaccine (intervention group, 120 μg preF protein) or a placebo containing the same buffer ingredients as the vaccine but without active components (control group). Efficacy findings were based on analyses of data collected from August 2021 to January 2023, which encompassed one complete RSV season for Northern and Southern Hemisphere participants and a partial second season for Northern Hemisphere participants only. Efficacy analyses for the first season spanned August 2021 to October 2022, while those for the second season spanned July 2022 to January 2023. Exact study-defined season dates were site-dependent. The mean follow-up time from vaccination to the end of efficacy follow-up across both seasons, including a gap in RSV surveillance between the first and second RSV seasons, was approximately 12 months per participant.

The efficacy of a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was 88.9% (95% CI = 53.6%–98.7%) during the first RSV season and 78.6% (95% CI = 23.2%–96.1%) during the partial second season. The efficacy of a single dose over two seasons was 84.4% (95% CI = 59.6%–95.2%) in preventing RSV-associated LRTD and 81.0% (95% CI = 43.5%–95.2%) in preventing medically attended RSV-associated LRTD. The study was not powered

### Respiratory syncytial virus infections in adults: a narrative review [^114zCeTP]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an RNA virus spread by droplet infection that affects all ages, is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in adults, especially among older people living with comorbidities. Distinguishing RSV from other acute viral infections on clinical grounds alone, with sufficient precision to be clinically useful, is not possible. The reference standard diagnosis is by PCR; point-of-care tests perform less well with lower viral loads. Testing samples from a single respiratory tract site could result in underdetection. RSV is identified in 6–11% of outpatient respiratory tract infection (RTI) consultations in older adults (≥ 60 years, or ≥ 65 years, depending on the study) and accounts for 4–11% of adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized with RTI. Of those hospitalized, 6–15% are admitted to intensive care, and 1–12% of all adults hospitalized with RSV respiratory tract infection die.

Community-based studies estimate the yearly incidence of RSV infection at around 3–7% in adults aged 60 years and older in high-income countries. Although RSV accounts for a similar disease burden as influenza in adults, those hospitalized with severe RSV disease are typically older (most ≥ 60 years), have more comorbidities, more respiratory symptoms, and are frequently without fever. Long-term sequelae are common and include deterioration of underlying disease, typically heart failure and COPD. There are few evidence-based RSV-specific treatments currently available, with supportive care being the main modality. Two protein subunit vaccines for protection from severe RSV disease in older adults are currently in development.

### Clinical practice guideline: The diagnosis, management, and prevention of bronchiolitis [^116ZuQc5]. Pediatrics (2014). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for respiratory syncytial virus infection, specifically in general counseling, AAP 2014 guidelines recommend inquiring about the infant or child's exposure to tobacco smoke when assessing them for bronchiolitis. Caregivers should be counseled about the risks of exposing the infant or child to environmental tobacco smoke and be advised on smoking cessation strategies during the assessment for bronchiolitis.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, 2023 [^115XmUoU]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Low credibility.

Efficacy of one dose of the Pfizer respiratory syncytial virus RSVpreF vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus–associated disease among adults aged ≥ 60 years was evaluated across multiple countries from 2021 to 2023.

Abbreviations used in this study are as follows: LRTD = lower respiratory tract disease; LRTI = lower respiratory tract illness; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus.

- **Manufacturer-calculated efficacy**: Includes events occurring more than 14 days after injection and person-time available from the manufacturer's pivotal phase 3 trial. Estimates are unadjusted.

- **Trial endpoints**: The RSVpreF trial had two co-primary endpoints defined as RSV LRTI with two or more lower respiratory signs or symptoms lasting more than one day, and RSV LRTI with three or more lower respiratory signs or symptoms lasting more than one day. Signs and symptoms included new or worsened cough, sputum production, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tachypnea. For RSVpreF estimates in this report, LRTD refers to the trial endpoint of RSV LRTI with three or more lower respiratory signs or symptoms.

- **Medically attended RSV-associated LRTD**: Defined as LRTD prompting any healthcare visit (such as hospitalization, emergency department visit, urgent care visit, home health care services, primary care physician office visit, pulmonologist office visit, specialist office visit, other visits, or telehealth contact). Estimates were not included in per-protocol assessments.

- **Season 1 vaccine efficacy estimates**: Reflect efficacy against first events occurring during the first complete RSV season for Northern and Southern Hemisphere participants.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2024 [^112qndgU]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory illness and hospitalization in older adults during fall and winter in the United States. The 2023–2024 RSV season was the first during which RSV vaccination was recommended for U.S. adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. On June 26, 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to update this recommendation as follows: a single dose of any Food and Drug Administration-approved RSV vaccine (Arexvy [GSK]; Abrysvo [Pfizer]; or mResvia [Moderna]) is now recommended for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. Adults who have previously received RSV vaccine should not receive another dose.

This report summarizes the evidence considered for these updated recommendations, including postlicensure data on vaccine effectiveness and safety, and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. These updated recommendations are intended to maximize RSV vaccination coverage among persons most likely to benefit by clarifying who is at highest risk and by reducing implementation barriers associated with the previous shared clinical decision-making recommendation. Continued postlicensure monitoring will guide future recommendations.

### Challenges and opportunities in developing respiratory syncytial virus therapeutics [^111jqwFU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The number of subjects needed for a safety database for either prevention or treatment of RSV in infants to gain approval would depend on whether the indication was for prophylaxis or treatment. The regulatory pathway for RSV passive antibody prophylaxis (RSV immunoglobulin and palivizumab) first involved phase I studies in adult healthy volunteers and then immediately entered phase I studies in high-risk infants dosed during the respiratory season, followed by pediatric phase 2 and 3 studies. Phase IV studies in targeted patient populations will be a critical issue, especially when administered to otherwise healthy infants and young children. When treating patients with a lower risk of disease, the safety bar is higher. Conversely, a product with a higher level of toxicity may be acceptable if it shows benefit in severe disease.

There is no compelling need to study a new agent in the elderly or immunocompromised first, regardless of whether these groups are eventual target indications. Approval to evaluate new agents in the adult population would probably be easier to obtain, because there are fewer safety concerns. Studies could be done in parallel with those in children.

Finally, the cost-effectiveness of any treatment is important for the final implementation of future RSV therapeutics. Cost-effectiveness models are notoriously difficult, and RSV is no exception, not only for antivirals but particularly for prevention. The pharmaceutical industry appreciates that their future market depends to a large extent on the cost-effectiveness of the drug.

### Revised indications for the use of palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections [^112yokNk]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous (RSV-IGIV) are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in high-risk infants, children younger than 24 months with chronic lung disease (formerly called bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and certain preterm infants. This report summarizes the clinical trial information on which the guidance in the accompanying policy statement for administering RSV prophylaxis to certain children with a history of preterm birth, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease is based. Based on results of a recently completed clinical trial, palivizumab is appropriate for infants and young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease; RSV-IGIV should not be used in children with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk infants and children because of the ease of intramuscular administration. Monthly administration of palivizumab during the RSV season results in a 45% to 55% decrease in the rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV. Because of the large number of infants born after 32 to 35 weeks' gestation and the high cost, immunoprophylaxis should be considered for this category of preterm infants only if two or more risk factors are present.

### Beyond randomized controlled trials: A "real life" experience of respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in infancy with and without palivizumab [^11434tNP]. Pediatric pulmonology (2006). Low credibility.

A population-based study examined the impact of palivizumab on confirmed Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) hospitalizations over a 7-year period within and between two similar health regions. Clinicians in Calgary implemented palivizumab prophylaxis for high-risk infants during the last four RSV seasons, whereas clinicians in Edmonton did not. The two cities are part of a unified health care system and have similar sociodemographics. Infants less than 36 weeks (wk) of gestational age (GA) were identified. RSV prophylaxis data and RSV hospitalizations for high-risk infants eligible for prophylaxis were reviewed, as well as those of moderate-risk infants (33–35 weeks GA) for whom RSV prophylaxis was not given a high priority according to the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) recommendations.

The prevalence of RSV hospitalization before and after the introduction of palivizumab was determined for the periods 1995–1998 and 1999–2002, respectively. In Calgary, there were 411 high-risk infants eligible for palivizumab before its provision (Pre) and 496 during the prophylaxis program (Post). In Edmonton, where no such prophylaxis program was implemented, there were 401 Pre and 425 Post infants. In Calgary, where palivizumab was offered (Post), RSV hospitalization was significantly reduced: 7.3% Pre versus 3.0% Post (OR, 2.53, 95% CI, 1.34, 4.76). No reduction was observed in Edmonton where palivizumab was not offered: 5.0% Pre versus 7.1% Post (OR, 1.45, 95% CI, 0.81, 2.59; P = 0.212). RSV hospitalizations did not change for moderate-risk infants not receiving palivizumab in Calgary (OR, 1.26, 95% CI, 0.75, 2.12; P = 0.389). An RSV prevention program…

### Guidelines for palivizumab prophylaxis: Are they based on infant's risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial viral disease [^1178dsxc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis aim to prioritize palivizumab administration to infants at the highest risk for RSV disease. Multiple studies have been published that assess the risk of hospitalization for RSV disease by gestational age (GA) at birth and the severity of lung disease.

- **Objective**: To evaluate whether the AAP guidelines for RSV prophylaxis correlate with the available data in the literature on the degree of risk of hospitalization for RSV disease by GA at birth and the severity of lung disease.

- **Methods**: We considered a hypothetical population of infants with and without chronic lung disease. This population was then divided into hypothetical cohorts depending on GA at birth and the month of neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We assumed that infants are discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit at 36 to 37 weeks postconceptional age. By applying the AAP policy for RSV prophylaxis, the numbers of palivizumab injections were determined for the different cohorts.

- **Results**: In some instances, infants who are currently known to be at higher risk of hospitalization for RSV disease receive fewer palivizumab injections than infants known to be at lower risk.

- **Conclusion**: Some discrepancies exist between the RSV prophylaxis guidelines and the published data on the level of risk of hospitalization for RSV disease by GA and lung disease. The AAP policy for RSV prophylaxis must be amended to better correlate the amount of palivizumab prophylaxis with the level of risk of hospitalization for RSV disease.

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^114CmLtR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Several solicited adverse events (AEs) were reported at higher rates in 50–59-year-olds than in those aged 60 years and older. Higher vaccine reactogenicity in younger versus older adults was not unexpected, as it has been observed with other vaccines. However, symptoms were transient, and incidences of grade 3 reactions were similarly low among 50–59-year-olds and those aged 60 years and older. The rates of unsolicited AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were balanced between study groups. Hence, the overall safety profile in adults aged 50–59 years was consistent with the known safety profile in those aged 60 years and older.

Respiratory syncytial virus poses a significant burden in 50–59-year-olds, with increased hospitalization rates and a greater use of medical resources among those with underlying medical conditions. Respiratory syncytial virus can also compromise the quality of life in this population, leading to an impairment in daily functioning. Considering that a substantial proportion of adults aged 50–59 years are living with conditions that increase the risk for RSV disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes, an effective vaccine in this population could help decrease the total RSV burden.

### A systematic review of European clinical practice guidelines for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis [^116FWphc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Since the widespread adoption of palivizumab prophylaxis in Europe, several clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been published for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children. The aim of this systematic review was to identify CPGs for the prevention of RSV infection across Europe.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic literature search and contacted European influenza and respiratory virus networks, as well as public health institutions, to identify national CPGs for the prevention of RSV infection. The Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT) Statement checklist was applied to extract data and review the quality of reporting.

- **Results**: A total of 20 national CPGs were identified, all published between 2000 and 2018. The greatest discrepancy between guidelines was the recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis for premature infants, with recommendations varying by gestational age. All guidelines recommended or considered the use of palivizumab in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 85% (n = 17) in children with congenital heart disease (CHD), and 60% (n = 12) in children with severe combined immunodeficiency.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend that agencies publishing RSV prevention guidelines adopt the RIGHT reporting requirements when updating these guidelines to improve the presentation of the evidence-base for decisions.

### Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalisations and emergency department encounters among adults aged 60 years and older in the United States, October, 2023, to March, 2024: A test-negative design analysis [^111REkuW]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus vaccines first recommended for use during 2023 were efficacious against lower respiratory tract disease in clinical trials. However, limited real-world data regarding respiratory syncytial virus vaccine effectiveness are available. To inform vaccine policy and address gaps in evidence from the clinical trials, we aimed to assess the effectiveness against respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalisations and emergency department encounters among adults aged at least 60 years.

- **Methods**: We conducted a test-negative design analysis in an electronic health records-based network in eight states in the United States, including hospitalisations and emergency department encounters with respiratory syncytial virus-like illness among adults aged at least 60 years who underwent respiratory syncytial virus testing from Oct 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. Respiratory syncytial virus vaccination status at the time of the encounter was derived from electronic health record documentation, state and city immunisation registries, and, for some sites, medical claims. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated by immunocompromise status, comparing the odds of vaccination among respiratory syncytial virus-positive case patients and respiratory syncytial virus-negative control patients, and adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day, social vulnerability index, number of underlying non-respiratory medical conditions, presence of respiratory underlying medical conditions, and geographical region.

### Respiratory syncytial virus pulmonary infections in adults - disease burden and prevention [^116SPTHJ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

We highlight the evolving understanding of the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in older adults and recent data on the three new vaccines.

- **Recent findings**: There is a greater recognition of the amount of RSV infection in adults, especially those over 60 years of age. Studies have detailed the post-acute burden, including excess cardiovascular disease and loss of physical and cognitive functioning. Three new RSV vaccines now have published data for two seasons. While direct comparison is not possible due to differences in timing, methodology, and populations studied, all vaccines show good efficacy with no serious side effects of concern.

- **Summary**: RSV causes a substantial amount of morbidity and mortality in older adults with both acute and longer-term impacts. With effective vaccines now available, clinicians should be advocating with their patients to prevent RSV infection.

### Variation in clinical practice guidelines for use of palivizumab in preventing severe respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) disease in high-risk infants [^115S4HL3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Uniformity and compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the use of palivizumab in preventing severe respiratory syncytial viral infection in Australian high-risk infants remain unclear.

- **Methods**: An online survey was conducted across the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network (ANZNN) to determine clinical practices around palivizumab. A literature search was also performed to identify and compare national and international guidelines.

- **Results**: A total of 65 of 422 ANZNN members completed the survey. Respondents included 61 senior medical staff, primarily consultants and staff specialists (78%), and four nursing staff (6%). According to the survey, infants most likely to be recommended palivizumab included preterm infants born before 29 weeks gestational age (30%), children with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) born before 32 weeks gestational age (40%), and those with hemodynamically significant heart disease (35%). Many of the respondents (53%) stated that CPGs for palivizumab were developed locally. The literature search identified 20 guidelines (10 international and 10 domestic); 16 (80%) recommended palivizumab use in preterm infants, 16 (80%) recommended use in infants with CLD, 17 (85%) in congenital heart disease, and 6 (30%) in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Eight (40%) guidelines provided specific recommendations for immunocompromised infants. Canada, Western Australia, and the American Academy of Pediatrics provided recommendations for Indigenous children. The frequency and dosage of palivizumab were universal across all CPGs. None of the international guidelines obtained were from low-

### The effect of an interventional program on adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for palivizumab prophylaxis [^1138999a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the effect of an interventional program designed to improve adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for palivizumab prophylaxis, a study was conducted at the Children's Hospital, University of California, Irvine Medical Center, and its affiliated clinics. An interventional program focused on educating healthcare workers about AAP guidelines, updating healthcare providers on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity, and designating a single clinic with effective screening for referrals for palivizumab administration was implemented during the summer of 2004. The medical records of infants who had received at least one dose of palivizumab or were eligible during the 2003–2004 and 2004–2005 RSV seasons at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center, were reviewed. The proportion of patients receiving injections according to AAP guidelines was compared.

- **Results**: After the intervention, the proportion of patients who received palivizumab injections according to AAP recommendations increased from 39% to 61% (P < 0.0001). The program significantly decreased the proportion of unnecessary injections from 140 out of 525 (27%) in 2003–2004 to 33 out of 323 (10%) in 2004–2005 (P < 0.0001). However, it did not change the proportion of missing injections. The program resulted in a significant reduction from 14% to 2% (P < 0.0001) in the proportion of palivizumab injections administered too late, after RSV activity had subsided. RSV hospitalization rates did not change as a result of the intervention.

### Residency in long-term care facilities: An important risk factor for respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization [^114jCL67]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal winter virus and a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in older adults, resulting in approximately 60,000–160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths in the United States annually among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Research and development of interventions to prevent disease in older and at-risk adults have been underway for several decades. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two new RSV vaccines for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Following FDA approval, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making. Further guidance in June 2024 recommended vaccinations for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and those aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV disease. Of critical importance, therefore, is defining clinical and demographic characteristics that increase the risk for severe RSV disease and identifying the populations who will derive the greatest benefit from vaccine prevention.

Numerous studies have established older age as the most well-defined risk factor, with the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization increasing significantly with each subsequent decade of life after age 60. Other risk factors include preexisting chronic medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, and underlying frailty. Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are particularly affected as they often present multiple risk factors, leading to higher susceptibility and adverse outcomes related to RSV infection.

### Vaccination of older adults against respiratory syncytial virus: The final pieces of the puzzle [^115NgJzQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

While van Effelterre et al. strengthen the consensus that vaccination of older adults against RSV has the potential to significantly reduce RSV seasonal burden, it simply highlights, but does not fill, the pressing knowledge gaps that need resolution. With a large and growing older adult population, these vaccines will rightly come under intense scrutiny concerning their affordability and cost-effectiveness. Given the lack of differentiated efficacy among vaccine products against acute respiratory infections, the decision to implement a vaccine program — and which vaccine to choose — will likely depend on the vaccine's duration of disease protection, its effectiveness against very severe outcomes and death, and ultimately, its price.

- **Methods**:

	- This phase 2, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the administration of motavizumab and palivizumab during the same RSV season to premature infants with and without chronic lung disease (CLD). Conducted between April 2006 and February 2007, the study enrolled eligible infants at 18 sites across the southern hemisphere, including Chile (7 sites), New Zealand (5 sites), and Australia (6 sites).

	- Eligible infants were randomly assigned (1:1:1, stratified by site) into one of three treatment groups using an automated randomization system:

	- Two doses of motavizumab followed by three doses of palivizumab (M/P)
	- Two doses of palivizumab followed by three doses of motavizumab (P/M)
	- Five doses of motavizumab only (control)

	- Motavizumab and/or palivizumab were administered at 15 mg/kg by intramuscular injection every 30 days for a total of five planned doses, adhering to the currently used regimen for palivizumab. The administration schedule was on study days 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120, with dose 2 (day 30) allowed between day 25 and day 30. For all other doses, a prespecified ± 5-day window was permitted.

	- The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical principles of the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board or independent ethics committee of each participating center. Additionally, written informed consent was provided by the parents or legal guardians for each subject before enrollment.

### RSV vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization among US adults aged 60 years or older during 2 seasons [^116YFUsQ]. JAMA (2025). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines for adults aged 60 years or older became available in 2023. One dose is recommended for all adults aged 75 years or older and those aged 60 to 74 years at increased risk of severe RSV; however, the duration of protection is unknown.

- **Objective**: To evaluate RSV vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization among adults aged 60 years or older during two RSV seasons.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A total of 6,958 adults aged 60 years or older were included in this test-negative, case-control study. Participants were hospitalized with acute respiratory illness at any of 26 hospitals in 20 US states during the October 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024, or October 1, 2024, to April 30, 2025, RSV seasons and had respiratory virus testing within 10 days of illness onset. Case patients tested positive for RSV only; control patients tested negative for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. Demographic and clinical data were obtained through patient interviews and electronic health records.

- **Exposures**: Receipt of one RSV vaccine dose at least 14 days before illness onset.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare the odds of RSV vaccination among hospitalized cases and controls. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, geographic region, and calendar month and year. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1 - adjusted odds ratio) × 100%. Analyses were stratified by the timing of RSV vaccine receipt (same vs prior season) relative to illness onset.

- **Recommended dosage for prophylaxis of influenza**: Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with Tamiflu within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with Tamiflu during a community outbreak.

- **Adults and adolescents (13 years of age and older)**: The recommended dosage of Tamiflu for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, Tamiflu may be continued for up to 12 weeks. The duration of protection lasts as long as Tamiflu dosing is continued [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)].

- **Pediatric patients (1 year to 12 years of age)**: The recommended oral dosage of Tamiflu for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age is based on body weight. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Preventing RSV bronchiolitis in vulnerable infants: the role of palivizumab [^113hruAV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The vast majority of infants tolerate infection with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) well and can be managed at home, so most should not be considered for RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab. However, there is a subset of vulnerable infants in whom the consequences of RSV infection are greater, with an increased likelihood of intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation. These include children born extremely preterm with chronic neonatal lung disease and infants with hemodynamically significant cardiac disease, for whom there is level II evidence suggesting that palivizumab may reduce their risk of acquiring RSV by approximately 50%. The use of palivizumab varies considerably worldwide, primarily based on economic considerations. This article reviews strategies developed to fight RSV infection, the evidence for palivizumab use, and suggests a reasonable clinical and economic approach to its use by proposing its selective use in the most vulnerable infants during the first six months of life.

### Characteristics and outcomes among adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus - RSV-NET, 12 states, July 2022-June 2023 [^11597Zgk]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. In May 2023, two RSV vaccines were approved for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In June 2023, the CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics, including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes, of 3,218 adults aged ≥ 60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022-June 2023.

Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged ≥ 75 years. The most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%-21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 60 years. Overall, 17.0% (95% CI = 14.5%-19.7%) of patients with RSV infection were admitted to an intensive care unit, 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5%-6.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 4.7% (95% CI = 3.6%-6.1%) died; 17.2% (95% CI = 14.9%-19.8%) of all cases occurred in long-term care facility residents. These data highlight the importance of prioritizing those at highest risk for severe RSV disease and suggest that clinicians and patients consider age (particularly age ≥ 75 years) and long-term care facility residence.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^114mGq12]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Vaccination with a single dose of the GSK or Pfizer RSV vaccines demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing symptomatic RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) over two consecutive RSV seasons among adults aged ≥ 60 years. Although trials were underpowered to estimate efficacy against RSV-associated hospitalization and death, prevention of LRTD, including medically attended LRTD, suggests that vaccination might prevent considerable morbidity from RSV disease among adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Although both vaccines were generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile, six cases of inflammatory neurologic events (including Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM], and others) were reported after RSV vaccination in clinical trials. Whether these events occurred due to chance, or whether RSV vaccination increases the risk for inflammatory neurologic events is currently unknown. Until additional evidence becomes available from post-marketing surveillance clarifying the existence of any potential risk, RSV vaccination in older adults should be targeted to those who are at highest risk for severe RSV disease and therefore most likely to benefit from vaccination. The recommendation for shared clinical decision-making is intended to allow flexibility for providers and patients to consider individual risk for RSV disease while taking into account patient preferences.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults, resulting in approximately 60,000–160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths annually among adults aged ≥ 65 years. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved two RSV vaccines for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years.

In June 2023, the CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making between patients and clinicians; adults at highest risk for severe RSV disease are most likely to benefit and should be prioritized for vaccination. To describe persons who experienced severe RSV disease requiring hospitalization, data from a large, geographically diverse surveillance system were analyzed to identify characteristics of adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during the 2022–23 respiratory virus season.

### Updated guidance for palivizumab prophylaxis among infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^114jMgeo]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Palivizumab was licensed in June 1998 by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at increased risk of severe disease. Since that time, the American Academy of Pediatrics has updated its guidance for the use of palivizumab four times as additional data became available. These updates aim to provide a better understanding of the infants and young children at greatest risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection.

The updated recommendations in this policy statement reflect new information regarding several factors:

- **Seasonality of RSV circulation**:
	- Understanding the timing and prevalence of RSV infections across different regions.

- **Palivizumab pharmacokinetics**:
	- Insights into how the drug is processed within the body.

- **Changing incidence of bronchiolitis hospitalizations**:
	- Observations on the trends in hospital admissions for bronchiolitis.

- **Effect of gestational age and other risk factors on RSV hospitalization rates**:
	- Analyzing how age at birth and additional factors influence the likelihood of hospitalization.

- **Mortality of children hospitalized with RSV infection**:
	- Evaluating the death rates among pediatric patients admitted due to RSV.

- **Effect of prophylaxis on wheezing**:
	- Assessing whether palivizumab helps in reducing episodes of wheezing.

- **Palivizumab-resistant RSV isolates**:
	- Identifying strains of RSV that show resistance to standard treatment.

This policy statement updates and replaces the recommendations found in the 2012 Red Book.

This study aims to describe adherence rates to the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Infectious Disease guidance document recommending which patients should receive palivizumab for prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

- **Methods**: A retrospective, single-center analysis of patients who received at least one dose of palivizumab between October 1, 2012, and March 1, 2017, was conducted. Data collected included demographics, medical history, palivizumab administration regimens, and the incidence of RSV infection.

- **Results**: Data were collected on 457 patients who received palivizumab over five RSV seasons. Approximately half of the patients (45% and 55%, respectively) received palivizumab according to the AAP recommendations in place at the time (2012 or 2014 recommendations, respectively). One percent of patients had a breakthrough RSV infection after receiving at least one dose of palivizumab. There was no significant difference in the number of breakthrough infections before and after the 2014 recommendations were released (3 vs. 2).

- **Conclusions**: Approximately half of the patients received prophylaxis in accordance with the 2014 AAP recommendations and infrequently suffered from a breakthrough RSV infection.

### Safety and immunogenicity of bivalent RSVpreF vaccine coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in older adults [^117SaiiV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory illness in people of all ages and can cause severe illness in infants and older adults. In temperate climates, RSV infection typically follows a seasonal pattern, resulting in annual wintertime epidemics. Although, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the RSV season was disrupted with interseasonal epidemics observed.

Adults aged 65 years and older and those who have chronic heart or lung conditions or are immunocompromised have an increased risk of serious RSV infection. The estimated disease burden among adults aged 60 years and older in high-income countries and regions (i.e. the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and South Korea) in 2019 was more than 5 million cases of acute respiratory illness, almost half a million RSV-associated hospitalizations, and more than 33,000 in-hospital deaths. Although available studies suggest that RSV morbidity and mortality may be comparable to influenza in older adults, the burden of adult RSV disease is underestimated.

Like RSV illness, influenza is typically seasonal, with winter peaks in temperate climates. Older adults, particularly those with medical comorbidities, are at increased risk of influenza morbidity and mortality, and annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended in this population to prevent illness or reduce illness severity. In some countries, high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines are preferentially recommended for adults aged 65 years and older.

The RSV prefusion F protein–based (RSVpreF) vaccine is a bivalent.

### Estimating the respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalisation burden in older adults in European countries: A systematic analysis [^1132DDnS]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

With respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines recently approved for use among older adults, country-level RSV disease burden estimates are needed to inform local RSV immunisation strategy. We aimed to estimate the country-level RSV hospitalisation burden in older adults in Europe.

- **Methods**: We compiled data on RSV hospitalisation burden in adults aged ≥ 60 years in Europe from published studies (systematic review: PROSPERO CRD42024516945), surveillance data, and unpublished data from international collaborators. We adjusted for diagnostic testing, clinical specimens, and case definitions through statistical modelling techniques and generated country-level hospitalisation rate estimates. For countries with no available data, we developed an ensemble model to predict RSV hospitalisation rates. We also estimated RSV in-hospital case fatality ratio (hCFR) for countries with available data.

- **Results**: We included 14 studies (3 unpublished studies). The adjusted RSV-associated hospitalisation rates were overall 2.2 to 6.4 times higher than unadjusted estimates. Among 5 countries with available data, adjusted annual RSV hospitalisation rates ranged from 193/100,000 person-years in the Netherlands (95% confidence interval [CI]: 125–304) and Finland (141–274) to 414/100,000 in Denmark (322–514). The RSV hospitalisation rates predicted by the ensemble model in 23 additional countries ranged from 223/100,000 to 317/100,000 person-years. RSV hCFR ranged from 6.73% (4.63–9.69) in Spain to 10.14% (4.91–19.79) in Switzerland.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^116NEWg1]. American Journal of Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group met at least monthly to review the available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults; postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that provides advice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, normally meets three times per year to develop US vaccine recommendations. The ACIP met October 23 to 24, 2024, to discuss influenza vaccines, chikungunya vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) immunizations, meningococcal vaccines, human papillomavirus vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, and revisions to the adult and child/adolescent immunization schedules. This update summarizes the proceedings of these meetings, with an emphasis on topics that are most relevant to the pediatric population.

Major updates for pediatric clinicians include information regarding COVID-19 and influenza vaccine recommendations, considerations for meningococcal vaccination, and updates regarding the implementation and effectiveness of RSV immunization in pregnant people and infants.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus surveillance data to optimize the timing of immunoprophylaxis [^115QvR35]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

For children in the United States who are at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends administering immunoprophylaxis during the RSV season. We present an approach to using surveillance data to help guide the application of AAP recommendations for immunoprophylaxis to local patterns of RSV outbreaks.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from laboratories that report consistently to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System from 1992 to 2007. Local RSV seasons were defined, and an immunoprophylaxis schedule was determined using the median onset dates from each laboratory during 2002–2007. These dates were applied to 10 preceding years of RSV detection data. We compared how well the 5-year median-based method and a fixed date method matched the timing of immunoprophylaxis to the RSV season.

- **Results**: Nineteen laboratories met our inclusion criteria and generally experienced only one RSV outbreak per season. Five years of data provided similar median onset/offset dates and season duration, as did 10 years and 15 years of data. The 5-year median schedule increased the number of seasons that children were protected at the season onset by 15% compared to a fixed start date of November 1 and identified communities that experienced RSV seasons with extended durations.

- **Conclusions**: The 5-year median method can be used to characterize the timing of RSV seasons and optimally apply the AAP recommendations for timing of palivizumab prophylaxis to the local community.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important respiratory pathogen that produces annual epidemics of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children worldwide. The greatest morbidity and mortality occur among children at high risk for severe RSV disease, including premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease (CLD), and infants with complicated congenital heart disease.

These high-risk infants currently receive prophylaxis for RSV with palivizumab (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), which is recommended and indicated for the prevention of severe RSV disease in high-risk children. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes a highly conserved neutralizing epitope in the A antigenic site of the F glycoprotein of RSV. Monthly palivizumab administration has been shown to reduce RSV hospitalizations by approximately 50% compared with placebo in high-risk children with prematurity, CLD of prematurity, and congenital heart disease. In addition, in the IMpact study, preterm infants without CLD who received prophylaxis with palivizumab had an even greater reduction in RSV-related hospitalizations that approached 80%.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of severe respiratory disease in older adults. In the United States, an estimated 60,000–160,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 RSV-associated deaths occur each year among adults aged ≥ 65 years. On June 21, 2023, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making. Understanding the severity of RSV disease compared with that of other respiratory viral diseases in older adults is needed to guide this shared patient-provider clinical decision-making.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^116LQCbK]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of one dose of the GSK respiratory syncytial virus RSVpreF3 vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus–associated disease was studied among adults aged 60 years and older across multiple countries from 2021 to 2023.

- **Manufacturer-calculated efficacy**: Includes events occurring more than 14 days after injection and the person-time derived from the manufacturer's pivotal phase 3 trial. Estimates were adjusted for participant age and region.

- **LRTD definition**: Two or more lower respiratory symptoms (such as new or increased sputum, cough, and dyspnea) or signs (new or increased wheezing, crackles or rhonchi detected during chest auscultation, respiratory rate ≥ 20 respirations per minute, low or decreased oxygen saturation [< 95% or ≤ 90% if baseline was < 95%], and need for oxygen supplementation) persisting for 24 hours or more, must include one or more lower respiratory signs, or alternatively, three or more lower respiratory symptoms persisting for 24 hours or more.

- **Medically attended RSV-associated LRTD**: Defined as LRTD requiring attention at one or more inpatient or outpatient health care services. These estimates were not included in the per-protocol assessments.

- **Season 1 vaccine efficacy estimates**: Reflect efficacy against first events occurring during the first complete RSV season for Northern Hemisphere participants and a partial first RSV season for Southern Hemisphere participants (May 2021–April 2022; exact study-defined season dates were site-dependent).

Several confidence intervals are reported, including the primary trial endpoint CI adjusted for multiplicity (96.95%) and standard confidence intervals (95%).

### Bivalent RSVpreF vaccine in adults 18 to < 60 years old with high-risk conditions [^112XJ5Vz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of severe respiratory disease in infants, older adults, and individuals with health conditions that increase the risk of severe RSV illness. These risk factors in adults are similar to those for severe influenza and include older age, chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and immunocompromising conditions.

Although the incidence of severe RSV illness is highest in infants, young children, and older adults, there is also a substantial and underestimated burden due to RSV in adults younger than 60 years, especially among those with risk factors for severe disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating medically attended RSV events among US adults reported underdetection-adjusted hospitalization incidences of 67/100,000 and 13/100,000 for those 50–64 and 18–49 years of age, respectively. After adjustment for underdetection, emergency department admission rates and outpatient visits were respectively 110/100,000 and 1,722/100,000 for those 50–64 years of age and 198/100,000 and 1,401/100,000 for those 18–49 years of age. Consistent with these findings on rates of medically attended RSV events, in 2022, the annual economic burden in the United States due to RSV-associated hospitalization in adults 50–59 years of age was estimated to be US$1.1 billion.

### Characteristics and outcomes among adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus - RSV-NET, 12 states, July 2022-June 2023 [^1162ydLr]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. In May 2023, two RSV vaccines were approved for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In June 2023, the CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics (including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes) of 3,218 adults aged ≥ 60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022–June 2023.

Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged ≥ 75 years, and the most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%–21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 60 years. Overall, 17.0% (95% CI = 14.5%–19.7%) of patients with RSV infection were admitted to an intensive care unit, 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5%–6.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 4.7% (95% CI = 3.6%–6.1%) died; 17.2% (95% CI = 14.9%–19.8%) of all cases occurred in long-term care facility residents. These data highlight the importance of prioritizing those at highest risk for severe RSV disease and suggest that clinicians and patients consider age (particularly age ≥ 75 years), long-term care facilities, and other underlying risk factors in decision-making regarding vaccination and treatment.

### What is the role of rapid molecular testing for seniors and other at-risk adults with respiratory syncytial virus infections [^115ov3ak]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2019). High credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospitalization, with viruses being important causal pathogens, especially in the elderly, immunocompromised patients, and those with respiratory or cardiovascular comorbidities. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as comprising a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality in older and at-risk adults. The emergence of rapid point-of-care molecular testing has made it possible to confirm an RSV diagnosis accurately in a clinically actionable timeframe.

RSV patients have significantly higher healthcare resource use, including hospital stays and emergency room/urgent care visits, than non-RSV matched controls, particularly if aged ≥ 65 years. They experience a longer length of hospitalization than those with influenza and incur associated costs nearly three times higher. We found no direct clinical outcome data specific to rapid molecular testing for RSV in adults and very little in children. There is very limited evidence that prompt diagnosis may reduce hospital length of stay; however, this and other outcome parameters need confirmation in larger, prospective clinical trials.

Regarding the reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, the picture is mixed, and testing alone is unlikely to change entrenched habits. There is little incentive for clinicians to order routine RSV tests in adults, given the absence of a specific antiviral therapy. However, with numerous vaccine and antiviral candidates in clinical development, we believe it is good practice to plan and start establishing standardized testing protocols, perhaps as part of outpatient care.

### Recommendations for the prevention of RSV disease in infants and children: Policy statement [^116mzcmK]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, particularly in terms of immunization for infants and children, the AAP 2025 guidelines recommend offering RSV immunization for:

- **Infants < 8 months of age**: Born during or entering their first RSV season if the pregnant parent did not receive the RSV vaccine during pregnancy, the vaccination status of the pregnant parent is unknown, or the infant was born < 14 days after the pregnant parent's vaccination.

- **Infants and children 8 through 19 months of age**: At high risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season, regardless of the vaccination status of the pregnant parent or the child's prior receipt of nirsevimab or clesrovimab when < 8 months of age in their first RSV season.

### Updated guidance for palivizumab prophylaxis among infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^114cgzmA]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the use of palivizumab prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first published in a policy statement in 1998. Initially, this guidance was based on results from a single randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 1996–1997, which described an overall reduction in RSV hospitalization rates from 10.6% among placebo recipients to 4.8% among children who received prophylaxis. In 2003, the results of a second randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving children with hemodynamically significant heart disease were published. This trial revealed a reduction in RSV hospitalization rates from 9.7% in control subjects to 5.3% among prophylaxis recipients.

Because no additional controlled trials regarding efficacy have been published, AAP guidance has been updated periodically to reflect the most recent literature regarding children at greatest risk of severe disease. Since the last update in 2012, new data have become available on the seasonality of RSV circulation, palivizumab pharmacokinetics, the changing incidence of bronchiolitis hospitalizations, and the effects of gestational age and other risk factors on RSV hospitalization rates. Further data on the mortality of children hospitalized with RSV infection and the effect of prophylaxis on wheezing and palivizumab-resistant RSV isolates are also available. These data enable further refinement of AAP guidance to focus more clearly on those children at greatest risk.

### Characteristics and outcomes among adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus - RSV-NET, 12 states, July 2022-June 2023 [^114m4Esr]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

- **Figure 2 - Age distribution**: Among persons aged ≥ 60 years residing in the surveillance network catchment area and among laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus–associated hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and in-hospital deaths — Respiratory Syncytial Virus–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, 12 states, October 2022–April 2023.

Abbreviations: ICU = intensive care unit; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; RSV-NET = Respiratory Syncytial Virus–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network.

The RSV catchment area includes select counties in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah. RSV-associated hospitalizations among RSV-NET catchment area residents have hospital admission dates from October 1, 2022, through April 30, 2023. Those with severe RSV disease might be more likely to receive RSV testing; therefore, these data could potentially overestimate the proportion of severe outcomes among hospitalized patients.

### Clinical endpoints for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis trials in infants and children in high-income and middle-income countries [^1118baNZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continues to cause a significant clinical and economic burden around the world. Historically, RSV-associated hospitalization was used as a primary endpoint for RSV prophylaxis trials in infants. However, due to the changing epidemiology and healthcare system landscape, this endpoint has become a critical bottleneck on the pathway to licensure for new therapeutics. A panel of seven RSV experts was convened in Chicago, IL, on May 22, 2014, to evaluate the challenges of defining RSV prevention endpoints for clinical trials and to develop endpoints that are clinically meaningful while minimizing subjectivity and bias to achieve sufficient consistency of response for regulatory approval.

Particular consideration was given to the ability to collect data systematically and consistently in countries with different healthcare practices and systems, while capturing the greatest proportion of disease impact. The group consensus was that a clinically meaningful primary endpoint could include medically attended RSV illness in settings beyond RSV-associated hospitalizations alone. In particular, they suggested a composite reduction in hospitalization, emergency room, or urgent care center visits due to an RSV respiratory infection. Relevant secondary endpoints included reductions in RSV lower respiratory tract infection, RSV-related intensive care unit rates, subsequent re-wheezing or asthma, and direct and indirect costs.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prevention within reach: the vaccine and monoclonal antibody landscape [^117LEmW7]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus is the second most common cause of infant mortality and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (aged > 60 years). Efforts to develop a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine or immunoprophylaxis remain highly active. Thirty-three respiratory syncytial virus prevention candidates are in clinical development using six different approaches: recombinant vector, subunit, particle-based, live attenuated, chimeric, and nucleic acid vaccines; and monoclonal antibodies. Nine candidates are in phase 3 clinical trials. Understanding the epitopes targeted by highly neutralizing antibodies has resulted in a shift from empirical to rational and structure-based vaccine and monoclonal antibody design.

An extended half-life monoclonal antibody for all infants is likely to be within one year of regulatory approval (from August 2022) for high-income countries. Live attenuated vaccines are in development for older infants (aged > 6 months). Subunit vaccines are in late-stage trials for pregnant women to protect infants, whereas vector, subunit, and nucleic acid approaches are being developed for older adults. Urgent next steps include ensuring access and affordability of a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine globally. This review provides an overview of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines and monoclonal antibodies in clinical development, highlighting different target populations, antigens, and trial results.

### Respiratory syncytial virus in adults with comorbidities: an update on epidemiology, vaccines, and treatments [^111RHfgr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is widely known as a frequent cause of respiratory distress among adults, particularly in older individuals. Recent years have witnessed several improvements in respiratory virus detection, leading to more questions about therapeutic management strategies.

- **Objectives**: This narrative review focuses on the RSV burden in older people and adults with risk factors, providing an update on the main recent developments regarding managing this infection.

- **Sources**: A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted until August 2023 to identify studies on RSV among the adult population. We included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on vaccines and different therapies.

- **Content**: This review should give clinicians an overview of RSV epidemiology and burden among older people and adults with pre-existing risk factors, the most recent RCTs on RSV vaccines, and the existing data on the different therapeutics existing and under development.

- **Implications**: There is a growing body of evidence on the RSV burden in adults. The landscape of preventive and curative treatments is quickly evolving.

### Expert consensus on palivizumab use for respiratory syncytial virus in developed countries [^1113ofNH]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of hospitalization in early childhood, and palivizumab is the only licensed intervention for prevention. Palivizumab guidelines should reflect the latest evidence, taking into account cost-effectiveness and healthcare budgetary considerations. RSV experts from Europe, Canada, and Israel conducted a systematic review of the evidence over the last five years and developed recommendations for prophylaxis in industrialized countries. Almost 400 publications were reviewed.

This group recommended palivizumab for:

- **Preterm infants**: (< 29 and ≤ 31 weeks gestational age [wGA] and ≤ 9 and ≤ 6 months of age, respectively; high-risk 32–35wGA)
- **Former preterm children** ≤ 24 months with chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia
- **Children** ≤ 24 months with significant congenital heart disease
- **Other high-risk populations**: such as children ≤ 24 months with Down syndrome, pulmonary/neuromuscular disorders, immunocompromised conditions, and cystic fibrosis

Up to five monthly doses should be administered over the RSV season. It is our impression that the adoption of these guidelines would help reduce the burden of RSV.

### Why the UK is vaccinating its older adult population against RSV-what geriatricians should know [^115EGHUE]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

The UK is launching a new free vaccination program against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for adults aged 75 or over. This initiative follows the development of safe and effective vaccines against RSV and the growing realization of the burden of RSV-related disease in older adults, estimated at approximately 8,000 deaths and 175,000 general practitioner episodes each year in the UK. It is likely that the full burden of RSV-related illness is underappreciated and under-reported due to a lack of testing and awareness of its dangers in older adults.

Healthcare professionals working with older people should be aware of the evidence base and be in a position to advise patients on the risks and benefits of vaccination and non-vaccination. We briefly review the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of the two licensed vaccines against RSV, with a special focus on what geriatricians and others working with frailer, older people need to know.

### The disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus in older adults [^113DZcxj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Considerable progress has been made in developing RSV vaccines for older adults. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently approved two RSV vaccines for this age group: RSVpreF, an unadjuvanted bivalent RSV vaccine with F protein in prefusion conformation, and RSVPreF3, an adjuvanted monovalent RSV vaccine with F protein in prefusion conformation. Both vaccines demonstrated very high efficacy rates along with durable protection for at least two years. The RSVPreF3 vaccine has also been licensed in Japan and Canada.

RSVpreF was tested on 34,284 participants enrolled between August 31, 2021, and July 14, 2022, showing an efficacy of 66.7% (96.6% CI: 28.8; 85.8) against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with at least two symptoms, and an efficacy of 85.7% (96.6% CI: 32.0; 98.7) with at least three symptoms at the end of the first season. RSVPreF3, evaluated on participants enrolled from 2021 to 2023, demonstrated an efficacy of 74.5% (95% CI: 60.0; 84.5) against RSV-associated LRTI over combined seasons one and two. In season one, the efficacy against RSV-associated LRTI was 82.6% (95% CI: 57.9; 94.1) and 87.5% (95% CI: 58.9; 97.6) against RSV-associated medically attended LRTI. In season two, the efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was 56.1% (95% CI: 28.2; 74.4).

Both vaccines demonstrated similar efficacies in adults aged 75 and older, as well as in those with comorbidities. However, concerns emerged regarding certain side effects, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and atrial fibrillation, which were observed post-vaccination in trials of both vaccines.

### National evidence in Israel supporting reevaluation of respiratory syncytial virus prophylactic guidelines [^11582xUx]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently narrowed the indications for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis, while in Israel, the guidelines have not changed.

- **Objective**: To compare the prevalence and severity of RSV infection among preterm infants born earlier than 34 weeks of gestation (PI), late preterm infants born at 34–36 weeks (LPTI), and term infants born after 37 weeks of gestation (TI) and to determine whether the results support a change in local policy.

- **Methods**: Data of all children aged 0–14 years hospitalized with PCR-positive RSV in a single tertiary center from 2010 to 2014 were collected. A total of 793 children were included and divided into 3 groups: 637 were TI, 105 were LPTI, and 50 were PI. These groups were compared regarding the incidence of hospitalization due to RSV infection, intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, and length of hospitalization.

- **Results**: The hospitalization rate due to RSV infection was 5.2%, 3.5%, and 1.3% among PI, LPTI, and TI, respectively (p < 0.01). The ICU hospitalization rate was 24%, 7.6%, and 3% among PI, LPTI, and TI, respectively (p < 0.001). The length (days) of hospitalization was significantly longer among PI compared with LPTI and TI (p < 0.001). Overall, the hospitalization rate and disease severity were significantly higher for infants born earlier than 35 weeks of gestation compared with more maturely born infants.

- **Conclusion**: RSV infection remains a major cause of morbidity among children born prematurely even after RSV prophylaxis and would probably be greater were it not for these preventive measures.
