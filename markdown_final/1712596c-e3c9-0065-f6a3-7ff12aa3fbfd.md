## Question

What causes parathyroid hormone elevation in chronic kidney disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and how it evolves with declining kidney function. Then, I should verify the specific drivers of PTH elevation, including phosphate retention, vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and FGF23 resistance. Next, I will examine end-organ resistance to PTH and the role of PTH fragments. After that, I should consider the adaptive versus maladaptive phases and the clinical implications for PTH targets. Finally, I will integrate these into a coherent causal model and highlight modifiable factors and guideline-based evaluation steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why PTH rises in CKD. CKD-MBD begins early in CKD and progresses as eGFR declines, with detectable abnormalities in calcium, phosphate, vitamin D metabolites, PTH, and FGF23; this framework anchors the subsequent causal reasoning and is explicitly outlined in contemporary KDIGO guidance and summaries, so I should keep that front and center as I proceed [^075cae98] [^8d40a801].

> Now, I will examine phosphate retention and FGF23 dynamics, because I need to ensure I get the sequence right. Early in CKD, phosphate balance is maintained by rising FGF23, which increases urinary phosphate excretion and suppresses 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis; however, as CKD advances, FGF23's phosphaturic effect wanes and phosphate retention emerges, directly stimulating PTH secretion and contributing to parathyroid hyperplasia, so phosphate is both a trigger and a driver of escalating PTH over time [^84811cd7] [^65ef574b] [^21af0bfd].

> Wait, let me verify the vitamin D axis next, because it is easy to overstate causality. Reduced renal mass and FGF23-mediated suppression of 1α-hydroxylase lower calcitriol, which diminishes intestinal calcium absorption and removes negative feedback at the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor, thereby amplifying PTH secretion; this calcitriol deficiency is a key permissive factor for secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD and is repeatedly emphasized in pathophysiology reviews and guidelines [^075cae98] [^3731a974].

> I should confirm the calcium signal itself. Hypocalcemia resulting from reduced calcitriol, phosphate retention, and impaired renal calcium reabsorption directly stimulates PTH secretion via the calcium-sensing receptor; this is a classic stimulus–response mechanism that becomes more pronounced as kidney function deteriorates, reinforcing the PTH elevation in later CKD stages [^075cae98] [^1531f439].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about PTH being purely a pathological driver; I need to check the adaptive dimension. Early in CKD, PTH elevation helps maintain phosphate excretion and calcium balance despite falling GFR, but over time this becomes maladaptive with parathyroid hyperplasia, autonomous secretion, and skeletal complications; guidelines reflect this by recommending PTH targets in dialysis that are above "normal" to preserve necessary bone turnover while avoiding extremes [^075cae98] [^9a7f8584].

> Next, I should review end-organ resistance to PTH, because this changes how we interpret PTH values. In CKD, bone and kidney exhibit PTH hyporesponsiveness, necessitating higher circulating PTH to achieve the same calcemic and phosphaturic effects; mechanisms include downregulation of PTH receptors, uremic toxin interference, and altered signaling, which together create a disconnect between PTH concentration and biologic effect and complicate target-based therapy [^32f7696b] [^1df4c9eb].

> I will now examine PTH fragments and assay issues, since they can confound interpretation. CKD increases accumulation of C-terminal and oxidized PTH fragments that are detected by some assays but have reduced or antagonistic biologic activity; although nonoxidized PTH has been proposed as a more "active" marker, data show strong correlation with total PTH and similar associations with outcomes, so while assay variability is real, the clinical implication remains to trend PTH longitudinally and treat the mineral disturbances rather than chase a single number [^7b444f4b] [^d10c2329] [^18b6fda4].

> Let me consider the temporal evolution to ensure the causal chain is coherent. Early CKD features rising FGF23 with relatively preserved serum phosphate, declining calcitriol, and modest PTH increases; as CKD advances, phosphate retention emerges, hypocalcemia worsens, FGF23 resistance at the parathyroid develops, and PTH rises progressively with gland hyperplasia, culminating in severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in ESRD; this staged model aligns with observational cohorts and guideline descriptions of CKD-MBD progression [^075cae98] [^3a441b2d].

> But wait, what if other factors modulate PTH independent of the classic axis; I should double-check. Uremic toxins, metabolic acidosis, and altered parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor sensitivity can independently stimulate PTH secretion and contribute to resistance to feedback, while diabetes and loop diuretic use may exacerbate mineral losses and PTH elevation; these modifiers help explain interpatient variability and the need to individualize evaluation and treatment [^a60f70ac] [^3060f4a9] [^aaaecf66].

> Next, I should review guideline-based evaluation, because identifying modifiable drivers is actionable. KDIGO recommends that in CKD G3a–G5 not on dialysis, progressively rising or persistently elevated PTH should prompt evaluation and correction of hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, high phosphate intake, and vitamin D deficiency; in dialysis, maintaining PTH roughly 2–9 times the assay upper limit of normal is suggested, with therapy adjustments based on trends rather than isolated values, reflecting the adaptive–maladaptive balance and assay variability [^d383b982] [^9a7f8584] [^f241dce1].

> Let me synthesize the causal model to ensure internal consistency. PTH elevation in CKD is multifactorial: phosphate retention and FGF23 resistance, calcitriol deficiency, and hypocalcemia provide direct stimuli to the parathyroid; end-organ resistance necessitates higher PTH to maintain homeostasis; parathyroid hyperplasia and autonomy emerge over time; and accumulation of inactive PTH fragments complicates assay interpretation, collectively producing a compensatory system that becomes maladaptive and harmful if unchecked [^075cae98] [^32f7696b] [^7b444f4b].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical implications for management, because causation guides therapy. Addressing modifiable factors — dietary phosphate load, phosphate binders, native vitamin D repletion, and careful calcium management — targets upstream drivers of PTH; calcimimetics and, when refractory, parathyroidectomy are reserved for advanced or unresponsive disease; throughout, decisions should be based on serial trends in phosphate, calcium, and PTH rather than single values, aligning treatment with the underlying pathophysiology and minimizing unintended consequences [^d383b982] [^9a7f8584] [^d724bbed].

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) rises in chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to **phosphate retention** and **calcitriol deficiency**, which drive secondary hyperparathyroidism [^075cae98]. As kidney function declines, phosphate excretion falls, prompting FGF-23 to increase and suppress calcitriol, which reduces intestinal calcium absorption and triggers PTH secretion [^84811cd7]. Hypocalcemia, **vitamin D deficiency**, and uremic toxins further amplify PTH release and parathyroid hyperplasia [^a60f70ac]. Over time, the parathyroid glands become autonomous, causing persistent PTH elevation even after mineral disturbances are corrected [^135903d9]. Management focuses on controlling phosphate, correcting calcium and vitamin D, and using calcimimetics or surgery when indicated [^d383b982] [^9a7f8584].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of PTH elevation in CKD

### Phosphate retention and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23)

- **Phosphate retention**: Reduced GFR impairs phosphate excretion, causing phosphate accumulation [^075cae98].
- **FGF-23 elevation**: To maintain phosphate balance, FGF-23 rises and suppresses calcitriol synthesis, reducing intestinal calcium absorption and stimulating PTH [^84811cd7].
- **Parathyroid resistance**: In CKD, parathyroid tissue becomes resistant to FGF-23, so PTH remains elevated despite high FGF-23 [^84811cd7].

---

### Vitamin D metabolism disturbances

Calcitriol deficiency results from impaired 1α-hydroxylation in the kidney, which reduces intestinal calcium absorption and increases PTH [^075cae98]. Vitamin D deficiency is common in CKD and further worsens hypocalcemia and PTH elevation [^6ff7be84].

---

### Hypocalcemia and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) dysregulation

Hypocalcemia from low calcitriol and phosphate retention directly stimulates PTH secretion [^1531f439]. CaSR dysregulation occurs as uremic toxins and chronic stimulation alter CaSR sensitivity, increasing PTH set point and secretion [^a60f70ac].

---

### Parathyroid gland hyperplasia and autonomy

Parathyroid hyperplasia develops with sustained stimulation, increasing gland mass and PTH output [^8ca25c0b]. Autonomous secretion emerges over time, with PTH remaining high even after mineral disturbances are corrected [^135903d9].

---

### Accumulation of PTH fragments

PTH fragments accumulate in CKD because reduced clearance increases inactive C-terminal fragments, which can interfere with PTH assays and signaling [^32f7696b].

---

## Clinical consequences of elevated PTH in CKD

Elevated PTH in CKD causes **bone disease** — renal osteodystrophy with high turnover, bone pain, and fractures [^d0d4b8f1] — and contributes to **vascular calcification**, increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [^bc95ce6b]. It also acts as a uremic toxin, causing pruritus, anemia, and neuromuscular symptoms [^98b0f8a5].

---

## Management strategies for controlling PTH levels in CKD

- **Phosphate control**: Dietary phosphate restriction, phosphate binders, and dialysis reduce phosphate load and PTH [^0d51e257].
- **Calcium and vitamin D management**: Calcium supplementation and active vitamin D analogs correct hypocalcemia and suppress PTH, with caution to avoid hypercalcemia [^4fc8ddd1].
- **Calcimimetics**: Cinacalcet and evocalcet lower PTH by sensitizing CaSR, especially in dialysis patients [^b3093ccd].
- **Parathyroidectomy**: For refractory hyperparathyroidism, surgical removal of hyperplastic glands is indicated [^7e2b2d2d].

---

PTH elevation in CKD is driven by **phosphate retention**, calcitriol deficiency, hypocalcemia, and parathyroid hyperplasia, with contributions from FGF-23 resistance and uremic toxins. Management targets these drivers to prevent bone disease, vascular calcification, and uremic symptoms.

### PTH – a particularly tricky hormone: why measure it at all in kidney patients? [^9022af01]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations are commonly measured in the context of CKD, as PTH concentration elevation is typical in this clinical context. Much has been inferred from this raised PTH concentration tendency, both about the state of skeletal integrity and health and also about the potential clinical outcomes for patients. However, we feel that reliance on PTH concentrations alone is a dangerous substitute for the search for, and use of, more precise and reliable biomarkers. In this article, we rehearse these arguments, bringing together patient-level and analytical considerations for the first time.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) is a selective update of the prior CKD-MBD guideline published in 2009. The guideline update and the original publication are intended to assist practitioners caring for adults with CKD and those receiving long-term dialysis.

Methods

Development of the guideline update followed an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. The approach adopted by the Work Group and the evidence review team was based on systematic reviews of relevant trials, appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and rating of the strength of recommendations according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Searches of the English-language literature were conducted through September 2015 and were supplemented with targeted searches through February 2017. Final modification of the guidelines was informed by a public review process involving numerous stakeholders, including patients, subject matter experts, and industry and national organizations.

Recommendations

The update process resulted in the revision of 15 recommendations. This synopsis focuses primarily on recommendations for diagnosis of and testing for CKD-MBD and treatment of CKD-MBD that emphasizes decreasing phosphate levels, maintaining calcium levels, and addressing elevated parathyroid hormone levels in adults with CKD stage G3a to G5 and those receiving dialysis. Key elements include basing treatment on trends in laboratory values rather than a single abnormal result and being cautious to avoid hypercalcemia when treating secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Is there an association between elevated or low serum levels of phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and calcium and mortality in patients with end stage renal disease? A meta-analysis [^bc95ce6b]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), the deterioration of kidney function is often accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) involving disturbances in mineral metabolism, including elevated levels of serum phosphorus, decreased calcium, and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). Observational studies suggest that biochemical markers of altered mineral metabolism are associated with poor clinical outcomes among patients with ESRD requiring dialysis, although controversy exists regarding the strength of the evidence and the independent nature of these relationships [-].

In a systematic review published in 2008, Covic et al. identified 22 studies published from 1980–2007 that assessed the association between disturbances in biochemical parameters and all-cause mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including 19 studies of patients on dialysis. The authors noted that the studies were too clinically and methodologically diverse to permit an appropriate meta-analysis. Nevertheless, a qualitative assessment of the studies led them to conclude that elevated values in certain biochemical parameters, specifically the serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus, as well as very low values of phosphorus, were associated with an increase in mortality risk among patients on dialysis.

### Is parathyroid hormone measurement useful for the diagnosis of renal bone disease? [^14bb0c00]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The non-invasive diagnosis of bone turnover in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains difficult compared with bone histomorphometry as the gold standard. Most clinicians rely on surrogate markers, mainly serum parathyroid hormone and total alkaline phosphatases, in association with serum calcium and phosphorus. Although very high serum PTH levels generally allow the diagnosis of high bone turnover, slight elevations, normal, or low values cannot allow a reliable distinction between normal or low turnover.

### Skeletal parathyroid hormone hyporesponsiveness: a neglected, but clinically relevant reality in chronic kidney disease [^1df4c9eb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Defining the optimal parathyroid hormone (PTH) target in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging, especially for bone outcomes, due to the substantial variability in the skeleton's response to PTH. Although PTH hyporesponsiveness is as integral a component of CKD-mineral bone disorder as elevated PTH levels, clinical awareness of this condition is limited. In this review, we will discuss factors and mechanisms contributing to PTH hyporesponsiveness in CKD. This knowledge may provide clues towards a personalized approach to treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD.

Recent Findings

Indicates a link between disturbed phosphate metabolism and impaired skeletal calcium sensing receptor signaling as an important mediator of PTH hyporesponsiveness in CKD. Further, cohort studies with diverse populations point towards differences in mineral metabolism control, rather than genetic or environmental factors, as drivers of the variability of PTH responsiveness.

In Summary

Skeletal PTH hyporesponsiveness in CKD has a multifactorial origin, shows important interindividual variability, and is challenging to estimate in clinical practice. The variability in skeletal responsiveness compromises PTH as a biomarker of bone turnover, especially when considering populations that are heterogeneous in ethnicity, demography, kidney function, primary kidney disease and mineral metabolism control, and in patients treated with bone targeting drugs.

### Does it matter how parathyroid hormone levels are suppressed in secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^0c5a6cae]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Because secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease, suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and minimization of associated derangements in mineral metabolism are cardinal therapeutic goals. There is an ongoing debate regarding the proper treatment strategy for PTH suppression in this population. While some practitioners believe that calcitriol analogues should be the primary therapy in this setting, others contend that calcimimetics offer unique treatment benefits. Recent advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the secondary effects of these agents may help clarify this debate. Here, we review the classical actions of calcitriol analogues and calcimimetics on mineral metabolism. We also examine the potential nonclassical effects of these therapies on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, proteinuria, vascular calcification, fibroblast growth factor-23, inflammation, and overall survival.

### Is serum phosphorus control related to parathyroid hormone control in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^e05aca8f]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by progressively impaired metabolism of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D, eventually leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), a clinical syndrome of abnormal mineral and bone metabolism and extraskeletal calcifications that is associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, cardiovascular morbidity and death.

As elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphorus and calcium have all been linked with increased morbidity and mortality in dialysis (CKD stage 5D) patients [-], the National Kidney Foundation’s Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI™ [KDOQI TM) in 2003 recommended stringent targets for intact PTH (iPTH; 150–300 pg/mL), calcium (8.4–9.5 mg/dL) and phosphorus (3.5–5.5 mg/dL) for this population of patients. With increasing awareness of the key contribution of elevated serum phosphorus to vascular calcification and cardiovascular morbidity [,,,-], more recent guidelines from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group have highlighted the importance of tight control of serum phosphorus and calcium. KDIGO suggest that levels as close to normal as possible should be aimed for in dialysis patients and that the choice of pharmacological treatment should be influenced by these parameters.

### Screening, identifying, and treating chronic kidney disease: why, who, when, how, and what? [^7a3ef866]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

What?

Confirmation and staging

The diagnosis of CKD requires demonstration of reduced GFR or evidence of kidney damage for 3 or more months. Investigation for chronicity includes trending prior laboratory results for confirmation of stability. In the absence of previous eGFR results, observation of small echogenic kidneys on imaging, or imaging manifestations of secondary hyperparathyroidism confirm chronicity. If duration of kidney disease is unable to be confirmed, AKI should be ruled out. Once identified, CKD should be staged based on the cause-GFR-albuminuria (C-G-A) classification. Optimal care of patients with CKD includes a multifaceted approach with optimization of diet, lifestyle, comorbidities, and pharmacotherapy.

### Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism: the importance and the challenge of controlling parathyroid hormone levels without elevating calcium, phosphorus, and calcium-phosphorus product [^9625a76d]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that can lead to clinically significant bone disease. Additional consequences of secondary HPT, such as soft-tissue and vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and calcific uremic arteriolopathy, may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among CKD patients. Secondary HPT arises from disturbances in calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone metabolism, which develop early in the course of CKD and become more prominent as kidney function declines. The standard therapies currently recommended to correct mineral metabolism and bone disease in these patients include calcium supplementation, dietary phosphorus restriction, phosphate-binding agents, and treatment with vitamin D sterols. However, such medications often have significant effects on the serum levels of calcium and phosphorus, which result in exacerbation of the disease and significant extraskeletal morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a need to identify more effective treatment approaches. This review discusses the pathophysiology of secondary HPT, the challenges faced in the management of this disorder, and the impact of current treatment options on patients' risks of morbidity and mortality. In addition, the development of new, more physiologically relevant therapies, which may lead to successful management of secondary HPT, is reviewed.

### Parathyroid hormone metabolism and signaling in health and chronic kidney disease [^32f7696b]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) shows a complex relationship with hard outcomes in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Moreover, intervention studies directly targeting PTH failed to yield unequivocal results. Disturbed PTH metabolism, posttranslational modifications of PTH, and end-organ hyporesponsiveness to PTH may explain the poor performance of PTH as an outcome biomarker and precise target of therapy in the setting of CKD, at least in the gray middle target zone. PTH fragments accumulate in CKD patients and may exert effects that are distinct from, if not opposite to biointact (1-84)PTH. Posttranslational modification of PTH and especially oxidation may alter the interaction of PTH with its receptor. Its clinical relevance, however, remains a matter of ongoing debate. Less controversial is the issue of end-organ hyporesponsiveness to PTH. This phenomenon, formally referred to as PTH resistance, has long been recognized in CKD, but factors and mechanisms contributing to it remain poorly defined. Subsequent evidence identified downregulation of the PTH receptor and competing downstream signals as underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. End-organ hyporesponsiveness to PTH in CKD, along with important analytical and biological variability, renders defining the PTH target range in CKD challenging. Although this may still be accomplished at the population level, it may prove to be very difficult at the individual level. This is a disillusioning thought in an era of personalized medicine. Parallel to the search of a functional and readily available assay quantifying PTH signaling tone or sensitivity, additional biomarkers (or a panel of biomarkers) should be formally evaluated.

### Analysis of time to diagnosis and outcomes among adults with primary hyperparathyroidism (...) [^ce4478ad]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

To convert albumin to grams per liter, multiply by 10; calcium to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0. 25; parathyroid hormone to nanograms per liter, multiply by
1. CKD indicates chronic kidney disease; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; PHP, primary hyperparathyroidism. Exposures Elevated serum calcium. Main Outcomes and Measures Existing symptoms and diagnoses associated with PHP compared in patients deemed high-risk and without a diagnosis and matched controls, and those who experienced times from documented hypercalcemia to diagnosis and diagnosis to treatment within or beyond 1 year. Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a benign overgrowth of single or multiple parathyroid glands.

It is the most common cause of hypercalcemia, 1, 2 with a prevalence of 0. 1% to
1. 0% and incidence of 28 cases per 100 000. 3-5 A biochemical diagnosis is made in the setting of elevated calcium and nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone. 1 Classic symptomatic PHP is associated with osteoporosis, fracture, and urolithiasis. Although the reference laboratory range for PTH is 10 to 65 pg/mL, concentrations as low as 25 pg/mL may be abnormally elevated and indicative of PHP in the setting of hypercalcemia. 25, 26 Therefore, PTH greater than or equal to 50 pg/mL was chosen as a conservative cutoff for this study. 27, 28 We assumed the latter group was at high risk for PHP because more than 90% of hypercalcemia cases are attributed to malignant neoplasms or PHP, 29 and we excluded patients with malignant neoplasms or other potential causes of hypercalcemia.

Compared with matched controls without hypercalcemia, high-risk patients with hypercalcemia and PTH greater than or equal to 50 pg/mL experienced significantly increased rates of all symptoms and diagnoses associated with PHP. Patients with unexplained hypercalcemia without documented additional workup also experienced significantly increased rates vs controls.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 KDIGO clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and Treatment of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) [^e4b4d52d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary—evaluation and treatment approach: compared with earlier guidance that acted on any PTH value above normal, the update targets PTH values that are progressively rising or persistently above the upper normal limit and emphasizes not initiating treatment for a single elevated PTH value because the optimal PTH concentration remains undefined, modest PTH elevation can be an adaptive phosphaturic response as glomerular filtration rate declines, and resistance to skeletal effects of PTH may not necessitate correction to normal levels; the KDOQI work group agrees with this update and its justification.

### Mineral metabolism and vitamin D in chronic kidney disease – more questions than answers [^5c0b3e76]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The underlying pathophysiology of this association remains largely unexplained and there is currently no clear interventional pathway. Emphasis has been placed on measuring serum levels of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) to monitor disease progression, driven by the assumption that achieving values within the 'normal' range will translate into improved outcomes. Retrospective studies have provided a body of evidence that abnormal levels of mineral biomarkers, and phosphate in particular, are associated with clinical events. Disturbances in vitamin D metabolism are also likely to contribute to the pathophysiology of CKD. Designing studies that yield useful information has proved to be difficult, partly owing to conceptual and financial limitations, but also because of the tight interdependency of calcium, phosphate and PTH, and the potential impact of vitamin D on these mineral metabolites. An intervention that perturbs any one of these factors is likely to exert effects on the others, making isolation of the individual variables almost impossible. However, some therapies in current use have the potential to act as probes to answer questions relating to the association between mineral biomarkers and outcomes in CKD.

### Significance of elevated parathyroid hormone after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^2e192e12]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on persistent parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation after surgical resection for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and to suggest a schedule for follow-up monitoring and strategies for future study.

Methods

We reviewed the literature targeting studies with detailed analysis of biochemical parameters before and after parathyroidectomy for PHPT. We focused on potential etiologies and currently available outcome data.

Results

PTH elevation with eucalcemia after parathyroidectomy for PHPT occurs in 12% to 43% of patients. Underlying etiology is probably multifactorial, and possible causes include bone hunger, vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium intake or absorption, reduced peripheral sensitivity to PTH, underlying chronic kidney disease, and/or a renal leak of calcium. No consensus exists on how to follow-up and treat these patients.

Conclusions

Although most patients with PTH elevation after parathyroidectomy will have normalization of PTH levels with time and/or calcium and vitamin D supplementation, this finding may be an early indicator of autonomous parathyroid secretion in a small number of patients. Patients with persistent PTH elevation should be monitored over time for recurrence of PHPT and other possible complications. A standardized follow-up protocol is needed to better study and elucidate the clinical significance of elevated PTH after parathyroidectomy.

### Calcimimetics for secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease patients [^b3093ccd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Calcimimetic agents lower abnormal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in people who have chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the benefits and harms on patient-level outcomes are uncertain. Since this review was first published in 2006 showing that evidence for calcimimetics was largely restricted to biochemical outcomes, additional studies have been conducted. This is an update of a review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of cinacalcet on patient-level outcomes in adults with CKD.

Search Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and conference proceedings were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any calcimimetic against placebo or another agent in adults with CKD (persistent albuminuria > 30 mg/g with or without reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (below 60 mL/min/1.73 m²)). We updated searches to 7 February 2013 including the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to complete this update.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs of a calcimimetic administered to patients with CKD for the treatment of elevated serum PTH levels.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted on all relevant patient-centred and surrogate outcomes. We summarised treatment estimates using random effects and expressed treatment effects as a risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eighteen studies (7446 participants) compared cinacalcet in addition to standard therapy with no treatment or placebo plus standard therapy. In adults with GFR category G5 (GFR below 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) treated with dialysis, routine cinacalcet treatment had little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.05), imprecise effects on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.87), and prevented surgical parathyroidectomy (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59) and hypercalcaemia (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.97), but increased hypocalcaemia (RR 6.98, 95% CI 5.10 to 9.53), nausea (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.81) and vomiting (RR 1.97, 95% CI 95% CI 1.73 to 2.24). Cinacalcet decreased serum PTH (MD -281.39 pg/mL, 95% CI -325.84 to -234.94) and calcium (MD -0.87 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.77) levels, but had little or no effect on serum phosphorous levels (MD -0.23 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.12).Data were sparse for adults with GFR categories G3a to G4 (GFR 15 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and kidney transplant recipients.Overall, based on GRADE criteria, evidence for cinacalcet in adults with GFR category G5 treated with dialysis (mortality, parathyroidectomy, hypocalcaemia, and nausea) is of high or moderate quality. High quality evidence suggests "further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect" and moderate quality evidence is "further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate". Information for adults with less severe CKD GFR category G3a to G4 is of low or very low quality. This means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate

Authors' Conclusions

Routine cinacalcet therapy reduced the need for parathyroidectomy in adults treated with dialysis and elevated PTH levels but does not improve all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Cinacalcet increases risks of nausea, vomiting and hypocalcaemia, suggesting harms may outweigh benefits in this population.

### Parathyroid hormone measurement in CKD [^4943df44]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines recommend that serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be measured regularly and maintained within target ranges that are defined according to the stage of CKD (e.g., 150-300 pg/ml in patients with CKD stage 5). The quality of the PTH assay is of paramount importance, as it contributes to the therapeutic decision. Indeed, when the PTH concentration is above these target values, drugs that decrease PTH secretion, such as active vitamin D compounds or calcimimetic agents, may be given and the doses are then adapted according to the evolution of the PTH concentration. By contrast, if the PTH concentration is below the target range, any treatment that may decrease PTH secretion is stopped to avoid adynamic bone disease and associated extra-skeletal calcifications. The aim of this article is to discuss the main features and pitfalls related to PTH measurement in the setting of CKD.

### Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with higher mortality in men with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease [^611ec548]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with mortality in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. We studied 515 male US veterans with chronic kidney disease, who were not yet on dialysis, to see what outcomes were associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in this population. Relationships between intact parathyroid hormone levels and all-cause mortality along with the composite of mortality or incidence of dialysis were measured in unadjusted and adjusted Cox models for case-mix and laboratory variables. Elevated parathyroid hormone levels above the upper limit compared to the lower limit of the normal range were significantly associated with mortality after adjustments. Higher intact parathyroid hormone levels in the upper limit of normal were significantly associated with higher mortality overall and showed similar trends in subgroups of patients with stage 3 and stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease and with higher and lower serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Similar associations were found with the composite outcome of mortality or dialysis. Our study shows that secondary hyperparathyroidism is independently associated with higher mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease but not yet on dialysis.

### Treatment failure of active vitamin D therapy in chronic kidney disease: predictive factors [^fc8d1a5e]. American Journal of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), impaired renal function leads to decreased vitamin D levels, which causes an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) production and contributes to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). This may result in adverse clinical effects such as bone disorders, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality. Current treatment practices and associated outcomes with active vitamin D treatment in patients with CKD were reviewed with the objective to assess parameters (such as PTH and serum calcium levels) that may be used to define the failure of vitamin D treatment.

Summary

Reports based on observational data have noted improved outcomes with active vitamin D treatment (calcitriol, paricalcitol, alfacalcidol, or doxercalciferol) in patients with CKD. Criteria for the identification of active vitamin D treatment failure are unclear from current guidelines, although up to 50% of patients may experience treatment failure eventually because of development of hypercalcemia or resistant SHPT, characterized by an elevated intact PTH (iPTH) level despite treatment. We propose a definition of vitamin D treatment failure as iPTH >600 pg/ml after 6 months of intravenous active vitamin D treatment and corrected total calcium serum levels >10.2 mg/dl, and review factors that may predict the response to vitamin D treatment. Key Message: Active vitamin D treatment failure is an important challenge in clinical practice. The aim of the proposed definition is to suggest a possible framework for hypothesis generation and to encourage further research into this common problem.

### Management of hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease: a new paradigm [^456058f9]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Bone and mineral metabolism becomes dysregulated with progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and increasing levels of parathyroid hormone serve as an adaptive response to maintain normal phosphorus and calcium levels. In end-stage renal disease, this response becomes maladaptive and high levels of phosphorus may occur. We summarize strategies to control hyperphosphatemia based on a systematic literature review of clinical trial and real-world observational data on phosphorus control in hemodialysis patients with CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). These studies suggest that current management options (diet and lifestyle changes; regular dialysis treatment; and use of phosphate binders, vitamin D, calcimimetics) have their own benefits and limitations with variable clinical outcomes. A more integrated approach to phosphorus control in dialysis patients may be necessary, incorporating measurement of multiple biomarkers of CKD-MBD pathophysiology (calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone) and correlation between diet adjustments and CKD-MBD drugs, which may facilitate improved patient management.

### The consequences of uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism and its treatment in chronic kidney disease [^d0d4b8f1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a frequent cause of clinically significant bone disease. Soft-tissue and vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) are additional serious consequences of the disorder that may contribute directly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Less widely appreciated manifestations include neurological disturbances, hematological abnormalities, and endocrine dysfunction. Secondary HPT arises from alterations in calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D metabolism that develop early in the course of CKD and become more pronounced as kidney function declines. Treatment is often delayed, however, until the disease is well established. Current therapeutic strategies rely largely on the use of vitamin D sterols to diminish excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) synthesis and to lower serum or plasma PTH levels, but their use is often confounded by increases in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations, changes that can aggravate soft-tissue and vascular calcification. As such, there is a need for new therapeutic interventions that can effectively lower serum or plasma PTH levels without producing untoward side effects. The current review summarizes the diverse manifestations of secondary HPT in patients with CKD. The consequences of inadequately controlled secondary HPT and the adverse effects of selected therapeutic interventions for the disorder on vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease in those with CKD are discussed.

### Vitamin D in chronic kidney disease: is there a role outside of PTH control? [^6ff7be84]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with kidney disease and many patients receive vitamin D supplementation. Several large, well-designed clinical trials have been published in the last few years evaluating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on important outcomes for patients with kidney disease including effects on cardiovascular disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and kidney disease progression.

Recent Findings

Several negative trials have been published showing no effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on cardiovascular events, kidney disease progression, and albuminuria. Long-term supplementation does not appear to be associated with kidney stone disease. Vitamin D supplementation decreases parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and high levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be required for maximal suppression.

Summary

There appear to be no effects of vitamin D supplementation on noncalcemic outcomes including progression of kidney disease, albuminuria, or cardiovascular disease. The primary reason to use vitamin D in kidney disease remains to lower PTH levels.

### Parathyroid hormone standardization program (...) [^d10c2329]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Parathyroid Hormone Standardization Program Measurement of parathyroid hormone along with the respective fragmented versions of this hormone in serum and/or plasma is necessary for the detection, diagnosis, and prevention of calcium/phosphate disorders. PTH is a widely accepted biomarker used to assess skeletal and mineral disorders associated with chronic kidney disease, referred to as CKD-bone mineral disorders. A recent update of the 2017 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Guideline for CKD-MBD management emphasized the role of PTH as one of the key biomarkers of this disorder. Reliable PTH measurement methods are essential for correct disease detection, prevention, and patient care. Clinical practice guidelines that recommend the use of PTH are limited because of considerable method-related variation in results. Research studies reported up to a 4. 2-fold difference in measurements depending on the method used.

This variation can lead to the misclassification of patients. In addition, it becomes difficult to compare PTH results from different studies and to develop common reference intervals and/or decision levels for treatment. CDC’s parathyroid hormone standardization program is improving the accuracy of PTH measurements performed in patient care and public health activities. Standardization of PTH will provide an opportunity for accurate diagnostic and improved pathophysiologic insight into CKD-MBD and hypo- and hyperparathyrioidism. As a first step towards standardization, CDC is developing a reference measurement procedure. To accomplish this, it is employing an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography—high resolution mass spectrometry -based reference method—for PTH and its respective fragments. Also, it is developing serum materials to help in assessing measurement accuracy and to improve the variability of measurement accuracy among laboratories.

### Serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and clinical outcomes in ESRD: a call for targeted clinical trials [^623354f4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism almost universally accompanies end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In some, but not all studies, elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations are associated with increased fracture rates, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in ESRD. The serum concentration of PTH required for optimal bone health and reduced cardiovascular risk in such patients remains elusive. Recent clinical trials have failed to show substantial changes in morbidity and mortality following reductions of elevated serum PTH concentrations. In this review, we will assess some of the difficulties in evaluating elevated serum PTH concentrations, and their association with skeletal fractures and mortality in ESRD patients. We are of the opinion that in the context of ESRD, elevated PTH concentrations occur in conjunction with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, hypertension, volume excess, preexisting heart disease, all of which have prevented establishing a precise association between elevated serum PTH concentrations and global or skeletal outcomes. Age, gender, and racial variability among groups make interpretation exceptionally difficult. Analysis of prevalent ESRD populations with secondary hyperparathyroidism should take all these factors into account. We suggest that future clinical trials which examine the usefulness of reductions in serum PTH concentrations be conducted in age, sex, and racially balanced groups, without or with minimal coexisting confounding disease. Furthermore, trials in such populations should have as their primary outcome a reduction in fractures rather than an alteration in mortality.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with mineral and bone disorders (MBDs) that occur early in CKD and worsen during disease progression. One of the hallmarks of CKD-MBD is secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). The pathogenesis of SHPT is complex and only partly understood. Several lines of evidence indicate that disturbed vitamin D metabolism and phosphate regulation, caused by increased serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), play an important role.CKD-MBD, and SHPT in particular, might lead to deleterious effects, since elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) is associated with worse outcomes, such as steeper kidney function decline, anaemia and hyporesponsiveness to erythropoietin, cardiovascular calcifications, bone fractures and increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, even before end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). PTH can thus be considered as a uraemic toxin.

During CKD, strategies to control SHPT range from the use of calcium supplements, intestinal phosphate binders, native vitamin D supplementation and the reduction of dietary phosphate intake. Other therapies utilized in CKD with progression of SHPT include active vitamin D analogues. Their efficacy in PTH control is counterbalanced by potential hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia, calling into question their risk–benefit profile in non-dialysis (ND)-CKD. Both active vitamin D analogues and calcimimetics are used in ESKD, and sometimes surgical parathyroidectomy (PTX) is also required to correct SHPT. However, all of these treatments have potential adverse effects and thus represent imperfect therapies. Furthermore, some component of the PTH increase during CKD is an adaptive mechanism that is necessary to maintain phosphate balance, overcome the skeletal resistance to PTH in order to maintain appropriate bone remodelling and avoid complications such as low bone turnover disease and adynamic bone. It has also been shown that low PTH levels (less than twice the upper limit of normal values) in patients with ESKD were associated with higher mortality risk. Consistently, during dialysis, current guidelines recommend maintaining PTH levels as much as 2- to 9-fold above the normal range in order to maintain this adaptive process.

KDIGO 2017 CKD-MBD update—parathyroid hormone (PTH) targets and interventions: In patients with CKD G5D, we suggest maintaining iPTH levels in the range of approximately 2 to 9 times the upper normal limit for the assay (2C), and we suggest that marked changes in PTH levels in either direction within this range prompt an initiation or change in therapy to avoid progression to levels outside of this range (2C). In patients with CKD G5D requiring PTH-lowering therapy, we suggest calcimimetics, calcitriol, or vitamin D analogs, or a combination of calcimimetics with calcitriol or vitamin D analogs (2B). In patients with CKD G3a–G5D with severe hyperparathyroidism who fail to respond to medical or pharmacological therapy, we suggest parathyroidectomy (2B).

### Association of nonoxidized parathyroid hormone with cardiovascular and kidney disease outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^0378aecc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

In patients with CKD, elevated plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are associated with greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the reference method for PTH measurement is disputed. It has been argued that measurement of nonoxidized PTH better reflects biologically active PTH than measurements with conventional assays.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

PTH and nonoxidized PTH levels were measured at study baseline in 535 patients with CKD with an eGFR range between 89 and 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . Patients were followed over 5.1 years for the occurrence of acute heart failure, atherosclerotic events, CKD progression (doubling of serum creatinine or initiation of RRT), or all-cause death.

Results

Atherosclerotic events, acute heart failure, CKD progression, and deaths from any cause occurred in 116, 58, 73, and 85 patients, respectively. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, patients at the highest PTH and nonoxidized-PTH tertile (79-543 and 12-172 pg/ml, respectively) showed a higher rate of atherosclerotic events, acute heart failure, CKD progression, and death from any cause. After adjustment for eGFR and albuminuria, nonoxidized PTH was no longer associated with atherosclerotic events (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 1.04 [95% confidence intervals, 0.62-1.75]), acute heart failure (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 1.24 [95% confidence intervals, 0.59-2.62]), CKD progression (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 0.93 [95% confidence intervals, 0.46-1.90]), and death from any cause (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 1.23 [95% confidence intervals, 0.66-2.31]), and PTH lost its association with atherosclerotic events (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 0.80 [95% confidence intervals, 0.46-1.38]) and CKD progression (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 0.99 [95% confidence intervals, 0.46-2.10]), although it remained associated with acute heart failure (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 2.76 [95% confidence intervals, 1.11-6.89]) and all-cause death (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 2.35 [95% confidence intervals, 1.13-4.89]). After further adjustment for cardiovascular and kidney risk factors, PTH remained associated with all-cause death (hazard ratio third versus first tertile, 2.79 [95% confidence intervals, 1.32-5.89]), but with no other end point.

Conclusions

In a cohort of patients with CKD, PTH was associated with all-cause mortality; there was no association of nonoxidized PTH with any of the clinical outcomes examined.

### Should phosphate management be limited to the KDIGO / KDOQI guidelines? [^ad7c6ca8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication of CKD. Prior to development of overt hyperphosphatemia, there are several adaptive mechanisms that occur to maintain normal phosphorus equilibrium in patients with CKD. These include an early and progressive rise in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23), followed by an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) with a decrease in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25 Vit D). Over the last 20 years, a large number of studies have shown that hyperphosphatemia is a strong predictor of adverse clinical outcomes including increased incidence of vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality in both individuals with CKD as well as those with normal kidney function. In addition, elevations of both FGF 23 and PTH are independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, phosphorus lowering therapies are a vital part of the treatment strategy for patients with CKD and include dietary phosphorus restriction, treatment with phosphate binders and removal with dialysis. However, there has been a lack of high quality evidence demonstrating beneficial effects of phosphate lowering therapy on clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we do not have definitive data as to whether effective phosphate control with phosphate binders will prevent elevations in FGF 23, and whether lowering FGF 23 levels will lead to improved patient outcomes. As a result of the presently available data (or lack thereof) clinical guidelines recommend treatment only after hyperphosphatemia develops and in dialysis patients; KDOQI recommends a treatment target of less than 5.5 mg/dL, whereas KDIGO recommends treating "towards normal." We are left with a clinical dilemma, being whether these recommendations are adequate, or should we be more aggressive in phosphate management. In this article, our goal is to discuss some of the studies concerning the adverse consequences of phosphate excess and as well as elevated FGF 23 levels, and present our opinion on what we believe the goal of treatment should be.

### Control of secondary hyperparathyroidism by vitamin D receptor agonists in chronic kidney disease [^04efab1e]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Effective treatment options for managing secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have advanced steadily since the early 1980s, from surgical removal of the parathyroid gland to pharmacologic intervention focused on reestablishing hormonal and mineral balances. In addition, earlier recognition of CKD via estimated GFR and educational efforts have led to advancements in diagnosis and treatment of elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D deficiency. Clinical studies support the efficacy and safety of vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists as effective treatments for SHPT. A number of considerations to ensure optimal SHPT control in CKD patients are apparent. VDR agonists effectively treat SHPT and vitamin D deficiency, but dosing needs to be optimized for each patient because the patient responds in an individualized manner to treatment to suppress and stabilize PTH levels. VDR agonist therapy should be continuous to ensure continued PTH suppression, coupled with strict monitoring of calcium and phosphorus to ensure compliance within target ranges. Awareness of the complex and beneficial effects of VDR agonists contributes to improved benefits in bone mineral disease and lower mortality risks.

### Parathyroid hormone oxidation in chronic kidney disease: clinical relevance? [^7b444f4b]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, parathyroid hormone (PTH), like all proteins, can undergo post-translational modifications, including oxidation. This can lead to structural and functional changes of the hormone. It has been hypothesized that currently used PTH measurement methods do not adequately reflect PTH-related bone and cardiovascular abnormalities in chronic kidney disease owing to the presence of oxidized, biologically inactive PTH in the circulation. Ursem et al. now report a strong correlation between serum non-oxidized and total PTH, and comparable associations with histomorphometric and circulating bone turnover markers, pleading against this hypothesis.

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 5, 6 to test the hypothesis that loop diuretic use associates with elevated PTH in adults with preserved renal function.

We studied participants from NHANES 2003 to 20045 and 2005 to 20066 because PTH measurements were available in these years. Participants were excluded for age younger than 18 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate lower than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2, or missing PTH value. “Loop users” had prescriptions for furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide. Our results demonstrate that loop use associates with higher PTH, even after adjustment for potential confounders. While previous studies have found similar associations in CKD, we demonstrate that this relationship extends to patients with preserved kidney function, having an impact on a considerably larger population. Clinicians often monitor for electrolyte changes after initiation of loop diuretics but may not measure PTH level. Many loop users are elderly or have CHF, both of which contribute to bone loss.

Use of a different diuretic class, repletion of vitamin D, or increased dietary calcium intake may combat a rise in PTH and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Earlier onset and greater severity of disordered mineral metabolism in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease [^3060f4a9]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

An estimated 25.8 million people in the U.S. suffer from diabetes, a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although improved understanding of diabetes-related complications has led to advances in clinical management of affected individuals, recent studies show that even with delivery of optimal care, high risks of CVD and CKD persist. Moreover, compared with patients without diabetes, those with diabetes experience faster progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and higher rates of CVD events and mortality. Thus, identifying novel pathophysiologic mechanisms that may contribute to these differences and can be targeted for intervention is a critical priority for diabetes and CKD management.

Chronic Kidney Disease–Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) refers to the clinical syndrome of laboratory abnormalities, bone disease, and extraskeletal calcification, including the arterial system. Among the earliest manifestations of CKD-MBD are vitamin D deficiency, disordered calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and secondary elevations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Mounting experimental and epidemiologic data support these alterations in mineral metabolism as novel risk factors for ESRD, CVD, and mortality. The evidence is especially strong for elevated serum phosphate and FGF23, which independently predict risks of CKD progression, CVD, and mortality. Differences in mineral metabolism according to diabetes status have been described in patients with ESRD, but a detailed characterization of the syndrome according to diabetes status is lacking in earlier stages of CKD. We measured mineral metabolites in baseline samples from 3,756 participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, a racially and ethnically diverse prospective CKD cohort with a high prevalence of diabetes. We hypothesized that individuals with diabetes would have more severe abnormalities of mineral metabolism at comparable levels of renal dysfunction than patients without diabetes (lower serum calcium, higher serum phosphate, PTH, and FGF23 levels).

### Parathyroid disorders-AAFP (...) [^00d0db16]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Parathyroid glands regulate serum calcium in response to abnormal levels. When the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor on parathyroid cells detects low serum calcium levels, one or more of the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, an 84–amino acid peptide. 1 PTH stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone and mobilize calcium into the blood, reduces renal calcium clearance, and stimulates intestinal calcium absorption through synthesis of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. 1, 2, 4–6 Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a paraneoplastic syndrome mediated by PTH-related peptide, should be considered in patients with low PTH levels, rapid onset of symptoms, and other signs and symptoms of malignancy. It is most often associated with squamous cell carcinoma and solid tumors of the lung, breast, esophagus, skin, cervix, and kidney. 4 Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of hypocalcemia.

Hyperparathyroidism PRIMARY Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common condition and the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism and mild hypercalcemia. 1, 13 In primary hyperparathyroidism, calcium levels are usually elevated without appropriate suppression of PTH levels, which can be normal or high. 13 However, in normocalcemic cases, calcium levels can be normal with elevated PTH levels, which may be encountered incidentally when screening for bone and renal disorders. In nations with readily accessible laboratory services, primary hyperparathyroidism is most often identified in asymptomatic individuals as an incidental finding of hypercalcemia on routine laboratory testing. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder that presents with abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood, low urinary calcium excretion, and normal or slightly elevated PTH levels.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia generally does not require treatment, including surgery. Indications for parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism include the presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1. 73 m.

### The case for routine parathyroid hormone monitoring [^8dfe2c99]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a uremic toxin with multiple systemic effects including bone disorders (renal osteodystrophy), myopathy, neurologic abnormalities, anemia, pruritus, and cardiomyopathy. Hyperparathyroidism is common in CKD and results in significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Clinical practice guidelines from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes initiative broadened the optimal PTH range to >2 and <9 times the upper limit of normal for the assay measured. Furthermore, the guidelines recommend following trends in PTH to determine the appropriate therapy. These guidelines overcome issues with the assay variability and help clinicians make judgments when treating individual patients. They also require frequent measurement in order to determine trends and implement appropriate treatments.

### Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in stages 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease [^98636976]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review approved treatment options for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with stages 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

Recently published data on the diagnosis and treatment of SHPT in patients with CKD were critically assessed.

Results

Early detection of SHPT is critical for effective treatment. Approximately 40% of patients with stage 3 CKD and 80% of patients with stage 4 have SHPT due to low serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Appropriate treatment involves suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to normal levels with active vitamin D therapy and phosphate binders. Ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol should be used to correct 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels either before or during active vitamin D therapy. Active vitamin D analogues include calcitriol, doxercalciferol, and paricalcitol. Calcitriol is effective, but has a narrow therapeutic window at higher doses because of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, which require frequent monitoring. Doxercalciferol is also effective, but has been associated with significant elevations in serum phosphorus requiring greater use of oral phosphate binders. Paricalcitol effectively suppresses PTH with minimal impact on serum calcium and phosphorus. Limited data exist on the use of cinacalcet in treating SHPT in stages 3 and 4 CKD, and it is only approved for use in patients receiving dialysis.

Conclusion

SHPT is an early and major complication of CKD. Treatment involves suppression of PTH to prevent metabolic bone disease, bone loss, and metabolic complications that may result in marked morbidity and mortality. Early detection of elevated PTH levels with appropriate intervention using active vitamin D therapy, even in the absence of elevated serum phosphorus and reduced serum calcium, is critical.

### Secondary hyperparathyroidism: review of the disease and its treatment [^72107447]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 develop secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). SHPT is an adaptive response to CKD and its associated disruptions in the homeostatic control of serum phosphorus, calcium, and vitamin D. The poor control of mineral and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels characteristic of SHPT is associated with serious clinical consequences.

Objective

This review discusses the pathophysiology and consequences of SHPT, as well as the efficacy and limitations of current treatment modalities.

Methods

Literature searches were conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS databases. Additional information was obtained from Internet web sites, textbooks, and nephrology congress abstracts.

Results

Patients with uncontrolled SHPT are at higher risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, hospitalization, bone disease, vascular and soft-tissue calcification, and vascular access failure than patients whose mineral and PTH levels are well managed. New National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) targets for calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, and PTH control have recently been published with the aim of improving the management of mineral metabolism in CKD patients. Data from observational studies suggest that the majority of patients currently have PTH and mineral levels outside these target ranges.

Conclusions

Given the inadequacies of current therapies, novel agents are being developed that may help improve the management of SHPT.

### Elevated parathyroid hormone one year after kidney transplantation is an independent risk factor for graft loss even without hypercalcemia [^322edfd6]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increases the risk of mortality and various other complications. Although successful kidney transplantation (KTx) can alleviate secondary hyperparathyroidism to some extent, hyperparathyroidism often persists and adversely affects clinical outcomes despite improved kidney function. Elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels promote bone resorption, calcium (Ca) reabsorption from the tubular tubes, and Ca absorption from the intestinal tract by increasing the production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, often causing hypercalcemia. Concerning the management of hyperparathyroidism after KTx, persistent hypercalcemia has been internationally recognized as the most common therapeutic indication, as hypercalcemia has been associated with poor outcomes. Egbuna et al. indicated in a retrospective study of 422 kidney transplant patients that hypercalcemia adversely affected mortality and graft prognosis. Moore et al. also demonstrated the mortality risk of hypercalcemia in their study of 303 kidney transplant patients. However, a high level of PTH alone is not generally a factor in making therapeutic decisions because it is not known whether high PTH levels without hypercalcemia may adversely affect kidney-graft function after KTx. Therefore, this retrospective cohort study of 892 kidney transplant patients aimed to identify the impact of elevated PTH levels without hypercalcemia on kidney-graft outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports focusing on the clinical implications of high PTH levels without hypercalcemia after KTx.

### The CKD-MBD syndrome: hysteresis in PTH involvement and PTH administration for its management [^65ef574b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disturbs mineral homeostasis, leading to mineral and bone disorders (MBD). CKD-MBD is a significant problem and currently available treatment options have important limitations. Phosphate retention is thought to be the initial cause of CKD-MBD but serum phosphate remains normal until the late stages of CKD, due to elevated levels of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Reduction of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D (1,25[OH] 2 D) concentration is the next event in the adaptive response of the homeostatic system. We argue, and provide the rationale, that calcium retention which takes place concurrently with phosphate retention, could be the reason behind the hysteresis in the response of PTH. If indeed this is the case, intermittent administration of PTH in early CKD could prevent the hysteresis, which arguably leads to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and provide the platform for an effective management of CKD-MBD. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

### Parathyroid hormone standardization (...) [^18b6fda4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Measurement of parathyroid hormone along with the respective fragmented versions of this hormone in serum and/or plasma is necessary for the detection, diagnosis, and prevention of calcium/phosphate disorders. This page provides information on how laboratories can do this. Overview PTH is a widely accepted biomarker used to assess skeletal and mineral disorders connected to chronic kidney disease, referred to as CKD-bone mineral disorders. A recent update of the 2017 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Guideline for CKD-MBD management emphasized the role of PTH as one of the key biomarkers of this disorder. Reliable measurements essential Reliable PTH measurement methods are essential for correct disease detection, prevention, and patient care. Clinical practice guidelines that recommend the use of PTH are limited because of method-related variation in results. Research studies reported up to a 4.

2-fold difference in measurements, depending on the method used. This variation can cause patients' health issues to be misclassified. In addition, the variation makes it difficult to compare PTH results from different studies and develop common reference intervals and/or decision levels for treatment. Improved accuracy CDC's parathyroid hormone standardization program improves the accuracy of PTH measurements taken in patient care and public health. Standardization of PTH can provide an opportunity for accurate diagnostic and improved pathophysiologic insight into CKD-MBD and hypo- and hyperparathyrioidism. To help with standardization, CDC is developing a reference measurement procedure that employs an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography—high resolution mass spectrometry -based reference method—for PTH and its respective fragments. CDC also is developing serum materials to help assess measurement accuracy and improve variability among laboratories.

CKD-MBD treatment—abnormal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels: In patients with CKD G3a–G5 not on dialysis, the optimal PTH level is not known. However, we suggest that patients with levels of intact PTH progressively rising or persistently above the upper normal limit for the assay be evaluated for modifiable factors, including hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, high phosphate intake, and vitamin D deficiency (2C). In adult patients with CKD G3a–G5 not on dialysis, we suggest that calcitriol and vitamin D analogs not be routinely used (2C). It is reasonable to reserve the use of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs for patients with CKD G4–G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (Not Graded). In children, calcitriol and vitamin D analogs may be considered to maintain serum calcium levels in the age-appropriate normal range (Not Graded).

### Relationship between parathyroid mass and parathyroid hormone level in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^8ca25c0b]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a growing health care concern associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism, mineral abnormalities, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As one of the most common abnormalities of CKD-MBD, secondary hyperparathyroidism leads to nodular transformation of the parathyroids in up to 75 % of cases. Can the increased glandular mass be reduced? Such a reduction would call for massive apoptosis to take place in the parathyroids. However, there are no known stimuli for apoptosis in the parathyroid cells. Thus, poor efficacy of pharmaceutical drug in progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) argues in favour of parathyroidectomy. The problem is particularly severe in China. That’s because vitamin D analogs and calcimimetics were unavailable in mainland China during the study period. The most common drugs currently used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in China were calcium-based phosphorus binders and non-selective VDR activator medications which may cause recurrent hypercalcemia and hyperphosphataemia.

### FGF23-parathyroid interaction: implications in chronic kidney disease [^84811cd7]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past few years there have been considerable advances in our understanding of the physiological regulation of mineral homeostasis. One of the most important breakthroughs is the identification of fibroblastic growth factor 23 (FGF23) and its role as a key regulator of phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D metabolism. FGF23 exerts its biological functions by binding to its cognate receptor in the presence of Klotho as a cofactor. FGF23 principally acts on the kidney to induce urinary phosphate excretion and suppresses 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis, thereby indirectly modulating parathyroid hormone secretion. FGF23 also acts directly on the parathyroid to decrease parathyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. In patients with chronic kidney disease, FGF23 levels increase progressively to compensate for phosphate retention, but these elevated FGF23 levels fail to suppress the secretion of parathyroid hormone, particularly in the setting of uremia. Recent data suggest that this parathyroid resistance to FGF23 may be caused by decreased expression of Klotho-FGFR1 complex in hyperplastic parathyroid glands. This review summarizes recent insights into the role of FGF23 in mineral homeostasis and discusses the involvement of its direct and indirect interaction with the parathyroid gland, particularly focusing on the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease.

### Parathyroid hormone, a uremic toxin [^98b0f8a5]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the innovations in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, there are uremic patients with marked elevation in PTH levels. Uremic toxicity is in part attributable to the excess of circulating PTH. It has been known for many years that PTH may induce changes in cell calcium, a key intracellular signal required for normal cell function. The effect of PTH in dialysis patients is not limited to bone; the diversity of biologic effects of PTH is summarized in this review. In addition, the present review addresses other issues: (i) the presence of different circulating PTH fragments in uremic patients, (ii) the PTH assays currently utilized to measure circulating PTH, and (iii) the fact that some of the PTH effects seen in uremic patients may be due to the interaction of C-terminal PTH fragment with putative C-terminal PTH receptors.

### Analysis of the kinetics of the parathyroid hormone, and of associated patient outcomes, in a cohort of haemodialysis patients [^4a6cb164]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common comorbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, particularly in those on hemodialysis (HD). Due to an unpredictable bone resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) action, maintaining a mild biological SHPT is recommended in most HD patients to favor a normal bone turnover rate. According to the most recent international Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines, experts recommend target serum PTH levels of 2 to 9 times the upper normal limit of the assay in HD patients. Identification of bone turnover rate from serum PTH levels, however, is not straightforward. Bone histology studies have shown that SHPT can be excluded by lower serum PTH levels and adynamic bone disease (ABD) by higher serum PTH levels. Between these two limits exists a ‘grey zone’ in which normal bone, ABD and SHPT can all be observed. Therefore, the assessment of serum bone markers and even bone biopsies, at times, are necessary to better assess the rate of bone turnover in HD patients.

Besides, the KDIGO experts suggest that “marked changes in PTH levels in either direction within the target range prompt an initiation or change in therapy to avoid progression to levels outside of this range (2C)”.

The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) provided evidence of an increase in mean serum PTH level being an important health issue in HD patients.

Beyond having consequences on the rate of bone turnover, elevated PTH is also a well-known uremic toxin which has been associated with cardiovascular calcification and mortality. However, it is important to note that both low and high serum PTH levels have been associated with poor health outcomes in HD patients. While low PTH levels commonly result from surgical parathyroidectomy (PTX) and the prescription of calcimimetics, various other causes can result in low PTH levels, including an excessive calcium and vitamin D load and hypercalcemia, as well as the malnutrition-inflammation syndrome and prolonged immobilization.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^a60f70ac]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease and bone

SHPT is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD, along with cardiovascular and mineral metabolism complications. Pre-pro-PTH (115 amino acids long) is the main PTH translational product, which is further enzymatically cleaved to the 84 amino acid long intact PTH (iPTH) and it is then released into the bloodstream and goes through a number of proteolytic changes. The concentration of iPTH, which represents the hormone's physiologically active component, is less impacted by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than its breakdown products. Serum iPTH is a valid marker for evaluating SHPT in CKD patients. The compensatory elevation of PTH is multifactorial: as GFR declines, circulating calcitriol decreases, both because of renal mass decrease and to inhibition of 1a-hydroxylase by hyperphosphatemia, thus promoting hyperuricemia and metabolic acidosis; PTH1R and a-Klotho receptor (a co-receptor of fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF23]) expression is decreased in the kidney; phosphate renal excretion is diminished and hypocalcemia is developed with further reduction of GFR; thus, PTH synthesis and secretion is stimulated; resistance to the phosphaturic hormone FGF23 may further increase hyperphosphatemia; iPTH half-life increases and C-terminal fragments of the hormone tend to accumulate; resistance to the circulating calcium and calcitriol at the level of parathyroid glands develops because of hyperuricemia, and may contribute to further PTH increase; multiple signaling pathways lead to parathyroid cell proliferation. At early stages of CKD, the action of PTH on both bone and kidney seems to be impaired, resulting in PTH hyporesponsiveness and higher concentrations of serum PTH to balance calcium homeostasis. This phenomenon is attributed to multiple factors, including decreased calcitriol levels, phosphate retention, downregulation of PTH1R, and uremic toxins.

### The effect of intradialytic exercise on calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone: a randomized controlled trial [^222f9b33]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Reviewing the limited available research on the effects of exercise in reducing phosphorus levels showed that although exercise often decreases the level of phosphorus, longer-term exercise and perhaps more intense exercise might be required to see reductions in some studies.

This study revealed that serum calcium levels showed significant change in the intervention group, but some other researchers failed to show any influence of exercise on serum calcium. Perhaps studies with longer time frame and differences in type and frequency of exercise are needed.

Renal hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease characterized by elevated PTH levels secondary to derangements in the homeostasis of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D.

Abnormalities in calcium, phosphorous, and PTH, hallmarks of the condition known as chronic kidney disease – mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), are associated with adverse outcomes in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease results in derangements of circulating markers of mineral metabolism and in dysregulation of skeletal and cardiovascular physiology. Epidemiologic studies of dialysis patients provide substantial evidence that elevated PTH is associated with mortality. However, therapies targeting abnormal CKD-MBD parameters, while improving biochemical end points, have failed to convincingly demonstrate reductions in “hard” end points such as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in clinical trials. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend that screening and management of hyperparathyroidism be initiated for all patients with chronic kidney disease.

Cardoso et al. in their systemic review found evidence supporting a positive relation between physical activity and bone outcomes in patients with CKD. Studies show that exercise acts as a regulator of homeostasis, alters the levels of circulatory mediators and hormones, and increases the demand for skeletal muscle and other vital organs for energy substrates. Exercise also activates bone and mineral metabolism, especially calcium and phosphate, both of which are essential for muscle contraction, neuromuscular signaling, adenosine triphosphate biosynthesis, and other energy substrates. Due to the fact that PTH is involved in the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, chronic exercise may help in limiting PTH secretion in exercise activity by changing the level of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream. On the other hand, the secretion of PTH changes in response to exercise and the resulting myokines, which indicates the systemic effects of physical activity on the secretion of hormones.

### Calcimimetics or vitamin D analogs for suppressing parathyroid hormone in end-stage renal disease: time for a paradigm shift? [^9bb0527e]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Considerable advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). These include the discovery that the calcium-sensing receptor has an important role in the regulation of parathyroid gland function, the development of calcimimetics to target this receptor, the recognition that vitamin D receptor activation has important functions beyond the regulation of mineral metabolism, the identification of the phosphaturic factor fibroblast growth factor 23 and the contribution of this hormone to disordered phosphate and vitamin D metabolism in CKD. However, despite the availability of calcimimetics, phosphate binders, and vitamin D analogs, control of SHPT remains suboptimal in many patients with advanced kidney disease. In this Review, we explore several unresolved issues regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of SHPT. Specifically, we examine the significance of elevated circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 levels in CKD, question the proposition that calcitriol deficiency is truly a pathological state, explore the relative importance of the vitamin D receptor and the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid gland function and evaluate the evidence to support the treatment of SHPT with calcimimetics and vitamin D analogs. Finally, we propose a novel treatment framework in which calcimimetics are the primary therapy for suppressing parathyroid hormone production in patients with end-stage renal disease.

### Persistent hyperparathyroidism in long-term kidney transplantation: time to consider a less aggressive approach [^634a9605]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Persistent hyperparathyroidism affects 50% of long-term kidney transplants with preserved allograft function. Timing, options and the optimal target for treatment remain unclear. Clinical practice guidelines recommend the same therapeutic approach as patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Mild to moderate elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in long-term kidney transplants may not be associated with bone loss and fracture. Recent findings on bone biopsy revealed the lack of association between hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism with pathology of high bone turnover. Elevated PTH levels may be required to maintain normal bone volume. Nevertheless, several large observational studies have revealed the association between hypercalcemia and the elevation of PTH levels with unfavourable allograft and patient outcomes. Both calcimimetics and parathyroidectomy are effective in lowering serum calcium and PTH. A recent meta-analysis suggested parathyroidectomy may be performed safely after kidney transplantation without deterioration of allograft function.

Summary

Treatment of persistent hyperparathyroidism is warranted in kidney transplants with hypercalcemia and markedly elevated PTH levels. A less aggressive approach should be applied to those with mild to moderate elevation. Whether treatments improve outcomes remain to be elucidated.

### Phosphate and bone fracture risk in chronic kidney disease patients [^accdaed0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), phosphate homoeostasis plays a central role in the development of mineral and bone disorder (MBD) together with decreased serum calcium and elevated serum parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 and sclerostin levels. Today there are only a few data exploring the direct role of abnormal phosphate homoeostasis and hyperphosphataemia in the development of CKD-MBD. On the other hand, several studies have looked at the link between hyperphosphataemia and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD, but there is a lack of evidence to indicate that lowering phosphate levels improves cardiovascular outcomes in this population. Furthermore, the impact of liberalizing phosphate targets on CKD-MBD progression and bone fracture is currently not known. In this review we discuss the central role of phosphate in the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD and how it may be associated with fracture risk, both in hyper- and hypophosphataemia.

### Difficulties in achieving the K / DOQI practice guidelines for bone and mineral metabolism [^19b51cc7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism and alterations in bone and mineral metabolism are known to occur early in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The etiology of these abnormalities is multifactorial. Phosphate retention and alterations in vitamin D metabolism play important roles. The recent practice guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) have emphasized the need to approach these problems early in the course of CKD by measuring the levels of parathyroid hormone when glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) fall to less than 60 ml/min. If hyperparathyroidism is detected, then treatment must be undertaken to try to prevent its progression. Strict guidelines have been proposed for the management of these alterations in bone and mineral metabolism when kidney disease progresses to CKD stage V. Although the initial recommendations were often opinion based, evidence is accumulating to support these views. However, with our current therapeutic armamentarium, there is considerable difficulty in achieving these practice guidelines for calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, and parathyroid hormone on a sustained basis. New therapeutic agents are becoming available that will help with phosphorus control and control of hyperparathyroidism, and minimize the calcium load. Additional beneficial effects of vitamin D analogs are being uncovered and are being intensively investigated. It is hoped that with attention to these practice guidelines, control of the abnormalities of mineral metabolism will be improved and will lead to improved patient outcomes.

### Mineral metabolism and outcomes in chronic kidney disease stage 2-4 patients [^3a441b2d]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Marked hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency are associated with mortality in dialysis patients. Such data in chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 population are limited. It has been suggested that high-normal serum phosphate predicts worse renal and patient outcomes. The data regarding parathyroid hormone and outcomes in this population is limited. The present study examined mineral metabolism and its association with the development of end-stage renal disease and mortality in stage 2–4 chronic kidney disease patients.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study that included 466 non-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 patients. Mineral parameters were obtained at the time of enrollment and the patients were followed prospectively for 25 (1–44) months or until they reached the endpoints of end-stage renal disease or mortality.

Results

Hyperparathyroidism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency began to occur in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, whereas significant hyperphosphatemia only developed in the later stages. High-normal and mildly elevated serum phosphate (>4.2 mg/dL) predicted the composite outcome of end-stage renal disease or mortality after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors, chronic kidney disease stage and other mineral parameters. Parathyroid hormone levels above the upper limit of normal (>65 pg/mL) predicted the future development of end-stage renal disease and the composite outcome of end-stage renal disease or mortality after adjustments. 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (<15 ng/mL) was also associated with worse outcomes.

Conclusions

In chronic kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism developed prior to significant hyperphosphatemia confirming the presence phosphate retention early in the course of chronic kidney disease. High-normal serum phosphate and mildly elevated parathyroid hormone levels predicted worse renal and patient outcomes. This data emphasizes the need for early intervention in the care of chronic kidney disease stage 2–4 patients.

### Impact of physical activity and exercise on bone health in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review of observational and experimental studies [^fc0adb39]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health problem with an estimated global prevalence of 11–13%. This prevalence is rising, driven by an aging population and the increasing incidence of obesity, hypertension and diabetes. In addition, most patients have an increased risk of comorbidities and all-cause cardiovascular premature death. As a result, CKD represents an enormous economic burden for healthcare systems worldwide with drastic personal health consequences. Patients suffering from CKD frequently develop mineral and bone disorders (MBD) due to systemic alterations induced by the disease. This syndrome has been associated with the spectrum of renal osteodystrophy, vascular calcifications, abnormalities in bone mineralisation and turnover, increased bone fractures, as well as increased morbidity and mortality, resulting in a diminished quality of life. Thus, CKD-MBD encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical disorders such as alterations in mineral and bone metabolism, which are in turn associated with abnormalities in calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphate or vitamin D metabolism. For instance, reduced levels of vitamin D and osteocalcin (OC) carboxylation, and elevated serum PTH and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are key risk factors for bone disease. PTH and FGF-23 are the main regulating hormones of bone integrity and mineral homeostasis.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^21af0bfd]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Dietary changes ameliorate mineral bone disorders of CKD

Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a systemic dysfunction of mineral and bone metabolism in patients with CKD. It results from abnormalities in calcium, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone and/or vitamin D metabolism as well as abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth or strength, in addition to vascular or other soft tissue calcification. Phosphate retention plays a crucial role in the development of CKD-MBD and it also increases the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with CKD. In the early stages of CKD serum phosphate levels are maintained in the normal range through phosphaturia induced by increase in parathyroid hormone actions and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) production. However, as kidney disease progresses the compensatory rise in FGF-23 levels fails to sustain phosphate clearance sufficiently and hyperphosphatemia ensues. Notably, increased FGF-23 levels by itself has been associated with increases in both cardiovascular events and mortality, suggesting that control of phosphate homeostasis early in CKD may help reducing the clinical consequences of mineral and bone disorders. Strategies to manage elevated serum phosphorus levels include reduction of dietary phosphate intake, as well as the use of phosphate binding agents. Clinical studies have assessed the effects of dietary phosphate and protein restriction in CKD patients. For example, patients with advanced CKD (stages 4 and 5) who had a reduction in dietary phosphates and protein intake also had improved short-term control of secondary hyperparathyroidism. In the long term, altering the diet allowed some patients to achieve a normal rate of bone formation. Recent evidence suggests that in addition to the absolute amount of phosphate in the diet, its source (i.e. plant versus animal food) should be considered. Indeed, dietary phosphates from plant-derived proteins are mostly in the form of phytates, which are less digestible in humans. Consequently, phosphates are ultimately less bioavailable compared to phosphates derived from animal sources. Moe et al. addressed this issue in nine patients who had established CKD (mean eGFR 32 mL/min/1.73 m 2) by comparing their responses to vegetarian- or meat-based diets with equivalent contents of protein and phosphates. After one week of the dietary intervention in their crossover study, the vegetarian diet led to lower serum levels of phosphorus and FGF-23 than the meat-based diet. Moreover, 13 patients with stages 3–5 CKD converted their food choices from an animal protein-based diet to a 70 % plant-protein diet for four weeks. The result was a significant reduction of urinary phosphorous excretion even though there were no significant changes in serum phosphorous or FGF-23 levels. The urinary sodium and titratable acid contents significantly decreased with the change to plant-based foods. Overall, the combination of phosphate-restricted diets plus oral phosphate binders has become a well established approach to controlling serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD stages 3–5 (including CKD stage 5D). For example, a randomized controlled trial showed that dual intervention with a low-phosphorous diet and the addition of phosphate binders was more effective than either approach alone in reducing serum FGF-23 concentrations in 39 patients with CKD stages 3–4 and normal serum phosphate levels. Taken together, the results we have discussed suggest that restriction of dietary phosphate intake may improve the control of mineral and bone metabolism in CKD patients. Nevertheless, the prescription of low phosphate diets can be challenging in that the bioavailability of phosphates in foods (see above) needs to be considered.

### Defective renal maintenance of the vitamin D endocrine system impairs vitamin D renoprotection: a downward spiral in kidney disease [^3731a974]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

In kidney disease, the progressive loss of renal capacity to produce calcitriol, the vitamin D hormone, is a key contributor to elevations in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mineral and skeletal disorders predisposing to renal and cardiovascular damage, ectopic calcifications, and high mortality rates. Thus, the safe correction of calcitriol deficiency to suppress PTH has been the treatment of choice for decades. However, recent epidemiological and experimental data suggest that calcitriol replacement may improve outcomes through renal and cardioprotective actions unrelated to PTH suppression. Furthermore, a striking incidence of vitamin D deficiency occurs in kidney disease and associates more strongly than calcitriol deficiency with a higher risk for kidney disease progression and death. Despite the translational relevance of these findings, no prospective trials are currently available in support of the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation and/or calcitriol replacement to safely halt/moderate renal disease progression. This review updates the pathophysiology behind the vicious cycle by which kidney injury impairs the maintenance of normal vitamin D and calcitriol levels, which in turn impedes vitamin D/calcitriol renoprotective actions, a requirement for the design of prospective trials to improve current recommendations for vitamin D interventions at all stages of kidney disease.

### Calcimimetics: a remedy for all problems of excess parathyroid hormone activity in chronic kidney disease? [^e59162de]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that is now available for use clinically to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism among patients undergoing dialysis regularly. It acts as an allosteric activator of the calcium-sensing receptor, the molecular mechanism that controls parathyroid hormone secretion. This mechanism of action differs fundamentally from that of the vitamin D sterols, which heretofore have been the only definitive pharmacological intervention for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Recent Findings

The ability of calcimimetic agents to enhance signaling through the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid cells affects several important components of parathyroid gland function. Results from several large clinical trials demonstrate that cinacalcet effectively lowers plasma parathyroid hormone levels in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism when used either alone or together with vitamin D. Unlike the vitamin D sterols, which generally raise serum calcium and phosphorus levels, treatment with cinacalcet is associated with modest reductions in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations. The impact of these biochemical changes on renal bone disease and on soft-tissue and vascular calcification during long-term treatment has yet to be characterized fully. Cinacalcet also diminishes parathyroid hormone gene expression, and studies in experimental animals indicate that its use retards the progression of parathyroid gland hyperplasia and increases bone mass. If confirmed in future clinical trials in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, these features represent potentially important ancillary therapeutic benefits.

Summary

Calcimimetic agents have diverse effects on parathyroid gland function that may enhance the overall medical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing dialysis regularly.

CKD–MBD, non–dialysis-dependent CKD (adult and pediatric)—use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs: In adult patients with CKD G3a-G5 not on dialysis, we suggest that calcitriol and vitamin D analogs not be routinely used (2C), and it is reasonable to reserve the use of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs for patients with CKD G4-G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (Not Graded). In children, calcitriol and vitamin D analogs may be considered. The KDOQI work group agrees that low doses of calcitriol or active vitamin D analogues could be initiated in patients with elevated and increasing PTH levels with close monitoring, and expresses concern that less aggressive attention to PTH levels may lead to increased rates of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and need for parathyroidectomy or more use of expensive medications later in CKD.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1531f439]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is due to increased activity of the parathyroid glands, either from an intrinsic abnormal change altering excretion of parathyroid hormone (primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism) or from an extrinsic abnormal change affecting calcium homoeostasis stimulating production of parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disorder, with the highest incidence in postmenopausal women. Asymptomatic disease is common, and severe disease with renal stones and metabolic bone disease arises less frequently now than it did 20-30 years ago. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by surgical removal of an adenoma, increasingly by minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Medical management of mild disease is possible with bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy, and calcimimetics. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in elderly people. However, the biochemical definition of vitamin D deficiency and its treatment are subject to much debate. Secondary hyperparathyroidism as the result of chronic kidney disease is important in the genesis of renal bone disease, and several new treatments could help achieve the guidelines set out by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative.

### Fibroblast growth factor 23, klotho, and disordered mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease: unraveling the intricate tapestry of events and implications for therapy [^72ca56a5]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and Klotho play key roles, along with serum phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH), in disordered mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Through independent and combined effects on renal phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism, alterations in FGF23 and Klotho expression are essential for maintaining mineral homeostasis in kidney disease. However, increasing evidence showing that disturbances in FGF23 and Klotho expression produce direct cardiovascular and renal toxicity has accelerated interest in therapies that directly target these hormones in the interest of improving outcomes in CKD. Importantly, recent studies showing that reversing CKD-induced elevations in FGF23 levels may have adverse cardiovascular effects have shed new light on the potential unintended consequences linked to developing therapeutic targets in this arena. These findings ultimately support the notion that addressing root causes of disturbances of FGF23 and Klotho, such as phosphorus excess, should remain the main focus in managing mineral metabolism in CKD.

### Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in non-dialysis CKD: an appraisal 2022s [^aac955f4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The situation of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis (ND-CKD) is probably best characterised by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder Update 2017 guideline 4.2.1 stating that the optimal parathyroid hormone levels are not known in these stages. Furthermore, new caution became recommended with regard to the routine use of active vitamin D analogues in early CKD stages and moderate SHPT phenotypes, due to their potential risks for hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia aggravation. Nevertheless, there is still a substantial clinical need to prevent the development of parathyroid gland autonomy, with its associated consequences of bone and vascular damage, including fracture risks and cardiovascular events. Therefore we now attempt to review the current guideline-based and clinical practice management of SHPT in ND-CKD, including their strengths and weaknesses, favouring individualised approaches respecting calcium and phosphate homeostasis. We further comment on extended-release calcifediol (ERC) as a new differential therapeutic option now also available in Europe and on a potentially novel understanding of a required vitamin D saturation in more advanced CKD stages. There is no doubt, however, that knowledge gaps will remain unless powerful randomised controlled trials with hard and meaningful endpoints are performed.

### High-dose cholecalciferol reduces parathyroid hormone in patients with early chronic kidney disease: a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^194fddb1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which occurs early in chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objectives

We aimed to determine whether high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation for 1 y in early CKD is sufficient to maintain optimal vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration ≥30 ng/mL) and decrease serum parathyroid hormone (PTH). A secondary aim was to determine the effect of cholecalciferol on blood pressure and serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23).

Design

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-six subjects with early CKD (stages 2-3) were supplemented with oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D group; 50,000 IU/wk for 12 wk followed by 50,000 IU every other week for 40 wk) or a matching placebo for 1 y.

Results

By 12 wk, serum 25(OH)D increased in the vitamin D group only [baseline (mean ± SD): 26.7 ± 6.8 to 42.8 ± 16.9 ng/mL; P < 0.05] and remained elevated at 1 y (group-by-time interaction: P < 0.001). PTH decreased from baseline only in the vitamin D group (baseline: 89.1 ± 49.3 to 70.1 ± 24.8 pg/mL; P = 0.01) at 12 wk, but values were not significantly different from baseline at 1 y (75.4 ± 29.5 pg/mL; P = 0.16; group-by-time interaction: P = 0.09). Group differences were more pronounced in participants with secondary hyperparathyroidism (group-by-time interaction: P = 0.004). Blood pressure and FGF23 did not change in either group.

Conclusions

After 1 y, this oral cholecalciferol regimen was safe and sufficient to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations and prevent vitamin D insufficiency in early CKD. Furthermore, serum PTH improved after cholecalciferol treatment, particularly in patients who had secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Practice variation in the treatment of patients with renal hyperparathyroidism: a survey-based study in the Netherlands [^135903d9]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the most common and early metabolic disorders in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is renal hyperparathyroidism (RHPT). RHPT can be divided into secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THPT). The former is usually diagnosed at first in patients with CKD and is characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels as a result of the derangements in the homeostasis of phosphate, vitamin D, and, in later stages, also calcium. Approximately 30–50% of end-stage kidney disease patients have SHPT. During the course of chronic renal failure, SHPT can develop into THPT in which, presumably because of prolonged stimulation, the parathyroid gland proliferates, autonomously secretes PTH regardless of feedback and thereby leading to hypercalcemia. RHPT pathophysiology is complex as many pathogenetic peculiarities are not defined nor understood. This emerges from the dilemma wherein RHPT-patients refractory to conservative therapy, meaning active vitamin D metabolites, require high doses of activated vitamin D despite the potential to cause hypercalcemia in SHP. Methods within the treatment arsenal of a physician in disrupting this vicious cycle are either parathyroidectomy (PTx) or calcimimetics. Calcimimetics are considered an acceptable bridge to renal transplantation or treatment in non-operable patients because it is effective even in patients with marked parathyroid hyperplasia. Besides decreasing PTH and calcium levels, cinacalcet has also been shown to be effective in improving bone-turnover and histology, and phosphate levels including patients on haemodialysis. However, the effects of calcimimetics on fracture rate, major cardiovascular events or mortality remain controversial. Regarding PTx, evidence is lacking on its superiority over medical treatment since only observational studies have been carried out thus far. Moreover, the disparity between increasing PTH levels in dialysis patients with simultaneous decrease of PTx performed pleads for a prevailing uncertainty about optimal PTH targets.
