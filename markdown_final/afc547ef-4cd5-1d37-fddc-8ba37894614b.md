## Question

What is the duration of therapy for skin and soft tissue infections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the duration of antibiotic therapy for skin and soft tissue infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical heterogeneity of SSTIs and how that drives duration. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend for common syndromes like nonpurulent cellulitis, purulent abscesses, necrotizing infections, and diabetic foot infections. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence supporting shorter courses and note any exceptions. After that, I should review real-world practice gaps and stewardship levers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, response-guided approach and state a concise bottom line with caveats for special populations and severity modifiers.

> Let me first confirm the clinical heterogeneity that dictates duration, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. SSTIs span uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, purulent abscesses, necrotizing soft tissue infections, diabetic foot infections, surgical site infections, and infections in immunocompromised hosts, and duration hinges on syndrome, severity, source control, and patient factors such as diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression, so a one-size-fits-all answer is inappropriate [^112FyTjX] [^115pZHJE].

> I will now examine nonpurulent cellulitis and erysipelas, since this is where evidence most clearly supports shorter courses. The IDSA recommends 5 days of therapy for uncomplicated cellulitis if the patient is improving, with extension only if there is no clinical response by day 5, and this is echoed by the American College of Physicians' best-practice advice for 5–6 days in clinically stable, closely followed patients; importantly, a 5-day course is noninferior to 10 days when patients improve clinically, which aligns with stewardship principles [^114JW9ff] [^111gsSaf] [^114JW9ff] [^116QtZHg].

> Wait, let me verify the purulent abscess scenario, because I recall conflicting data on whether antibiotics are needed after drainage. IDSA advises that incision and drainage is primary therapy and that antibiotics are reserved for patients with systemic features, rapid progression, immunocompromise, or failure to improve; when antibiotics are indicated, 5–7 days is reasonable, and a randomized subgroup analysis suggested higher cure with courses beyond 5–7 days up to 10 days, though this conflicts with broader stewardship data and should be interpreted cautiously; in children, quality-improvement work shows 5–7 days is effective and safe when antibiotics are used after drainage [^111eVYNk] [^117BeCBh] [^113PMCEy].

> Hold on, I should verify necrotizing soft tissue infections, because duration here is driven by source control rather than a fixed antibiotic course. Contemporary surgical and infectious disease guidance recommends continuing antibiotics until further debridement is unnecessary, the patient is clinically improved, and fever has been absent for 48–72 hours; some recent reviews suggest that as little as 48 hours after adequate source control may suffice, but I need to emphasize that this remains low-certainty and should be individualized with close clinical monitoring rather than stopped prematurely [^113QMhjS] [^1165Rpwy] [^115pZHJE].

> Next, I should review diabetic foot infections, and I need to be precise about soft tissue versus osteomyelitis. For soft-tissue diabetic foot infections without bone involvement, 1–2 weeks is recommended by IWGDF/IDSA 2023, and a pilot RCT supports 10 days after surgical debridement; for diabetic foot osteomyelitis treated nonsurgically, randomized data suggest 6 weeks is adequate, and when treated surgically with removal of infected bone, even shorter courses may suffice, though evidence quality varies and decisions should be individualized to response and source control [^117XUhim] [^117XUhim] [^117CGQ5R] [^112FyTjX].

> Let me consider surgical site infections, because duration often gets overextended. For superficial SSIs, the cornerstone is opening the wound and local care; antibiotics are not routinely indicated unless there is a significant systemic response or incomplete source control, in which case a brief course of 24–48 hours may be reasonable, and prolonged antibiotics do not compensate for inadequate drainage [^111Lq8tE] [^113Etuia].

> I should confirm the stance in immunocompromised hosts, including neutropenia, where durations are generally longer due to impaired host response. IDSA suggests 7–14 days for most bacterial SSTIs in this group, with adjustments based on clinical response and microbiology, and for persistent or recurrent fever and neutropenia, antifungal therapy is added with treatment continued for about 2 weeks after clearance of bacteremia or resolution of lesions, underscoring the need for longer, individualized courses in this population [^113Wgf58] [^115ciDLK].

> But wait, what about bacteremia arising from SSTI; does that change duration. Historically, uncomplicated bacteremia without endocarditis or metastatic foci has been treated for about 2–3 weeks, yet emerging randomized evidence shows that for many bloodstream infections, 7 days is noninferior to 14 days; however, this BALANCE trial excluded Staphylococcus aureus and foci requiring prolonged therapy, so for S. aureus bacteremia from SSTI, I should still individualize toward 2–3 weeks unless a multidisciplinary review supports a shorter, carefully selected course with close follow-up [^115bjUCK] [^115KeWh6] [^116uopy8].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for shorter courses to ensure I'm not overstating. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses across common infections, including SSTIs, demonstrate that shorter antibiotic courses achieve similar clinical outcomes to longer courses when the diagnosis is correct, the drug is active, and the patient is improving; stewardship guidance explicitly recommends implementing systems to default to the shortest effective duration, which reinforces practice change toward 5–7 days for most uncomplicated SSTIs [^116rgAo8] [^116AV2uF] [^111gsSaf].

> I need to check real-world practice gaps, because knowing the evidence is not enough if clinicians routinely prescribe longer. Observational data show frequent overuse of broad-spectrum agents and durations exceeding 10 days, with more than 75% of patients receiving longer-than-recommended courses in some settings; EMR interventions and QI initiatives can reduce median durations by about 2 days and improve guideline concordance, though effect sizes vary and sustained change often requires multifaceted stewardship [^1177NgQH] [^114xMAVq] [^1122o9zG] [^113oAFa3].

> Let me synthesize a practical, response-guided approach, and I should double-check that it aligns with major guidelines. For uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, use 5–6 days if improving, extending only if there is inadequate response; for drained abscesses without systemic features, no routine antibiotics are needed, but if indicated, 5–7 days is reasonable; for necrotizing infections, continue until 48–72 hours after the last debridement, clinical improvement, and defervescence; for diabetic foot soft-tissue infection, treat 7–10 days, extending if slow response; for immunocompromised hosts, plan 7–14 days with adjustments to response and microbiology; always reassess at 48–72 hours and tailor duration to clinical trajectory rather than a fixed endpoint [^115p3xNL] [^111eVYNk] [^113QMhjS] [^116Nf3FQ] [^113Wgf58].

> Hold on, I should verify special modifiers that can justify shorter or longer therapy. Obesity alone does not require longer courses, and in fact longer durations may be associated with worse outcomes in some SSTI contexts; early IV-to-oral switch once clinically stable is encouraged to facilitate shorter total durations; and in children, 5–7 days is effective for most SSTIs, with stewardship tools improving adherence without increasing failures, supporting pediatric application of shorter courses [^112FyTjX] [^115uj1iH] [^113PMCEy] [^11715JoP].

> Bottom line, after reviewing guidelines and evidence, I should conclude clearly: for most uncomplicated SSTIs, 5–7 days of appropriately targeted therapy is sufficient if the patient is clinically improving, with extension only for slow response or special circumstances; necrotizing infections require source-control–driven duration until 48–72 hours after debridement, clinical improvement, and defervescence; diabetic foot soft-tissue infections generally need 7–10 days; and immunocompromised hosts often require 7–14 days with individualized adjustments, all within a stewardship framework that defaults to the shortest effective course and reassesses early for response [^115p3xNL] [^111gsSaf] [^113QMhjS] [^116Nf3FQ] [^113Wgf58].

The duration of therapy for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) depends on the **clinical scenario** and response to treatment. For uncomplicated cellulitis or abscess, **5–7 days** is sufficient if the patient is improving [^115p3xNL] [^111gsSaf]. For complicated SSTIs, including necrotizing infections or diabetic foot infections, **10–14 days** is typical, extending to 2–3 weeks if slow response or osteomyelitis is present [^116Nf3FQ]. Necrotizing infections require antibiotics until 48–72 hours after the last debridement, clinical improvement, and fever resolution [^113QMhjS]. Always tailor duration to clinical response, and extend if improvement is slow or complications arise [^116PoWQe].

---

## General principles guiding duration of therapy

Several factors influence the **appropriate duration** of antibiotic therapy for SSTIs:

- **Severity and extent of infection**: Uncomplicated infections typically require shorter courses, whereas complicated infections necessitate longer treatment durations [^115p3xNL].

- **Presence of systemic symptoms**: Fever, leukocytosis, or other systemic signs may warrant extended therapy [^notfound].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Immunocompromised status, diabetes, obesity, and other comorbidities may prolong the required duration of therapy [^notfound].

- **Clinical response**: Therapy should be individualized based on patient response, with adjustments made if improvement is slow or complications arise [^116PoWQe].

---

## Recommended durations for specific SSTI categories

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cellulitis or abscess | 5–7 days | High [^115p3xNL] [^111gsSaf] |
| Complicated SSTIs (e.g. necrotizing infections, diabetic foot infections) | 10–14 days; extend to 2–3 weeks if slow response or osteomyelitis | Moderate [^116UZ3J7] [^116Nf3FQ] |
| Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) | Until 48–72 hours after last debridement, clinical improvement, and fever resolution | Moderate [^113QMhjS] [^1165Rpwy] |
| Purulent SSTIs with MRSA | 7–14 days, individualized based on response | Moderate [^111aNudS] [^1131cRoq] |
| Surgical site infections (SSIs) | 7–14 days, depending on severity and response | Low [^notfound] |

---

## Evidence supporting shorter courses of therapy

Recent studies and guidelines increasingly support **shorter antibiotic courses** for uncomplicated SSTIs, demonstrating comparable clinical outcomes with reduced risks of adverse effects, antibiotic resistance, and healthcare costs [^116rgAo8] [^116AV2uF]. For example, a randomized controlled trial found that 5 days of therapy for uncomplicated cellulitis was as effective as 10 days, provided the patient showed clinical improvement by day 5 [^116QtZHg]. Similarly, a meta-analysis concluded that shorter courses (5–7 days) were noninferior to longer courses (10–14 days) in uncomplicated SSTIs [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require longer courses (10–14 days) due to impaired host response and higher risk of recurrence [^notfound].

- **Diabetic foot infections**: Typically require 10–14 days, extending to 2–3 weeks if osteomyelitis is present or if clinical response is slow [^116Nf3FQ] [^117XUhim].

- **Necrotizing infections**: Require prolonged therapy until surgical debridement is complete, clinical improvement is evident, and fever has resolved for 48–72 hours [^113QMhjS] [^1165Rpwy].

- **Pediatric patients**: Shorter courses (5–7 days) are generally effective, with clinical response guiding duration adjustments [^113PMCEy] [^11715JoP].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Regular clinical assessment is essential to determine the **appropriate duration** of therapy. If the patient shows significant improvement within the initial 5–7 days, therapy can be discontinued. Persistent symptoms, slow response, or complications may necessitate extending treatment to 10–14 days or longer, depending on the clinical context [^116PoWQe].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uncomplicated SSTIs**: 5–7 days of therapy is sufficient if the patient is clinically improving [^115p3xNL] [^111gsSaf].

- **Complicated SSTIs**: 10–14 days is typical, extending to 2–3 weeks if the response is slow or complications arise [^116UZ3J7] [^116Nf3FQ].

- **Necrotizing infections**: Continue antibiotics until 48–72 hours after the last debridement, clinical improvement, and fever resolution [^113QMhjS] [^1165Rpwy].

- **Individualize therapy**: Base duration on clinical response, patient-specific factors, and severity of infection [^116PoWQe].

---

The duration of therapy for SSTIs varies with infection severity, patient factors, and clinical response. Shorter courses (5–7 days) are effective for uncomplicated cases, whereas complicated infections may require 10–14 days or longer. Regular clinical assessment and individualized therapy are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Determining the optimal antibiotic duration for skin and soft tissue infections [^112FyTjX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optimal duration of therapy in SSTIs - a heterogeneous group of infections - remains unknown. The advances in knowledge of antibiotic duration of treatment in selected SSTIs that can impact clinical practice and published in the last 18 months are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence indicates that few patients receive guideline concordant empiric antibiotics and appropriate duration in the United States, although this likely can be extrapolated to other countries. One of the most commonly identified opportunities to improve antibiotic stewardship is duration of therapy more than 10 days. The long-standing debate regarding the significance of abscess size and its impact on clinical response to antibiotics, following proper drainage, is increasingly shifting towards the conclusion that abscess size is not directly associated with cure. In obese patients with SSTI, there is no benefit to longer antibiotic durations for SSTIs in patients with obesity, and it appears that longer antibiotic duration of therapy was associated with increased treatment failure. In diabetic foot infections (DFO), two randomized studies suggest that in the presence of osteomyelitis, the total duration of antibiotic therapy for patients treated nonsurgically does not need to be more than 6weeks. In a prospective, randomized, noninferiority, pilot trial, patients with DFO who underwent surgical debridement and received either a 3-week or 6-week course of antibiotic therapy had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events. In patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, successive observational studies clearly suggest that short duration of antibiotic treatment after NSTI source control is as well tolerated and effective as a longer course. It appears that 48h would be enough. The possibility of fixed versus individualized approaches to therapy for common bacterial infections, including SSTIs merits to be considered seriously. Fully individualized therapy may be an ideal approach to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of antimicrobials. Much more work is needed before this strategy becomes feasible.

Summary

There is increasing evidence that shorter duration of treatment is better in different types of SSTIs. Paradoxically, evaluation of real-life clinical practice indicates that long treatments continue to be commonly given to this population.

### The optimal duration of treatment for skin and soft tissue infections and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^112BmFn7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the current finding on SSTIs/ABSSSIs treatment duration.

Recent Findings

In 2013, the FDA approved the definition of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). From a clinical point of view, the new definition may present some advantages: the definition of the severity of the disease, the measurement of reduction in lesion size, and effectiveness of treatment primary endpoint at 48-72h after treatment initiation. New therapeutic options with improved efficacy, safety, and/or pharmacodynamics are available for ABSSSIs and so far, several questions still need to be addressed for the management of these infections, including treatment duration.

Summary

There is a wide variation of duration of antimicrobial treatment in skin and soft tissue infections. Plenty of published data available suggest that we should focus on the early response to shorten duration of treatment, and that the antimicrobial stewardship perspective is extremely helpful in underscoring the need for composite outcomes in clinical practice, as multiple tools are available to increase cost-efficacy, including reduction of treatment changes, early oral switch, early discharge (even from the Emergency Department), outpatient antimicrobial treatment, long-acting antibiotics, and all together, de-escalation treatment strategies.

### Current international and national guidelines for managing skin and soft tissue infections [^111a7LNw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin and soft tissue infections account for a significant percentage of both community and nosocomial infections. Several nosological entities are included in this concept. However, there is a very scarce body of doctrine for their treatment based on randomised trials. Therefore, we considered it necessary to review current treatment guidelines to bring new recommendations and improvements to our colleagues. In this review of recent literature, we identified updated guidelines in this area by searching the databases PubMed, evidence-based medicine online, York University reviewers group, Cochrane, MBE-Trip and Sumsearch using the terms: soft tissue infection, therapy, guideline.

Recent Findings

Developments focus on using new antimicrobials and on the prescription of shorter antibiotic treatment courses.

Summary

With the development of new drugs and the current evidence of their use, there is a need to refine the appropriate drug's decision-making. Drugs with a long half-life, which allows weekly administration, can reduce hospital admission and length of stay with fewer healthcare resources. Shorter courses of antibiotics are recommended. The role of stewardship programmes will continue to expand. The surgical indication and its value are evident in many patients. Therefore, management should rely on a collaborative group with experience in this disease.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^116rgAo8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Antibiotic duration, but not abscess size, impacts clinical cure of limited skin and soft tissue infection after incision and drainage [^117BeCBh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are frequently prescribed following incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses. In subgroup analyses from a recent clinical trial, we observed higher likelihood of cure with antibiotic courses beyond 5 or 7 days (up to 10). Among this cohort, for abscesses ≤ 5 cm, size did not modify the antibiotic effect.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113QMhjS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for necrotizing infections?

In the absence of definitive clinical trials, antibiotic therapy should be administered until further debridement is no longer necessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has resolved for 48–72 h (recommendation 1C).

Procalcitonin monitoring may be useful to guide antimicrobial discontinuation (recommendation 2B).

There is no direct evidence about optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, and the expert panel shares that antimicrobial therapy should be administered until further debridement is no longer necessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has been resolved for 48–72 h.

Several controlled clinical studies have evaluated the potential of the infection biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with bacterial infections and its influence on decisions regarding antibiotic therapy.

In order to develop a PCT ratio indicating successful surgical intervention in patients with necrotizing infections, Friederichs et al. designed a study of 38 patients treated with clinical signs of sepsis caused by a NSTI. All patients received radical surgical treatment. Serum levels of PCT and C-reactive protein were monitored postoperatively. The ratio of day 1 to day 2 was calculated. An eradication of the infectious focus was successfully performed in 84% of patients, averaging 1.9 operations (range 1–6) to achieve the elimination of the infectious source. The PCT ratio was significantly higher in the group of patients with successful surgical intervention (1.665 versus 0.9, p < 0.001). A ratio higher than the calculated cutoff of 1.14 indicated successful surgical treatment with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 71.4%. The positive predictive value was 75.8%, and the negative predictive value was 80.0%.

The PCT ratio of postoperative day 1 to day 2 following major surgical procedures for necrotizing infections represented a valuable clinical tool indicating successful surgical eradication of the infectious focus and correlated with the successful elimination of the infectious source and clinical recovery.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

### Current challenges in acute bacterial skin infection management [^115pZHJE]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are aspects of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) that remain unresolved, such as current numbers, classification criteria, how best to define severity and predict the outcome, what diagnostic tests to perform, what new treatment options are available, or what the duration of antibiotic treatment should be. We have reviewed the literature over the last 18months to clarify these issues and provide our opinion.

Recent Findings

SSTIs are common and among the top 10 most frequent infections worldwide. They represent a burden on the healthcare system and have a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Regarding classification, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) provides a practical guide that distinguishes between uncomplicated and complicated infections, acute and chronic wound infections, and necrotising and nonnecrotizing infections based on skin extension and tissue necrosis. With new microbiological and imaging diagnostic techniques, SSTIs can now be better diagnosed. New PCR techniques are available, and mass spectrometry can be applied to samples collected in liquid transport media. Moreover, new treatment methods such as photodynamic therapy, reactive oxygen, and phages are emerging. SSTI patients can be treated with shorter antibiotic courses if they receive an active drug with good tissue penetration. Antibiotic treatment in necrotizing infections can be shortened to 48h after the last debridement.

Summary

SSTIs remain a challenge regarding rapid and accurate diagnosis and clinical management.

### Staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections [^114JW9ff]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacteria causing purulent skin and soft tissue infections. Many disease-causing S aureus strains are methicillin resistant; thus, empiric therapy should be given to cover methicillin-resistant S aureus. Bacterial wound cultures are important for characterizing local susceptibility patterns. Definitive antibiotic therapy is warranted, although there are no compelling data demonstrating superiority of any one antibiotic over another. Antibiotic choice is predicated by the infection severity, local susceptibility patterns, and drug-related safety, tolerability, and cost. Response to therapy is expected within the first days; 5 to 7 days of therapy is typically adequate to achieve cure.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PZ2N8]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent global point prevalence survey of infections in 1,265 intensive care units (ICUs) documented bloodstream infection (BSI) among 15% of patients, and this rate may be increasing over time because of increased use of immunosuppressive drugs, invasive procedures, and older patients who have concomitant medical conditions and who are admitted to intensive care. These infections are a major contributor to patient morbidity and are associated with a doubling or even tripling of mortality. Mortality rates may be higher if delayed or ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy is prescribed, and so it is difficult to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use in the initial empiric phase of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. In contrast, it may be more feasible to reduce antibiotic use at the back end of treatment courses. Up to half of the antibiotic use in hospital wards and critical care units is unnecessary or inappropriate, and excessive durations of treatment are the greatest contributor to inappropriate use. A reduction in the length of antibiotic courses is, therefore, a potentially viable strategy to minimize the consequences of antibiotic overuse in critical care, including antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, Clostridium difficile colitis, and costs.

The optimal duration of therapy for primary BSI and BSI secondary to major organ system infections has been poorly defined. A review of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of infections most commonly encountered in the critical care setting - including guidelines for community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), pyelonephritis, and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) - provides no guidance about the optimal duration of therapy for the subset of patients with bacteremia. In the absence of high-grade evidence, there is wide variability in antibiotic treatment duration recommendations from infectious disease and critical care specialists, and the presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for extended courses of antibiotic therapy regardless of the observed clinical response to treatment. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining duration of therapy in several organ system infections have demonstrated that treatment can be shortened to 1 week or less without worsening patient outcomes, so it is plausible that treatment duration could potentially be shortened for BSIs as well.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115p3xNL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^112Yz2zv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bjUCK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Bacteremia management — Early source control and imaging are emphasized, and intravenous (IV) to oral transition is allowed with defined duration. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed; repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection; antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate when bacteremia cleared promptly and there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess, and Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate).

The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections – are they applicable today? [^117Hg2MC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113H7gvu]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for bloodstream infections is unknown. Shorter durations of therapy have been demonstrated to be as effective as longer durations for many common infections; similar findings in bacteremia could enable hospitals to reduce antibiotic utilization, adverse events, resistance and costs.

Methods

A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE databases was conducted for the years 1947–2010. Controlled trials were identified that randomized patients to shorter versus longer durations of treatment for bacteremia, or the infectious foci most commonly causing bacteremia in critically ill patients (catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), intra-abdominal infections, pneumonia, pyelonephritis and skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI)).

Results

Twenty-four eligible trials were identified, including one trial focusing exclusively on bacteremia, zero in catheter related bloodstream infection, three in intra-abdominal infection, six in pyelonephritis, thirteen in pneumonia and one in skin and soft tissue infection. Thirteen studies reported on 227 patients with bacteremia allocated to 'shorter' or 'longer' durations of treatment. Outcome data were available for 155 bacteremic patients: neonatal bacteremia (n = 66); intra-abdominal infection (40); pyelonephritis (9); and pneumonia (40). Among bacteremic patients receiving shorter (5–7 days) versus longer (7–21 days) antibiotic therapy, no significant difference was detected with respect to rates of clinical cure (45/52 versus 47/49, risk ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–1.01), microbiologic cure (28/28 versus 30/32, risk ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.91–1.21), and survival (15/17 versus 26/29, risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.76–1.23).

Conclusions

No significant differences in clinical cure, microbiologic cure and survival were detected among bacteremic patients receiving shorter versus longer duration antibiotic therapy. An adequately powered randomized trial of bacteremic patients is needed to confirm these findings.

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^111PJKuw]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are a common cause of hospitalization and use of antibiotic therapy, and may result in significant disability. Infections managed by surgeons may vary from simple, noncomplicated cellulitis to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. The differentiation of necrotizing infections from nonnecrotizing infections is critical to achieving adequate surgical therapy. An understanding of the changing epidemiology of all complicated skin and soft tissue infections is required for selection of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy.

Initial episode antibiotic therapy for patients with SSTIs and fever and neutropenia — treatment: Hospitalization and empiric antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin plus antipseudomonal antibiotics such as cefepime, a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem or doripenem) or piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended. Documented clinical and microbiologic SSTIs should be treated based on antimicrobial susceptibilities of isolated organisms. It is recommended that the treatment duration for most bacterial SSTIs should be 7–14 days. Surgical intervention is rarely necessary to debride soft tissue abscesses after marrow recovery or for a progressive polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis. Adjunct colony-stimulating factor therapy (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) or granulocyte transfusions are not routinely recommended. Acyclovir should be administered to patients suspected or confirmed to have cutaneous or disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection.

### Current epidemiology, etiology, and burden of acute skin infections in the United States [^1141cqBz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CURRENT CHALLENGES IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF SSTIS

While rapid diagnostics have improved the outcomes for patients with other severe infections, limited data and strategies are available for SSTIs. Hence, more studies are urgently needed to establish the role of various novel diagnostic technologies in these infections. Even when such diagnostics are available, due to the high rates of culture-negative SSTIs, therapy will remain challenging in patients at increased risk for Gram-negative and mixed infections.

The optimal time to switch from IV to oral antibiotic therapy as well as the optimal duration of therapy remain uncertain. Switching from IV to oral antibiotics when clinical improvement is apparent and antibiotic deescalation are important components of antimicrobial stewardship. In addition, there is likely a role for short-course therapy in some SSTI populations, although there is a dearth of clinical evidence on this topic.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) — Although most infections occur after primary inoculation at sites of skin disruption or trauma, hematogenous dissemination does occur; in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients the most common manifestations include cutaneous and pleuropulmonary disease, and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients catheter-related infection and bacteremia are noted. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurs preferentially among patients with HIV disease, whereas bloodstream and cutaneous infections with multiple NTM species are more frequent among non-HIV-immunocompromised hosts; dermatologic manifestations include a poorly resolving cellulitis, painless 1- to 2-cm nodules, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment requires prolonged combination therapy (duration, 6–12 weeks) that should consist of a macrolide antibiotic (eg, clarithromycin) and a second agent to which the isolate is susceptible, and surgical debridement is crucial for cultures and sensitivities and to promote skin and soft tissue healing.

Cutaneous anthrax — clinical features, diagnostics, and treatment evidence: After an incubation period of 1–12 days, pruritus begins at the entry site followed by a papule, vesicles develop on top of the papule, and finally a painless ulcer with a black scab; the eschar generally separates and sloughs after 12–14 days. Cultures of untreated lesions are positive > 80% of the time; white blood cell counts are generally normal and blood cultures are almost always negative. For specimen collection, vesicles should be unroofed and 2 dry swabs soaked in fluid, and at later stages 2 moist swabs rotated in the ulcer base or beneath the eschar's edge. No randomized, controlled trials of therapy exist; penicillin is effective and will "sterilize" most lesions within a few hours to 3 days without accelerating healing, with value primarily in reducing mortality from as high as 20% to zero. The optimal duration of treatment is uncertain, but 7–10 days appears adequate in naturally acquired cases, whereas Sixty days of treatment is recommended when associated with bioterrorism; until susceptibilities are available, ciprofloxacin is rational empiric therapy for bioterrorism-related cases, and other fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or moxifloxacin are also likely to be effective.

### Default antibiotic order durations for skin and soft tissue infections in outpatient pediatrics: a cluster randomized trial [^113o4Egt]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic durations for uncomplicated skin/soft tissue infections (SSTI) often exceed the guideline-recommended 5–7 days. We assessed the effectiveness of a default duration order panel in the Electronic Health Record to reduce long prescriptions.

Methods

Cluster randomized trial of an SSTI order panel with default antibiotic durations (implemented 12/2021), compared to a control panel (no decision support) in 14 pediatric primary care clinics. We assessed long prescription rates from 23 months before to 12 months after order panel implementation (1/2020–12/2022). Antibiotic duration was considered long if > 5 days for cellulitis or drained abscess, or > 7 days for undrained abscess, impetigo, or other SSTI.

Results

We included 1123 and 511 encounters in intervention and control clinics, respectively. In a piecewise generalized linear model, the long prescription rate decreased from 63.8% to 54.6% (absolute difference, -9.2%) in the intervention group and from 70.0% to 54.9% (absolute difference, -15.1%) in the control group. The relative change in trajectories from pre-panel to post-panel periods did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups (P = 0.488). Although used in only 29.4% of eligible encounters, intervention panel use had lower odds of long prescription compared to all other prescriptions (odds ratio 0.18).

Conclusions

We did not detect an overall impact of an order panel with default durations in reducing long antibiotic prescriptions for SSTIs. When ordered from the intervention panel, prescriptions were usually guideline-concordant. Effective strategies to make choosing a default duration more automatic are necessary to further reduce long prescriptions.

### A multifaceted intervention improves antibiotic stewardship for skin and soft tissues infections [^114xMAVq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted stewardship intervention to reduce frequency and duration of inappropriate antibiotic use for emergency department (ED) patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). We hypothesized the antibiotic stewardship program would reduce antibiotic duration and improve guideline adherence in discharged SSTI patients.

Design

Nonrandomized controlled trial.

Setting

Academic EDs (intervention site and control site).

Patients Or Participants

Attending physicians and nurse practitioners at participating EDs.

Intervention(S)

Education regarding guideline-based treatment of SSTI, tests of antimicrobial treatment of SSTI, implementation of a clinical treatment algorithm and order set in the electronic health record, and ED clinicians' audit and feedback.

Results

We examined 583 SSTIs. At the intervention site, clinician adherence to guidelines improved from 41% to 51% (aOR = 2.13 [95% CI: 1.20–3.79]). At the control site, there were no changes in adherence during the "intervention" period (aOR = 1.17 [0.65–2.12]). The between-site comparison of these during vs. pre-intervention odds ratios was not different (aOR = 1.82 [0.79–4.21]). Antibiotic duration decreased by 26% at the intervention site during the intervention compared to pre-intervention (Adjusted Geometric Mean Ratio [95% CI] = 0.74 [0.66–0.84]). Adherence was inversely associated with SSTI severity (severe vs mild; adjusted OR 0.42 [0.20–0.89]) and purulence (0.32 [0.21–0.47]). Mean antibiotic prescription duration was 1.95 days shorter (95% CI: 1.54–2.33) in the time period following the intervention than pre-intervention period.

Conclusions

A multifaceted intervention resulted in modest improvement in adherence to guidelines compared to a control site, driven by treatment duration reductions.

### What is new in the management of skin and soft tissue infections in 2016? [^117SjtJ7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are the most frequent infectious cause of referrals to emergency departments and hospital admissions in developed world, contributing to significant morbidity and healthcare expenditures. We sought to review recent literature covering epidemiology and management of SSTIs.

Recent Findings

Incidence trends of SSTIs were increasing worldwide with Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci predominating and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) posing additional challenges, because of high rates of treatment failure and relapse. Development of new antimicrobials was associated with an appraisal of regulatory definitions and endpoints. Prediction of clinical response can be very tricky, because of variable risk factors for recurrence or treatment failure, depending mostly on the host. Precise indications for new antimicrobials should be established; their integration into clinical practice algorithms may serve reduction of unnecessary admissions, overtreatment and total costs.

Summary

New antimicrobials with activity against MRSA have been recently launched. Long-acting agents, mainly oritavancin and dalbavancin, provide the opportunity of single-dose treatment and early discharge. Further outpatient treatment options include new per os antibiotics such as oxazolidinones. Validated assessment tools are urgently needed to support decision-making toward rational resource utilization and delivery of optimal treatment.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^114ch8sU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Evidence about the contribution of excessive treatment duration to antibiotic overuse in primary care is limited. A recent study from the US showed that more than two thirds of antibiotic courses for acute sinusitis in adults were 10 days or longer, whereas the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends treatment of uncomplicated cases for five to seven days. A small study from the Manitoba region in Canada, that focused on urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, skin or soft tissue infections, and pneumonia estimated that 15% of prescriptions with the appropriate antibiotic were for treatments longer than guideline based recommendations.

An up-to-date picture on prescribed antibiotic durations for common infections in English primary care is lacking. Such an overview is especially relevant given the increasing evidence from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses that shorter antibiotic courses clear infection comparable to longer courses, while minimising selection, proliferation, and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the likelihood of side effects from antibiotic use.

We therefore assessed the extent to which durations of antibiotic courses prescribed for common infections in English primary care are in line with relevant guidelines. If substantial proportions of antibiotic prescriptions are longer than recommended, this would indicate that there is potential to safely reduce total antibiotic use simply by better application of guidelines in clinical practice.

### Impact of an electronic medical-record-embedded clinical-decision support tool on duration of antibiotics for outpatient pediatric skin and soft-tissue infections [^112JhKxj]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Up to 90% of human antibiotic use occurs in the ambulatory setting. In the United States, ∼50% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary or inappropriate when accounting for antibiotic selection, dose, and duration. – In addition to driving antimicrobial resistance, unnecessary antibiotic use results in increased adverse drug events and increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection.

Most ambulatory stewardship interventions reported in the literature have targeted respiratory infections, although skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) are a common indication for outpatient antimicrobial use. We investigated the impact of an electronic medical record (EMR)–embedded clinical decision support (CDS) tool on antibiotic duration for outpatient pediatric SSTI.

### Antibiotic treatment for 7 versus 14 days in patients with bloodstream infections [^115KeWh6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Early, appropriate antibiotic therapy is important, but the duration of treatment is uncertain.

Methods

In a multicenter, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned hospitalized patients (including patients in the intensive care unit [ICU]) who had bloodstream infection to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 days or 14 days. Antibiotic selection, dosing, and route were at the discretion of the treating team. We excluded patients with severe immunosuppression, foci requiring prolonged treatment, single cultures with possible contaminants, or cultures yielding Staphylococcus aureus. The primary outcome was death from any cause by 90 days after diagnosis of the bloodstream infection, with a noninferiority margin of 4 percentage points.

Results

Across 74 hospitals in seven countries, 3608 patients underwent randomization and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 1814 patients were assigned to 7 days of antibiotic treatment, and 1794 to 14 days. At enrollment, 55.0% of patients were in the ICU and 45.0% were on hospital wards. Infections were acquired in the community (75.4%), hospital wards (13.4%) and ICUs (11.2%). Bacteremia most commonly originated from the urinary tract (42.2%), abdomen (18.8%), lung (13.0%), vascular catheters (6.3%), and skin or soft tissue (5.2%). By 90 days, 261 patients (14.5%) receiving antibiotics for 7 days had died and 286 patients (16.1%) receiving antibiotics for 14 days had died (difference, -1.6 percentage points [95.7% confidence interval {CI}, -4.0 to 0.8]), which showed the noninferiority of the shorter treatment duration. Patients were treated for longer than the assigned duration in 23.1% of the patients in the 7-day group and in 10.7% of the patients in the 14-day group. A per-protocol analysis also showed noninferiority (difference, -2.0 percentage points [95% CI, -4.5 to 0.6]). These findings were generally consistent across secondary clinical outcomes and across prespecified subgroups defined according to patient, pathogen, and syndrome characteristics.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection, antibiotic treatment for 7 days was noninferior to treatment for 14 days. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; BALANCE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03005145.).

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^1165Rpwy]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up antibiotic management

Although no studies have specifically addressed antibiotic de-escalation strategies in NSTIs, it appears reasonable to adjust therapy based on the anatomical site of infection (considering that abdominoperineal and cervicofacial NSTIs are mostly polymicrobial, whereas limb NSTIs are monomicrobial in 60–70% of cases) as well as blood culture results and intraoperative microbiological samples. The optimal agent for oral step-down therapy has not been defined; oral de-escalation should be initiated after complete surgical debridement and we recommend selecting an antibiotic with good oral bioavailability and encourage lipophilic molecules with reliable skin tissue penetration. No randomized controlled trials have established the ideal duration of antibiotic therapy. Treatment is generally continued until surgical debridement is no longer required, the patient demonstrates clinical improvement and fever has been absent for at least 48 to 72 h.

After acute infection, we recommend careful surveillance, as recurrence — necrotizing or not — occurs in up to 35% of cases within one year of the initial NSTI.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^116AV2uF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) duration of therapy — We recommend that ASPs implement guidelines and strategies to reduce antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective duration (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Suitable approaches include developing written guidelines with specific suggestions for duration, including duration of therapy recommendations as part of the preauthorization or prospective audit and feedback process, or specifying duration at the time of antibiotic ordering (eg, through an electronic order entry system). Findings from 2 pre–post investigations suggest similar clinical outcomes with reduced duration; in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, education and PAF reduced use from 20.7 days to 13.1 days (P < .001), with no significant differences in length of stay or 30-day readmission rates, and among inpatients with SSTIs duration fell from 13 to 10 days; P < .001) after a guideline. Evidence from systematic reviews and RCTs demonstrates that shorter courses are associated with outcomes similar to longer courses in adults and children with few adverse events.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^112vEQE9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are potentially life-threatening infections of any layer of the soft tissue compartment associated with widespread necrosis and systemic toxicity. Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidence-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The multifaceted nature of these infections has led to a collaboration among surgeons, intensive care and infectious diseases specialists, who have shared these guidelines, implementing clinical practice recommendations.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

Neutropenic fever skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — episode classification and empiric spectrum are described as follows: An "initial" episode refers to the first episode of neutropenic fever requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy, whereas a "persisting episode" is "persistent neutropenic fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy beyond days 4–7", and episodes may also be recurrent. During the initial episode, "gram-negative bacteria should be primarily targeted by the initial antibiotic regimen because they are associated with high mortality rates", and although gram-positive bacteria are more common, "the addition of antibiotics with gram- positive activity including MRSA is not recommended unless physical findings suggestive of inflammation in the skin and soft tissues are present, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and risk factors for MRSA are present". For persistent or recurrent episodes, "antibiotic-resistant bacterial or fungal pathogens (including Candida) may be encountered".

### Current epidemiology, etiology, and burden of acute skin infections in the United States [^111Ga75V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The burden and cost of acute skin infections in the United States, including ambulatory visits and hospitalizations, are substantial. While S. aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus spp. remain common SSTI causes, Gram-negative and mixed infections, though often underappreciated by clinicians when choosing empiric coverage, are present in up to 30% of culture-positive SSTIs. To optimize outcomes, it is important for clinicians to recognize factors that may increase the risk for MRSA as well as for a Gram-negative or a mixed infection. Future research should address the optimal duration of SSTI therapy, including the timing of IV to oral switch, and further characterize risk factors for polymicrobial infections. Such data would augment antibiotic stewardship efforts to provide effective empiric antimicrobial therapy to patients with SSTIs while also avoiding unnecessarily broad-spectrum treatment.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment of MRSA infections in… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy for five to 10 days is recommended pending culture results for outpatients with purulent cellulitis. Infection from β-hemolytic streptococci does not usually require empiric therapy. For those with nonpurulent cellulitis, five to 10 days of empiric therapy for β-hemolytic streptococcal infection is recommended, based on the patient's clinical response. Empiric coverage for community-associated MRSA is recommended in patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics, and also may be considered in those with systemic toxicity. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response.

Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks. For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures.

The optimal duration of therapy for MRSA osteomyelitis is unknown, although a minimum of eight weeks is recommended. Some experts suggest an additional one to three months of oral rifampin-based combination therapy with TMP/SMX, doxycycline, minocycline, clindamycin, or a fluoroquinolone, chosen based on susceptibilities. The duration of therapy should be individualized, but a minimum of three to four weeks is recommended for patients with septic arthritis, and four to six weeks for patients with osteomyelitis. Daptomycin and linezolid are alternative therapies.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112cLfcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^11791M4U]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Stewardship strategies in the inpatient setting — local guidelines — The development and dissemination of institutional guidelines for diagnosing and treating common infectious syndromes is a key function of stewardship programs, and guidelines provide evidence-based and standardized diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on local data and promote adherence to the use of formulary drugs. Antibiotic guidelines can be developed to target common indications for antibiotic use, such as community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, hospital- and ventilator-associated pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, intraabdominal infections, and neonatal and pediatric sepsis, and these indications represent the majority of antibiotic use in most institutions. Inpatient guidelines can discuss appropriate clinical criteria suggestive of bacterial infections, diagnostic testing (including imaging studies when needed), specific empirical and targeted therapy (including dosing and options for severe drug allergies), and appropriate durations of therapy.

### Current guidelines and recommendations for the management of skin and soft tissue infections [^117MabCv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has significantly increased over the last years. In addition, major ecological changes have been reported with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), involved in a large proportion of these cases. A large number of expert opinions, guidelines, and recommendations for the management of SSTIs have been published over the last decade. The purpose of this review is to compare these guidelines.

Recent Findings

A total of six official publications have presented recommendations for the management of SSTIs. During the same period, other guidelines for the management of MRSA infections have also been published, including some recommendations for SSTIs.

Summary

The applicability of the guidelines is questionable in many ways. The distinction between necrotizing/nonnecrotizing infections is valuable but difficult to apply prior to surgical management. The prescribers should choose a pragmatic approach to empirical antibiotic therapy, taking into account the patient's initial severity, the extent of infection and risk factors for resistant microorganisms essentially related to healthcare-associated circumstances.

Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Impact of an electronic medical-record-embedded clinical-decision support tool on duration of antibiotics for outpatient pediatric skin and soft-tissue infections [^11715JoP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Intervention timeline

The Michigan Medicine Ambulatory Antimicrobial Stewardship Program instituted serial interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing for outpatient pediatric SSTI. The primary intervention was a pediatric SmartSet, an EMR-embedded CDS tool used to guide therapy at the time of the visit (Epic, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, Wisconsin).

Institutional SSTI treatment guidelines for pediatric and adult patients were developed in July 2019, followed by dedicated SSTI education for general pediatricians in May 2020. General medicine and family medicine practitioners received generalized education on the management of common infections, including SSTI. The pediatric SmartSet was developed with a general pediatrics champion and was implemented in December 2020. It includes a templated progress note and prepopulated options for guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing based on diagnosis (impetigo, cellulitis, or abscess). In May 2021, a Tableau dashboard (Tableau software, Seattle, WA) was developed with the quality and analytics team. The dashboard displays the rate of prescriptions with an inappropriate antibiotic duration for adult and pediatric SSTI, as well as rates by clinic and provider, allowing for individual review of inappropriate cases.

Study design, setting, and population

In this quasi-experimental, before-and after study, adult patients (aged ≥ 21 years) and pediatric patients (aged 2 months to < 21 years) were included if they were prescribed an enteral antibiotic within 3 days of a Michigan Medicine primary care or general surgery encounter (ie, in-person, virtual, or telephone) with an International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code for impetigo, cellulitis, or cutaneous abscess. Prescriptions of < 3 days or > 14 days were excluded because these durations were likely not prescribed for uncomplicated SSTI. The SmartSet was implemented in December 2020. The preintervention period was July 2019 through December 2020, and the postintervention period was January 2021 through December 2021.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric SSTI with an inappropriate duration, defined as > 7 days. Institutional SSTI guidelines, consistent with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, recommend 5-day treatment courses for impetigo, cellulitis, and abscess, with extension to 7 days for slow clinical response.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pdiDB]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The eligible trials of treatment duration in pyelonephritis involved diverse patient populations, durations of treatment, and outcome measures, and this explains the heterogeneity of outcomes with shorter durations of therapy. Recently, the results of several RCTs have demonstrated short-course (5 or 7 days) fluoroquinolone therapy to be equally as efficacious as 10 to 14 days of treatment with comparator medications. IDSA guidelines were accordingly amended to recommend therapy for 7 days, but the issue of bacteremia was not explicitly addressed. Our data suggest that patients with bacteremia secondary to uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be successfully treated with shorter-duration therapy.

The sole trial of treatment duration in SSTI demonstrated that, in a carefully selected healthy adult population, a short duration of therapy was associated with a cure rate equal to that of a long duration of therapy. However, the explicit exclusion of patients with more serious infections, argues that it is unlikely that these data can be directly extrapolated to critically ill patients with bacteremic soft tissue infections.

The present review has several important limitations. The prespecified search strategy excluded unpublished data and non-English language trials. Of eligible trials, bias may have been introduced by low rates of blinding and use of placebo controls. Some studies included only patients with early clinical improvement for randomization to short- or long-course therapy; consequently, the effect size and findings may not be generalizable to sicker patient populations. Other trials excluded patients post-randomization or presented only per-protocol analyses and so may have excluded bacteremic patients failing therapy. Treatment outcomes for patients with bacteremia in individual studies were derived from small post hoc subgroup analyses. Finally, within individual infectious syndromes, significant variability was encountered both in study design and in the durations of therapy employed (with 14 days even considered shorter-course therapy in one study). However, the lack of outcome heterogeneity between syndromes suggests that it is valid to pool BSI data from multiple infectious foci into a single meta-analysis or enroll such patients within a single RCT.

### Avoidable antibiotic exposure for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in the ambulatory care setting [^1137MrAc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent indications for outpatient antibiotics. A detailed understanding of current prescribing practices is necessary to optimize antibiotic use for these conditions.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adults treated in the ambulatory care setting for uncomplicated cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess between March 1, 2010 and February 28, 2011. We assessed the frequency of avoidable antibiotic exposure, defined as the use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity, combination antibiotic therapy, or treatment for 10 or more days. Total antibiotic-days prescribed for the cohort were compared with antibiotic-days in 4 hypothetical short-course (5–7 days), single-antibiotic treatment models consistent with national guidelines.

Results

A total of 364 cases were included for analysis (155 cellulitis, 41 wound infection, and 168 abscess). Antibiotics active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were prescribed in 61% of cases of cellulitis. Of 139 cases of abscess where drainage was performed, antibiotics were prescribed in 80% for a median of 10 (interquartile range, 7–10) days. Of 292 total cases where complete prescribing data were available, avoidable antibiotic exposure occurred in 46%. This included use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity in 4%, combination therapy in 12%, and treatment for 10 or more days in 42%. Use of the short-course, single-antibiotic treatment strategies would have reduced prescribed antibiotic-days by 19% to 55%.

Conclusions

Approximately half of uncomplicated skin infections involved avoidable antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic use could be reduced through treatment approaches using short courses of a single antibiotic.

### Impact of an electronic medical-record-embedded clinical-decision support tool on duration of antibiotics for outpatient pediatric skin and soft-tissue infections [^1122o9zG]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Implementation of an EMR-embedded CDS tool was associated with an immediate relative decrease of 40% in inappropriate antibiotic duration for outpatient pediatric SSTI. Prior to SmartSet implementation, guidelines and clinician education resulted in only a modest decline in inappropriate antibiotic duration. Subsequent passive feedback via dissemination of a Tableau dashboard sharing inappropriate prescribing rates by clinician or clinic did not result in a further reduction in inappropriate prescribing. The improvement was sustained over 12 months. SmartSet use was low, though concordant with the degree of improvement. We hypothesize that increasing SmartSet use may result in further improvement.

In contrast to the improved prescribing in pediatrics, the proportion of prescriptions of inappropriate duration for adult patients within the same health system remained unchanged over the study period. Adult providers received comparable SSTI guidelines and generalized education on treatment of common infections including SSTI but no CDS tool. These findings suggest that timely EMR nudges are associated with improved outpatient antibiotic prescribing for duration for SSTI over guidelines and education alone.

Bacillary angiomatosis and cat scratch disease — antibiotic therapy and dosing are specified as follows: Azithromycin is recommended for cat scratch disease according to the following dosing protocol, with patients > 45 kg receiving 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg for 4 additional days and patients < 45 kg receiving 10 mg/kg on day 1 and 5 mg/kg for 4 more days (strong, moderate). For bacillary angiomatosis, erythromycin 500 mg qid or doxycycline 100 mg bid for 2 weeks to 2 months is recommended (strong, moderate), with evidence noting that cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis therapy has not been systematically examined, either erythromycin (500 mg qid) or doxycycline (100 mg bid) appears effective, the duration of initial therapy should be for 2 weeks to 2 months, relapse may warrant prolonged therapy (months) until immunocompetence returns, and HIV-infected patients may require lifelong treatment; trial data report a single, double-blind placebo-controlled study of 29 patients, 14 of whom received azithromycin, in which lymph node size regressed by 80% at 30 days more commonly in the azithromycin-treated patients (P = 0.02).

### Accounting for non-adherence to assigned antibiotic treatment duration for bloodstream infection (BALANCE): a post-hoc analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^116uopy8]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The BALANCE trial (NCT03005145) showed non-inferiority of 7-day versus 14-day antibiotic duration for treatment of patients with non-Staphylococcus aureus uncomplicated bloodstream infection (BSI). Non-adherence to assigned duration occurred in 728 (20.3%) of 3581 patients. This post-hoc analysis aimed to identify factors associated with this non-adherence, and evaluate its effect on validity of trial results.

Methods

We identified factors associated with non-adherence using generalised linear mixed models. Adherence was defined as receiving antibiotic duration up to 2 days longer or shorter than assigned duration, measured using a trial-specific adherence variable (assessed daily by research staff) and a separate variable capturing total antibiotic duration. We estimated the effect of antibiotic duration on the primary outcome of 90-day all-cause mortality, accounting for confounding introduced by non-adherence, in adjusted per-protocol and as-treated populations (using two different adherence definitions: first, using an adherence variable as assessed daily by site research staff, and second, using a total antibiotic duration variable recording the total cumulative antibiotic duration received), using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and instrumental variable methods. We compared these adjusted estimates to the primary effect estimates in BALANCE and used the same 4% non-inferiority margin to determine non-inferiority of 7-day duration.

Findings

3581 patients with complete outcome data were included. Non-adherence was higher in the 7-day group (432 [24.0%] of 1802 patients) versus 14-day group (296 [16.6%] of 1779). Disease severity, intra-abdominal and skin or soft tissue source of infection, persistent fever, and persistent bacteraemia were associated with treatment prolongation, whereas vascular catheter source and antimicrobial resistance were associated with treatment shortening. Adjusted risk differences for the primary outcome of 90-day all-cause mortality were similar to the primary results in BALANCE: (1) IPTW per-protocol analysis (definition one): -1.61% (95% CI -4.13 to 0.87); IPTW per-protocol analysis (definition two): -1.91% (95% CI -4.61 to 0.93); and IPTW as-treated analysis: -0.75% (95% CI -3.36 to 1.86); and (2) instrumental variable analysis (definition one): -2.68% (95% CI -6.65 to 1.29) and instrumental variable analysis (definition two): -2.80% (95% CI -5.98 to 0.37).

Interpretation

Non-adherence in BALANCE was significantly associated with a range of important prognostic factors, which might have introduced bias. Causal inference methods addressing this bias showed a consistent conclusion of non-inferiority, strengthening the validity of this finding. 7-day antibiotic duration should be the standard of care for patients with uncomplicated BSI.

Funding

The BALANCE trial was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Health Research Council of New Zealand, Australian National Medical Research Council, Physicians Services Incorporated Ontario, and Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care Innovation Fund.

### Outpatient antimicrobial stewardship targets for treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113oAFa3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to identify factors associated with long duration and/or non-first-line choice of treatment for pediatric skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Ambulatory encounter claims of Medicaid-insured children lacking chronic medical conditions treated for SSTI and/or animal bite injury in Ohio in 2014.

Methods

For all diagnoses, long treatment duration was defined as treatment > 7 days. Non-first-line choice of treatment for SSTI included treatment with 2 antimicrobials dispensed on the same calendar day or any treatment not listed in the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The adjusted odds of (1) long treatment duration and (2) non-first-line choice of treatment were calculated for patient age, prescriber type, and patient county of residence characteristics (ie, rural vs metropolitan area and poverty rate).

Results

Of 10,310 encounters with complete data available, long treatment duration was prescribed in 7,968 (77.3%). The most common duration of treatment prescribed was 10 days. A non-first-line choice was prescribed in 1,030 encounters (10%). Dispensation of 2 antimicrobials on the same calendar day was the most common reason for the non-first-line choice, and of these, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus a first-generation cephalosporin was the most common regimen. Compared to pediatricians, the adjusted odds ratio of long treatment duration was significantly lower for all other primary care specialties. Conversely, nonpediatricians were more likely to prescribe a non-first-line treatment choice. Patient residence in a high-poverty county increased the odds of both long duration and non-first-line choice of treatment.

Conclusions

Healthcare claims may be utilized to measure opportunities for first-line choice and/or shorter duration of treatment for SSTI.

### Should the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage status be used as a guide to treatment for skin and soft tissue infections? [^114ijTbQ]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous skin carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) leads frequently to empiric antibiotic MRSA coverage for skin & soft tissue infections.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of orthopaedic patients hospitalized at Geneva University Hospitals (MRSA prevalence; 30%); community-acquired MRSA excluded.

Results

A total of 378 skin and soft tissue infections in 346 patients were retrieved. Overall cure was achieved in 330 episodes (87%) after a median antibiotic administration of 15 days. Among all episodes, 102 revealed a positive current MRSA status (during 2 weeks preceding infection; 27%) and 70 (19%) were MRSA carriers in the past. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of current MRSA skin carriage to predict abscesses due to MRSA were 0.68, 0.77, 0.19, and 0.97, respectively. Fifty-four current MRSA carriers (54/102, 53%) and 30 past carriers (43%) were successfully treated with a non-MRSA antibiotic agent. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, anti-MRSA coverage (hazard ratio 1.2, 95%CI 0.5–2.8) and duration of antibiotic therapy (HR 1.0, 95%CI 0.96–1.02) did not influence treatment failure among patients with positive MRSA carriage.

Conclusions

Current or past HA-MRSA skin carriage poorly predicts the need for anti-MRSA coverage for the antibiotic treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in hospitalized orthopaedic patients.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### When to switch to an oral treatment and / or to discharge a patient with skin and soft tissue infections [^115uj1iH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin and soft tissue infections prevalence is increasing and represent a frequent cause of hospital admission. New guidelines have become available in order to better define these infections and their response to antimicrobial treatment. Gram-positive bacteria, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, remain the most frequently isolated pathogens in skin and soft tissue infections. To treat complicated forms and infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria, hospital admission and administration of intravenous antibiotics are often required, impacting on healthcare costs and patients' morbidity.

Recent Findings

New therapeutic options offer efficacy against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria as well as potential to favor early patients' discharge, including the possibility for intravenous to oral switch and infrequent drug administration because of prolonged drug half-life. Although data from real-world studies on new antimicrobials is awaited, clinicians need clear direction on how to optimize the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in order to avoid prolonged hospitalizations and extra costs. Early assessment of patient's clinical conditions and response to treatment appear useful in order to facilitate patients' discharge.

Summary

We have reported the evidence for early intravenous to oral switch and early hospital discharge for patients with skin and soft tissue infections. New therapeutic options that represent promising tools in promoting an optimized management of these infections have also been reviewed.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mRmpz]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Study selection and characteristics

Our search strategy identified 40,484 total references in six separate searches. A total of 24 trials met inclusion criteria, and there was excellent agreement between investigators (kappa statistic = 0.90). Only 11 out of 24 studies reported on allocation concealment, 13 out of 24 employed some form of blinding, 10 out of 24 used placebo, and 9 out of 24 had a low risk of bias on the basis of clear reporting of all three of these factors (Table 1). These trials consisted of 1 trial dedicated to bacteremia and 23 trials examining the syndromes most commonly causing critical care-associated bacteremia (0 in CRBSI, 3 in intra-abdominal infection, 6 in pyelonephritis, 1 in SSTI, and 13 in pneumonia) (Figure 1). Fifteen studies (63%) included patients with bacteremia, and 13 studies (54%) reported on the proportion of patients with bacteremia (1 out of 1 trial in bacteremia, 0 out of 0 in CRBSI, 2 out of 3 in intra-abdominal infection, 2 out of 6 in pyelonephritis, 0 out of 1 in SSTI, and 8 out of 13 in pneumonia).

### Rapidly progressive soft tissue infections [^11438Qaj]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are among the most common reasons for people to seek medical advice. They also represent one of the most common indications for antimicrobial therapy and account for approximately 7–10% of hospitalisations in North America. Although non-limb and non-life threatening infections may be treated on an out-patient basis with oral antibiotics, patients with more serious acute skin and soft tissue infections may require admission to hospital for management; this decision is especially true if the infection is rapidly progressive. We provide a concise overview of the differential diagnosis and approach to management of community-acquired rapidly progressive skin and soft tissue infections.

### Improving duration of antibiotics for skin and soft-tissue infections in pediatric urgent cares… [^113PMCEy]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

National guidelines recommend a 5- to 7-day course of antibiotics for most skin and soft-tissue infections. Our aim was to increase the percentage of pediatric patients receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for SSTIs in our pediatric urgent care clinics from 60% to 75% by December 31, 2021. PDSA cycle 3 provided project outcome and balancing measure updates to UCC providers at regular intervals. We created a monthly report of patients 90 days and older in UCCs with a final diagnosis of SSTIs. We used a Shewhart control chart to identify special cause variations. After completing our PDSA cycles, we found that the percentage of children receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for SSTIs exceeded 85%. The improvement was sustained over multiple months. There was no increase in the proportion of patients returning to the UCCs with an SSTI diagnosis within 14 days.

5–7 Skin and soft-tissue infections are the second most common diagnosis leading to pediatric antibiotic prescriptions in the outpatient setting, making them an important target for AS programs. 8 Although multiple studies support a short antibiotic course for SSTIs, 9–11 and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for common SSTIs, including impetigo, cellulitis, erysipelas, and abscesses 11, 12; more than 75% of patients receive an inappropriately long course of antibiotics. Measures The primary outcome was the percentage of patients receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for SSTIs. We determined duration based on the electronic prescription recorded at the time of discharge from the UCC visit. Our process measure was the percentage of electronic prescriptions originating from a prescription folder within the EHR.

The balancing measure was the number of patients returning to the UCC with a diagnosis of SSTI within 14 days of their initial visit. Discussion We used QI methodology to increase the percentage of patients receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for SSTIs in our pediatric UCCs from a baseline of 60% to 86%. We saw a narrowing of the control limits, implying less variability in the prescribing process. We sustained this improvement over multiple months, with no identified increase in returns to UCCs because of treatment failures.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112XpKn6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — incidence, classification, and timing: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common adverse events affecting hospitalized surgical patients, with an average incidence of SSI of 2.6%, accounting for 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSIs are divided into the categories of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ/space SSI. Superficial incisional SSIs involve only the subcutaneous space between the skin and underlying muscular fascia, occur within 30 days of the surgery, and are documented with at least 1 of the following: purulent incisional drainage; positive culture of aseptically obtained fluid or tissue from the superficial wound; local signs and symptoms of pain or tenderness, swelling, and erythema after the incision is opened by the surgeon; or diagnosis of SSI by the attending surgeon or physician. A deep incisional infection involves the deeper soft tissue and occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if a prosthesis was inserted, and an organ/space SSI has the same time constraints and evidence for infection and may involve any part of the anatomy other than the original surgical incision. Flat, erythematous skin changes can occur around or near a surgical incision during the first week without swelling or wound drainage, most resolve without any treatment, and the cause may relate to tape sensitivity or other local tissue insult not involving bacteria. Antibiotics begun immediately postoperatively or continued for long periods after the procedure do not prevent or cure this inflammation or infection; therefore, the suspicion of possible SSI does not justify use of antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and measures such as opening the wound. SSIs rarely occur during the first 48 hours after surgery and are almost always due to S. pyogenes or Clostridium species when they do; after 48 hours, SSI is a more common source of fever and, by 4 days after surgery, a fever is equally likely to be caused by an SSI or by another infection or other unknown sources.

### A European survey of antibiotic management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: current clinical opinion and practice [^117XshGh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Although the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) varies across Europe, healthcare-associated MRSA infections are common in many countries. Despite several national guidelines, the approach to treatment of MRSA infections varies across the continent, and there are multiple areas of management uncertainty for which there is little clinical evidence to guide practice. A faculty, convened to explore some of these areas, devised a survey that was used to compare the perspectives of infection specialists from across Europe on the management of MRSA infections with those of the faculty specialists. The survey instrument, a web-based questionnaire, was sent to 3840 registered delegates of the 19th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, held in April 2009. Of the 501 (13%) respondents to the survey, 84% were infection/microbiology specialists and 80% were from Europe. This article reports the survey results from European respondents, and shows a broad range of opinion and practice on a variety of issues pertaining to the management of minor and serious MRSA infections, such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections. The issues include changing epidemiology, when and when not to treat, choice of treatment, and duration and route of treatment. The survey identified areas where practice can be improved and where further research is needed, and also identified areas of pan-European consensus of opinion that could be applied to European guidelines for the management of MRSA infection.

### Novel techniques in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infection [^111FmuvM]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Global antibiotic resistance is compromising the management of soft tissue infection and Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection (ABSSI). This review describes a novel topical treatment Reactive Oxygen (RO) gel which could compliment and in some situations replace systemic antibiotics.

Recent Findings

A novel topical treatment RO gel could have an important role in treatment, infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship. RO is highly antimicrobial against Gram positive and negative bacteria, by slow release of oxygen radicals over a prolonged period of up to 72h. It prevents and breaks down biofilm and may support healing by cellular signalling. Much clinical investigation remains to be delivered on RO therapy but there seem few disadvantages in its use and early clinical evaluations are extremely promising.

Summary

Managing complicated skin and soft tissue infections require more than just antibiotic treatment. Soft tissue infection healing is often compromised by underlying comorbidities and pathology and increasingly the presence of highly antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. This has been highlighted particularly in war and trauma soft tissue infection. The fundamentals of soft tissue infection repair require early surgical drainage and debridement, correction of compromised physiology and treatment of underlying conditions and appropriate antimicrobial treatment. RO therapy could be an important advance.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117XWsQz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Glycopeptides have been for many years the microbiological agents of choice used in complicated Gram-positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft-tissue infections where aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended, such as linezolid and daptomycin. Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). It has the advantages of early intravenous-to-oral switch with the oral preparation having very high bioavailability and excellent tissue penetration.

In 2010, an open-label study compared oral or intravenous linezolid with intravenous vancomycin for treatment of cSSTIs caused by MRSA. Patients receiving linezolid had a significantly shorter length of stay and duration of intravenous therapy than those receiving vancomycin. Both agents were well tolerated. Adverse events were similar to each drug's established safety profile.

Recently, a Cochrane meta-analysis included all randomized controlled trials comparing linezolid with vancomycin in the treatment of SSTIs. Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical (risk ratio [RR] = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03–1.16) and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16). For infections caused by MRSA, linezolid was significantly more effective than vancomycin in clinical (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03–1.17) and microbiological cure rates (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.32).

The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin. Although inpatient treatment with linezolid cost more than inpatient treatment with vancomycin per day, the median length of hospital stay was 3 days shorter with linezolid.

### Optimal pediatric outpatient antibiotic prescribing [^115wAedF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Optimal Antibiotic Duration by Indication and Based on Standard vs Contemporary Duration

When evaluating optimal antibiotic duration outlined in the standard guidelines, 259 786 of 506 633 clinical encounters (51.3%) were prescribed optimally. After excluding all prescriptions for tier 3 diagnoses, optimal antibiotic duration increased to 259 786 of 309 099 encounters (84.0%). The indication with the most suboptimal duration of therapy was for gastroenteritis (optimal duration of ≤ 14 days based on the associated ICD-10-CM diagnosis code), with just 167 of 1864 clinical encounters (9.0%) prescribed optimally.

After excluding azithromycin prescriptions and restricting the clinical encounters to indications of AOM, animal bites, appendicitis, complicated and uncomplicated UTI, lymphadenitis, pneumonia, SSTI, and sinusitis, 183 818 encounters were used to evaluate optimal antibiotic duration based on contemporary duration. Of these clinical encounters, 27 973 (15.2%) aligned with contemporary duration. Specifically, the number of pneumonia encounters for optimal duration of therapy decreased from 5025 of 5694 (88.3%) under standard duration (10 days) to 257 of 4472 (5.7%) under contemporary (5 days) duration (Figure 3).

### Skin and soft tissue infection treatment and prevention practices by pediatric emergency medicine providers [^111DXnbr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) treatment and prevention practices among pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) clinicians in the context of current clinical practice guidelines and contemporary evidence.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional survey of PEM clinicians belonging to the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine Survey listserv. Four varying hypothetical clinical scenarios of children with SSTI were posed to respondents; subsequent items assessed SSTI treatment and prevention practices. Provider demographics were collected.

Results

Of 160 survey respondents, more than half stated that they would prescribe oral antibiotics for each clinical scenario, particularly for more complex presentations (small uncomplicated abscess, 51.8%; large uncomplicated abscess, 71.5%; recurrent abscess, 83.5%; febrile abscess, 90.3%; P < 0.001). Most commonly selected antibiotics were clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Across scenarios, more than 80% selected a duration of treatment 7 days or more. Of the 121 respondents who prescribe preventive measures, 85.1% recommend hygiene measures; 52.5% would prescribe decolonization with topical antibiotic ointment and 77.5% would recommend antiseptic body washes. Half of the respondents reported that their institution has standard guidance for SSTI management.

Conclusions

Although current evidence supports adjuvant antibiotics for all drained SSTI and decolonization for the index patient and household contacts, PEM clinicians do not consistently adhere to these recommendations. In light of these findings, development and implementation of institutional guidelines are necessary to aid PEM clinicians' point-of-care decision making and improving evidence-based practice.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^1125JJvB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113MEu1L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — surgical and antimicrobial management centers on urgent debridement, broad coverage for aerobes including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and targeted therapy for group A streptococcus. Surgical intervention is the primary therapeutic modality and is indicated when infection is confirmed or suspected, and most patients should return to the operating room 24–36 hours after the first debridement and then daily until no further debridement is needed. In the absence of definitive trials, antimicrobial therapy should continue until further debridement is unnecessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has been absent for 48–72 hours. For polymicrobial infections, treatment should cover both aerobes, including MRSA, and anaerobes, using vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin combined with one of piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and ertapenem), ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, with coverage modified once microbiology is known. Necrotizing fasciitis and/or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group A streptococcus should be treated with both clindamycin and penicillin; clindamycin suppresses streptococcal toxin and cytokine production and observational studies suggest greater efficacy than β-lactams. Reported macrolide resistance in group A streptococci is < 5.0% in the United States, 8.2% in Germany, and 18.3% in Spain, and no resistance to clindamycin was found from invasive strains in Chicago.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^115gqSfK]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

Management of recurrent SSTIs includes individuation of predisposing conditions and treatment whenever possible. Nonpharmacological interventions include weight and diabetes control, and patient education regarding skin care.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated only for recurring nonpurulent SSTIs (i.e. cellulitis and erysipelas), for patients with more than two episodes of recurrence per year. Prophylaxis targets beta-haemolytic Streptococci and drugs of choice are low dose oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, or erythromycin in case of penicillin allergy.

Recently, a Cochrane analysis reviewed the five clinical trials designed to set utility of antibiotic prophylaxis and found a reduction in recurrence by 69% (risk ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.13–0.72), with an estimated number needed to treat (NNT) of six patients with nonpurulent SSTI to prevent a recurrence.

Duration of prophylaxis is not clearly defined, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, but usually continued for at least 6 months. Since the protective effect is lost after discontinuation, a personalized approach is suggested, based on frequency of recurrence and persistence of risk factors.

The counterpart of antibiotic prophylaxis is development of antimicrobial resistance, pharmacological side effects and risk of Clostridioides difficile infection. In particular, high rates of macrolide resistance are already described in Europe for Streptococcus spp. and cross resistance between macrolide and clindamycin is largely documented.

With these premises, the suggested approach is to target prophylaxis only for high-risk patients, selected by clinical scores, reducing antibiotics misuse.

In case of recurrent purulent infections and abscesses associated with pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa and foreign bodies, surgical debridement and cultures should be performed. After incision and drainage, 7 days of antibiotic course showed higher curative rate and less recurrences than surgery alone, even for noncomplicated abscesses.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1152eBNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Treatment challenges in the management of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections [^115yRNDe]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) are a significant clinical problem, partially owing to increasing resistance of infecting bacteria to current antibiotic therapies. Two case studies that illustrate complications that can arise when treating cSSTIs are outlined, and methods that can be used to address the problem and the final treatment outcome are detailed. Although these are specific examples, intolerance of and bacterial resistance to current antibacterial therapies are problems that are often seen in the clinical setting and must be addressed appropriately. The use of new antibiotic agents is one potential solution to these problems, and some of these agents are highlighted. Selecting the most appropriate therapy for an infection is often crucial for patient welfare. This article presents some potential approaches to the treatment of cSSTIs.

### Development and validation of the baseline recurrence risk in cellulitis (BRRISC) score [^112YD7cv]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is the commonest form of non-purulent skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). In the United States (US), the overall incidence of SSTIs increased by 24% from 2000–2012, with the incidence in older adults almost doubling and associated healthcare costs tripling to $15 billion. While most patients with cellulitis respond well to antibiotics and mortality rates remain low, a substantial proportion (13–47%) experience recurrence of the infection within a year.,

Recommended treatment durations vary from 5–7 days, with advice to extend treatment if clinical improvement is not seen. However, the evidence base for antibiotic duration is weak. A meta-analysis of eight trials examining clinical response rates between patients with cellulitis treated with shorter versus longer antibiotic durations found no evidence of a difference between groups. However, agents in the shorter arms were often longer acting agents (e.g. azithromycin) or not commonly used for cellulitis in practice (e.g. quinolones), most patients had mild disease, and follow up did not extend beyond 30 days. In practice, > 75% of patients receive > 5 days of therapy, exceeding 14 days in almost one third of patients in one study.

The 'DANCE' trial overcame some of these limitations, comparing 6 versus 12 days of flucloxacillin for hospitalised patients with cellulitis with follow up to 90 days. While the trial was underpowered for the primary outcome of cure within 14 days, more recurrences occurred in the short treatment group by day 90 (24% versus 6%, p = 0.045). Although 76% of patients achieved a successful clinical outcome with short duration therapy, this highlights the potential for prolonged therapy after immediate clinical response to reduce risk of recurrence in some patients.

Observational studies which generally include more acutely unwell and comorbid populations than those recruited to clinical trials, demonstrate that patient susceptibility, illness severity and early clinical response predict clinical outcomes in cellulitis. Two small, retrospective studies have previously developed risk scores to identify patients at high risk for recurrent cellulitis but neither has been successfully externally validated.

Our primary objective was to develop and temporally validate a risk score to predict those at highest risk of cellulitis recurrence. A secondary objective was to describe antibiotic treatment for this population.

Intravenous options:
Vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q12h
Teicoplanin LD 12 mg/kg IV q12h for 3 doses, then 6 mg/kg q12h
Tigecycline 100 mg IV as a single dose, then 50 mg IV q12h

Dalbavancin 1000 mg once followed by 500 mg after 1 week or 1500 mg one dose
Tedizolid 200 mg q24h

The decision to use intravenous or oral agents has been debated. Currently, oral therapy is recommended for mild infections and intravenous therapy for severe infections. Moderate infections may be treated via the oral route, or with one to two intravenous doses and then transitioning to oral therapy. For patients with severe infections who are able to tolerate oral therapy and in whom clinical improvement has been documented, the goal should be to transition to the oral route as soon as possible. There is evidence to suggest that this approach positively impacts length of stay as well.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116M9Dcd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Is a multidisciplinary approach to necrotizing infections mandatory?

A multidisciplinary team is mandatory for the management of NSTIs. Depending on the time line, various specialties are involved. Specific attention should be given to the long-term management of these patients (recommendation 1C).

NSTIs rank among one of the more difficult disease processes encountered by physicians. The most critical factors for reducing mortality in NSTIs are early recognition and urgent operative debridement. Initial treatment of patients with necrotizing infections should always require coordination between the surgeons, intensivists, and infectious disease specialist. Treatment consists of radical debridement associated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and hemodynamic support.

Moreover, the magnitude of necrotic tissues that need to be radically debrided, although required to save the patient's life, often create unique and difficult challenges in terms of wound care, preservation of function, reconstruction, and cosmesis. These problems require time and a multidisciplinary approach. After an extended hospitalization, multiple dressing changes, and surgical procedures, the survivor of NSTI faces months of continued physical therapy to regain functional independence, whenever possible. Rehabilitation is an essential and integral component of recovery.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: a randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^117CGQ5R]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Virtually all infections of the foot in persons with diabetes involve the soft tissues. These soft tissue diabetic foot infections (ST-DFI) usually begin with superficial invasion of an ulcer or wound, but may progress contiguously to cellulitis, phlegmon, abscess, fasciitis, or osteomyelitis. – The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, which is considerably shorter than for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), is largely based on clinical experience. While there are some data concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy of non-amputated DFO, few studies have investigated the optimal duration for ST-DFI not accompanied by DFO. Many experts in the field recommend administering systemic antibiotic therapy for 1 to 3 weeks, with appropriate tissue debridement as needed. – The most recent recommendations of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot; state 1–2 weeks is adequate for most ST-DFIs. The recommendations of the 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are for 2–3 for moderate to severe ST-DFI (point 24 of recommendations), but urge decisions be based on the individual clinical response of therapy. Various reviews report antibiotic regimens for ST-DFI of relatively short (7–14 days)or relatively long durations (14–28 days). The results of our own retrospective study of 463 ST-DFIs did not define an optimal duration antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, but suggested that our current practice (median of 18 days for ST-DFI) might be too long. In that retrospective study, we failed to determine any minimal threshold for systemic antibiotics in ST-DFIs. The median duration of antimicrobial administration of 18 days statistically yielded to be too long regarding remission, because treatment durations as short as 7–10 days seemed to be enough, whenever the clinical evolution was favorable. Another study of patients with various types of cellulitis found that clinical remission rates were similar for those treated with 7 days of systemic antibiotic therapy compared to those who received longer treatment durations.

### A national quality improvement collaborative to improve antibiotic use in pediatric infections [^113VnXuX]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Nearly 25% of antibiotics prescribed to children are inappropriate or unnecessary, subjecting patients to avoidable adverse medication effects and cost.

Methods

We conducted a quality improvement initiative across 118 hospitals participating in the American Academy of Pediatrics Value in Inpatient Pediatrics Network 2020 to 2022. We aimed to increase the proportion of children receiving appropriate: (1) empirical, (2) definitive, and (3) duration of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections to ≥ 85% by Jan 1, 2022. Sites reviewed encounters of children > 60 days old evaluated in the emergency department or hospital. Interventions included monthly audit with feedback, educational webinars, peer coaching, order sets, and a mobile app containing site-specific, antibiogram-based treatment recommendations. Sites submitted 18 months of baseline, 2-months washout, and 10 months intervention data. We performed interrupted time series (analyses for each measure.

Results

Sites reviewed 43916 encounters (30799 preintervention, 13117 post). Overall median [interquartile range] adherence to empirical, definitive, and duration of antibiotic therapy was 67% [65% to 70%]; 74% [72% to 75%] and 61% [58% to 65%], respectively at baseline and was 72% [71% to 72%]; 79% [79% to 80%] and 71% [69% to 73%], respectively, during the intervention period. Interrupted time series revealed a 13% (95% confidence interval: 1% to 26%) intercept change at intervention for empirical therapy and a 1.1% (95% confidence interval: 0.4% to 1.9%) monthly increase in adherence per month for antibiotic duration above baseline rates. Balancing measures of care escalation and revisit or readmission did not increase.

Conclusions

This multisite collaborative increased appropriate antibiotic use for community-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infection among diverse hospitals.

Source control, achieved through early and complete debridement, remains the cornerstone of NSTI treatment. Antimicrobial therapy, providing broad-spectrum coverage and considering specific pathogens, serves as a crucial adjunct to source control. Early and aggressive antibiotic therapy is crucial and should be initiated concomitantly with surgical evaluation and treatment. Prompt blood cultures and deep tissue, abscess, or operative cultures aid in tailoring antibiotic therapy based on culture results. Empiric therapy should encompass broad-spectrum coverage, considering the polymicrobial nature of infections. This includes an MRSA-active agent and a broad-spectrum agent against gram-negative pathogens, along with anaerobic activity. Considerations such as the use of tigecycline in patients previously colonized with resistant bacteria and avoiding empiric use of certain agents in areas with high resistance prevalence are crucial. While not essential empirically, antifungal therapy may be added upon evidence of fungal elements in cultures. Tailoring therapy based on culture results, with consideration for discontinuation of MRSA-active agents guided by negative predictive value, is emphasized. The duration of therapy, not extensively studied, is suggested to continue for a minimum of 48–72 h after resolution of fever, systemic signs, and hemodynamic stabilization. IDSA practice guidelines for skin and soft tissue infections provide additional details on antibiotic therapy for NSTI.

### Meta-analysis of trials evaluating parenteral antimicrobial therapy for skin and soft tissue infections [^113BUpgQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Many trials have been carried out to determine the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in treating skin and soft tissue infections. The results of these studies are often utilized to make determinations about the use of these antimicrobials against other types of infections. Despite the importance of these trials in determining clinical care, we hypothesized that many of these studies failed to include a variety of infections of significant enough severity to effectively draw objective conclusions about antimicrobial efficacy.

Methods

We conducted a modified PubMed search to identify studies of antimicrobial agents in treating soft tissue infections that were published from 1998 through 2008. We then evaluated these trials for specific recommended study criteria, which were based on published US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for the conduct of trials of antimicrobials for soft tissue infection.

Results

Seventeen studies were identified for inclusion in the trial. Upon review, only 30% of trials required both local and systemic signs of infection for inclusion in the trial. One trial stratified results on the basis of operative intervention, less than half reported patient comorbidities, and only 53% provided a specific definition for "cure".

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis of current trials evaluating antimicrobial therapy for skin and soft tissue infections revealed substantial shortcomings in the design of most of these trials. These data provide evidence for the importance of designing specialist panels to objectively evaluate studies and photographs of included infections to ensure that conclusions drawn from these trials concerning clinical practice are justified.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117V2ULq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

Patients receiving linezolid had a significantly shorter length of stay and duration of intravenous therapy than patients receiving vancomycin. Both agents were well tolerated. Adverse events were similar to each drug's established safety profile.

Recently a Cochrane meta-analysis including all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing linezolid with vancomycin in the treatment of SSTIs.

Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16) and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16). For those infections due to MRSA, linezolid was significantly more effective than vancomycin in clinical (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.32).

The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin. Although inpatient treatment with linezolid cost more than inpatient treatment with vancomycin per day, the median length of hospital stay was three days shorter with linezolid.

Tigecycline has a broader range of activity, covering infections caused not only by resistant Gram-positive bacteria but also by many resistant Gram-negative organisms including those producing extended spectrum β-lactamases. It is only available as an intravenous formulation.

An interesting study evaluated the penetration of tigecycline into soft tissues in patients with cSSTIs requiring surgical intervention was published in 2011.

Tissue and blood samples were obtained one to six days (mean 2.5 days) after initiation of tigecycline treatment. The authors found higher concentrations of tigecycline in soft tissue than in the serum at the same time point.

### Antibiotic prescribing practices in a multicenter cohort of patients hospitalized for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection [^1177NgQH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Hospitalizations for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) are common. Optimizing antibiotic use for ABSSSIs requires an understanding of current management. The objective of this study was to evaluate antibiotic prescribing practices and factors affecting prescribing in a diverse group of hospitals.

Design

Multicenter, retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Seven community and academic hospitals.

Methods

Children and adults hospitalized between June 2010 and May 2012 for cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess were eligible. The primary endpoint was a composite of 2 prescribing practices representing potentially avoidable antibiotic exposure: (1) use of antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria or (2) treatment duration greater than 10 days.

Results

A total of 533 cases were included: 320 with nonpurulent cellulitis, 44 with wound infection or purulent cellulitis, and 169 with abscess. Of 492 cases with complete prescribing data, the primary endpoint occurred in 394 (80%) cases and varied significantly across hospitals (64%-97%; P < .001). By logistic regression, independent predictors of the primary endpoint included wound infection or purulent cellulitis (odds ratio [OR], 5.12 [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.46–17.88), head or neck involvement (OR, 2.83 [95% CI, 1.17–6.82]), adult cases (OR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.18–4.11]), and admission to a community hospital (OR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.05–3.44]).

Conclusions

Among patients hospitalized for ABSSSI, use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity or treatment courses longer than 10 days were common. There may be substantial opportunity to reduce antibiotic exposure through shorter courses of therapy targeting gram-positive bacteria.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111eVYNk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

### Improving empiric antibiotic selection for patients hospitalized with skin and soft tissue infection: the INSPIRE 3 skin and soft tissue randomized clinical trial [^1157vWmV]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics are routinely prescribed for patients hospitalized with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) despite low likelihoods of infection with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).

Objective

To evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts presenting patient-specific and pathogen-specific MDRO infection risk estimates could reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for noncritically ill patients admitted with SSTI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cluster randomized clinical trial included 92 hospitals and assessed the effect of an antibiotic stewardship bundle that included CPOE prompts vs routine stewardship on antibiotic selection during the first 3 hospital days (empiric period) in noncritically ill adults hospitalized with SSTI. The trial population included adults 18 years and older treated with empiric antibiotics for SSTI in non-intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Data were collected from January 2019 to December 2023.

Interventions

CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients prescribed extended-spectrum antibiotics during the empiric period when absolute risk of MDRO SSTI was estimated to be less than 10%, coupled with feedback and education.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy (summed number of different extended-spectrum antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas and/or MDR gram-negative bacteria received per patient each calendar day). The secondary outcome was antipseudomonal days of therapy. Safety outcomes included days to ICU transfer and hospital length of stay. Outcomes compared differences between baseline and intervention periods across strategies.

Results

Among 118 562 patients admitted with SSTI at 92 hospitals, 67 033 (56.7%) were male and the mean (SD) age was 58.0 (17.5) years. A total of 57 837 patients were included in the baseline period and 60 725 in the intervention period. Receipt of any empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic during the baseline and intervention periods was 57.0% (16 855 of 29 595) and 56.0% (17 534 of 31 337), respectively, for the routine stewardship group compared with 55.4% (15 650 of 28 242) and 43.0% (12 647 of 29 388), respectively, for the CPOE group. Empiric extended-spectrum days of therapy per 1000 empiric days targeting Pseudomonas and/or MDR gram-negative pathogens was 511.5 during the baseline period and 488.7 during the intervention period in the routine stewardship group and was 496.2 and 359.1, respectively, in the CPOE bundle group (rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.67–0.79; P < .001). There was no evidence of inferiority in the CPOE bundle group for mean (SD) hospital length of stay (routine stewardship, 6.5 [3.8] days; CPOE bundle, 6.4 [3.8] days) and days to ICU transfer (routine stewardship, 6.3 [3.2] days; CPOE bundle, 6.3 [3.1] days).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum empiric antibiotics for low-risk patients hospitalized with SSTI coupled with education and feedback significantly reduced use of extended-spectrum antibiotics without increasing admissions to ICUs or hospital length of stay.

Trial Registration

### Variation in paediatric hospital antibiotic guidelines in Europe [^112RxSk3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the availability and source of guidelines for common infections in European paediatric hospitals and determine their content and characteristics.

Design

Participating hospitals completed an online questionnaire on the availability and characteristics of antibiotic prescribing guidelines and on empirical antibiotic treatment including duration of therapy for 5 common infection syndromes: respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue, osteoarticular and sepsis in neonates and children.

Results

84 hospitals from 19 European countries participated in the survey of which 74 confirmed the existence of guidelines. Complete guidelines (existing guidelines for all requested infection syndromes) were reported by 20% of hospitals and the majority (71%) used a range of different sources. Guidelines most commonly available were those for urinary tract infection (UTI) (74%), neonatal sepsis (71%) and sepsis in children (65%). Penicillin and amoxicillin were the antibiotics most commonly recommended for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (up to 76%), cephalosporin for UTI (up to 50%) and for skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) and bone infection (20% and 30%, respectively). Antistaphylococcal penicillins were recommended for SSTIs and bone infections in 43% and 36%, respectively. Recommendations for neonatal sepsis included 20 different antibiotic combinations. Duration of therapy guidelines was mostly available for RTI and UTI (82%). A third of hospitals with guidelines for sepsis provided recommendations for length of therapy.

Conclusions

Comprehensive antibiotic guideline recommendations are generally lacking from European paediatric hospitals. We documented multiple antibiotics and combinations for most infections. Considerable improvement in the quality of guidelines and their evidence base is required, linking empirical therapy to resistance rates.

### Editorial commentary: duration of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a question with many answers [^117LHr5C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Emergency room visits and hospital admissions for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) have been increasing, with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cultured from the site of infection. By recent estimates, approximately 7% of patients in US hospitals are colonized with MRSA. This includes an increase in colonization with community-acquired strains commonly associated with SSTIs.

According to the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the duration of colonization remains an unresolved issue. Data have shown that individuals remain at increased risk of MRSA infection and death until they are no longer colonized. However, there is a wide range of estimates for the median time to clearance, ranging from 7 to 9 months to well beyond a year. Thus, many US hospitals recommend waiting 6 months or more prior to screening for clearance of MRSA colonization.

In this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, the study by Cluzet et al adds to the debate on the duration of MRSA colonization, looking at clearance following diagnosis of an SSTI with a positive MRSA culture. In this longitudinal sampling study, MRSA surveillance cultures were collected from nares, axilla, and groin every 2 weeks for up to 6 months on both index cases and their household members. The first finding of interest was a median duration of MRSA colonization of only 21 days, far less than what has been noted in prior studies. I will point out, however, that 92% of the index cases received a systemic anti-MRSA antibiotic as treatment for their SSTI, and around 20% were prescribed topical nasal mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine/bleach baths in the 2 weeks following SSTI diagnosis. The second finding of interest was that SSTI treatment with clindamycin was associated with earlier clearance of MRSA colonization. To my knowledge, this is the first time that this has been suggested in the literature.
