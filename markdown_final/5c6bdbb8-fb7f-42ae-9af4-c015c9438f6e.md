## Question

In a 10-year-old with anxiety and ADHD who is experiencing mouth twitching and excessive appetite suppression on Adderall XR 10 mg, would it be appropriate to stop and switch to atomoxetine or guanfacine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it's appropriate to stop Adderall XR 10 mg and switch to atomoxetine or guanfacine for a 10-year-old with ADHD and comorbid anxiety who developed a mouth twitching tic and marked appetite suppression, and how to implement that change safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current adverse effects and whether they justify discontinuing the stimulant. Then, I should review how comorbid anxiety influences medication selection. Next, I will compare atomoxetine versus guanfacine ER for ADHD with tics and anxiety, including efficacy, onset, side effects, and monitoring. After that, I need to confirm pediatric dosing and safety monitoring. Finally, I will formulate a practical, stepwise switching plan and follow-up strategy with appropriate behavioral supports.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and the rationale to change therapy. The child is experiencing a motor tic (mouth twitching) and significant appetite suppression on an amphetamine stimulant, which indicates poor tolerability and provides a sound reason to discontinue or switch therapy rather than simply persisting or escalating the dose, particularly given that stimulants can precipitate or exacerbate tics in some patients and commonly suppress appetite in pediatric populations [^113SRexJ] [^1145xUKk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anxiety yet; I should verify the comorbidity considerations. ADHD co-occurs with anxiety in roughly 25–50% of children, stimulants are often still tolerated, but anxiety can worsen in a subset, and atomoxetine has demonstrated benefit and tolerability in ADHD with comorbid anxiety; in addition, CBT remains an important adjunct for anxiety symptoms once ADHD is addressed, so I need to consider both pharmacologic and psychosocial strategies in the plan [^1177nf8h] [^113V75nV].

> Now, I will examine atomoxetine as an option. Let me think through pros and cons carefully. Pros include evidence of efficacy in pediatric ADHD with comorbid anxiety and the advantage of being a noncontrolled medication with once-daily or twice-daily dosing options; cons include a delayed onset of benefit typically over several weeks and a bimodal response distribution where about 47% show robust improvement and approximately 40% are nonresponders by 6–9 weeks, plus an increased risk of headache relative to placebo in meta-analytic data, and importantly, no specific benefit for tics is expected, which is salient here given the stimulant-induced motor tic [^116sqi2g] [^1177nf8h] [^111NPK3g] [^11556ij4].

> Next, I should review guanfacine ER. Guanfacine ER is FDA-approved for pediatric ADHD as monotherapy in ages 6–17 years, has a pharmacologic mechanism as an alpha-2A adrenergic agonist modulating prefrontal cortical networks, and can directly help tic severity; it often reduces hyperarousal that may overlap with anxiety, does not typically suppress appetite, but requires careful blood pressure and heart rate monitoring with a start-low, go-slow titration to mitigate sedation and hypotension; wait, I initially thought multiple daily dosing might be needed, but I should correct that — guanfacine ER is intended for once-daily dosing, so multiple daily dosing is not necessary with the extended-release formulation [^114TQ31z] [^113SRexJ] [^1121hADU].

> Hold on, I should verify an evidence-informed decision framework for ADHD with tics. Guidance suggests that if a stimulant is effective but worsens tics, adding guanfacine is reasonable; however, if the stimulant is only partially effective or poorly tolerated, switching to guanfacine monotherapy should be considered, which fits this case given the intolerable tic and appetite suppression, so a switch rather than augmentation is favored here [^113SRexJ].

> I need to check age-appropriate dosing and monitoring details for both nonstimulants to ensure safety. For guanfacine ER, I should start 1 mg once daily and titrate by 1 mg at weekly intervals toward a target of approximately 0.05–0.12 mg/kg/day, with baseline and serial monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate during titration to reduce risks of hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation; for atomoxetine in children, a commonly used approach is to start near 0.5 mg/kg/day and titrate over several weeks toward about 1.2 mg/kg/day if tolerated, recognizing the delayed onset and need for close follow-up; growth parameters and overall tolerability should be monitored regularly for either option, and behavioral interventions should proceed in parallel [^114TQ31z] [^1121hADU] [^113Rw9zv] [^113V75nV].

> Let me weigh the two options against the specifics of this case before finalizing. Because the index problems are a stimulant-emergent motor tic and significant appetite suppression, guanfacine ER aligns better with the primary adverse effect profile, provides ADHD efficacy as monotherapy, offers potential tic reduction, and is less likely to further suppress appetite, whereas atomoxetine would be reasonable if anxiety predominance were the main driver or if families preferred a non-sedating option despite the lack of tic benefit; I should also acknowledge that atomoxetine's delayed onset may be less attractive given the need to discontinue the problematic stimulant now [^114TQ31z] [^113SRexJ] [^1177nf8h].

> I should now outline a precise implementation plan and double-check safety steps. Discontinue Adderall XR; a taper is not strictly required for stimulants, but a brief 3–5 day taper can be considered to minimize rebound irritability or appetite changes; initiate guanfacine ER 1 mg once nightly to mitigate early sedation, increase by 1 mg each week toward a weight-based target of roughly 0.05–0.12 mg/kg/day, monitor BP and HR weekly during titration and at each follow-up thereafter, track weight and height monthly early on, and add CBT for anxiety if residual anxiety persists after ADHD stabilization; reassess at 6–8 weeks for ADHD symptom control, tic reduction, and anxiety response, adjusting the plan as needed based on efficacy and tolerability [^1121hADU] [^114TQ31z] [^113V75nV].

> In summary, I recommend switching to guanfacine ER monotherapy in this 10-year-old given the stimulant-associated tic and appetite suppression, with careful titration and cardiovascular monitoring, and concurrent behavioral interventions; atomoxetine remains a viable alternative if anxiety symptoms are substantially more impairing than tics or if guanfacine is contraindicated or not tolerated, but given the tic prominence and appetite concerns here, guanfacine ER is the better initial switch [^113SRexJ] [^114TQ31z] [^1177nf8h].

Yes, discontinuing Adderall XR is appropriate in a 10-year-old with ADHD and anxiety who develops **mouth twitching** and **excessive appetite suppression** [^1145xUKk]. These are **concerning stimulant side effects**, and continuing the medication risks worsening tics [^113SRexJ] and anxiety. Atomoxetine or **guanfacine** are **suitable alternatives**: atomoxetine is effective for ADHD and may help anxiety [^1177nf8h], while **guanfacine** is useful for ADHD with tics or anxiety [^113SRexJ] but can cause sedation and hypotension [^1121hADU] [^114TQ31z]. Slow titration with close monitoring is recommended [^1145xUKk], and behavioral therapy should be included [^113V75nV].

## Clinical significance of mouth twitching and appetite suppression

Mouth twitching may indicate emerging **tics** or **neuromuscular side effects**, which stimulants can precipitate or worsen, especially in children with anxiety or a predisposition to tics. Appetite suppression is common with stimulants, but **excessive suppression** can **impair growth and nutrition**, warranting prompt intervention [^115BuZ5J] [^111orm8m].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

AAP guidelines advise titrating to maximum benefit with tolerable side effects; **intolerable effects** warrant **dose reduction, discontinuation, or switching** [^1145xUKk] [^111orm8m]. For **comorbid anxiety**, stimulants can exacerbate anxiety, so consider non-stimulants when anxiety is significant or side effects are problematic [^1177nf8h] [^116XYQVH].

---

## Alternative medications: atomoxetine and guanfacine

### Atomoxetine

- **Mechanism**: Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [^11556ij4].

- **Efficacy**: Effective for ADHD [^116sqi2g] and may improve anxiety symptoms [^1177nf8h] [^111SrU75].

- **Side effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, mood changes, rare suicidal ideation; monitor closely [^11556ij4].

- **Onset**: 2–4 weeks for initial response; 6–8 weeks for full effect [^116sqi2g].

---

### Guanfacine

- **Mechanism**: Alpha-2A adrenergic agonist [^114TQ31z].

- **Efficacy**: Effective for ADHD, especially with tics or anxiety; reduces hyperactivity/impulsivity and improves emotional regulation [^113SRexJ].

- **Side effects**: Sedation, hypotension, bradycardia, headache; monitor blood pressure and heart rate [^114TQ31z] [^116aiznU].

- **Onset**: 1–2 weeks for initial response; 4–6 weeks for full effect.

---

## Clinical considerations for switching medications

- **Tapering**: Gradually taper Adderall XR to avoid withdrawal or rebound symptoms.

- **Washout**: Consider a brief washout before starting the new medication.

- **Titration**: Start low and titrate slowly to minimize side effects [^1121hADU] [^1145xUKk].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess ADHD and anxiety symptoms, side effects, growth, and cardiovascular parameters [^111orm8m] [^1113HZak].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Behavioral therapy, including **parent training** [^113V75nV] and **CBT**, is recommended alongside medication, especially with comorbid anxiety [^1177nf8h] [^111uhjrX]. School accommodations should include **classroom strategies** to support attention and reduce anxiety.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's side effects and comorbid anxiety, **it is appropriate to stop Adderall XR and switch to atomoxetine or guanfacine**. Atomoxetine is preferred if anxiety is prominent; guanfacine is preferred if tics are present or sedation would be beneficial. Titrate slowly with close monitoring, and include behavioral therapy.

### Treating ADHD and comorbid anxiety in children: A guide for clinical practice [^1177nf8h]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently comorbid with anxiety disorders, with rates as high as 25% to 50% in children and adolescents. Despite various treatment options for ADHD symptoms, limited research addresses treatment in the context of comorbidity. This article seeks to provide a review of the evidence regarding treatment of this comorbid population. Distinct emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms have been observed in this population, suggesting a need for tailored treatment.

Despite common concerns about anxiety exacerbation, stimulant medications demonstrate good tolerability and a positive response in addressing symptoms. Atomoxetine has also demonstrated some benefit and good tolerability for treating this comorbid population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used as adjunctive treatment for anxiety but require careful monitoring of side effects.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an important treatment to improve anxiety symptoms in the absence of significant ADHD symptoms. Psychosocial interventions are also essential to improve outcomes.

- **Dosing**: Failing to 'start low and go slow' when initiating medication can lead to premature discontinuation, as adverse effects often occur before therapeutic benefits are seen. This can be avoided by gradual titration, starting low and going slow. For example, initial syncope due to postural hypotension can be related to the initiation of clonidine, which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, and guanfacine, which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors. Sedation is potentially related to all medications for tics. These adverse effects are often encountered if the initial dose is too high. However, with careful low-dose initiation and slow titration, these adverse effects are much less likely to occur. Suggested initial doses are 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg of guanfacine, and 0.5–1 mg of aripiprazole once daily, with titrations using a weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly approach according to the response. The initial dose and the titration speed could differ according to body weight, age, and other characteristics of the patient.

- **Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose**: When a medication has been initiated, it is essential to titrate to recommended therapeutic doses. For clonidine, this means an average daily dose of 3–5 mcg/kg; for aripiprazole, around 5–10 mg daily; and for guanfacine, between 1 and 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents, according to weight. Often, young people are sub-optimally medicated to reduce potential side effects.

Tics/Tourette syndrome: Is it best to replace methylphenidate with guanfacine or use it as an adjunct when ADHD is present but tics require treatment?

As both methylphenidate and guanfacine are licensed for the treatment of ADHD, both can be helpful and effective treatments for this condition; however, the co-occurrence of tics is unlikely to be treated adequately using methylphenidate. While treating ADHD with methylphenidate can have beneficial effects on associated symptoms that increase tics (such as frustration, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation), there does not appear to be a direct effect on tics.

The clinical decision whether to switch to guanfacine or to augment methylphenidate with guanfacine is based on several factors:

- **Relative severity of ADHD and tic symptoms**: Consider the prominence of each symptom group.
- **Effectiveness of methylphenidate for ADHD symptoms**: Determine if methylphenidate effectively manages the ADHD symptoms.
- **Influence of methylphenidate on tics**: Assess whether methylphenidate seems to worsen tics.

If methylphenidate is already effective in treating ADHD symptoms but tics worsen or require treatment, guanfacine may be added. In cases of mild to moderate ADHD symptoms with co-existing tics, or if methylphenidate is only partially effective or poorly tolerated, discontinuing methylphenidate and switching to guanfacine may be considered. If tics improve with guanfacine alone but ADHD worsens, then methylphenidate may be restarted.

In cases of mild-to-moderate ADHD with co-existing tics where both require treatment, there is an argument to suggest that guanfacine monotherapy should be considered as the first-line medication choice rather than methylphenidate.

Regarding the medical management for stimulant use disorder, and more specifically the management of hyperadrenergic symptoms, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend administering GABAergic agents, such as benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, or propofol, in patients experiencing a stimulant-induced hyperadrenergic state. Benzodiazepines are considered the first-line choice.

### Clinical responses to atomoxetine in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: The Integrated Data Exploratory Analysis (IDEA) study [^116sqi2g]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical experience suggests that some, but not all, patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are highly responsive to the nonstimulant atomoxetine. We conducted a retrospective analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to identify potential baseline (moderator) and on-treatment (mediator) predictors of responses.

Data from six U.S. RCTs among patients aged 6 to 18 years were pooled (N = 1,069; subjects treated with atomoxetine, n = 618). Subjects were categorized as much improved (≥ 40% decrease in ADHD Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator Administered and Scored total score), minimally improved (25%- < 40% decline), or nonresponders (< 25% decrease). Logistic regression, analyses of variance, and repeated-measures analyses were used to explore associations between baseline and on-treatment variables, achieving a much-improved response at trial endpoint (6–9 weeks).

Forty-seven percent of patients showed a much-improved clinical response, and 40% did not respond. Only 13% of the patients had a minimal response. No baseline characteristics predicted achieving a much-improved clinical response. The only predictor of achieving this response was being at least minimally improved by treatment week 4 (sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 72%, positive predictive value = 75%, and negative predictive value = 79%).

Clinical response to atomoxetine was bimodal, with most subjects being either responders who were much improved or nonresponders. There were no demographic or clinical predictors of response.

### Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and risk for non-affective psychotic disorder: The role of ADHD medication and comorbidity, and sibling comparison [^1124Bm6F]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder in childhood. It is unclear whether ADHD increases the risk of non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD). The study included a matched cohort, drawn from all individuals born in Sweden between 1987–1991 (n = 548,852). ADHD was defined based on ICD diagnosis and/or prescription of ADHD medication.

- **Stimulant and non-stimulant usage**: Usage duration was categorized into < 1 year, 1–2 years, and ≥ 2 years.

- **Odds ratio calculations**: We calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NAPD, adjusted for confounders, comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and substance abuse. ADHD cases were also compared to their unaffected full siblings.

The study analyzed 18,139 ADHD cases and 72,437 sex and birth year matched controls. NAPD was more common in cases than controls (2.7% and 0.4%, respectively). After adjustment for confounders, ADHD cases had a markedly high risk for NAPD (OR: 6.99; 95% CI 6.03–8.10), which was further attenuated after adjustment for ASD and substance abuse (OR: 2.57; 95% CI 2.09–3.16). Utilization of ADHD medication increased the risk for NAPD, with ORs indicating a change in odds of NAPD for every 5 extra prescriptions of stimulants (OR: 1.06; 95% CI 1.02–1.10) and non-stimulants (OR: 1.15; 95% CI 1.01–1.30). There was no association between the length of medication usage and the risk for NAPD.

The risk for NAPD was higher in individuals with ADHD than their unaffected siblings (OR: 2.95; 95% CI 2.07–4.20). Overall, ADHD was associated with an elevated risk for NAPD, which is not entirely explained by shared familial factors.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^115rtsGj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The most frequently cited reasons for discontinuing medication are the family's experience that the medications are not effective or the child is experiencing intolerable adverse effects. The clinician should help the family have realistic expectations for how ADHD medication can help, and provide frequent monitoring in the initial stages to address emerging adverse effects, as two important methods to improve medication adherence.

### Diagnosing and treating adult ADHD and comorbid conditions [^115HD69i]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Many adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were never diagnosed as children. The impairment caused by untreated ADHD can complicate, or even lead to, other psychiatric conditions. Accurate diagnosis and efficacious treatment of ADHD in adults, which may include pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, is vital to improve their functioning. When a patient has ADHD and a co-occurring condition, the clinician should usually treat the most impairing condition first.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^116sm6ra]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Safe and effective medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is available and recommended as first-line treatment for the core symptoms of inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness. Despite impaired functioning during adolescence, many discontinue medication treatment. For children, healthcare decisions are usually made by the parent; older youth make their own decisions. Beliefs and attitudes may differ widely. Some families understand that ADHD is a neurobiological condition and accept that medication is indicated; for others, such treatment is unacceptable.

Converging evidence describes negative perceptions of the burden associated with medication use, as well as concerns about potential short- and long-term adverse effects. Indeed, experiences of adverse effects are a frequent explanation for discontinuation among youth.

Ways to improve shared decision-making among practitioners, parents, and youth, along with monitoring effectiveness, safety, and new onset of conditions, are likely to optimize outcomes.

### Relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder care and medication continuity [^1113HZak]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the relationships between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) care practices and subsequent medication use.

- **Method**: A retrospective cohort from a random sample of medical records in 50 pediatric practices with 188 providers, including 1,352 children who started ADHD medication, was studied. Independent variables included physician behaviors related to medication titration and monitoring of treatment response. Primary outcomes were the number of days covered with ADHD medication during the first year of treatment and the time from starting medicine to the first 30-day gap in medication supply. Multilevel modeling and Cox proportional hazards regression models were conducted.

- **Results**: Children had an average medication supply of 217 days in the first year. Half experienced a 30-day gap in medication supply in the first 3 months. Nearly three-fourths had a medication adjustment in the first year, with the first adjustment usually being a dosage change. The average time to the first medication adjustment was over 3 months. Physicians' first contact with parents occurred in the first month of treatment for less than half, with the average time being over 2 months. Little variation related to ADHD care quality was accounted for at the physician level. Early titration and early contact were related to greater medication supply and continuity of treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Earlier physician-delivered ADHD care, such as contact with parents after starting medication and medication adjustment, is related to greater medication supply and continuity.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: How much responsibility are pediatricians taking [^114XYyYZ]? Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the most common childhood behavioral condition, is one that pediatricians think they should identify and treat/manage.

- **Objective**: Our goals were to explore the relationships between pediatricians' self-reports of their practice behaviors concerning usually inquiring about and treating/managing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and (1) attitudes regarding perceived responsibility for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and (2) personal and practice characteristics.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the 59th Periodic Survey of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the 447 respondents who practice exclusively in general pediatrics. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify attitudes and personal and practice characteristics associated with usually identifying and treating/managing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

- **Results**: A total of 67% reported that they usually inquire about and 65% reported that they usually treat/manage attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Factors positively associated with usually inquiring about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adjusted multivariable analyses include perceived high prevalence among patients, attendance at a lecture/conference on child mental health in the past 2 years, having patients who are assigned or can select a specific pediatrician, practicing in suburban communities, practicing for ≥ 10 years, and being female. Pediatricians' attitudes about responsibility for identification of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder reflect these findings.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1115kWgZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend arranging for a parent, health professional, such as a trained school nurse, or another trusted adult to directly observe the administration of medication. This is especially important when using a short-acting formulation in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder along with ADHD. Consider counseling families on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^115NxHpj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Parents describe that a good relationship with their healthcare provider helps in the decision to start treatment for their children. Those who trust their healthcare provider and, more generally, the healthcare system are more likely to accept ADHD medication treatment. While parents and pediatricians have a similar understanding of ADHD and treatment priorities, it is not identical. Families often consult with friends and relatives about the advice doctors provide; when these informal consultations align with the provider's advice to use medication, it is more likely to be followed.

Barriers to ongoing medication use include the cost of prescriptions, whereas limited insurance coverage and the need to take time off work can interfere with ongoing monitoring and care. Pediatricians note that providing care for children with special needs can be time-consuming, requiring additional phone calls to schools and mental health professionals outside of usual office hours. The physician's ability to clarify treatment preferences, discuss available options, and maintain a treatment alliance with the family is crucial to success.

### Pediatric psychopharmacology for treatment of ADHD, depression, and anxiety [^111CYWDx]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The pediatric practitioner is often the first point of contact for children and adolescents suffering from mental illness. Part of the treatment planning for psychiatric diagnoses includes consideration of medication. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, one of the most common diagnoses, is very responsive to stimulant medications; for children who are unable to tolerate stimulants or who do not achieve satisfactory symptom management, central α-agonists and atomoxetine are effective and generally well-tolerated alternative or augmentative agents. Depression and anxiety disorders are also frequently encountered in the pediatric office setting. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is considered first-line psychopharmacology for depression and anxiety symptoms. Despite concerns for suicidal ideation related to this medication class, the benefits typically outweigh the risks. This review provides basic clinical pharmacology of stimulant and nonstimulant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors intended to serve as a primer for the general pediatrician.

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, the WHO 2023 guidelines suggest offering methylphenidate to pediatric patients aged ≥ 6 years with ADHD, provided that:

- **Symptoms are causing persistent, significant impairment**: This must occur in at least one domain of functioning (education, interpersonal relationships, occupation) after implementing environmental modifications in schools, at home, or other relevant settings.

- **Careful assessment has been obtained**: Carry out thorough evaluations of the child or adolescent.

- **Informed decision-making is supported**: Ensure the child/adolescent and the caregivers are informed about treatment options and supported in decision-making.

- **Specialist consultation is involved**: Methylphenidate prescriptions should be made by, or in consultation with, a specialist.

### SPL drug information for atomoxetine hydrochloride [^11556ij4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of atomoxetine hydrochloride PO for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults is as follows:

- **Start at**: 40 mg PO daily for at least 3 days.
- **Maintenance**: 80 mg PO daily, in 1–2 divided doses (either a single daily dose in the morning or evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon/early evening).
- **Maximum**: 100 mg per day.

### Efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: An integrated analysis of the complete database of multicenter placebo-controlled trials [^112D6xUU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, these data show that ATX has a statistically significant and clinically relevant response in adults with ADHD, which is maintained over six months. Indirect comparison of the results of these integrated analyses of ATX studies with those from studies of stimulants in adults with ADHD suggests that the effect size may be more similar than previously thought. Not all adult patients are likely to respond or are able to tolerate stimulants, and there are additional advantages of ATX in some cases. The low abuse and diversion potential of ATX, the possibility of once or twice daily dosing with enduring efficacy, stable effect throughout the day, and demonstrated effectiveness in reducing ADHD symptoms in patients with comorbid social anxiety and alcohol use disorders make ATX an important medication to consider when treating adult patients with ADHD.

### Second opinions improve ADHD prescribing in a Medicaid-insured community population [^114PDk8j]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The appropriate use of psychotropic medications in youths is an important public health concern. This article describes a review process developed to monitor the use of stimulants and atomoxetine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in youths receiving fee-for-service Medicaid services.

- **Method**: Washington State Medicaid developed threshold safety parameters for ADHD medications through a process involving the community. A second opinion was mandated when safety thresholds based on dose, combination therapies, or age were exceeded. Use and cost were compared two years before and after the program began.

- **Results**: From May 2006 to April 2008, 5.35% of ADHD prescriptions exceeded safety thresholds, resulting in 1,046 second-opinion reviews. Of those, 538 (51.4%) resulted in a prescription adjustment. Adjustments were made to prescriptions written by primary care physicians (52%), psychiatrists (50%), nurse practitioners (54%), and physician assistants (51%). When comparing the preperiod and postperiod, second opinions reduced ADHD medication at high doses by 53%, in combinations by 44%, and for patients 5 years of age and younger by 23%. The review process resulted in a savings of $1.2 million, with 538 fewer patients exceeding safety thresholds. This represented a 10:1 return over administrative costs; however, overall Medicaid expenditures for ADHD medication still increased due to higher unit costs and clinicians' preferential use of newer brands entering the market.

- **Conclusions**: A statewide second-opinion process reduced outlier ADHD medication use, contributing to public health improvements.

### Adderall [^112gQuRP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The mode of therapeutic action in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not known. Amphetamines are thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Adderall® tablets contain d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine salts in the ratio of 3:1. Following administration of a single dose of 10 mg or 30 mg of Adderall® to healthy volunteers under fasted conditions, peak plasma concentrations occurred approximately 3 hours post-dose for both d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) for d-amphetamine was shorter than the t1/2 of the l-isomer (9.77 to 11 hours vs. 11.5 to 13.8 hours). The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC0-inf) of d- and l-amphetamine increased approximately three-fold from 10 mg to 30 mg, indicating dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.

The effect of food on the bioavailability of Adderall® has not been studied.

### Managing the risks of ADHD treatments [^114sALti]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a well-established and effective treatment modality. However, ADHD medications are not without side effects. Understanding the prevalence of adverse events and effective management of risks associated with stimulants and other medications used to treat ADHD is central to broad applicability and effective treatment. This review discusses the literature on the prevalence of adverse events and management strategies employed. We searched online MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles using several keywords relating to adverse events associated with ADHD medication management. We discuss the relevant data on the significance and prevalence of side effects and adverse events, highlight recent updates in the field, and suggest approaches to clinical management.

### Low-dose atomoxetine for maintenance treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^113Rw9zv]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Data from acute studies of atomoxetine in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder suggest that a dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg per day is required to attain a maximal symptom response. However, lower doses could be effective during maintenance treatment, reducing drug exposure and potential problems related to tolerability during chronic treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 6 to 16 years who had a robust response to an initial acute trial of atomoxetine were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to continue treatment for up to 8 months. They were either continued on the dose to which they had responded acutely (1.2–1.8 mg/kg per day, N = 116, continued same dose) or switched to a lower dose (0.5 mg/kg per day, N = 113, low dose). The primary outcome measure was relapse, defined as the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-Administered and Scored total score returning to ≥ 90% of the original baseline value (before acute treatment) for 2 consecutive visits. Mean change in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale total score was assessed as a secondary outcome.

- **Results**: At randomization, symptom severity was low and similar in both groups. At end point, relapse rates did not differ between the groups. The mean change in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale total score from the conclusion of acute treatment to end point also was not different between groups. Reports of affective lability were higher in the low-dose group. Additionally, increases in heart rate (compared with) were observed.

### Headache in ADHD as comorbidity and a side effect of medications: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NPK3g]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There is mixed evidence on the association between headache and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as the relationship between headache and ADHD medications. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the co-occurrence of headache in children with ADHD and the effects of ADHD medications on headache. Embase, Medline, and PsycInfo were searched for population-based and clinical studies comparing the prevalence of headache in ADHD and controls through January 26, 2021. Additionally, the search of a previous systematic review and network meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ADHD medications was updated on June 16, 2020. Trials of amphetamines, atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with a placebo arm and reporting data on headache as an adverse event were included.

Thirteen epidemiological studies and 58 clinical trials were eligible for inclusion. In epidemiological studies, a significant association between headache and ADHD was found [odds ratio (OR) = 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.63–2.46], and this remained significant when limited to studies reporting ORs adjusted for possible confounders. The pooled prevalence of headaches in children with ADHD was 26.6%. In RCTs, three ADHD medications were associated with increased headache during treatment periods compared to placebo: atomoxetine (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.06–1.56), guanfacine (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.12–1.82), and methylphenidate (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.09–1.63). The summarized evidence suggests that headache is common in children with ADHD.

### Efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: An integrated analysis of the complete database of multicenter placebo-controlled trials [^115mdYts]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

An integrated (pooled) analysis was performed. This can be viewed as a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data, as opposed to study-level summary data used in traditional meta-analyses. It allows patient characteristics to be investigated by within-subgroup analyses, which were not part of the original study analyses.

The present analysis included all multicenter, randomized, double-blind efficacy studies of atomoxetine (ATX) in adults sponsored by Eli Lilly. Two Eli Lilly-sponsored studies were not included: one phase 2 cross-over study with very short treatment periods of three weeks and a maintenance of effect study including a randomized withdrawal period of atomoxetine responders. These were excluded as they had different objectives and study designs.

The included studies comprised of six short-term (10–16 week) placebo-controlled studies, including two studies of ADHD with comorbid disorders, and three longer-term (six-month) placebo-controlled studies. New analyses were undertaken to calculate response rates across studies based on common definitions of response.

Data from the nine included studies were pooled to provide more precise estimates of response and responder rates, effect size, and to increase the power of the analysis.

Given the increasing use of ADHD medication worldwide, and its impact on cardiometabolic risk and protective factors associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), it is important to understand the association between ADHD medication use and the risk of T2D. We conducted a nationwide population study to investigate the association between cumulative use of ADHD medications and the risk of T2D in adults. This study also tests whether the association differs by sex and age of T2D diagnosis.

### Guanfacine toxic ingestion with subsequent cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^116aiznU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Guanfacine is a central alpha-2 agonist often prescribed for attention-deficit hyperactive disorder as well as tic disorder, with a usual dose of 1–4 mg per day. Due to its sympatholytic mechanism of action, guanfacine can cause autonomic instability and hypotension. It can additionally cause cardiac dysfunction, including symptomatic bradycardias and contractility suppression.

The authors present a case of a 17-year-old male with an ingestion of 80 mg of extended-release guanfacine, resulting in delayed-onset cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring mechanical ventilation. Previous pediatric ingestions have resulted in bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased level of consciousness, which were responsive to intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and occasionally naloxone. However, cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to reduced cardiac contractility is a novel consequence of extended-release guanfacine ingestion.

Given guanfacine's extended half-life, this unique case underscores the importance of emergency providers' familiarity with this toxidrome, as well as the necessity for prolonged, close observation following guanfacine ingestion.

### A guide to the treatment of adults with ADHD [^111vGb2F]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

While child and adolescent physicians are familiar with the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), many adult physicians have had little experience with the disorder. It is difficult to develop clinical skills in the management of residual adult manifestations of developmental disorders without clinical experience with their presentation in childhood. Adult patients are increasingly seeking treatment for the symptoms of ADHD, and physicians need practice guidelines. Adult ADHD often presents differently from childhood ADHD. Because adult ADHD can be comorbid with other disorders and has symptoms similar to those of other disorders, it is important to understand differential diagnoses.

Physicians should work with patients to provide feedback about their symptoms, to educate them about ADHD, and to set treatment goals. Treatment for ADHD in adults should include:

- **Medication trial**: Restructuring of the patient's environment to make it more compatible with the symptoms of ADHD.
- **Ongoing supportive management**: Address any residual impairment and facilitate functional and developmental improvements.

### ADHD medication discontinuation and persistence across the lifespan: A retrospective observational study using population-based databases [^116gfhk1]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Although often intended for long-term treatment, discontinuation of medication for ADHD is common. Unfortunately, cross-national estimates of discontinuation are missing due to the absence of standardized measures. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of ADHD treatment discontinuation across the lifespan and to describe similarities and differences across countries to guide clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective, observational study using population-based databases from eight countries and one Special Administrative Region: Australia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the United States. We employed a common analytical protocol approach and extracted prescription data to identify new users of ADHD medication. Eligible individuals were aged 3 years or older who had initiated ADHD medication between 2010 and 2020. We estimated treatment discontinuation and persistence in the five years after treatment initiation, stratified by age at initiation (children [age 4–11 years], adolescents [age 12–17 years], young adults [age 18–24 years], and adults [age ≥ 25 years]) and sex. Ethnicity data were not available.

- **Findings**: A total of 1,229,972 individuals (735,503 [60%] males, 494,469 females [40%]; median age 8–21 years) were included in the study. Across countries, treatment discontinuation one to five years after initiation was lowest in children and highest in young adults and adolescents. Within one year of initiation, 65% (95% CI 60–70) of children, 47% (43–51) of adolescents, 39% (36–42) of young adults, and 48% (44–52) of adults remained on treatment.

### Systematic review of national and international guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^115YcDv3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

During the last few years, several clinical guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been published by national and international medical societies. To systematically review and compare recommendations of selected ADHD guidelines, we performed a systematic search in online guideline databases and PubMed to retrieve guideline texts. Guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed, and recommendations on assessment and treatment were extracted. The AGREE instrument was used to assess methodological quality.

Of the 26 guidelines identified, 13 were selected for further analysis: 11 guidelines deal with ADHD in childhood and adolescence, and 5 guidelines cover transitional patients and/or ADHD in adults. The methodological quality of ADHD guidelines is moderate to good, reflecting similarities and differences in healthcare systems. Diagnosis throughout the lifespan is based on a detailed clinical history. There is greater agreement on evidence-based pharmacological treatment than on psychosocial interventions, reflecting the strength of evidence.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^112sPDUz]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of comorbid conditions:

- **ADHD**: Stimulants may also be used for comorbid ADHD in stable/euthymic youth taking optimal doses of anti-manic medications. Adjunctive mixed amphetamine salts (level 3) and methylphenidate (level 3) have both been shown to be effective in addressing attention symptoms and have been well tolerated overall within the RCTs completed at the time of writing, despite theoretical and epidemiological data regarding risks of induction of mood elevation. Although open trials suggest potential benefits of atomoxetine (level 4), the possibility of inducing mania or hypomania remains, suggesting the need for RCTs before clinical recommendations can be made.

- **Substance use**: Comorbid substance use should be treated concurrently with mood symptoms, with inpatient hospital or community residential treatment employed as clinically indicated. A small study suggests that lithium may be effective for reducing substance use in this population (level 3), and FFT should also be considered. Positive trials of N-acetylcysteine for cannabis use disorders among adolescents, smoking, and bipolar depression among adults suggest that N-acetylcysteine may benefit adolescents with comorbid bipolar and SUDs; however, studies examining this hypothesis have not yet been completed (level 4).

Management of bipolar disorder in older age:

- **Presentation and course**: Because of the aging population in Canada and many countries around the world, knowledge of pertinent issues related to the management of older adults is becoming increasingly important.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^115iZDZG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

The topic of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder involves careful considerations when switching to equivalent doses of long-acting formulations of methylphenidate. When transitioning patients from immediate- or extended-release methylphenidate — which acts by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine — to a long-acting methylphenidate formulation, prescribers should avoid a simple equivalence based on the total dose. Instead, they should use the immediate-release component of each formulation as the reference.

For instance, when switching from 20 mg of Medikinet XL® (methylphenidate extended release, ER) with 50% immediate release (10 mg) to OROS Concerta XL®, 45 mg of OROS Concerta XL® with 22% immediate release (9.9 mg) would give the equivalent immediate-release dose. Similarly, 40 mg of Equasym XL® (methylphenidate extended release, ER) with 30% immediate release (12 mg) would be equivalent to OROS Concerta XL® 54 mg, and Equasym XL® 50 mg would be approximately equivalent to OROS Concerta XL® 72 mg.

### Efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: An integrated analysis of the complete database of multicenter placebo-controlled trials [^111Ws6tP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Access to clinical resources for ADHD in adults remains limited in many countries, in part because of the traditional perspective that ADHD is a problem restricted to childhood and due to the lack of approved treatments in many countries. However, awareness of ADHD in adults is growing rapidly, and there is now an urgent need to broaden understanding of the condition and to evaluate the effectiveness of available therapeutic interventions.

Based on evidence, national and international guidelines recommend drug treatments as the first line of clinical management for ADHD in adults, particularly where the disorder is associated with moderate-to-severe levels of impairment. In the United States, a wide range of pharmacological treatments are approved for use in adults, including atomoxetine (ATX), methylphenidate (MPH), dexmethylphenidate, and various amphetamines. ATX was approved in the EU in May 2013 for initiation in adults to treat ADHD. No other medications are approved in Europe to be initiated for the treatment of ADHD in adults, except in Germany, where a long-acting form of MPH has been approved since 2011.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^114pUDUG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

The analysis of ADHD medication consumption in relation to ADHD prevalence, geographical region, and income level:

In the multivariable analysis, adjusting for yearly GDP per capita, ADHD prevalence, and geographical region, the worldwide trend for an increase in ADHD medication consumption was smaller but remained statistically significant, with an average annual percentage change of +4.58% (95% CI, +1.33 to +7.93). When considering these factors, ADHD prevalence (P = 0.22) and geographical region (P = 0.37) were not associated with the trends, while GDP per capita (P < 0.001) was positively associated with the trend in ADHD medication consumption (Table S3, Supplement pp5).

We also investigated ADHD medication consumption in countries categorized by income levels. The annual average increase in ADHD medication consumption was only significant for high-income countries (n = 39; +11.28%; 95% CI, +9.48% to +13.12%). No significant changes in ADHD consumption rates were observed for upper-middle-income countries (n = 17; +3.23%; 95% CI, −1.88% to 8.61%) or lower-middle-income countries (n = 8; +16.60%; 95% CI, −7.15% to +46.43%) (Table 2).

In 2019, the pooled consumption rates of ADHD medication were 6.39 DDD/TID (95% CI, 4.63 to 8.84) in high-income countries, 0.37 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.58) in upper-middle-income countries, and 0.02 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.05) in lower-middle-income countries (Table 2).

### The effect of guanfacine treatment on ocular parameters in pediatric and adolescent patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^114vezGA]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental condition identified by impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention. This diagnosis is the most prevalent among school-age children in the field of psychiatry. The prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents has been reported to range from 5.9 to 14%.

Stimulant (methylphenidate, amphetamine) and non-stimulant (atomoxetine and guanfacine) pharmacologic treatments are used in the treatment of ADHD, and their effectiveness has been shown in randomized controlled trials and other studies. There has been a notable rise in the use of ADHD medication among both children and adults in recent years. Guanfacine, a non-stimulant used in the management of ADHD, functions as a selective alpha-2 A adrenergic receptor agonist, activating postsynaptic alpha-2 A receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It enhances noradrenergic transmission and improves connectivity within PFC networks. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the extended-release formulation of guanfacine (GEXR) for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that captures high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina. In recent years, the choroidal vascularity index (CVI) has been frequently used in the evaluation of choroidal diseases. CVI is the ratio of the luminal area (LA), indicative of the vascular component, to the total choroidal area (TCA). The Oculus Pentacam (Optikgerate) uses Scheimpflug technology to measure these parameters.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^1137eDhM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Guanfacine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, was the fastest-growing ADHD medication during the study period. An extended-release formulation of guanfacine was first approved as a treatment for ADHD in the US in 2009, and it has since been approved in several other countries. In contrast, clonidine, another alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist licensed for ADHD as the extended-release formulation, is only available in five countries. Although immediate-release clonidine is used off-label in some countries, our study did not capture this data. There have been far fewer studies examining the safety and tolerability of clonidine and guanfacine than stimulants and atomoxetine.

A recent network meta-analysis reported less precise estimates with broad confidence intervals when evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of these medications, leading to uncertainty when interpreting the results. This highlights the need for larger and longer-term studies that monitor the safety of these recently approved medications. Despite its fast growth, consumption rates of guanfacine remained low compared with stimulants. Following guanfacine, amphetamines had the second-highest annual increase in consumption. Northern and Western Europe had the highest regional annual increase in amphetamines consumption during the study period. In non-US countries, this was likely due to the recent approval of lisdexamfetamine, an amphetamine prodrug, where previously only dexamfetamine's immediate release was available. In children and adolescents, amphetamines may have moderately greater efficacy than methylphenidate in ADHD.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and seizures [^111rTa3u]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of seizures, but there is uncertainty about whether ADHD medication treatment increases this risk among patients with and without preexisting seizures.

- **Methods**:
	- We followed a sample of 801,838 patients with ADHD who had prescribed drug claims from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases to examine whether ADHD medication increases the likelihood of seizures among ADHD patients with and without a history of seizures. First, we assessed the overall risk of seizures among patients with ADHD. Second, within-individual analyses assessed the odds of seizure events during months when a patient with ADHD received ADHD medication compared to when the same individual did not, while adjusting for antiepileptic medications. Third, within-individual long-term analyses examined the odds of seizure events in relation to the duration of months over the previous two years patients received medication.

- **Results**:
	- Patients with ADHD were at higher odds for any seizure compared with non-ADHD controls (odds ratio [OR] = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.24–2.42 for males; OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 2.22–2.42 for females). In adjusted within-individual comparisons, ADHD medication was associated with lower odds of seizures among patients with (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.60–0.85) and without (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.62–0.82) prior seizures. Long-term within-individual comparisons suggested no evidence of an association between medication use and seizures among individuals with (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = XXXX).

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Management [^114GHJ8p]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder of childhood and often persists into adulthood. It is a neurophysiologic disorder defined in behavioral terms and associated with significant morbidity in social and academic success, as well as self-esteem. ADHD is frequently linked with comorbid psychiatric disorders and learning disabilities, further hindering the successful development of affected individuals.

It is essential that family physicians be knowledgeable about the presentation and diagnosis of ADHD. Stimulant medications remain the cornerstone of treatment, though many other medications (such as antidepressants and alpha blockers) serve as helpful adjuvants to therapy.

- **Recommendations for treatment**: An individualized, multimodal approach involving parents, teachers, counselors, and the school system is advised.

- **Treatment follow-up**: This includes monitoring the response to medications across various settings, as well as side effects.

With time and interest, family physicians can develop the skills needed to effectively treat this disorder.

Regarding the medical management for stimulant use disorder, particularly with respect to the management of hyperadrenergic symptoms, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of the following adjunctive agents in patients in a hyperadrenergic state persisting despite appropriate improvement in agitation and neuromuscular hyperactivity following treatment with benzodiazepines or other GABAergic agents:

- **A β-blocker with concomitant α-1 antagonism**: Such as carvedilol or labetalol.

- **An α-2 adrenergic agonist**: Such as dexmedetomidine for severe symptoms or clonidine for mild-to-moderate symptoms.

- **Other pharmacological options**: Such as CCBs, α-1 adrenergic antagonists, α-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators, if β-blockers are contraindicated and considering other clinically relevant signs and symptoms.

### Electrophysiological and clinical predictors of methylphenidate, guanfacine, and combined treatment outcomes in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^1145U6xP]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

The combination of d-methylphenidate and guanfacine (an α-2A agonist) has emerged as a potential alternative to either monotherapy in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but it is unclear what predicts response to these treatments. This study is the first to investigate pretreatment clinical and electroencephalography (EEG) profiles as predictors of treatment outcome in children randomized to these different medications.

A total of 181 children with ADHD (aged 7–14 years; 123 boys) completed an 8-week randomized, double-blind, comparative study with d-methylphenidate, guanfacine, or combined treatments. Pretreatment assessments included ratings on ADHD, anxiety, and oppositional behavior. EEG activity from cortical sources localized within midfrontal and midoccipital regions was measured during a spatial working memory task with encoding, maintenance, and retrieval phases. Analyses tested whether pretreatment clinical and EEG measures predicted treatment-related change in ADHD severity.

Higher pretreatment hyperactivity-impulsivity and oppositional symptoms and lower anxiety predicted greater ADHD improvements across all medication groups. Pretreatment event-related midfrontal beta power predicted treatment outcome with combined and monotherapy treatments, albeit in different directions. Weaker beta modulations predicted improvements with combined treatment, whereas stronger modulation during encoding and retrieval predicted improvements with d-methylphenidate and guanfacine, respectively. A multivariate model including the pretreatment metrics was developed to allow for a comprehensive assessment of predictors of treatment response across different medication groups.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers up to March 2022. Additionally, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes: ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events. We also considered three secondary outcomes: adverse events deemed non-serious, general behavior, and quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors, including two from the original review, participated in the analysis.

### AdderallXR [^115HqPhK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years**: The recommended starting dose for pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years with ADHD, whether they are starting treatment for the first time or switching from another medication, is 10 mg/day. The dose may be increased to 20 mg/day after one week if ADHD symptoms are not adequately controlled.

- **Recommended dosage in adults**: In adults with ADHD who are either starting treatment for the first time or switching from another medication, the recommended dose is 20 mg/day.

- **Dosage in patients with renal impairment**: In adult patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily in the morning. In pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with severe renal impairment, the recommended dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose for children aged 6 to 12 years with severe renal impairment is 20 mg once daily. Adderall XR is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Dosage modification due to drug interactions**: Agents that alter urinary pH can impact the excretion and alter the blood levels of amphetamines. Acidifying agents (e.g. ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels; adjust Adderall XR dosage based on clinical response [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### ADHD and anxiety: Clinical significance and treatment implications [^111YjACt]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In comparison to the DSM formulation of ADHD, we have proposed that ADHD in adults should be divided into inattentive and emotional dysregulation presentations. Under both systems, there is potential overlap with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We compared data from four distinct populations: ADHD clinical trials, GAD clinical trials, an ADHD clinic, and a forensic clinic. Approximately 25% of patients in each population had comorbid ADHD and anxiety.

Comorbid subjects reported more childhood ADHD symptoms and higher scores on ADHD scales, and were more likely to fit criteria for ADHD emotional dysregulation presentation or DSM-IV combined type. Comorbid subjects did not drop out at a higher rate and showed significant drug-placebo differences on ADHD symptoms, including emotional dysregulation. Conversely, although symptoms of anxiety decreased, there was no drug-placebo difference in improvement.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Xj9pb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, specifically in pharmacotherapy, the AAP 2019 guidelines suggest offering methylphenidate to pediatric patients aged 4–5 years. This is suggested if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is a moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the child's functioning. It is important to weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 against the harm of delaying treatment, especially in regions where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available.

Only after all these aspects have been assessed should the prescriber consider:

1. **Second-line medications**: atomoxetine, which selectively inhibits the norepinephrine transporter, and guanfacine, which selectively stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, or clonidine, which selectively stimulates alpha-2A adrenergic receptors.
2. **Augmenting agents**: guanfacine or clonidine XR.
3. Other agents, under specialized advice or supervision, for which RCTs provide preliminary evidence of efficacy (e.g. bupropion, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).

- **Does the concomitant use of cannabis impact the effectiveness and tolerability of psychostimulants?** The evidence on the effectiveness of psychostimulants in marijuana users and the tolerability of the combination of psychostimulants and marijuana is limited. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of OROS-methylphenidate and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in youths with substance use disorder (with the majority of cases being marijuana use), there were no significant differences in efficacy between participants assigned to OROS-methylphenidate plus CBT and those in the placebo plus CBT group when considering the primary outcome (scores on the ADHD-RS completed by clinicians). However, ADHD-RS scores rated by parents were significantly lower in adolescents treated with OROS-MPH plus CBT compared to those in the placebo plus CBT arm at 8 and 16 weeks. The tolerability of OROS-methylphenidate was not substantially different from what would be expected with OROS-methylphenidate alone. Another RCT showed addictive effects.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111W8QUn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses, is it best to go beyond the treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, should one reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine, or is cross-tapering acceptable?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the order of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young individuals may tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that sedation has additional sleep and comorbidity benefits. Therefore, in these children, higher doses might be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. Clonidine can be divided into two or three doses; often, children sensitive to guanfacine side effects find that a BD or TDS regime of clonidine suits them better than the once-daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, whereas guanfacine appears more potent at postsynaptic receptors. This translates to increased prefrontal activity, improved impulse control regulation, and better behavior regulation. Therefore, in cases of comorbidities where behavioral modification is desired, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines indicate 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day, suggesting a rough equivalency of: Guanfacine 1 mg = Clonidine 100 mcg.

If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective, reduce and withdraw clonidine first before initiating guanfacine.

### Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^113Qj6RN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD can persist into adulthood and can affect individuals' social and occupational functioning, as well as their quality of life and health. It is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as substance use disorders, anxiety, and affective disorders. Amphetamines are used to treat adults with ADHD, but uncertainties about their efficacy and safety remain.

- **Objectives**: To examine the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for adults with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: In August 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, 10 other databases, and two trials registers, and we ran citation searches for included studies. We also contacted the corresponding authors of all included studies, other experts in the field, and the pharmaceutical company, Shire, and we searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews for other published, unpublished, or ongoing studies. For each included study, we performed a citation search in Web of Science to identify any later studies that may have cited it.

- **Selection criteria**: We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of amphetamines (at any dose) for ADHD in adults aged 18 years and over against placebo or an active intervention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data from each included study. We used the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the risk ratio (RR) to assess continuous and dichotomous outcomes.

### Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children [^114M3dJx]. Health Psychology Research (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:

- **Definition**: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by pervasive and impairing symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity according to DSM-V.

- **Pathophysiology**: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is caused by biological factors (such as genetics, brain structure, and their influence on neuropsychology) and environmental factors (including pregnancy or birth complications, exposure to environmental toxins, chaotic parenting, and diet).

- **Disease course**: The interplay of environmental and genetic factors, along with dysfunction in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellum, results in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This manifests clinically as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is associated with poor motor coordination, impaired academic functioning, unintentional physical injury, sleep disturbances, and poor quality of life.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is not associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality.

### Managing ADHD and comorbidities in adults [^1114NHUC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Psychiatric comorbidity is common in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) across the lifespan, but the nature of these comorbidities differs in adults and adolescents compared with children. The relationships between and boundaries of ADHD and its comorbidities are still imperfectly understood, but the impairment they cause increases with age. Comorbidity may alter the patient's response to ADHD treatment and often requires treatment that is independent of and distinct from the treatment for ADHD.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^113BWr31]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

While ADHD medications are consistently associated with a reduced risk of serious real-world outcomes, the magnitude of these associations has decreased over time alongside rising prescription rates. This underscores the importance of continuously evaluating medication use in different patient populations. Further research is needed to better understand individual-level treatment effects based on patient characteristics, ensuring that clinical decision-making remains well informed.

### Atomoxetine treatment in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid social anxiety disorder [^111SrU75]. Depression and Anxiety (2009). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the effect of atomoxetine (ATX) on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid social anxiety disorder in adults.

- **Methods**: The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, involving adults with ADHD and social anxiety disorder. Participants received 40–100 mg of ATX (n = 224) or a placebo (n = 218) for 14 weeks following a 2-week placebo lead-in period. Efficacy measures included the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale: Investigator-Rated: Screening Version (CAARS:Inv:SV), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Clinical Global Impression-Overall-Severity (CGI-O-S), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS), and Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale-29 (AAQoL). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

- **Results**: The ATX group showed a mean change of -8.7 (± 10.0) from a baseline of 29.6 (± 10.4) on the CAARS:Inv:SV Total ADHD Symptoms score, which was significantly greater than the placebo group's mean change of -5.6 (± 10.2) from a baseline of 31.2 (± 9.4), with a P-value of < 0.001. For the LSAS Total score, the ATX group exhibited a mean change of -22.9 (± 25.3) from a baseline of 85.3 (± 23.6), significantly different from the placebo group's mean change of -14.4 (± 20.3) from a baseline of 82.1 (± 21.3), also with a P-value of < 0.001. The visit-wise analysis revealed greater improvement on both the CAARS:Inv:SV Total ADHD Symptoms score and LSAS Total score for ATX at every time point throughout the study (P-values ≤ .012). Mean changes in CGI-O-S, STAI-Trait Anxiety scores, and AAQoL Total score were significantly greater for ATX compared to placebo. Mean change for both groups on STAI-State Anxiety scores was comparable. There was an improvement on the SAS for the ATX group compared to the placebo group.

### Effect of pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on later psychiatric comorbidity: a population-based prospective long-term study [^1134h1ZD]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). Low credibility.

Clinicians should be aware that most children and adolescents with ADHD will be diagnosed with additional psychiatric disorders and that pharmacological treatment may have protective effects on some of these comorbidities. However, although we did not find support for any harmful causal effect of ADHD medication on psychiatric comorbidity for patients on the margin of treatment, both benefits and risks should be monitored carefully in the follow-up of individual patients.

### Adderall XR [^114n9brN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted in adults (N = 255) who met DSM-IV® criteria for ADHD. Patients were randomized to fixed-dose treatment groups receiving final doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of Adderall XR or placebo once daily in the morning for four weeks. Significant improvements, measured with the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), an 18-item scale that measures the core symptoms of ADHD, were observed at endpoint for all Adderall XR doses compared to patients who received placebo for all four weeks. There was not adequate evidence that doses greater than 20 mg/day conferred additional benefit.

### Prevalence of pharmacotherapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and prescription stimulant misuse: A national study of US college students [^112Y5zNJ]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Increasing rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pharmacotherapy may simultaneously benefit patients and increase the availability of stimulants for misuse. We measured the association between university-level prevalence of ADHD medication treatment and prevalence of prescription stimulant misuse (PSM) among college students.

- **Design, setting and participants**: This was an observational study using cross-sectional data from the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment III. Data included 395 participating universities between Fall 2019 and Fall 2022. Our sample included 224,469 undergraduates aged 18–25 years (65.2% cisgender female; 58.7% White).

- **Measurements**: Students self-reported any lifetime clinical ADHD diagnosis, past-year ADHD medication treatment, and past-3-month PSM. We defined university-level ADHD medication prevalence as the proportion of included students endorsing past-year ADHD medication treatment. Secondary outcomes included lifetime PSM and moderate- to high-risk alcohol and cannabis use. We also measured university-level depression medication prevalence as a negative control exposure.

- **Findings**: Among the included students, 9.6% reported a lifetime clinical ADHD diagnosis, 5.1% reported past-year medication treatment, and 2.4% reported past-3-month PSM. The prevalence of ADHD medication treatment varied among universities (mean = 5.3%, SD = 2.8%). In adjusted models, the prevalence of PSM was 7% relatively greater for every 1% increase in university-level medication prevalence.

### Cumulative ADHD medication use and risk of type 2 diabetes in adults: A Swedish Register study [^113BpsZC]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

The overall results were similar across women and men, showing that cumulative ADHD medication use was associated with a decreased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with no medication use. We also found that cumulative ADHD medication use was associated with decreased risk for T2D for both age groups (≤ 44 years old, ≥ 45 years old) compared with no use.

- **Association between medication use and T2D risk**: The results indicate that the association between cumulative duration of ADHD medication use and T2D risk was stratified by sex and age group at T2D diagnosis. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) are based on cases and controls matched on age, sex, and time since baseline and adjusted for the following factors:
	- **Demographics and education**: Country of birth, highest educational level
	- **Somatic comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, obesity, dyslipidemia, sleep disorders
	- **Psychiatric comorbidities**: Anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, depressive disorder, eating disorders, intellectual disability, personality disorders, schizophrenia, substance use disorders

Note: ADHD stands for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and T2D stands for type 2 diabetes.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly in patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend addressing ADHD symptoms as part of the substance use disorder treatment. Consider offering the following:

- **Psychostimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.

- **Non-stimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks.

- **Behavioral approaches**: As an additional strategy in management.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111N3rU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention; they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD. Despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: In February 2015, we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behavior, and quality of life.

Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^111QD2tG]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A second challenge in treating ADHD is related to the methods of treatment and the optimization of the risk:benefit ratio. Optimization of the treatment response often requires careful adjustments in doses and specific distributions of the doses during the day to maximize the effect of medications at the point of performance. Combined pharmacotherapy, such as using an antidepressant plus a stimulant for ADHD and comorbid depression, is often needed for patients with comorbid disorders and is sometimes indicated when ADHD is the only presenting problem. Adjunct psychosocial treatments are often useful but should be targeted to patients based on a needs assessment.

Possibly as a function of the disorder itself, non-adherence to treatment regimens is high in ADHD. In addition to the disorganization inherent in the disorder, other contributors to poor treatment adherence may include denial, externalization of the problem, and medication side effects. Little is known about predictors of long-term adherence, so more work is needed to improve this crucial component of treatment efficacy.

In sum, despite considerable advances in our understanding and treating ADHD, the disorder remains challenging to manage. Poor treatment adherence and psychiatric comorbidity clearly complicate treatment and negatively affect outcomes.

### Strategies for managing the risks associated with ADHD medications [^1171jk86]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

College students with ADHD may need help to overcome symptoms that make studying, organizing and completing projects, and managing their time a challenge. In order to properly treat these patients, clinicians must correctly assess ADHD and comorbid conditions using rating scales and educate patients about their responsibility to reach their treatment goals and to properly use and protect their medication. Patients with past substance use may require treatment options that are less likely to be misused, such as nonstimulant or long-acting stimulants. Throughout the treatment process, clinicians should continue to monitor symptoms and side effects with regular office visits and random testing, watching for signs of drug misuse.
