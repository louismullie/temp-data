## Question

liquifaction in semen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about semen liquefaction, including its physiology, normal timing, clinical significance, procedural handling, and how delayed or incomplete liquefaction should be interpreted and managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological basis of coagulation and liquefaction. Then, I should verify the normal time course and acceptable range. Next, I will review why liquefaction matters clinically and how it influences downstream testing. After that, I need to check guideline-based handling procedures and quality control. Finally, I will examine abnormal liquefaction patterns, their differential, and practical management, while confirming when to escalate or repeat testing.

> Let me first confirm the physiological basis. Semen coagulates immediately after ejaculation due to proteins from the seminal vesicles, notably semenogelins, forming a gel that helps retain sperm in the female reproductive tract. Subsequently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other proteases degrade these proteins, producing a liquid phase that permits sperm motility and function, a process that is tightly regulated and clinically relevant to sperm performance [^115TR2BK].

> I should confirm the normal time course. Standard laboratory guidance indicates that ejaculated semen typically liquefies within 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature, and this interval is the operational window used for routine semen analysis timing and processing decisions [^114ZrnVU]. Wait, let me verify variability across studies. Some cohorts report median liquefaction around 30 minutes with most samples completing by 60 minutes, which aligns with WHO-based practice, though exact distributions vary by population and methods, reinforcing the need to adhere to standardized timing in the lab [^114ZrnVU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance. I need to ensure I separate correlation from causation. Delayed or incomplete liquefaction can signal accessory gland dysfunction, particularly prostatic or seminal vesicle pathology, and may correlate with reduced sperm motility and impaired functional testing; however, liquefaction abnormalities are not themselves a direct cause of infertility and should prompt evaluation for underlying etiologies rather than be treated as the primary defect [^11245Kgb]. Let me reconsider the downstream impact; failure to liquefy properly can confound accurate assessment of volume, viscosity, motility, and concentration, so documenting and addressing it is essential for test validity [^notfound].

> Next, I should review procedural handling and quality control. I need to check that the sample is collected after 2–7 days of abstinence, brought promptly to the lab, and allowed to liquefy at room temperature for 30–60 minutes before analysis. Time of collection and abstinence interval should be recorded, and pH should be measured after liquefaction to support interpretation of accessory gland function [^114ZrnVU]. Wait, I should double-check temperature nuances; some protocols incubate at 37°C to standardize conditions, but the key is consistency within the laboratory and adherence to the local validated method aligned with WHO principles, with documentation of any deviations [^112Zie2m] [^114ZrnVU].

> I will now examine abnormal liquefaction patterns. Let me think about the types: delayed liquefaction beyond 60 minutes, incomplete liquefaction with persistent clumps, and viscous or "sticky" ejaculates that resist standard processing. These phenotypes can reflect prostatic inflammation, enzymatic deficiencies, or structural abnormalities of the glands, and they warrant targeted history, examination, and sometimes imaging or biochemical testing of seminal plasma constituents [^112eWeUg] [^11245Kgb]. But wait, what if the lab notes a cascade-type liquefaction with stepwise clearing; this pattern has been described and may still fall within physiologic variation, so I should correlate with other semen parameters and clinical context before labeling it pathologic [^112eWeUg].

> Let me verify management steps when liquefaction is abnormal. First, I should confirm the finding by ensuring adequate time at a controlled temperature and reassess. If persistent, note the degree of viscosity and consider mechanical or enzymatic aids such as gentle pipetting, needle aspiration, or addition of a small volume of a buffered medium, while avoiding procedures that damage sperm or alter osmolarity, and always document any deviations from standard processing [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that any enzymatic approach is consistent with local policy; many laboratories avoid routine enzymatic digestion due to potential effects on sperm integrity and instead rely on careful mechanical dispersion and extended observation, with results interpreted in light of the nonstandard handling [^notfound].

> Next, I should review when to escalate evaluation. If delayed or incomplete liquefaction recurs on repeat testing, or if accompanied by low semen volume, acidic pH, reduced fructose, or other accessory gland markers, I need to consider prostatitis, seminal vesicle hypofunction, or ejaculatory duct obstruction and refer for appropriate urologic or andrologic assessment. Persistent abnormalities should also prompt a broader male infertility workup per contemporary guidelines [^113cLaYx] [^113E6gdS]. I should confirm that repeat semen analysis is advised when initial results are abnormal, given substantial biologic and analytic variability, which strengthens the reliability of observed liquefaction patterns over time [^116CgYz4] [^1168s8BQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are precise. I should record the exact liquefaction time, describe viscosity qualitatively if abnormal, note any processing deviations, and interpret results within the context of the full semen profile and the patient's clinical presentation. This aligns with WHO's emphasis on standardized reporting and supports meaningful comparisons across serial analyses and laboratories [^114ZrnVU]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that normal liquefaction guarantees normal fertility. I should correct that — normal liquefaction is expected, but semen analysis overall has limited predictive value for natural conception, so liquefaction status is one piece of a larger clinical puzzle rather than a standalone fertility determinant [^116jZr9Z] [^113cUYwH].

Semen liquefaction is the **normal process** whereby ejaculated semen changes from a gel to a liquid within 30–60 minutes at room temperature [^114ZrnVU], driven by prostate-specific antigen and other proteases that degrade seminal vesicle proteins [^115TR2BK]. Delayed or incomplete liquefaction (> 60 min) is clinically significant because it can **impair sperm motility and function**, reducing fertility potential and complicating semen processing for ART [^114Tvayk]. Persistent abnormalities warrant evaluation for prostatic or seminal vesicle dysfunction, infection, or antisperm antibodies, and management may include mechanical or enzymatic treatment and repeat testing to confirm persistence [^11245Kgb] [^116CgYz4].

---

## Physiological process of semen liquefaction

- **Initial coagulation**: Upon ejaculation, semen coagulates due to proteins from the seminal vesicles (e.g. semenogelin), forming a gel that traps sperm and keeps semen in the female reproductive tract [^notfound].

- **Enzymatic liquefaction**: Within 30–60 minutes, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other proteases degrade coagulation proteins, converting semen to a liquid that allows sperm motility and migration [^114ZrnVU].

- **Normal timeline**: Liquefaction typically completes within 30–60 minutes at room temperature; persistent gel beyond 60 minutes is considered delayed or incomplete [^114ZrnVU].

---

## Clinical significance of delayed or incomplete liquefaction

Delayed or incomplete liquefaction is clinically significant because it can **impair sperm motility and function**, reducing fertility potential and complicating semen processing for ART [^notfound].

---

## Causes of delayed or incomplete liquefaction

Several factors can contribute to delayed or incomplete liquefaction:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Prostatic dysfunction | - Chronic prostatitis <br/> - Benign prostatic hyperplasia <br/> - Prostate cancer |
| Seminal vesicle dysfunction | - Congenital abnormalities <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Infection |
| Enzymatic deficiencies | - Reduced PSA activity <br/> - Other protease deficiencies |
| Infections | - Bacterial infections (e.g. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) <br/> - Sexually transmitted infections (e.g. gonorrhea, chlamydia) |
| Antisperm antibodies | - Immune-mediated agglutination and impaired motility |
| Lifestyle factors | - Smoking <br/> - Alcohol consumption <br/> - Poor diet <br/> - Sedentary lifestyle |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When delayed or incomplete liquefaction is observed, a thorough evaluation is recommended:

- **Repeat semen analysis**: Confirm persistence of liquefaction abnormalities with at least two analyses spaced several weeks apart [^116CgYz4] [^1168s8BQ].

- **Physical examination**: Assess for prostatic or seminal vesicle abnormalities, infection, or inflammation [^113cLaYx].

- **Laboratory tests**: Consider PSA levels, bacterial cultures, and antisperm antibody testing [^115FmtzQ].

- **Imaging**: Transrectal ultrasound or MRI may be used to evaluate prostate or seminal vesicle abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Treatment and management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Mechanical methods**: Gentle pipetting or needle aspiration can help liquefy viscous semen samples [^notfound].

- **Enzymatic treatments**: Collagenase, trypsin, or chymotrypsin may be used cautiously to aid liquefaction [^notfound].

- **Medical management**: Treat underlying infections or inflammation with antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Address modifiable factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet [^notfound].

- **Assisted reproductive techniques**: In cases of persistent liquefaction abnormalities, intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be considered [^notfound].

---

## Impact on fertility and assisted reproductive techniques

Delayed or incomplete liquefaction can **significantly impact fertility** by impairing sperm motility, reducing the likelihood of natural conception, and complicating semen processing for ART. It may necessitate specialized techniques such as density gradient centrifugation or swim-up to isolate motile sperm for ART procedures [^116eLuHq].

---

## Current research and advancements

Recent research focuses on **standardizing liquefaction assessment**, developing novel enzymatic treatments, and exploring the role of microfluidics and other advanced technologies in sperm processing [^114Tvayk]. The WHO sixth edition manual emphasizes standardized procedures and quality control to improve consistency and reliability of semen analysis results [^115pvhdn] [^115FmtzQ].

---

Semen liquefaction is a normal enzymatic process that converts coagulated semen to liquid within **30–60 minutes**. Delayed or incomplete liquefaction can **impair fertility** and may indicate underlying prostatic, seminal vesicle, or enzymatic abnormalities. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management — including **mechanical or enzymatic treatments**, medical therapy, and lifestyle changes — are essential to address this issue and optimize fertility outcomes [^notfound].

### The effect of the new 2010 World Health Organization criteria for semen analyses on male infertility [^115A6W4e]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the effect of the new 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) semen analysis reference values on reclassifying previous semen analysis parameters and definition of patients with male factor infertility.

Design

A multi-institutional retrospective chart review.

Setting

University and private male infertility clinics.

Patient(S)

Men referred for infertility evaluation.

Intervention(S)

Comparison of semen analysis values based on 2010 versus 1999 reference criteria.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Quantification of the change based on individual sperm parameters and as a whole.

Result(S)

A total of 184 men had at least two semen analyses; 13 (7%), 17 (9.2%), 34 (18.4%), and 29 (15.7%) patients changed classification to being at or above the reference values by the 2010 criteria for semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, and morphology, respectively. A total of 501 men had one semen analysis on file; 40 (7.9%), 31 (6.2%), 50 (9.9%), and 74 (19.3%) would change classification for volume, concentration, motility, and morphology, respectively. Overall, 103 patients (15.1%) who had one or more parameter below the reference value on the original analysis were converted to having all parameters at or above the 2010 reference values.

Conclusion(S)

The 2010 reference values result in some infertile men being reclassified as fertile if status is based on semen analysis alone. This may lead to fewer men being referred for proper infertility evaluation or treatment.

### Impact of seminal trace element and glutathione levels on semen quality of Tunisian infertile men [^113DmWKt]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and subject selection

A prospective controlled study was employed, involving 250 men (22–50 years) consulting for infertility evaluation in our laboratory of Cytogenetic and Reproductive Biology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse (Tunisia). Inclusion and exclusion criteria for selection of idiopathic infertile males were as follows:

Inclusion criteria

Males of couples living together with regular unprotected coitus for a reasonable period of time but not less than 1 year without conception.

Exclusion criteria

A detailed medical history was performed for all studied cases. Subjects currently on any medication or antioxidant supplementation were not included. In addition, subjects with testicular varicocele, genital infection, leukocytospermia, chronic illness and serious systemic diseases, smokers and alcoholic men were excluded from the study because of their well-known high seminal ROS levels and decreased antioxidant activity.

Study consent

A written consent of each subject was taken after explaining the aims and objectives of the study and its benefits on individual and society. Also, the study was approved by the Local Ethic Committee of the Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse (Tunisia).

Semen analysis

Semen samples were collected by masturbation into sterile cups following 3 days of sexual abstinence. After 30 minutes of liquefaction, standard semen parameters (Volume, motility, concentration and morphology) were immediately evaluated according to the World Health Organization guidelines (1999). Sperm motility was classified into four categories: rapid progressive motile (Type a), slow progressive motile (Type b), non-progressive motile and immotile spermatozoa, and was assayed at exactly 0.5 and 2 hours after liquefaction.

Total progressive motility was defined as the combination of type a rapid motility and type b slow progressive (At least 30% of sperm should have normal motility (categories a + b)). Sperm concentration was determined with an improved Neubauer Hemacytometer ® counting chamber and normal values of concentration were " > 20 × 10⁶ sperm/ml". Morphology was measured by recording the percentage of abnormal forms in the sample based on the classification of "David" and at least 30% of sperm should have normal morphology.

### Sperm-friendly lubricant: fact or fiction [^1142n35j]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of "sperm-friendly" coital lubricants on sperm motility.

Methods

This study compared the effects of five lubricants (Optilube®, Pre-Seed®, Yes Baby®, olive oil, and egg white) on sperm motility in 60 normozoospermic semen samples obtained from men attending a private fertility clinic. Samples were exposed to each of the lubricants, with untreated samples serving as controls, and were examined microscopically at four defined time-points from 2 to 72 h after liquefaction. Sperm motility was graded according to World Health Organization criteria.

Results

With the exception of egg white, all lubricants caused significant (P < 0.001) reductions in sperm forward progression compared with untreated controls until 24 h after liquefaction. Furthermore, between-group comparisons of the commercially available lubricants revealed statistically significant differences in forward progression motility: Pre-Seed® was superior to Optilube® (P < 0.001), which in turn was superior to Yes Baby® (P < 0.001) at 2–4 h after exposure. Significance (P < 0.001) between Pre-Seed® and Yes Baby® was maintained until 24 h.

Conclusion

Although spermatozoa exposed to Pre-Seed® demonstrated greater motility than spermatozoa exposed to Yes Baby®, claims that these lubricants are sperm-friendly were refuted. Conversely, egg white was shown to be a sperm-friendly lubricant for couples who are trying to conceive.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^115bN2fW]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Goals of the WHO laboratory manual for examination of human semen

The World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen was first published in 1980 to standardize the procedures for the examination of human semen. This WHO "semen" manual has undergone five revisions (Fig. 1) and has been translated into multiple languages in response to the growing global needs in andrology and reproductive medicine and to standardize procedures for the examination of human semen. The WHO manual provides standard laboratory methods for semen analysis that are used extensively by clinical and reference laboratories for the understanding of reproductive function in men, the diagnosis and planning of treatment for subfertile couples, assessment of male contraceptive methods, and large-scale population studies and research activities, such as the effects of viral, environmental, and other toxicants on male reproductive function.

Figure 1
The six editions of the WHO "Semen" manual.

The development of each edition of the manual was coordinated by the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund/United Nations Children's Fund/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) within the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research, which worked with the respective Task Forces or later, Research Group for the Regulation of Male Fertility. The latter, including the editorial board, was drawn from global experts working in male reproductive function. HRP has played very vital roles in convening the development of the manual, including overall coordination, technical input, supporting evidence generation, document production, dissemination, and promotion, ensuring continuity across editions, and providing necessary financial support.

### Introduction: male fertility testing: the past, present, and future [^111Vvhim]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Semen analysis remains the initial laboratory evaluation for infertile men. The limitations of the standard semen analysis along with past attempts to improve the analysis of sperm are reviewed. Advances in genetic testing will lead to fewer diagnoses of idiopathic male infertility, and improvements in picking the best sperm offer hope of improved assisted reproduction outcomes. The development of simplified testing has opened up the availability of tests performed in settings without advanced laboratory facilities as well as by patients in their own homes.

### Counseling for the man with severe male infertility [^116CAChV]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarize the proper counseling for men with severe male factor infertility.

Recent Findings

Men who are experiencing infertility should have a semen analysis, the results of which may imply additional investigations, including genetic and hormonal. Moreover, possible modifiable factors that may harm men's reproductive health should be carefully evaluated. Finally, different treatment options are available.

Summary

Approximately 15% of couples struggle with infertility. Complete evaluations of both men and women are required to determine the etiology of infertility and determine appropriate treatment.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^111Evjgp]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Methodology for preparation of the sixth edition

The sixth edition of the manual includes a section that describes the methodology used by WHO to prepare this sixth edition, providing transparency and assuring equity of representation as well as technical accuracy according to the WHO requirements. The WHO/HRP secretariat used the list of members and contributors from the prior editorial team, consulted with the collaborating institutions, and scanned the peer-reviewed global literature on andrology and semen analyses to develop the final list. This final list of editorial committee members selected for the editorial committee had a record of accomplishment of research and practice on semen analysis, balancing laboratory experience and clinical practice. The editorial committee consisted of nine international members, two members from the WHO Secretariat, and three early-career scientists. This manual retained its purpose as a laboratory procedure document and was not considered as a guideline, as the objectives and procedures for the latter are very different. This editorial team reviewed the topics, assigned members to review the literature on special topics that may be more controversial, and the reviews were discussed and a decision was made based on the available evidence whenever possible.

The procedure undertaken took approximately 3.5 years with partial interruptions to timelines from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The process entailed developing an outline of the chapters, preparing two major rounds of document drafts that were reviewed internally by the editorial core group, approving and reviewing by the editor-in-chief, Lars Björndahl, M.D. Ph.D. Centre for Andrology and Sexual Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; internal reviewing by WHO; external reviewing by other technical experts on andrology and semen analysis, and public reviewing (March to June 2021) with comments from 43 countries. These steps are part of the standard procedures for the development and finalization of WHO documents after collation and synthesis of all reviews and comments that were carefully implemented within the development of the sixth edition. The procedures for the final launch of the manual followed the WHO best practice in this area.

### Post-vasectomy semen analysis: what is the best protocol? [^114YvDpc]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasectomy is a safe, quick, and highly effective form of permanent sterilization. However, vasectomy does not render patients sterile immediately, and they must continue to use alternate forms of contraception until cleared by a post-vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA). Historically, the criteria for post-vasectomy clearance have varied widely amongst providers, with most physicians requiring azoospermia in order to consider vasectomy a success. The 2012 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines expanded the definition of post-vasectomy clearance to include ≤ 100,000 non-motile sperm (NMS). This has decreased the need for subsequent semen analyses and increased initial clearance rates. Despite this, patient compliance with PVSA has been poor, which has led to research focused on factors associated with compliance and interventions to enhance PVSA completion. There are many factors that affect patient compliance. Mail-in and at-home PVSA have the potential to increase compliance due to inherent convenience and less patient embarrassment. While no currently at-home test fulfills the AUA guidelines on post-vasectomy clearance, mail-in testing can be utilized to clear patients on the basis of azoospermia alone. Future research should focus on continued strategies to enhance PVSA compliance as well as explore patient preferences and alternative options.

### "Oligozoospermia, " "azoospermia, " and other semen-analysis terminology: the need for better science [^113BGvk6]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

The Greek-based terms used to describe semen-analysis abnormalities (e.g., "oligozoospermia" and "azoospermia") are unscientific, have overlapping definitions, and are often misinterpreted. The best course is to abandon these vague and difficult labels and simply report semen analyses quantitatively.

### Quantification of tissue factor pathway inhibitor in human seminal plasma and in human follicular fluid [^115qBBg3]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a multivalent Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor, which plays a central role in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. It inhibits activated factor X directly and factor VIIa/tissue factor via a quaternary complex. The composition of human semen is governed by the ejaculatory mixing of sperm-rich epididymal fluid, with secretion provided by the accessory sex glands. It is composed of more than 30 proteins including coagulation and liquefaction proteins. Ovarian follicular fluid plays an important biological role in folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation, and it remains in a hypocoagulable state until ovulation.

Materials and Methods

TFPI levels were measured in ovarian follicular fluid gained from the punctured follicles of superovulated women (n = 70), and, for the first time, in seminal plasma of 28 healthy ejaculate donors and 23 infertile patients with oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, or teratozoospermia.

Results

TFPI concentrations determined in liquor folliculi (median 298 ng/ml, 90% range 109–648 ng/ml) were four times higher than the levels found in human blood of healthy individuals. TFPI concentrations in seminal plasma samples of infertile men were significantly reduced (median 2.20 ng/ml, 90% range 0.28–6.02 ng/ml, p < 0.07) in comparison to healthy donors (median 3.55 ng/ml, 90% range 0.93–7.90 ng/ml).

Conclusions

The high TFPI levels measured in the ovarian follicular fluid underline the physiological importance of this inhibitor for maintaining the hypocoagulable state. The decreased TFPI concentrations in seminal plasma of infertile men support the possible correlation between the coagulation properties of ejaculated semen and male fertility.

### Performing a sperm DNA fragmentation test in addition to semen examination based on the WHO criteria can be a more accurate diagnosis of IVF outcomes [^112ftKEv]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Female factors are important in determining the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, many reports have shown that male factors also affect the success or failure of IVF, indicating that male examination is important for assessing fertility in couples. Generally, male fertility is assessed using semen analysis; semen tests are based on diagnostic methods in line with the WHO criteria and include analysis of semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm malformation rate. It is well known that conventional sperm motility analysis is dependent on the subjectivity of the observer, and the diagnostic sensitivity of semen motility analysis for assessing fertility potential is low. Hence, only motility of sperm cannot represent the fertility of sperm. In addition, evaluation of the malformation rate is also subjective, as there could be individual differences, and is based only on an approximate morphological sperm evaluation viewed through a biological microscope. Therefore, sperm evaluation criteria based on conventional semen analysis methods alone may not be a primary factor in determining subsequent IVF embryonic potential and pregnancy and miscarriage rates after transplantation. In addition to evaluating the number and motility of sperm, factors that contribute to infertility, such as whether sperm has the ability to fertilize oocytes and how they are involved in embryogenesis after fertilization, should be evaluated.

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^115e7oTv]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Vasectomy — post-vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA) analytic techniques state that centrifugation of semen samples is unnecessary and surgeons "should request a clinical laboratory not to perform centrifugation for a PVSA". The 2010 WHO manual advises that "high-speed centrifugation of spermatozoa must be avoided", and Steward et al. reported uncentrifuged analysis (n = 2,014 samples) as a reliable method to identify samples with > 100,000 sperm/ mL with sensitivity 99.3% and negative predictive value 99.8%.

### Defining reference ranges for serum anti-Müllerian hormone on a large cohort of normozoospermic adult men highlights new potential physiological functions of AMH on FSH secretion and sperm motility [^1126YUrb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hormone Analysis

All blood samples for hormone assays were collected from the cubital vein and then centrifuged at 4°C to recover the serum. Since serum hormone concentrations decrease during the daytime, we collected a single serum sample per patient in the morning (between 8 and 10) and in nonfasting state.

A fully automated sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay using the DxI Access system (Beckman Coulter, USA) was used to measure serum AMH levels. Its limit of quantification was 0.47 pmol/L. Below this threshold, AMH was defined as undetectable. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were < 2 and < 3%, respectively.

FSH, LH, and total T were measured by immunoassay using an automatic analyzer (Architect, Abbott Laboratories, USA). The limit of quantification of each assay was as follows: FSH = 0.2 IU/L, LH = 0.5 IU/L, and total T = 0.04 ng/ml. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 3.1% to 5.6% for FSH, 4.3% to 6.4% for LH, and 4.7% to 5.2% for total T. Reference ranges were from 1.2 to 7.8 IU/L for FSH, 0.60 to12 IU/L for LH, and 2.40 to 8.70 ng/mL (8.3–30.2 nmol/L) for total T.

The serum inhibin B assay was determined using an Inhibin B Gen II ELISA kit (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France). The assay's limit of quantification was 8 pg/mL. Below this threshold, inhibin B was defined as undetectable. The reference range for serum inhibin B was from 92 to 316 pg/mL.

AMH/tT values were calculated using serum AMH and serum total T concentration values as nanograms per milliliter.

Semen Collection and Analysis

Semen samples were provided in the laboratory by masturbation into a sterile plastic specimen cup, following a requested period of 2 to 7 days of sexual abstinence. After 30 minutes of liquefaction at room temperature, a manual semen analysis was performed as previously described. The semen volume, total sperm count, sperm concentration, motility, and vitality were interpreted according to the 2010 World Health Organization guidelines. Normal forms were analyzed and interpreted according to the standardized David's modified classification method.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part I [^115pZpYx]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Male partner evaluation — failed ART cycles or recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) and semen analysis (SA): In couples with failed ART cycles or recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) (two or more losses), evaluation of the male should be considered (Expert Opinion). Maternal age is the strongest predictor of fertility outcome for couples, and semen parameter values falling above or below the lower limit do not by themselves predict either fertility or infertility, so at least two SAs, ideally obtained at least one month apart, are important to obtain, especially if the first SA has abnormal parameters. In addition to treatment benefits, 1–6% of men evaluated for infertility have significant undiagnosed medical pathology including malignancies even when they have so-called "normal" SAs.

### Novel concepts in the aetiology of male reproductive impairment [^116x9qv9]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Infertility is a widespread problem and a male contribution is involved in 20–70% of affected couples. As a man's fertility relies on the quantity and quality of his sperm, semen analysis is generally used as the proxy to estimate fertility or gain insight into the underlying reasons for infertility. Male reproductive impairment might result from factors that affect sperm production, quality, function, or transport. Although in most men the origin of infertility remains unexplained, genetic causes are increasingly being discovered. In this first of two papers in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Series on male reproductive impairment, we propose a novel, clinically based aetiological construct with a genetic focus, and consider how this might serve as a helpful way to conceptualise a diagnostic algorithm.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^114gUPK9]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of these current and future advances

In closing, the continued improvement of procedures for the laboratory evaluation and processing of human semen over the past > 40 years has expanded the knowledge of male reproductive function and diagnosis of specific forms of dysfunction and set the stage for large multinational studies of semen parameters and characteristics worldwide. The improved rigor, precision, and accuracy that the current standardized protocols describe will now set the stage for advanced clinical trials aimed at filling the significant evidence gaps in both the diagnosis and treatment of male factor infertility needed to improve clinical care. In addition, the genomic revolution now allows the clinical diagnostic laboratories to realize quantum leaps in improved patient diagnosis in several areas of medicine. In andrology, we are on the forefront of vastly improving our diagnostic abilities to define precise etiologies and comorbidities and eventually (perhaps) develop medically based treatments for men with reproductive failure to improve not only their fertility potential but also their overall health. Translation of the new technologies described earlier (spermatogonial stem cell transplantation and spermatogenesis in vitro) to serve the clinical needs will require additional research. In the future, these methods should move from the laboratory to the clinical arena to provide therapeutic options for men with reproductive health-related conditions. However, because of the complexity of the systems involved and the substantial risks that otherwise healthy individual may be subjected to, there must be a high bar to ensure safety and a positive outcome. Despite these caveats, certainly, the future looks promising for improving the health and fertility of the male with reproductive failure through precision medicine and the application of advanced technologies for advanced diagnosis and treatment.

### Can semen parameters predict pregnancy outcomes? [^116jZr9Z]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Semen analysis is an integral component of the evaluation and management of men with infertility. Although it is important for patient counseling and clinical decision making, a conventional semen analysis cannot reliably predict the chance of pregnancy or differentiate fertile vs. infertile men (except in the most extreme cases). Advanced, nonstandard sperm functional tests may provide additional discriminatory and prognostic power; however, further research is needed to determine how to best incorporate these tests into modern clinical practice. Therefore, the primary applications of a conventional semen analysis should be to judge the severity of infertility, estimate the effects of future therapy, and measure the response to current therapy.

### Semen parameter variability among users of at-home sperm testing kits [^117G5KGj]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Semen analysis remains the single most important modality in the initial clinical evaluation of men's reproductive health. Despite the generally accepted World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on this procedure, an individual's results can display significant variation when performed across time or in different laboratories. Semen parameters are in fact highly variable measures that can differ significantly between various analyses; for this reason, a single semen study should not be used alone in assessing fertility status. The American Urological Association (AUA)/the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of male infertility recommend performing at least two semen analyses, ideally spaced at least one month apart, especially in cases when the first semen analysis revealed abnormal parameters.

Previous studies have focused much attention on the intra-subject variation of semen parameters. Brooks A. Keel enrolled 74 patients with infertility and 65 healthy donors who provided 479 and 2043 semen samples, respectively, and demonstrated substantial intraindividual variability among semen parameters, particularly sperm count. Moreover, intraclass correlations demonstrated that a minimum of three semen analyses should be performed prior to making the diagnosis of infertility. Similarly, Blickenstorfer et al. support the need for at least two semen analyses in male fertility assessment. The authors analyzed 5132 semen samples from 2566 men and demonstrated that only 51.2% of cases in the second analysis confirmed the initial results. Mallidis et al. investigated 673 semen samples obtained from seven healthy men over a seven-year period and revealed noticeable within-subject variations in sperm concentration, ejaculate volume, and motility index.

### Ten years' experience with an external quality control program for semen analysis [^113MGXrp]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To gauge the performance of laboratories and impact of the German semen analysis external quality control program (QuaDeGA) over its first 10 years.

Design

Retrospective analysis of QuaDeGA's twice yearly distribution of fixed semen samples and electronic material documenting sperm motility. Ranking of each participant's responses was determined according to their relation to a "target window".

Setting

Multicenter. PAITENT(S): Healthy donors.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Laboratory performance, World Health Organization (WHO) adherence.

Result(S)

Over 19 runs, there was a steady increase of participants (280 laboratories), the largest group being private urologic practices. Although use of WHO-recommended Neubauer chamber (from 33% to 55%) and diluent (from 11% to 32%) increased, the opposite occurred with morphology staining protocols (from 41% to 19%). Overall, < 8% of laboratories truly followed WHO guidelines. Median-based comparisons, replacing reference laboratories, resulted in a merging of performance rankings regardless of the protocols used.

Conclusion(S)

Adherence to WHO recommendations is low, with the majority of laboratories using methods expressly opposed by the guidelines. Participation in QuaDeGA was found to improve the performance of the laboratories involved in the program. However, the use of median-based ranking, while decreasing the extent of variance between laboratories, brings into question the significance of the rankings.

### Evolution of the basic semen analysis and processing sperm [^114Tvayk]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The sixth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen was recently published with specific step-by-step instructions for semen evaluation and sperm processing. Point-of-care (POC) testing for semen evaluation and microfluidics for sperm processing are rapidly evolving technologies that could impact how we evaluate and process sperm. Understanding the updated manual in the context of these novel technologies is important.

Recent Findings

Proper standardization of semen evaluation and sperm processing will allow for consistent high-quality results among laboratories worldwide. POC testing could improve access to semen evaluations that generate referrals to male infertility specialists for further assessment. Microfluidics can select functional sperm with decreased DNA fragmentation in semen and testicular biopsy samples for assisted reproductive technology (ART). Clinical outcomes, such as pregnancy rates and live birth rates, have not been shown to be consistently improved with these technologies compared to conventional techniques, although high level evidence research in this area is limited.

Summary

POC testing and microfluidics have the potential to be combined with machine learning technologies to improve fertility care. If these technologies are appropriately optimized, they could change how we evaluate and process sperm, and potentially lead to improved ART outcomes.

### Circulating sex hormone levels in relation to male sperm quality [^111vLKNj]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Method

Study population

This study included a cohort of men in subfertile couples who sought evaluation and treatment at Nanjing Jinling Hospital between August 2012 and June 2015. They were aged 18 to 50 years, and their partners had not conceived within 12 months after stopping use of contraception. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about occupation, lifestyle factors (e.g. alcohol consumption and smoking history), and medical and reproductive history. After undergoing physical examination, they provided semen specimens and fasting venous blood. Exclusion criteria included azoospermia or current use of exogenous hormones. Among 338 eligible participants, 305 (90.2%) had normal semen concentrations, 189 (55.9%) had normal sperm total motility, and 229 (67.8%) had normal sperm morphology, according to the 2010 WHO reference values. A total of 165 (48.8%) men had one or more parameter below the reference value. This study was approved by the Human Subject Committees of Nanjing Jinling Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Analysis of semen parameters

Semen specimens were collected through masturbation after 2–7 days of sexual abstinence according to the 2010 WHO guidelines. After liquefaction at 37 °C, total sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility were analyzed using a computer-aided sperm analysis system (CFT-9201; Jiangsu Rich Life Science Instrument Co. Ltd. Nanjing, China). Sperm morphology was evaluated using Diff-Quik staining according to the manufacture's protocol (Nanjing Xindi Biological Pharmaceutical Engineering Co. Ltd. Nanjing, China). At least 200 spermatozoa were counted for each specimen, and the experiments were performed at least twice.

### Role of semen analysis in subfertile couples [^113W5gqW]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the associations between the results of the male partner's semen analysis (classified according to the World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) and fathering a child without any treatment.

Design

Prospective multicenter cohort study.

Setting

Twenty subfertility centers in The Netherlands.

Patient(S)

A total of 3,345 consecutive couples presenting for subfertility.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Associations between the results of the male partner's semen analysis, classified according to the WHO criteria, and fathering a child without any treatment within a time horizon of 1 year. Subsequently, we redefined semen quality criteria and reevaluated the associations.

Result(S)

Follow-up data of 3,129 couples (94%) were available, of which 517 (17%) had a healthy pregnancy without treatment. The 1-year pregnancy rate in men with WHO normozoospermia did not differ significantly from that in men with WHO impaired semen (24% vs. 23%). In contrast, we observed lower chances of fathering a child for sperm concentrations < 40 × 10⁶/mL, total sperm count < 200 × 10⁶, and sperm morphology < 20% normal forms. With a multivariable regression model based on the redefined male semen subfertility criteria we were able to make a finer differentiation between subfertile men, with probabilities of fathering a child ranging from 7% to 41%.

Conclusion(S)

The current WHO criteria for semen quality do not discriminate between fertile and subfertile men. Our redefined and graded semen criteria have strong predictive value. If interpreted correctly, the fast and inexpensive semen analysis remains the gold standard for defining a man's role in subfertility.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^115j93tc]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The fourth edition

In 1999, the WHO/HRP fourth edition of the semen manual was published. This revision was in response to advances in the genetics of male infertility (Y chromosome microdeletions); the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection; the demonstration of contraceptive efficacy of hormonally induced suppression of spermatogenesis; and reports of declining sperm counts and increasing incidence of testicular cancer. These factors added urgency to the search for new methods to achieve better standardization and improved procedures for semen analysis. The WHO sought advice from experts throughout the world via letters, journals, and national andrology societies and formed a working group to revise the manual. The fourth edition of the WHO semen manual was a companion to the WHO Manual for the Standardized Investigation and Diagnosis of the Infertile Couple. In this fourth edition, the multiple sperm defects index and the hypoosmotic swelling test were added to the optional tests, and measurement of reactive oxygen species was added to the research test. Importantly, the quality control section was expanded to include statistical consideration of counting errors. Again, in Appendix — "Reference Values for Semen Variables" — it was clearly stated that these reference values are not to be used as the minimum/lowest semen values compatible with fertility in vitro or in vivo. Taking into consideration the comments from the prior edition, this edition left the morphology variable blank with a note suggesting that a percent normal morphology < 15% may be associated with a lower in vitro fertilization rate (Table 2). This fourth edition of the WHO Semen Manual was considered a significant improvement in the description and standardization of techniques, and the demand for the manual was high.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^111kZCjD]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

As stated clearly in all editions of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, the goal of the manual is to meet the growing needs for the standardization of semen analysis procedures. With constant advances in andrology and reproductive medicine and the advent of sophisticated assisted reproductive technologies for the treatment of infertility, the manual has been continuously updated to meet the need for new, evidence-based, validated tests to not only measure semen and sperm variables but also to provide a functional assessment of spermatozoa. The sixth edition of the WHO manual, launched in 2021, can be freely downloaded from the WHO website, with the hope of gaining wide acceptance and utilization as the essential source of the latest, evidence-based information for laboratory procedures required for the assessment of male reproductive function and health.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on male sexual and reproductive health: 2025 update on male infertility [^113Z8rut]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

To present a summary of the updated 2025 European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines on Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) on male infertility, providing practical recommendations on the clinical work-up with a focus on diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.

Methods

For the 2025 SRH guidelines, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough urological assessment of all men seeking medical help for fertility problems to ensure appropriate treatment. The guidelines also stress the clinical relevance of a parallel investigation of the female partner during the diagnostic and management work-up of the infertile couple, to promote shared-decision making in terms of timing and therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the guidelines recommend to counsel all infertile men and men with abnormal semen parameters on the associated health risks. Key changes in the male infertility guidelines for 2025 include: the addition of two new sections addressing exome sequencing and probiotic treatment; and significant update of the evidence base and recommendations for the diagnostic work-up of male infertility.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2025 SHR guidelines offers valuable insights into the diagnosis, classification, treatment and follow-up of male factor infertility and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

### Reference value of semen quality in Chinese young men [^112UmgTi]. Contraception (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate semen quality in young Chinese men and to establish reference values. Normal healthy young men from seven geographical areas were enrolled. The study showed that the mean sperm volume was 2.61 mL, and mean percent of sperm with forward progression was 59.89, while median of semen viability was 79.0%, and geometric mean of semen density was 55.45 × 10⁶/mL. Proportion of routine semen indexes that met World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were as follows: 81.9% for semen volume, 91.1% for liquefaction time, 93.4% for viscosity, 90.8% for pH, 81.3% for sperm with forward progression, 65.3% for sperm viability, 93.8% for semen density, 98.8% for normal sperm morphology, and 89.1% for total sperm count. Participants whose sperm met all WHO standard parameters accounted for 42.3%. Because the infertility rate in China is about 10–15%, the fifteenth percentile of semen parameters might be used as the lower limit of reference values, which may be more appropriate for young Chinese men. The fifteenth percentiles of parameters in this study were as follows: 1.5 mL for semen volume, 7.2 for pH value, 45% for proportion of sperm with forward progression, 68% for sperm viability, 30 × 10⁶/mL for semen density, 68% for proportion of sperm with normal morphology, and 50 × 10⁶ for total sperm count.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^111sT83M]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the past 40 years, since the publication of the original WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, the laboratory methods used to evaluate semen markedly changed and benefited from improved precision and accuracy, as well as the development of new tests and improved, standardized methodologies. Herein, we present the impact of the changes put forth in the sixth edition together with our views of evolving technologies that may change the methods used for the routine semen analysis, up-and-coming areas for the development of new procedures, and diagnostic approaches that will help to extend the often-descriptive interpretations of several commonly performed semen tests that promise to provide etiologies for the abnormal semen parameters observed. As we look toward the publication of the seventh edition of the manual in approximately 10 years, we describe potential advances that could markedly impact the field of andrology in the future.

Zinc supplementation elevates LMW-Zn% in seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic subjects to more than normal value, that's may be because its enhancement the synthesis of metallothioneins (Low molecular weight zinc binding protein). The increment of LMW-Zn% not coming from the degradation of semenogelin because Zn²+ acts to inhibit the protease activity of prostate-specific antigen. The increment of LMW-Zn% after supplementation is not harmful to spermatozoa because it's not generating from the degradation of semenogelin, i.e. it's not contain 14 kDa fragment of semenogelin which has an inhibitory effect on ejaculated spermatozoa.

DIALOG: You can discuss this article with its authors and other readers at

With the publication of the 6th edition of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, the advances in the field of andrology to date are evident and reflect over 40 years of technical refinement of the routine semen analysis that improved the precision and accuracy of the procedure as well as the addition of new tests to evaluate semen characteristics or sperm function together with the removal of tests that are no longer widely employed (e.g. the postcoital cervical mucus penetration test). In this article, we look toward the future and discuss some of the impacts of this work to date, the emerging areas for the development of new procedures, as well as a glimpse of the future and thoughts about where the field will be headed over the next 10 years of the publication of this manual and its new editions to come.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^113PFqL6]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen has undergone five revisions (Table 1) to meet the needs of laboratories performing semen analyses. Continuous improvement/updating of the manual occurs every 8 to 10 years to introduce new and emerging tests for research and clinical validation of significance into practice. The goals of this laboratory manual remain the same. It is designed for everyone who uses semen analyses to understand the function of the male reproductive function and dysfunction, diagnose and plan treatment of the infertile couple, assess sperm output and other variables following male contraception, and conduct epidemiological and other research studies of, among others, potential environmental pollutants and other toxicants on male reproductive function.

### Outcomes of fertility investigations in a cohort of adults with perinatally acquired HIV-1 infection: a UK cross-sectional observational study [^112Zie2m]. AIDS (2021). Medium credibility.

Adults with perinatally acquired HIV (PaHIV) have undergone puberty with a chronic viral infection, exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and in some cases severe ill-health. We hypothesize that fertility in adults with PaHIV may be impaired.

We aimed to evaluate outcomes of fertility investigations in a cohort of adults with PaHIV.

This was a single-centre cross-sectional observational study. Patients aged 18 years or over with PaHIV attending a specialist HIV service in London, UK between February 2018 and July 2019 were invited to participate.

Demographic information collected included age, ethnicity, BMI, nadir CD4 + count, smoking, alcohol and recreational drug use and past exposure to zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (DDI), stavudine (d4T) and efavirenz (EFV) (drugs previously shown to be associated with mitochondrial toxicity or sperm abnormalities).

Blood was taken for lymphocyte subsets and plasma HIV viral load testing. An additional sample was taken from women for anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels (a hormone produced by the granulosa cells of preantral and antral follicles, used as a biomarker of ovarian reserve). Female participants underwent transvaginal ultrasound (TVUSS) performed by a single gynaecologist at St Mary's Hospital, London to measure antral follicle count (AFC).

Male participants were given an appointment for semen production at Hammersmith Hospital, London. All samples were analysed according to WHO 2010 guidelines and UKNEQAS accreditation. Samples were produced on site following 2–7 days of sexual abstinence, and incubated at 37 °C for liquefaction, up to 60 min prior to analysis. Sperm morphology was analysed on Papanicolaou prestained slides, using Kruger strict criteria.

### Does outdoor air pollution cause poor semen quality? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117XSaCQ]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The effect of outdoor air pollution on semen volume

The pooled effect size of eight datasets of the association between air pollution and semen volume was WMD − 0.13 mL; 95%CI -0.21 to -0.05; P = 0.001, with no evidence of significant heterogeneity (I² = 32.1%, P = 0.172) (Fig. 2). The overall result of the meta-analysis was sensitive to the Zhou et al. (WMD − 0.01 mL; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.11) study. Sub-group analyses have revealed that air pollutants were associated significantly with semen volume in Asian (WMD − 0.16 mL; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.07), cross-sectional/case-control (WMD − 0.20 mL; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.11), and high quality (WMD − 0.12 mL; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.04) studies (Table 2).

The effect of outdoor air pollution on total sperm count

Nine studies assessed the relationship between air pollution and sperm count, and no association was observed (WMD − 27.37 × 10⁶; 95% CI, -85.39 to 30.64; P = 0.34), with evidence of significant heterogeneity (I² = 98.1%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3). Excluding individual studies did not change the overall meta-analysis results. The heterogeneity has decreased significantly in the sub-group of Asian (WMD − 0.52 × 10⁶; 95% CI, -9.32 to 8.26), cohort (WMD 4.54 × 10⁶; 95% CI, -13.24 to 22.33), and high-quality (WMD − 0.73 × 10⁶; 95% CI, -9.03 to 7.56) studies (Table 2).

### Peculiarities of semen coagulation and liquefaction in males from infertile couples [^112eWeUg]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

The results of electrosemengraphy showed frequent absence of postejaculatory semen coagulation (62% of patients examined) and 3 variants of ejaculate liquefaction in males from infertile couples. Semen liquefaction was mostly of a cascade nature (one- and two-cascade types), but viscid ejaculates often liquefied slowly and monotonously (monotonous type of liquefaction).

### Processing of semen can result in increased sperm DNA fragmentation [^115osmZF]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Processing of semen for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) entails a number of procedures that include semen liquefaction, removal of seminal plasma by centrifugation, incubation, and cryopreservation. The results of this study indicate that incubation of semen at room temperature and semen cryopreservation can result in increased levels of sperm DNA fragmentation.

### Idiopathic male infertility is strongly associated with aberrant DNA methylation of imprinted loci in sperm: a case-control study [^116qGZ9N]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Subject recruitment and sample collection

Study subjects were volunteers form affiliated hospitals of Nanjing Medical University between July 2009 and September 2010. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University, and subjects gave written informed consent. All activities involving human subjects were done under full compliance with the government policies and the Helsinki Declaration. Consecutive eligible men (without diagnosed infertile wives) were recruited to participate, 196 in total were asked. Of those approached, 87.2% consented (171 participants). A completed physical examination including height and weight was performed, and a questionnaire was used to collect information including personal background, lifestyle factors, environmental and occupational exposures, genetic risk factors, and medical history. Men with immune infertility, semen non-liquefaction, and medical history of risk factors for infertility (e.g. varicocele, orchidopexy, or postvasectomy), and receiving treatment for infertility (e.g. hormonal treatments) were excluded from the study (15 of 171 subjects). Men with other known causes related to male infertility, such as genetic disease, infection, and occupational exposure to the agents suspected to be associated with male reproduction, were also excluded (13 of 156 subjects). Furthermore, to avoid azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia caused by Y chromosome microdeletions, we excluded subjects with Y chromosome microdeletions of the azoospermia factor region (8 of 143 subjects). We selected 59 fertile men from the early pregnancy registry, from the same hospitals as the cases. All controls were healthy men with normal reproductive function and confirmed to have healthy babies 6–8 months later. All subjects were Han Chinese who came from Nanjing and neighborly suburban area.

Semen analysis

Semen samples were obtained in private by masturbation into a sterile wide-mouth and metal-free glass container after a recommended at least 3-day sexual abstinence. After liquefaction at 37 °C for 30 min, conventional semen analysis was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen (World Health Organization, 1999), including semen volume, sperm number per ejaculum, sperm concentration, motility, progression, and motion parameters. Strict quality control measures were enforced throughout the study. Observation and counting in the semen analysis were automatic, and the backgrounds of the samples were blinded to avoid bias.

### Response of semen parameters to three training modalities [^111749qi]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of different training modalities on various markers of semen quality.

Design

Crossover study.

Setting

Medical school.

Patient(S)

Forty-five men participated voluntarily in the study, being allocated into three groups according to their sports practice.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sperm parameters (volume, liquefaction time, pH, viscosity, sperm count, motility, and morphology).

Result(S)

Sperm concentration; total sperm number; type "a", "b", and "d" velocity; and morphology were significantly different among the practitioners of the three different training modalities. Morphology was the parameter showing the greatest difference, even reaching clinical relevance for the triathlete group (4.7%, poor prognosis pattern). In addition, these parameters tended to decrease as training requirements increased.

Conclusion(S)

There are differences in the seminal profiles of individuals exercising in different modalities. The differences are more marked as intensity and volume of exercise increase, especially for morphology. These variables ought to be carefully analyzed and taken into account when designing a training protocol, especially with higher-level athletes, so that reproductive function is not compromised.

### Approach to male infertility and induction of spermatogenesis [^115TKAeX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Male subfertility is common, and it causes significant duress to couples. Although the most common cause of male subfertility is idiopathic failure of spermatogenesis, a significant percentage of male subfertility is medically treatable. Compared to reproductive specialists, endocrinologists may see a population of men that have a higher prevalence of treatable causes of subfertility including sexual disorders, endocrinopathies, obesity, drugs, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Seminal fluid analysis is the most important diagnostic study, and at least 2 samples should be analyzed. All patients with sperm concentrations < 10 million/mL due to idiopathic spermatogenic defects should be referred for genetic counseling and karyotyping; most experts also recommend that these patients be tested for Y chromosomal microdeletions. For most men with low sperm concentrations due to gonadotropin deficiency, gonadotropin therapy effectively increases spermatogenesis. The endocrinologist must recognize when to use medical therapy to stimulate spermatogenesis and when to refer for consideration of assisted reproductive technology.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^115iaj6B]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The second edition

The second, third, and fourth editions of the WHO semen manual were led by G.M.H. Waites, Ph.D. then as area Research Manager within HRP, in response to the developments in andrology, with increasing awareness of the importance of the objective assessment of the quality and functional characteristics of human spermatozoa (Table 1). More importantly, semen analysis was established as an important tool in assessing the male partner, with the rapid development of assisted reproductive techniques. A working group of experts in semen analysis, andrology, and reproductive medicine were constituted to revise the semen manual. The second edition was published in 1987. Among the included changes from the first edition was the division of semen analysis into standard (all tests described in the 1980 manual plus antisperm antibody tests) and optional tests, including semen culture, seminal fluid biochemical tests, zona-free hamster oocyte penetration test, and sperm migration test ("swim-up"). The section on semen-cervical mucus interaction was not changed. Importantly, the second edition introduced the "normal" values for sperm variables based mainly on the early studies of Macleod and Gold in 1951, which was updated in 1979 with consensus-based modifications. The manual suggested that these values from such large-scale studies may be used by laboratories to guide the interpretation of semen analysis results. However, it was noted that although the data of Macleod et al. were obtained from large numbers of fertile and infertile men, the time taken to achieve a pregnancy in the female partner was not defined. The manual suggested that "normal values" should be evaluated from men who had achieved pregnancy with their partner within 12 months (Table 2). Appendices were expanded to provide technical details of some of the procedures. This 1987 version, translated into seven languages, was used in WHO Andrology Workshops that were held in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe with a hands-on demonstration of semen analysis techniques.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^112MkdKu]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Paradigm shift in the pathway for investigations and diagnosis of male factor infertility

Semen analysis, along with physical examination and history, is the cornerstone in the diagnosis of male factor infertility. Currently, the analysis needs to be performed in a laboratory. However, in the 6th edition, there is a discussion on emerging technologies (Chapter 4.6 of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen), which may widen the availability of semen analysis into the community. One aspect identified was the potential use of home assays for the assessment of sperm motility. With the recent implementation of widespread telemedicine for several types of clinical office visits, it is not surprising that home assays for a variety of clinical diagnostic tests would be created. At-home testing in andrology has a long history, and several new tests that assess sperm motility and/or concentration were recently launched. A number of kits commercially available today have yet to be rigorously evaluated in large-scale trials, including comprehensive comparisons with standardized laboratory methods, so their current clinical value in diagnosis is limited. However, technology is rapidly evolving, and as the assays improve, it is very likely that men assessing their own samples (providing robust and acceptable diagnostic information) will be a reality in the next 5 years. Therefore, patients will have a pivotal role to play in their own health management as witnessed in several other arenas, for example, blood glucose levels for diabetes and retinal imaging. Once the technologies are demonstrated to be accurate and precise, there is a need to determine the role these assays play in the patient diagnostic pathway, for example, are they additional, complementary, or replacement tests, and can they be used to triage patients? The tests may be cheaper and easier to use than traveling to andrology laboratories for semen analysis. They can be used in large-population–based studies of lifestyle changes or potential environmental exposures and may help to identify infertility in men. Certainly, these at-home or mail-in test kits could be particularly important for those living in rural or underdeveloped areas lacking sufficient healthcare, and at the very least, they may provide the patient with some data on their semen parameters pointing to the need for a clinical evaluation and diagnostic semen analysis if abnormalities are present. If positive answers are forthcoming, this will significantly increase effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has indicted that we can do more at-home testing to manage our healthcare than previously recognized.

### Semen quality and age-specific changes: a study between two decades on 3, 729 male partners of couples with normal sperm count and attending an andrology laboratory for infertility-related problems in an Indian city [^114v4ejR]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the semen quality and age-specific changes in men between the 1980s and 2000s.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Andrology laboratory, University of Calcutta, India.

Patient(S)

A semen sample was obtained from 3729 men presenting for infertility problems in two distinct decades, that is, between 1981–85 and 2000–2006.

Intervention(S)

Subjects with sperm count > 20 x 10(6)/mL without any extreme pathological disorders were selected. Samples having a major liquefaction problem were excluded.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

A standard World Health Organization procedure for semen analysis was performed that included assessment of volume, sperm concentration, and percentage motility. The motility parameters were further classified into forward progressive motility and nonprogressive motility.

Result(S)

The present large-scale study confirms a significant decline in the sperm motility parameters and seminal volume in the present decade. However, no change in overall sperm concentration was noted. A decline was seen in sperm motility with increasing age in both decades.

Conclusion(S)

There are significant changes in sperm motility and volume between the two decades, and the age-related changes in semen parameters are also different in the two decades.

### Prior fertility in the male partner does not predict a normal semen analysis [^111n9qiS]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

A history of male fertility is not an accurate predictor of a normal semen analysis result. The semen analysis should remain part of the evaluation of the infertile couple even in cases where a history of male fertility is reported.

### Male infertility [^117UX2fk]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

It is estimated that infertility affects 8–12% of couples globally, with a male factor being a primary or contributing cause in approximately 50% of couples. Causes of male subfertility vary highly, but can be related to congenital, acquired, or idiopathic factors that impair spermatogenesis. Many health conditions can affect male fertility, which underscores the need for a thorough evaluation of patients to identify treatable or reversible lifestyle factors or medical conditions. Although semen analysis remains the cornerstone for evaluating male infertility, advanced diagnostic tests to investigate sperm quality and function have been developed to improve diagnosis and management. The use of assisted reproductive techniques has also substantially improved the ability of couples with infertility to have biological children. This Seminar aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the assessment and management of men with infertility, along with current controversies and future endeavours.

### A comprehensive evaluation of pre-and post-processing sperm parameters for predicting successful pregnancy rate following intrauterine insemination with the husband's sperms [^112uaePT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Subjects

This was a retrospective cohort study enrolling infertile Chinese couples that underwent AIH at the fertility clinic of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between September 2018 and May 2020. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Protocol no. 2018–142).

Before the enrollment, the patients were diagnosed with the causes of infertility, with necessary assays to elicit etiologies. Female patients had hysterosalpingograms, and men had semen analyses. Causes of infertility were grouped into: (1) male factors, (2) female factors (ovulatory dysfunction, cervical factors, immune factors, endometriosis, endometriosis after pelvic plastic surgery, etc.), (3) combined male and female factors, and (4) unexplained infertility. Demographic data such as the age of the couple, duration of infertility, semen parameters before and after sperm processing, and the AIH outcomes were extracted from the patients' records. All pregnancies were confirmed by positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) in the serum 14 days after AIH. Exclusion criteria: (1) Those whose record writing is not standard. (2) Those whose semen sample was collected with an incorrect container, partially lost, or was sent for examination after more than 30 min. (3) Those had undergone antibacterial treatment. (4) Those with incomplete data regarding the pregnancy outcome or missing data on pre- and post-processing sperm parameters. Finally, a total of 3,522 AIH cycles from 1,918 infertile Chinese couples were retrospectively analyzed (Table 1).

Table 1
Patient demographics

Semen collection

Semen processing was performed as previously described. In brief, semen specimens were produced with masturbation in a collection room at the fertility clinic. The specimens were kept at 37℃ temperature and were examined within half an hour post collection. After complete liquefaction, all samples were evaluated in a blinded fashion by a qualified technician to prevent the interobserver variation based on WHO 2010 criteria.

### Effect of cell phone usage on semen analysis in men attending infertility clinic: an observational study [^115NuuUG]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of cell phone use on various markers of semen quality.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Three hundred sixty-one men undergoing infertility evaluation were divided into four groups according to their active cell phone use: group A: no use; group B: < 2 h/day; group C: 2–4 h/day; and group D: > 4 h/day.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sperm parameters (volume, liquefaction time, pH, viscosity, sperm count, motility, viability, and morphology).

Result(S)

The comparisons of mean sperm count, motility, viability, and normal morphology among four different cell phone user groups were statistically significant. Mean sperm motility, viability, and normal morphology were significantly different in cell phone user groups within two sperm count groups. The laboratory values of the above four sperm parameters decreased in all four cell phone user groups as the duration of daily exposure to cell phones increased.

Conclusion(S)

Use of cell phones decrease the semen quality in men by decreasing the sperm count, motility, viability, and normal morphology. The decrease in sperm parameters was dependent on the duration of daily exposure to cell phones and independent of the initial semen quality.

### The use of frozen embryos and frozen sperm have complementary IVF outcomes: a retrospective analysis in couples experiencing IVF / donor and IVF / husband [^117B7aqs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the institutional review board of the Ethical Committee of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University and written informed consent was obtained from all couples. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

We retrospectively analyzed the IVF treatment of couples experiencing infertility with frozen-thawed donor sperm (Group IVF/D) or fresh husband sperm (Group IVF/H) at Shanghai Ji Ai Genetics and IVF Institute (Jan. 2013-Feb. 2019), after which we followed up until the birth of the baby. For Group IVF/D, the donor's inclusion criteria were normal sperm parameters above World Health Organization guidelines. For Group IVF/H, the husband's inclusion criteria were also normal sperm parameters according to World Health Organization guidelines. The inclusion criteria for women in both groups were those undergoing their first IVF-ET cycle caused only by tubal obstruction factors. Women with premature ovarian failure, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chromosome abnormalities, habitual abortion and other diseases that cause infertility were all excluded from this study. In addition, male patients with anti-sperm antibodies, high DNA fragmentation index, non-ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, chromosome abnormalities and other diseases that cause infertility were also excluded.

The processing of the semen sample treatments was as follows: According to the World Health Organization guidelines, donors' semen samples were obtained by masturbation. After liquefaction of the fresh ejaculate, the specimens' characteristics were evaluated, such as volume, count and motility. The qualified donors followed the National Sperm Bank reference for semen parameters (before freezing: volume ≥ 2.0 ml, concentration ≥ 60 million/ml, progressive motility ≥ 60%, normal sperm morphology ≥ 70%; after thawing: concentration ≥ 15 million/ml, progressive motility ≥ 32%, normal sperm morphology ≥ 4%). On the day of egg collection by uterine surgery, the semen samples were thawed in a water bath at 37 ℃. Then, the semen sample was treated by the density gradient method (45% and 90% gradient solution, Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden), by which the samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 20 min. After removing the supernatant, the precipitate was washed with washing solution (Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden) and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min. For the husband, all the semen samples were obtained by masturbation on the day of egg collection by uterine surgery, and the fresh sperm were used in the IVF-ET cycles.

### How reliable are results from the semen analysis? [^115R96hp]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Based on the results of a number of studies that have evaluated the reliability of semen analysis testing, it would appear that there is a significant lack of standardization in the performance and reporting of semen analyses among laboratories. A large degree of variation and disagreement exists among different laboratories performing this test, and quality control procedures are not routinely performed in a majority of these laboratories. These observations significantly impact physicians who have to interpret and compare results among laboratories, who receive patients and test results referred from other clinics, or who have to rely on reference or other unknown laboratories for semen analysis testing.

### 2016 laboratory guidelines for postvasectomy semen analysis: association of biomedical andrologists, the British andrology society and the British Association of Urological Surgeons [^114wL3tU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Post-vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA) is the procedure used to establish whether sperm are present in the semen following a vasectomy. PVSA is presently carried out by a wide variety of individuals, ranging from doctors and nurses in general practitioner (GP) surgeries to specialist scientists in andrology laboratories, with highly variable results. Key recommendations are that: (1) PVSA should take place a minimum of 12weeks after surgery and after a minimum of 20 ejaculations. (2) Laboratories should routinely examine samples within 4h of production if assessing for the presence of sperm. If non-motile sperm are observed, further samples must be examined within 1h of production. (3) Assessment of a single sample is acceptable to confirm vasectomy success if all recommendations and laboratory methodology are met and no sperm are observed. Clearance can then be given. (4) The level for special clearance should be < 100000/mL non-motile sperm. Special clearance cannot be provided if any motile sperm are observed and should only be given after assessment of two samples in full accordance with the methods contained within these guidelines. Surgeons are responsible both preoperatively and postoperatively for the counselling of patients and their partners regarding complications and the possibility of late recanalisation after clearance. These 2016 guidelines replace the 2002 British Andrology Society (BAS) laboratory guidelines and should be regarded as definitive for the UK in the provision of a quality PVSA service, accredited to ISO 15189:2012, as overseen by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).

### Sperm functional tests [^117SX1Ep]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Several semen parameters are used to discriminate the fertile male from the subfertile male. The most widely used parameters are sperm concentration, motility, progressive motility, and sperm morphology. Semen analysis is usually applied as described in the World Health Organization manual for semen analysis. In addition to a routine semen analysis, sperm functional tests have been described for many years, which in most cases are regarded as research tools and not part of the routine semen testing in an infertility clinic. In this review we report on the value of four sperm function tests: the sperm penetration assay, the sperm-zona pellucida binding tests, the acrosome reaction, and the hyaluronan binding assay. For each test we describe the current value, the indication for performing the test, how to interpret the results, and its therapeutic implications. Our data show that sperm functional assays are highly predictive of IVF outcome results and have the potential to assist in clinical decision making, especially to avoid the current long-standing treatment with IUI and to direct the patients to intracytoplasmic sperm injection without delay when sperm functional testing fails. We believe that advances in molecular biology techniques will allow us to develop simpler sperm function assays in the near future. This will undoubtedly help clinicians in optimizing male factor infertility diagnosis and treatment.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^113qHzeq]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Ten years after the fourth edition, the WHO considered revisions to the manual necessary because of advances in andrology technology and new tests that may be useful in the management of infertile couples with updated supporting evidence. After consultations with experts in the field and professional associations, the WHO/HRP, led then by Research Manager and later Director, M. Mbizvo, Ph.D. established an editorial committee with 20 members from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The committee nominated T. G. Cooper, Ph.D. from the Institute of Reproductive Medicine at the University of Münster, Münster, Germany, a WHO-collaboration center, as editor-in-chief with support from the WHO Secretariat. After receiving comments from laboratory technicians and scientists, this edition improved on the prior editions and provided a detailed description with a rationale of alternate methods, examples, notes, and comments for each procedure. Dr. Cooper and the editorial committee decided to edit the fifth edition in accordance with the principles of "Evidence Based Medicine". This led the editors to collect and critically appraise original clinical studies in the field of spermatology and the definition of evidence-based thresholds and reference values. Semen analyses procedures remained the same, but the emphasis was placed on counting errors when an inadequate number of spermatozoa are assessed. Sperm preparation techniques extended beyond the ejaculate and included the collection of spermatozoa from the testis and epididymis. A chapter on cryopreservation of spermatozoa was added. The quality control chapter was rewritten with suggestions on how to improve laboratory performance. Most importantly, the fifth edition for the first time provided reference ranges based on in vivo data derived from studies in fertile men with partners who conceived within 12 months. The lower fifth centile was used as the lower reference range with a clear statement indicating that this lower limit does not distinguish subfertile and fertile men and that clinical information must be used together with semen analyses data (Table 2).

### Limits of current male fertility testing [^114Ft3nh]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

In the current approach to male fertility testing, basic semen analysis has limitations as a predictor of fertility status, and the technology is fraught with variability. Nonetheless, it remains the cornerstone of the evaluation of the male infertility, and we recommend adherence to most recent World Health Organization guidelines. Although the current sperm function tests (bioassays) have important drawbacks, they are still valuable as research tools. Sperm quality assays with analysis of sperm DNA fragmentation need further investigation before they can be recommended for routine clinical use. The answer to the many current challenging questions relies on identifying spermatogenesis pathologies and the resulting sperm dysfunctions at the cellular and molecular levels. New discoveries may bring answers or new avenues to explore.

Azoospermia definition and clinical differentiation note that azoospermia is defined as the absence of sperm in the ejaculate, including after examination of a centrifuged semen pellet; men with azoospermia and small volume testes, elevated FSH and normal semen volume will typically have NOA, whereas men with normal testis volume (e.g., testis length > 4.6 cm), FSH < 7.6 and/or semen volume < 0.5 or 1.0 mL most likely have obstructive azoospermia, especially if the proximal epididymis is enlarged or the vasa deferentia are absent on exam.

### Are WHO recommendations to perform 2 consecutive semen analyses for reliable diagnosis of male infertility still valid? [^1168s8BQ]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated whether a second semen analysis as suggested by the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction would improve diagnostic reliability in the evaluation of male infertility.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed a total of 5,132 semen samples from 2,566 men who underwent at least 2 consecutive semen analyses at a university fertility center. Reproducibility and correlation between the first and second analyses were evaluated for sperm concentration, motility and morphology according to the WHO criteria as well as the total motile sperm count.

Results

Altogether 51.2% of the second analyses confirmed the initial findings according to WHO criteria and 60% confirmed them when applying total motile sperm count criteria. After finding normozoospermia on the initial analysis 27% of the second semen analyses were pathological. Following a first pathological semen analysis 23% of the second analyses were normal and 77% were pathological. The coefficient of variation ranged from 0.23 to 0.60. The Spearman correlation coefficient was high for sperm concentration (rₛ = 0.84) and normal morphology (rₛ = 0.80) but lower for progressive motility (rₛ = 0.57). The discriminating capacity of each semen parameter to distinguish between men with a normal vs a pathological second semen analysis was rather limited (ROC AUC 0.72 to 0.79).

Conclusions

In accordance with WHO recommendations 2 consecutive semen analysis should be performed.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^115pvhdn]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approaches will be improved: basic semen analysis will be standardized and thus the results comparable throughout the world

A plethora of data, including that from well-established Andrology External Quality Assurance schemes, independent of country of origin, demonstrate that there is considerable variability in the results of the basic semen analysis. There are several reasons for this, for example, lack of adherence to established methods, poor training, and/or the use of a variety of methods to perform the analysis. This variability has significant clinical ramifications because a semen analysis result in 1 laboratory may not be comparable to that in another. Moreover, it can make comparisons between data sets difficult. Although these issues are well documented and have been a continual source of concern, these challenges remain.

A focus of the 6th edition is to provide clear and standardized methods that focus among others on the basic analysis (Chapter 2 of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen). Providing simplified methods obviates a primary difficulty in performing high-quality semen analysis and helps address the reproducibility crisis that has beset semen analysis for a number of years. Moreover, because the basic techniques described are robust and easy to follow, it is anticipated that this will facilitate higher-quality training. However, on their own, simplified methods will not be sufficient. If, in the next 5–10 years, we are to achieve comparable results from semen analysis from different laboratories, complementary tactics need to be actioned.

Standard semen analysis

The sample was collected into a graduated glass measuring cylinder with a wide mouth. The volume was read directly from the graduations. Seminal fluid was left for 60 min at 37 °C to liquefy. After liquefaction, the sperm count and motility (progressive and total) was assessed using the Motility/Concentration module of the computer assisted semen analysis (CASA) system using MiraLab — Egypt (Mira 9000 Sperm Analyzer CASA software). For analysis, a Trinoculer Microscope with a plain objective lens (Olympus), equipped with phase contrast optics and a heated stage (37 °C), was used.

Morphology was assessed by the preparation of a smear and the application of the spermMac stain staining method (Fertipro, Belgium) as outlined by the WHO. Leukocyte concentration was determined using the peroxidase staining technique according to that of Politch and colleagues and first described by Endtz. Viability was assessed using an Eosin Y stain. A blinded observer scored 100 cells for stain uptake (dead cells) or exclusion (live cells). Seminal plasma was obtained by subjecting the semen samples after liquefaction to centrifugation at 7000 rpm. The supernatant fluid was separated into aliquots and stored at −30 °C until used to estimate the seminal plasma glucose and insulin levels.

### Are young men attempting to achieve paternity through intracytoplasmic sperm injection candidates for general health screenings? [^112LZeRL]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

It is now well established that men from infertile couples are at increased risk of a number of non-communicable diseases, both malignant and non-malignant. These findings call for reconsideration of the criteria for what can be considered as good health service when meeting men with fertility problems. Thus, it has been discussed if it is sufficient to only help these men to become fathers or if prevention of long-term morbidity and mortality also should be considered as standard care. Such routines in the management of men from infertile couples are currently not recommended, although the clinical guidelines from the European Association of Urology mention discussing general health status with men having fertility issues. One of the major obstacles in this regard is to define the subgroups of infertile men in whom such actions would be most feasible and cost-efficient.

The recently published article by Saffati et al. dives deep into the topic of male infertility and its long-term health consequences, where it provides valuable insight on how poor sperm quality as a proxy for general health could be implemented as a screening tool for young men in the future. While one could argue that reproductive ability as a screening tool for certain diseases in young men is worth to consider as a part of standard medical care, semen analysis as a screening tool has its downfalls.

Standard semen parameters are subject to significant intra-individual day-to-day variation, and therefore a single semen analysis may not be sufficient to identify high-risk subjects. Furthermore, not included in standard semen routine analyses, other sperm characteristics affecting fertility could also be impaired, as for example DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI). It has been shown that up to 25% of men from infertile couples with otherwise normal semen parameters, have an increased level of sperm DFI. High DFI is not only associated with decreased fertility, but also with impaired insulin sensitivity.

### Critical appraisal of World Health Organization's new reference values for human semen characteristics and effect on diagnosis and treatment of subfertile men [^113hMWrR]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

In 2010, the World Health Organization established new reference values for human semen characteristics that are markedly lower than those previously reported. Despite using controlled studies involving couples with a known time to pregnancy to establish the new limits, the reference studies are limited with regard to the population analyzed and the methods used for semen evaluation. The present review discusses concerns related to the new reference values for semen characteristics, including the effect on patient referral, diagnosis, and treatment of recognized conditions, such as varicocele, and on the indications for assisted reproductive technologies.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^115FmtzQ]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The launch of the sixth edition in 2021

On July 20, 2021, the WHO launched the sixth edition of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen through a webinar. In the press release, the WHO states "High-quality laboratory services are crucial for ensuring the value of research on health. Effective analysis and comparison of results across laboratories help to ensure that health care workers receive high-quality information, which in turn helps them to provide the best quality care. The sixth edition of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen replaces the 2010 version. It provides important information on semen examination and preparation for clinical evaluation, assessment, cryopreservation, quality control in the semen analysis laboratory, and laboratory examination in the investigation of male sexual and reproductive health".

Retaining the stated goals of the manual articulated with its first launch in 1980, this newest edition provides step-by-step, easy-to-follow procedures for technicians and scientists performing semen analyses. Consistent with previous editions, the sixth edition includes basic examination, semen volume, sperm motility, concentration, morphology, and vitality assessments as well as estimation of sperm numbers in samples with very low sperm concentration. Extended semen examination includes procedures to detect leucocytes, immature germ cells, sperm antibodies, indices of multiple sperm defects, and biochemical assessment and introduces methods to detect sperm aneuploidy, sperm genetics, and DNA fragmentation. Advanced examination replaced the prior research tests with extensive revisions and includes assessment of reactive oxygen species, membrane ion channels (new), acrosome reactions, and computer-assisted sperm analysis. Emerging new methods were briefly described, including tracking individual sperm cell motility and flagellar waveforms that may provide more information on the energetics of sperm movement. Continued improvement in digital camera technology in smartphones raises the possibility of initial semen assessment without a microscope. The zona-free hamster oocyte penetration test and human zona pellucida binding test are removed as these tests are rarely used in the laboratory because of difficulty in obtaining the test materials, lack of standardization, high labor intensity, and high cost. In addition, the availability of intracytoplasmic injection of sperm directly into oocytes eliminated the necessity of these tests. Chapters on sperm preparation and cryopreservation and internal and external quality control methods have been updated. The chapter on sperm interaction with cervical mucus has been eliminated, as the procedure is no longer being routinely performed as part of infertility investigation.

### An automated smartphone-based diagnostic assay for point-of-care semen analysis [^112xGE8U]. Science Translational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Male infertility affects up to 12% of the world's male population and is linked to various environmental and medical conditions. Manual microscope-based testing and computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) are the current standard methods to diagnose male infertility; however, these methods are labor-intensive, expensive, and laboratory-based. Cultural and socially dominated stigma against male infertility testing hinders a large number of men from getting tested for infertility, especially in resource-limited African countries. We describe the development and clinical testing of an automated smartphone-based semen analyzer designed for quantitative measurement of sperm concentration and motility for point-of-care male infertility screening. Using a total of 350 clinical semen specimens at a fertility clinic, we have shown that our assay can analyze an unwashed, unprocessed liquefied semen sample with < 5-s mean processing time and provide the user a semen quality evaluation based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines with ~98% accuracy. The work suggests that the integration of microfluidics, optical sensing accessories, and advances in consumer electronics, particularly smartphone capabilities, can make remote semen quality testing accessible to people in both developed and developing countries who have access to smartphones.

The third edition

Recognizing the rapid progress in assisted reproductive techniques used for the treatment of the infertile couple, the proliferation of many andrology laboratories in infertility treatment centers, the increasing concern about the putative effects or environmental pollutants on male reproductive function, and the need for new and better standard methods of semen analysis, the WHO laboratory manual was revised by a group of experts in 1992. The semen analysis section was divided into three sections standard procedures, optional tests, and research tests. The research tests included the zona-free hamster oocyte penetration test, human zona pellucida binding tests, acrosome reaction, and computer-assisted sperm analysis. The section on sperm-cervical mucus interaction was not significantly altered, but the title of this edition was changed to the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction. This edition contains two additional chapters relevant to the needs of laboratories, sperm preparation techniques and quality control of laboratory performance of semen analyses. In addition, in the appendices, this manual introduced basic safety guidelines and minimal equipment needed for any laboratory performing semen analysis. These additions were timely and responsive to the needs of many laboratories.

In the few years preceding the revision of the third edition of the manual, the classification of sperm morphology was changed based on the morphology of spermatozoa able to reach the oocyte and bind to the zona pellucida. Emerging evidence related to outcomes in in vitro fertilization suggested that pregnancy rates in the female partner were more frequent when normal sperm morphology was above 14%. In Appendix 1, the reference limits of semen variables were provided based on consensus limits in the first and second editions. It was noted that there were no population-based clinical studies on semen variables completed at that time, and an empirical reference value for sperm morphology in men was quoted as 30% without supportive data (Table 2). This empirical cut-point of 30% normal forms was reported not to be clinically useful as approximately half of fertile men had sperm morphology below this value. It is important to keep in mind that the criteria for characterizing human sperm morphology have changed substantially from those used by Macleod to the strict Tygerberg criteria.

### Genetically determined dosage of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) affects male reproductive parameters [^115M9BV9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Semen samples were obtained by masturbation and ejaculated into a collection tube in the privacy of a room near the laboratory. After ejaculation, the semen was incubated at 37 C for 30–40 min for liquefaction. Semen analysis was performed as recently described. Semen volume was estimated by weighing the collection tube with the semen sample and subsequently subtracting the predetermined weight of the empty tube, assuming 1 g = 1 ml. The motility assessment was performed in duplicate, and the average value was calculated for both samples. For assessment of the sperm concentration, the samples were diluted in a solution of 0.6 mol/liter NaHCO 3 and 0.4% (vol/vol) formaldehyde in distilled water. The sperm concentration was assessed using the improved Neubauer hemocytometers.

Physical examination for the assessment of genital pathology and testicular size was performed with the men in the standing position. If necessary, pathologies were clarified further with the men in the supine position. The orchidometer (made of birch wood; Pharmacia & Upjohn, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for assessment of testicular size. Participants of the study were examined by one (J.E. Riga) or two (M.P. and K. A. Tartu; V.M. and B.Z. Kaunas) investigators who had passed special training for standardization of the clinical examination immediately before the study. The total testes volume is the sum of the volume of right and left testicles.

Genotyping of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; −211 G/T from mRNA start site) was performed according to the established protocol using the restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The PCR primers and conditions (forward/reverse primers: 5′-GGAGCCAGATCATGAAATGTT-3′/5′-GACCAATGCTAGCCTGAAGC-3′) and the choice of the restriction enzyme (TatI; Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) for the G-allele-specific cutting of the PCR product was identical to the seminal study. The uncut PCR product (364 bp) representing the T-allele was separated from the restricted fragments (233 and 131 bp) resulting from the G-allele using electrophoreses in 2% agarose gel and 0.5X TBE buffer. On each analyzed gel were loaded positive control samples representing GG, GT, and TT individuals, whose rs10835638 genotype had been confirmed by sequencing.

### Semen assessment [^115EdnkS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Semen analysis initiates the evaluation of the male partner of an infertile couple, and is generally the first test ordered when a couple presents with concerns of infertility. This article outlines the steps involved in the initial evaluation of the man's fertility potential, the interpretation of the results, and the prognostic value of these results. A look into the future of this long-standing test concludes with some interesting concepts for male infertility evaluation.

### The correlation between sperm percentage with a small acrosome and unexplained in vitro fertilization failure [^115tcJ1t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

The percentage of sperm with a small acrosome and acrosin activity

Acrosin activity was determined after liquefaction. The results showed that with an increase in the percentage of sperm with a small acrosome, the value of acrosin activity was lower, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) (Table 1).

Table 1
Correlation of sperm percentage with acrosin activity

The percentage of sperm with a small acrosome and acrosome reaction

The spermatozoa were divided into dead sperm (the whole head of sperm was stained blue) and living sperm, which can be divided into three categories: "F" type (non-capacitated sperm, the whole acrosome was stained yellow); "B" type (capacitated but no acrosome reaction sperm, the acrosome was present, but a faint fluorescent zone appeared in the region behind the acrosome); and "AR" type (acrosome reactive sperm, the whole head was pale yellow or non-fluorescent). The tails of all spermatozoa were yellow (Fig. 3). "AR" % was calculated as "AR" type sperm / total sperm count × 100%.

Fig. 3
The patterns of chlortetracycline staining in human spermatozoa during capacitation. The 'F' pattern was characteristic of non-capacitated, acrosome-intact spermatozoa; and the 'AR' pattern was characteristic of acrosome reacted spermatozoa

Acrosome reaction was determined after liquefaction of semen samples. The results showed that the percentage of sperm with a small acrosome was negatively associated with the AR%. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05; Table 2).

### Evolution of the World Health Organization semen analysis manual: where are we? [^113cUYwH]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO (World Health Organization) manuals provide state-of-the-art guidance on how a semen analysis should be carried out. The much anticipated sixth edition of the WHO semen analysis manual has been released 10 years after its previous version and includes essential updates, such as new reference standards for semen volume and microscopic sperm characteristics of recent fathers. A well-conducted semen analysis remains an essential foundation of the infertility evaluation process and affects patient referral, diagnosis and treatment. However, a male infertility work-up primarily based on routine semen analysis does not provide men with an optimal fertility pathway; the primary reasons for routine semen analysis inadequacy in this context include its low predictive value for natural and assisted conception success, its inability to detect sperm DNA and epigenetic deficiencies that might negatively affect embryo development, implantation and offspring well-being, and the substantial overlap between semen parameters of fertile and subfertile individuals. Ideally, a full andrological assessment should be carried out by reproductive urologists in all men dealing with couple infertility and should include a detailed history analysis, physical examination, semen analysis, endocrine assessment and other tests as needed. Only through a complete male infertility work-up will relevant underlying medical and infertility conditions be revealed and potentially treated or alleviated. The ultimate goals of a comprehensive andrological assessment are to positively influence overall male health, pregnancy prospects and offspring well-being.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part I [^113cLaYx]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis/assessment/evaluation — testing and interpretation: The results from SA should be used to guide management of the patient, and results are of greatest clinical significance when multiple SA abnormalities are present (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should obtain hormonal evaluation including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone for infertile men with impaired libido, erectile dysfunction, oligozoospermia or azoospermia, atrophic testes, or evidence of hormonal abnormality on physical evaluation (Expert Opinion). Azoospermic men should be clinically evaluated to differentiate genital tract obstruction from impaired sperm production initially based on semen volume, physical exam, and FSH levels (Expert Opinion). Karyotype and Y-chromosome microdeletion analysis should be recommended for men with primary infertility and azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (< 5 million sperm/mL) with elevated FSH or testicular atrophy or a presumed diagnosis of impaired sperm production as the cause of azoospermia (Expert Opinion).

### Sperm deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation assessment in normozoospermic male partners of couples with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss: a prospective study [^114jaw8n]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether sperm DNA integrity in normozoospermic male partners plays a role in idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).

Design

Prospective, cohort study.

Setting

Academic tertiary care center.

Patient(S)

Group I: 26 male partners of women with unexplained RPL. Group II: 31 normozoospermic males with proven fertility.

Intervention(S)

Semen samples were collected by masturbation after 48–72 hours of abstinence. After liquefaction at room temperature, semen analysis was performed according to World Health Organization standards. Only samples with > 20 × 10(6) spermatozoa/mL with at least 50% progressive sperm motility and 30% normal morphology were selected for the study. DNA fragmentation of the sperm was assessed with TUNEL assay followed by flow cytometric analysis.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sperm DNA fragmentation in both groups.

Result(S)

Mean DNA fragmentation (mean ± SD) was significantly more in men with RPL (36.8 ± 5) compared with controls (9.4 ± 2.7).

Conclusion(S)

Sperm DNA fragmentation may play a role in unexplained RPL despite normal semen analysis parameters.

### Effect of semen collection location on semen parameters and fertility outcomes and implications for practice in the COVID-19 era: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies [^115NGmWF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

During the COVID-19 era, semen collection at infertility centers might increase the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2. Seminal fluid collection at home is an alternative method for preventing this spread. However, there is no conclusion about the effect of home vs clinic semen collection on semen parameters and assisted reproductive technology outcomes. This systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to assess the effect of semen collection location on semen parameters and fertility outcomes.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using the major electronic databases including MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, OpenGrey, and CENTRAL from their inception to September 2021.

Clinicaltrials

gov was searched to identify the ongoing registered clinical trials.

Study Eligibility Criteria

We included all human randomized controlled trials and observational studies that investigated the effect of at-home semen collection vs in-clinic semen collection on semen parameters and fertility outcomes.

Methods

We pooled the mean difference and risk ratio using Review Manager software version 5.4.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2022). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach was applied to assess the quality of evidence.

Results

Seven studies (3018 semen samples) were included. Overall, at-home semen collection results made little to no difference in semen volume (mean difference, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, -0.10 to 0.85; low-quality evidence), sperm count (mean difference, -6.02; 95% confidence interval, -27.26 to 15.22; very low-quality evidence), and sperm motility (mean difference, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, -4.39 to 5.92; very low-quality evidence) compared with in-clinic semen collection. There was no difference in fertilization rate (risk ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.03; very low-quality evidence) and pregnancy rate in in vitro fertilization (risk ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.25; very low-quality evidence).

Conclusion

At-home semen collection had no adverse effects on semen parameters or fertility outcomes compared with in-clinic collection. However, higher-quality evidence is needed.

### The clinical value of short-term insemination: a retrospective analysis of 3496 patients [^116eLuHq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Sperm preparation, in-vitro insemination and ICSI

According to World Health Organization standards, semen samples were collected from males after abstinence for 3–5 days on the day of partner oocyte retrieval. Following masturbation, semen was ejaculated into a sterile cup and allowed to liquefy for 30 min at room temperature. In accordance with the WHO guideline, embryologists prepared liquefied semen by routine discontinuous density gradient centrifugation and swim-up procedures. For subsequent fertilization, the processed sperm remained incubated. To allow fertilization to occur naturally, the IVF procedure was typically performed 39–40 h after HCG injection. We incubated each oocyte with about 20,000–30,000/ml motile sperm cells during routine and short-term IVF procedures. Prepared sperm were mixed with oocyte-cumulus complexes for overnight co-incubation for 16–18 h in routine IVF procedure. Conventional ICSI was directly performed 4–6 h after oocyte retrieval. When the patient had previous experienced fertilization failure in other centers before coming to our center for treatment or when his sperm density ≤ 5 × 10⁵/ml after the sperm preparation, the ICSI was directly conducted. The sperms with normal morphology were selected, and then injected into the cytoplasm of metaphase II (MII) oocytes.

Short-term IVF procedure, early second PB assessment, and early R-ICSI

The embryologist observed fertilization under an inverted microscope after co-incubation for 4–6 h. The release of the second polar body was used as an indicator for predicting fertilization. Specifically, after 4 h of insemination, oocytes were denuded from cumulus cells and the oocytes were immediately transferred to fresh cleavage medium for evaluation of fertilization by the presence of a second polar body. In cases where no more than 30% of oocytes released a second polar body, the observation will be extended to 6 h post-fertilization for a re-evaluation. If, at this stage, the percentage remains below 30%, the early R-ICSI will be carried out.

### Validity of a rapid assay for antisperm antibodies in semen [^1157ijfH]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the validity of a rapid assay for antisperm antibodies in semen.

Design

Prospective comparison of the results of standard and rapid antisperm antibody assays performed simultaneously.

Setting

Tertiary care infertility center.

Patient(S)

Couples who presented for infertility evaluation.

Intervention(S)

Semen analysis and measurement of antisperm antibodies in semen using a standard and a rapid immunobead binding test (IBT).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

[1] Comparison of sperm parameters between semen-containing antisperm antibodies and semen free of antisperm antibodies. [2] Validation of the rapid test by calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the rapid assay using the standard assay as a gold standard. [3] Cost comparison of the standard and rapid test.

Result(S)

[1] Nine semen specimens with antisperm antibodies had a significantly lower sperm concentration, motility, and total motile fraction compared to 44 specimens without antisperm antibodies. Also, specimens with antisperm antibodies had a significantly higher percentage of vibratory sperm and percent of bound antisperm antibodies. The strict morphology, liquefaction time, semen volume, and white blood cell concentration were no different between the two groups. [2] Using a threshold of ≥ 12% of bound antisperm antibodies in the rapid assay, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the test are 100% when correlated with a threshold of ≥ 20% in the standard assay. Increasing the threshold in the standard assay decreases the specificity and positive predictive value of the rapid assay but not the sensitivity and the negative predictive value. [3] The cost of the rapid assay was 16% that of the standard test and its performance took 20% of the time it took to set and perform the standard test.

Conclusion(S)

A rapid test for antisperm antibodies is valid, reliable, and more cost and labor effective than a standard IBT.

### Can semen analysis be utilized as a screening tool for overall health in young men? [^112kRgJT]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, semen analysis has been viewed solely as a tool for assessing male fertility. However, emerging research suggests that abnormal semen parameters may serve as indicators of broader health issues beyond reproductive function. Studies have revealed significant associations between abnormal semen parameters and an increased risk of chronic diseases such as prostate cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and metabolic disorders. These findings challenge the conventional understanding and position semen analysis as a potential screening tool for overall male health. The correlation between abnormal semen parameters and conditions like erectile dysfunction further underscores the multifaceted implications of semen quality. This suggests that abnormal semen parameters may be a risk factor for poorer overall health and a higher likelihood of developing comorbidities over time. Given these compelling associations, there is a growing call to integrate semen analysis into routine health assessments for young men, particularly in conjunction with established general health screenings. This proactive approach aligns with a preventative healthcare paradigm, facilitating early detection of underlying health concerns and timely interventions. However, overcoming cultural, logistical, and cost-related barriers is crucial for the successful implementation of this shift in reproductive health.

### Limitations of semen analysis as a test of male fertility and anticipated needs from newer tests [^112NiDnL]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Semen analysis is the first step to identify male factor infertility. Standardized methods of semen analysis are available allowing accurate assessment of sperm quality and comparison among laboratories. Population-based reference ranges are available for standard semen and sperm parameters. Sperm numbers and morphology are associated with time to natural pregnancy, whereas sperm motility may be less predictive. Routine semen analysis does not measure the fertilizing potential of spermatozoa and the complex changes that occur in the female reproductive tract before fertilization. Whether assisted reproduction technology (ART) is required depends not only on male factors but female fecundity. Newer tests should predict the success of fertilization in vitro and the outcome of the progeny.

### The diagnosis of azoospermia depends on the force of centrifugation [^113qF8b2]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the centrifugal force required to pellet sperm.

Design

Prospective, in vitro study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patient(S)

Men undergoing semen processing or postvasectomy semen analyses.

Intervention(S)

In Phase I, postvasectomy semen samples were centrifuged at 600 × g, and the pellets were examined. Supernatants from samples with no visible sperm underwent repeat centrifugation at 1,000 × g; the supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 3,000 × g. Pellets from both centrifugations were examined. Phase II examined nonazoospermic semen that was divided into 3 aliquots and centrifuged at 500, 1,000, and 3,000 × g. The supernatants were examined for the presence of sperm.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sperm presence in centrifuged pellets or seminal supernatant.

Result(S)

Phase I: After centrifugation at 1,000 × g and 3,000 × g, sperm were noted in 12% and 0% of samples, respectively. Phase II: Sperm were noted in the supernatant in 100% of samples subjected to 500 × g and 1,000 × g, and in 92% of samples subjected to 3,000 × g centrifugation.

Conclusion(S)

If sperm are in the seminal plasma, they will also be present in the pellet following centrifugation at a force of 1,000 x g or greater. Semen samples that appear azoospermic upon initial wet mount microscopy should be centrifuged at a minimum of 1,000 x g for 15 minutes.

### Semen analysis: looking for an upgrade in class [^113cdqBe]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature database regarding current methods for diagnosing male subfertility and to critique new testing methods that have the potential to be incorporated as part of routine semen analysis.

Design

Literature database review.

Setting

None.

Patient(S)

None.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

None.

Result(S)

Methods for performing high quality semen analysis are standardized and clearly presented in the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen. In spite of the fact that lower reference limits contained therein are now evidence-based, debate persists about their clinical value. One test put forth as being additive to the semen analysis is assessment of DNA integrity. However, due to lack of standardized methods and quality control measures, accessibility to instrumentation, and evidence-based reference values for clinical interpretation this test has not become incorporated into the clinical andrology mainstream. Novel tests that probe molecular function have emerged that also have promise for integration into routine clinical semen analysis.

Conclusion(S)

Semen analysis, when performed according to WHO guidelines, will yield accurate and precise clinical laboratory data on traditional semen parameters. Due to the biological nature of the specimen in question definitive diagnosis of subfertility and its cause(s) remains enigmatic. Novel tests that may be easily standardized for subsequent multi-center, prospective randomized trials need to be integrated so more meaningful clinical diagnoses can be made.

### Seminal plasma cfDNA fragmentomics landscape delineates male infertility subtypes [^11245Kgb]. Clinical Epigenetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Human sample collection and processing

The study included patients (diagnoses of VC [n = 14] and NOA [n = 19]), along with age-matched healthy controls provided SP (n = 18), and additional age-matched healthy controls provided plasma from a separate cohort (n = 20). Following 3–5 days of sexual abstinence, participants collected seminal samples via masturbation into sterile wide-mouthed containers. Semen samples were immediately transported to the laboratory. Samples that did not liquefy within 30 min at room temperature were excluded from the study, as incomplete liquefaction can affect cfDNA extraction efficiency and may reflect underlying prostatic abnormalities. All participants were Asian. Comprehensive demographic characteristics and clinical parameters are detailed in Supplemental Table. The study design is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Study design and analytical workflow

Firstly, we performed fragmentomic comparisons of seminal plasma cfDNA (n = 18) and blood plasma cfDNA (n = 20) using WGS and Jag-Seq, analyzing fragment size distribution, end motifs heat map, preferred end motif, jagged end length, methylation level, and the relationship of cfDNA size and jagged end length. Then we performed a translational application varicocele (n = 14) and nonobstructive azoospermia (n = 19) to develop a diagnostic model.

Sample collection and processing

Following 3–5 days of sexual abstinence, participants collected seminal samples via masturbation into sterile wide-mouthed containers. Semen samples were immediately transported to the laboratory for centrifugation at 4000× g (10 min, room temperature). The obtained SP was aliquoted and stored at – 80 °C until analysis.

Plasma from the blood samples was collected through centrifugation at 1600× g (10 min, 4 °C). The obtained plasma supernatant was aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C until analysis.

cfDNA extraction and quantification

cfDNA was extracted from approximately 0.4 mL of SP or plasma using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen). All cfDNA samples underwent dual quality assessment: purity analysis via NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and precise quantification using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The specific sequencing protocol are shown in Methods of Additional file.

### Relationship between sperm NAD + concentration and reproductive aging in normozoospermia men: a cohort study [^115x7ZD9]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Semen collection and analysis

The semen specimens were collected by masturbation after 2–7 days of sexual abstinence. Semen samples were masturbated into a sterile plastic container and then transferred to our andrology laboratory. Incubation at 37 °C for 30 min was performed to allow liquefaction. After liquefaction, the semen volume was evaluated by weighing. A computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) system (CFT-9200, Ruiqi, Jiangsu, China) was used to measure the semen parameters (sperm count and motility). A macro spermatozoa-counting chamber (Yuancheng, Nanjing, China) with a 10 μm depth was used to evaluate the semen samples. According to WHO guidelines for each measurement, at least 400 spermatozoa were analyzed.

Sperm chromatin integrity was assessed by a flow cytometric-based sperm degree of DNA fragmentation chromatin structure assay (SCSA, CellPro Biotech, Ningbo, China). The assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) was used to express the sperm chromatin integrity.

AUA/ASRM male infertility guideline — assessment recommendations state that for initial infertility evaluation, both male and female partners should undergo concurrent assessment (Expert Opinion). Initial evaluation of the male for fertility should include a reproductive history (Clinical Principle), and initial evaluation of the male should also include one or more semen analyses (SAs) (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Men with one or more abnormal semen parameters or presumed male infertility should be evaluated by a male reproductive expert for complete history and physical examination as well as other directed tests when indicated (Expert Opinion).

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^113oAAMY]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Another aspect to improving standards in basic semen analysis is the very recent development of a formal International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard (23162:2021) for Basic Semen Examination. This is the first time that this has been achieved. The ISO standards are based on the same principles as the sixth edition of the manual and specify the minimum requirements for equipment and critical aspects of methods for best practice. Adoption of these standards will support laboratories seeking accreditation. Moreover, because ISO is applicable through the world, adherence to this standard is likely to be manifested in an overall improvement in quality of semen assessment globally.

The reproducibility of scientific data is, of course, not a unique problem for andrology. Several tools suggested to address these challenges include the provision of robust materials and methods and checklist for publication in journals, for example, STAR methods in Cell Press journals. In andrology, we now have clear robust methods, and with new educational methods to use for staff training, we can look forward to a world where a robust semen analysis is the norm.

### Association of exposure to particulate matter air pollution with semen quality among men in China [^112KSasL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Study Population

This retrospective cohort study consisted of male patients who visited the Reproductive Medical Center of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital in Shanghai, China, and whose wives were seeking assisted reproductive technology procedures from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2019. Men were excluded once any of the following conditions were met: chromosomal abnormality, varicocele, azoospermia, difficult sperm retrieval, reproductive tract infection, genital tract trauma, history of mumps, and vasectomy surgery.

The included participants were interviewed, and data on detailed residential address, age, ethnicity, body weight and height, educational level, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption were collected by trained physicians. Because all data were used anonymously, written consent was not obtained from each participant. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Semen Analysis

After their number of abstinence days were recorded, the participant's semen samples were collected via ejaculation and liquefied in a 37 °C heating chamber for no more than 60 minutes. The semen parameters of sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility (total and progressive) were evaluated using a computer-assisted semen analysis system (SSA-II; Beijing Suijia Software Co, Ltd) according to the World Health Organization guidelines for the examination of human semen. The detailed descriptions of the computer-assisted semen analysis are provided in eMethods of the Supplement.

Sperm motility parameters included progressive and total motility. Motility was graded as follows: A indicated rapid progressive motility; B, slow progressive motility; C, local motility; and D, immotility. Progressive motility was defined as the proportion of rapid and slow-progressive spermatozoa. Nonprogressive motility was defined as the proportion of spermatozoa with local motility. Total motility was calculated by summing progressive and nonprogressive motilities. Quality control procedures were established by the semen laboratory according to World Health Organization (2010) guidelinesand were routinely conducted by laboratory technicians. All tests were in agreement with the quality control standards.
