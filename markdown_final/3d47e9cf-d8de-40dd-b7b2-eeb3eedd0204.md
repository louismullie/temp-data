## Question

What is the workup and treatment for major depressive disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the step-by-step workup and treatment plan for major depressive disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about screening and when to screen. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and differential diagnosis. Next, I will consider severity stratification and functional assessment. After that, I need to review initial treatment selection by severity and patient preference, including special populations. Then, I should confirm monitoring and response thresholds. Finally, I will examine management of inadequate response, maintenance and relapse prevention, and documentation and follow-up, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm screening recommendations and tools. Routine screening for depression is recommended in adults and adolescents when systems are in place for accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, with the PHQ-2 as a brief screen and PHQ-9 for severity quantification, but I should double-check that PHQ-9 is not used in isolation to make a diagnosis, which the VA/DoD explicitly discourages even though it supports using PHQ-9 for measurement-based care and monitoring [^111Fu2yJ] [^1139m7XG] [^112DFH34] [^115Qxpgq].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic workup elements before moving to treatment. A comprehensive evaluation should confirm DSM-5 criteria, assess functional status, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, past treatment history, family history including mood disorders and suicide, substance use, and perform a mental status and focused physical exam, with labs as indicated to exclude medical causes such as hypothyroidism or B12 deficiency. I need to ensure suicide risk is assessed at every visit with specific inquiry about ideation, intent, plans, means, and protective factors, and I should also screen for bipolar disorder given misdiagnosis risk and the implications for antidepressant use [^111VP2Lj] [^116SNdKt] [^114keWUx] [^112aqkQ6].

> Hold on, I should verify severity stratification and how it guides treatment. Severity can be anchored to PHQ-9 ranges, but I need to remember that PHQ-9 thresholds differ slightly across sources. The VA/DoD uses 5–9 mild, 10–14 moderate, 15–19 moderately severe, and ≥ 20 severe, whereas some literature uses 10–14 for mild MDD, 15–19 for moderate, and > 20 for severe, so I should reconcile this by emphasizing functional impairment and distress alongside the scale rather than relying on a single cutoff, and I will document chronicity if symptoms persist beyond two years or if there are recurrent episodes [^1172csJX] [^112wSsbF] [^1125sNdD].

> Next, I should review initial treatment selection for mild severity. For mild MDD, monotherapy with psychotherapy such as CBT or IPT is reasonable, and medication may be deferred. I need to ensure patient preference drives the choice and that we avoid unnecessary polypharmacy early on, while also considering digital CBT options if access is limited, and I should confirm that APA and ACP align on psychotherapy-first in mild cases, which they do [^114h5feK] [^112TaqDX] [^111mFFY5].

> For moderate severity, let me consider both monotherapy and combination strategies. Either a second-generation antidepressant or evidence-based psychotherapy is appropriate, and combination therapy can be offered, particularly when rapid response is desired or when there is significant functional impairment. I should confirm that APA supports combined CBT or IPT plus an antidepressant and that ACP acknowledges combination as a reasonable option, while WHO lists several structured psychotherapies and common SSRIs/SNRIs as acceptable pharmacotherapy [^113xPxeq] [^113iJfju] [^11644Lxx].

> For severe MDD, I need to ensure we do not under-treat. Combination treatment with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is recommended, with close monitoring and consideration of higher-intensity settings if safety risk is elevated. I should double-check that VA/DoD explicitly recommends combination for severe presentations and that APA supports combined modalities in such cases, which they do [^111UvmXm] [^113xPxeq].

> But wait, what if the patient is an older adult, an adolescent, pregnant, or has prominent anxiety or substance use. In older adults, I should prioritize psychotherapy when feasible due to pharmacologic safety concerns and consider group CBT or IPT with cautious medication selection; in adolescents, I should confirm DSM-5-TR criteria and use validated tools, and in pregnancy or postpartum, I need to weigh reproductive safety and consider psychotherapy first-line with shared decision-making; with prominent anxiety or substance use, I should treat comorbidities concurrently because they worsen outcomes and complicate antidepressant response [^114Fe3PT] [^116VQAW9] [^111estf1] [^1126HftZ] [^11567J87].

> I should confirm medication choices and practical considerations. SSRIs and SNRIs are first-line pharmacotherapies, with selection guided by prior response, side-effect profile, comorbidities, drug interactions, and cost; I need to ensure we avoid pharmacogenomic testing for routine selection because it has not improved outcomes, and I should verify that WHO and VA/DoD list commonly used agents such as sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine among reasonable options [^111GYDWw] [^111hxKtD].

> Let me now examine psychotherapy options and formats. CBT, IPT, behavioral activation, brief psychodynamic therapy, problem-solving therapy, and third-wave therapies such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy are all supported. I should offer individual or group formats based on preference and access, and consider clinician-guided digital CBT when in-person care is limited, verifying that WHO and VA/DoD endorse these modalities [^11644Lxx] [^116p2kYC] [^111mFFY5].

> Next, I should review measurement-based care and monitoring cadence. I need to ensure PHQ-9 is collected at baseline and at regular intervals, with clinical judgment applied to interpret changes. A reduction of about 50% from baseline is a useful response threshold, but I should confirm remission targets and adjust treatment if there is inadequate improvement by 4–6 weeks, documenting side effects, adherence, and functional gains at each visit [^114xXvPr] [^115q5jT9] [^112jbrLn].

> Hold on, I should verify how to define and manage inadequate response. Treatment-resistant depression is typically defined after at least two adequate trials of different antidepressants or psychotherapies. At that point, options include switching to a different antidepressant class, switching to psychotherapy, augmenting with a second antidepressant, adding psychotherapy to medication, or augmenting with a second-generation antipsychotic such as aripiprazole or quetiapine, and for severe TRD with suicidality, psychosis, or catatonia, ECT should be considered. I should confirm that APA, VA/DoD, and AAFP align on these strategies, which they do [^116nTw5m] [^116QPGY7] [^114Hm3TR] [^111EzeEL] [^112icXZK].

> I need to ensure we address continuation and maintenance phases properly. After acute remission, continue the effective treatment for at least 6–12 months, and for patients with recurrent or persistent depression, consider longer maintenance. Psychotherapy such as CBT, MBCT, or IPT can be prioritized for relapse prevention in some patients, and I should confirm that APA supports psychotherapy-based relapse prevention strategies and that VA/DoD emphasizes individualized maintenance planning [^115ij3WN] [^111tjUuj].

> Let me reconsider documentation and follow-up elements so nothing is missed. I should document DSM-5 criteria confirmation, severity and functional impact, suicide risk assessment, comorbidities, prior treatments, and the shared decision-making discussion; follow-up should be frequent early in treatment, for example every 1–2 weeks initially, then extend as stability improves, and I should verify that APA endorses systematic assessment of symptoms, benefits, and side effects to tailor care over time [^111VP2Lj] [^112jbrLn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that combination therapy is broadly superior for all patients; I should correct that. While combination treatment is reasonable and sometimes preferred in severe, persistent, or recurrent depression, high-quality evidence for universal superiority of combination over monotherapy is limited, so I need to emphasize patient preference, severity, and clinical context rather than a blanket recommendation for all [^116NCrkE] [^112PgFnJ].

> Finally, I should confirm that the overall algorithm remains coherent with major guidelines. The VA/DoD algorithm provides a clear pathway from screening to risk assessment, diagnostic confirmation, severity-based initial treatment, measurement-based monitoring, and escalation for inadequate response, which aligns with APA and ACP guidance on offering either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy first-line with shared decision-making and judicious use of combination strategies in appropriate cases [^113uGapm] [^115FXR4W] [^111tvqBW].

The workup for major depressive disorder (MDD) should confirm DSM-5 criteria [^113vDr3J], assess severity and functional impairment [^113DQXTJ] [^116SNdKt], screen for suicide risk [^114keWUx], and rule out medical or substance-related causes [^116SNdKt] [^116asCiq]; use the PHQ-9 for screening and monitoring [^114xXvPr] [^115Qxpgq], and obtain labs (CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate) when indicated [^111VP2Lj]. First-line treatments are **SSRIs/SNRIs or CBT/IPT** [^111tvqBW] [^115FXR4W], with combination therapy for severe or persistent cases [^111UvmXm] [^1165RXtY]. Monitor with PHQ-9 every 2–4 weeks [^notfound]; if no response after 6–8 weeks, switch or augment [^notfound] (e.g. bupropion, mirtazapine, aripiprazole, lithium) [^111EzeEL]. Continue treatment for at least 6–12 months after remission [^notfound]; for treatment-resistant depression, consider ECT or ketamine [^112icXZK].

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Clinical assessment

- **DSM-5 criteria**: Confirm ≥ 5 symptoms (including depressed mood or anhedonia) for ≥ 2 weeks, causing distress or impairment [^112wSsbF].

- **Severity and functional impairment**: Use PHQ-9 [^114xXvPr] and functional assessments to guide treatment [^114DNCbX].

- **Suicide risk assessment**: Assess ideation, intent, plans, means, and protective factors at every visit [^114keWUx].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Rule out bipolar disorder [^112aqkQ6], anxiety disorders, substance use, and medical conditions (e.g. hypothyroidism, anemia, vitamin deficiencies) [^116SNdKt].

---

### Laboratory and medical evaluation

Order **CBC, CMP, TSH, vitamin B12, and folate** to exclude medical causes when clinically indicated [^111VP2Lj]. No **routine imaging** is required unless neurological symptoms or other red flags are present [^111vLA7b].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Initial treatment selection

- **Mild depression**: CBT or IPT as first-line; consider SSRIs if psychotherapy is declined or unavailable [^114h5feK] [^115FXR4W].

- **Moderate-to-severe depression**: SSRIs or SNRIs; consider combination with CBT/IPT for faster/stronger response [^111tvqBW] [^111UvmXm].

- **Patient preference**: Use shared decision-making to choose between pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or combination [^1115LSQn] [^112PgFnJ].

---

### Pharmacotherapy

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| SSRIs | - Sertraline <br/> - Fluoxetine <br/> - Citalopram <br/> - Escitalopram | First-line; favorable safety profile [^111GYDWw] |
| SNRIs | - Venlafaxine <br/> - Duloxetine | Consider for comorbid pain or anxiety [^notfound] |
| Atypical antidepressants | - Bupropion <br/> - Mirtazapine | Options for SSRI intolerance or augmentation [^notfound] |
| Second-generation antipsychotics | - Aripiprazole <br/> - Quetiapine | Augmentation for partial response [^111EzeEL] |

---

### Psychotherapy

Evidence-based options include **CBT, IPT, behavioral activation, and problem-solving therapy** [^11644Lxx]. Delivery can be **individual or group**, in-person or via telehealth, based on patient preference and access [^116p2kYC].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Measurement-based care**: Use PHQ-9 every 2–4 weeks to track response and guide adjustments [^114xXvPr] [^115q5jT9].

- **Treatment response**: Expect 50% reduction by 6–8 weeks; aim for remission (PHQ-9 < 5) [^116Z6gJu].

- **Inadequate response**: Switch or augment after 6–8 weeks (e.g. bupropion, mirtazapine, aripiprazole, lithium) [^116QPGY7] [^112e8kXW].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly**: Start low, go slow; consider psychotherapy first-line due to medication risks [^111ws1LF].

- **Pregnancy/postpartum**: Prefer psychotherapy; if medication is needed, SSRIs such as sertraline or fluoxetine are reasonable [^notfound].

- **Treatment-resistant depression**: Consider ECT or ketamine after ≥ 2 adequate trials [^116nTw5m] [^112icXZK].

---

## Relapse prevention

Continue treatment for **6–12 months after remission** [^115ij3WN], and consider **maintenance psychotherapy** or pharmacotherapy for recurrent or persistent depression [^1165RXtY].

---

The workup for MDD should confirm DSM-5 criteria, assess severity and functional impairment, screen for suicide risk, and rule out medical or substance-related causes; use the PHQ-9 for screening and monitoring, and obtain labs (CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate) when indicated. First-line treatments are **SSRIs/SNRIs or CBT/IPT**, with combination therapy for severe or persistent cases. Monitor with PHQ-9 every 2–4 weeks; if there is no response after 6–8 weeks, switch or augment (e.g. bupropion, mirtazapine, aripiprazole, lithium).

A serial cross-sectional study in. Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Physicians. In the February issue, Dr. Heather Kovich and colleagues provided an update on pharmacologic treatment and tapering strategies to minimize the risk of discontinuation syndrome. When initiating medication, the authors recommend using shared decision-making, considering factors such as "prior treatment and response, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects". An accompanying editorial by Drs. Andrew Buelt and John McQuaid compared the three major U. S. clinical guidelines for major depressive disorder from the ACP, the American Psychological Association, and the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. All of the guidelines recommend initial treatment with evidence-based psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. Pharmacogenetic tests such as GeneSight Psychotropic " not been shown to improve patient-oriented outcomes and not recommended to assist in drug choice. " Most patients will not experience additional benefit from combining psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy; however, the VA/DoD suggests that this combination is appropriate for patients with severe, persistent, or recurrent depression. A Canadian group recently developed a visual evidence-informed decision support tool based on a literature review and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments depression treatment guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^111estf1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder (children and adolescents) — evaluation principles: Clinically significant depression must be distinguished from everyday sadness and irritability, which can be normative in specific developmental stages. In DSM-5-TR, mental disorders are defined as a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in underlying psychological, biological, or developmental processes. By DSM convention, a mental disorder is diagnosed if all diagnostic criteria for the given disorder are met. Most diagnostic criteria sets require specific frequency and duration of symptoms and clinically significant distress and functional impairment, and alternative medical, substance, and psychiatric explanations must have been considered before the diagnosis is applied.

### Identifying patients with depression who require a change in treatment and implementing that change [^114F6gvq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Creating an effective treatment regimen for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) can be a challenge for clinicians. With each treatment trial, only 20% to 30% of patients achieve remission, and many of those who do reach remission experience residual symptoms. Patients with treatment-resistant depression or with residual symptoms are candidates for a change in treatment. Other patients requiring treatment changes are those who experience intolerable adverse effects and those who experience an illness recurrence. Because early detection can lead to improved outcomes, clinicians must be vigilant about assessing patients to identify when one or more of these situations occur. Clinicians must also communicate effectively with their patients to ensure that they understand the treatment strategies, goals, and potential adverse effects; have realistic expectations of treatment; and express their treatment preferences. Timely and appropriate treatment adjustment is necessary to help patients with MDD achieve recovery.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117M1xRR]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Anxiety and depression in asthma — anxiety symptoms and psychiatric disorders, particularly depressive and anxiety disorders, are more prevalent among people with asthma, and psychiatric comorbidity is associated with worse asthma symptom control and medication adherence, and worse asthma-related quality of life. Anxiety and depressive symptoms have been associated with increased asthma-related exacerbations and emergency visits, and panic attacks may be mistaken for asthma. Although several tools are available for screening in primary care, the majority have not been validated in asthma populations, and difficulties distinguishing anxiety or depression from asthma symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis. It is important to be alert to possible depression and/or anxiety in people with asthma, particularly when there is a previous history of these conditions, and where appropriate, patients should be referred to psychiatrists or evaluated with a disease-specific psychiatric diagnostic tool to identify potential cases of depression and/or anxiety.

### Depression in primary care: part 1-screening and diagnosis [^113vjbw4]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Depression is a common and heterogeneous condition with a chronic and recurrent natural course that is frequently seen in the primary care setting. Primary care providers play a central role in managing depression and concurrent physical comorbidities, and they face challenges in diagnosing and treating the condition. In this two part series, we review the evidence available to help to guide primary care providers and practices to recognize and manage depression. In this first of two reviews, we outline an approach to screening and diagnosing depression in primary care that evaluates current evidence based guidelines and applies the recommendations to clinical practice. The second review presents an evidence based approach to the treatment of depression in primary care, detailing the recommended lifestyle, drug, and psychological interventions at the individual level. It also highlights strategies that are being adopted at an organizational level to manage depression more effectively in primary care.

Scope of this guideline — audience and population: This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is based on published clinical evidence available through January 31, 2021 and is intended to provide general guidance on best evidence-based practices, and it is not intended to serve as a standard of care. It is intended for use by all healthcare providers caring for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), with this version particularly tailored to primary care providers (PCPs) and mental health providers. The patient population of interest is adults (≥ 18 years) with a DSM or ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis of MDD eligible for care in the VA or DoD healthcare delivery systems, including mild, moderate, and severe MDD, chronic major depression per DSM-IV, and persistent depressive disorder/chronic major depression per DSM-5, and it also includes adults with MDD who have either partially responded or not responded to treatment for depression. The CPG does not address patients at risk for suicide or patients with post-stroke depression or bipolar disorder I/II, as recommendations for these populations are included in other VA/DoD CPGs.

Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in clinical practice — purpose and PHQ-9 scoring: The PHQ facilitates the recognition and diagnosis of depressive disorders, with the PHQ-2 functioning as a screening tool and the PHQ-9 serving as an indicator of depression severity or response to treatment for patients with a depressive disorder; although the instrument can be used to align with diagnostic criteria, it should not be used in isolation to make a diagnosis without considering whether symptoms are better accounted for by another disorder. The PHQ-9 can also be used as a continuous measure of severity in the practice of measurement-based care (MBC), which emphasizes the use of assessments to help personalize care and guide treatment decisions, aids in identifying intervention targets and assessing progress over time, and positively impacts the clinical relationship between patient and provider. Scoring instructions specify that the response categories "not at all", "several days", "more than half the days", and "nearly every day" correspond to scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively; the index is the sum of the scores for the nine items and ranges from 0 to 27, anchored to the prompt "Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following?" as presented in Table I-1, Nine Symptom Checklist (PHQ-9).

### Using assessment tools to screen for, diagnose, and treat major depressive disorder in clinical practice [^1128MgsY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Depression remains underrecognized and undertreated worldwide, although it is a leading cause of disease burden. Many instruments are available to enhance the assessment of major depressive disorder (MDD) at 3 levels: screening, diagnosing, and monitoring treatment. This article reviews a variety of tools that can be used at each level of assessment as part of a measurement-based care approach to MDD. Measurement-based care for MDD is feasible in clinical practice. Patient self-reports can be used instead of clinician-rated scales to save time, whether in paper, computerized, or interactive voice response formats. Assessment tools are available in many languages. Treatment algorithms can rationalize decision making, and collaborative care can speed and enhance treatment results.

Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, affecting more than 300 million people of all ages globally, and is now the leading cause of disability. Despite the availability of effective psychological and pharmacologic treatments, depression recognition and treatment rates remain low. Clinicians can improve the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of depression by using a measurement-based care approach. The systematic use of validated screening tools can improve recognition and diagnosis. The US Preventive Services Task force recommends routine screening of depression in adults and adolescents as long as systems are in place for accurate diagnosis, treatment initiation, and appropriate follow-up. Here, tools and diagnostic criteria are described.

Major depressive disorder is a chronic and recurrent illness that affects 20% of adults during their lifetime and is one of the leading causes of suicide in the United States. A systematic measurement-based care approach is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) by promptly identifying individuals with depression and avoiding delays in treatment initiation. As comorbidities may be associated with poorer outcomes to commonly used antidepressants and increase risk of drug-drug interactions, their recognition and treatment is an essential component of management of TRD.

How is major depressive disorder diagnosed?

The diagnosis of major depressive disorder in clinical practice is based on the presence of certain symptoms according to the diagnostic criteria outlined in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision. These two sets of diagnostic criteria are largely comparable. The diagnosis of depression as it is defined by these diagnostic criteria does not build on any aetiological or pathophysiological framework. The assessment according to the diagnostic criteria might be supported by a structured interview, such as the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM. The conduct of these interviews may take 15–60 min. There are no objective tests and no laboratory test (eg, blood tests, MRI scans) for depression or for validating the diagnosis.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — determining recommendation strength and direction follows GRADE across domains including confidence in the quality of the evidence (options include High, Moderate, Low, or Very low, and if quality differs across critical outcomes, the lowest quality determines the overall rating), balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes (options include benefits outweigh harms/burden, benefits slightly outweigh harms/burden, benefits and harms/burdens are balanced, harms/burdens slightly outweigh benefits, and harms/burdens outweigh benefits; this assumes most clinicians will offer an intervention if advantages exceed harms), patient values and preferences (options include similar values, some variation, or large variation; homogeneous values may increase a recommendation's strength while heterogeneous values may decrease it, and the Work Group considered findings from a patient focus group), and other implications (options include resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, and subgroup considerations). The recommendation strength generally aligns with the confidence in the quality of evidence — Strong recommendations are typically supported by High or Moderate quality evidence — however, GRADE permits Low or Very low quality evidence to support a Strong recommendation in certain instances (e.g., life-threatening situation).

Evidence suggests employing MBC in the treatment of patients with major depression enhances outcomes, and MBC features three key elements: collect (use reliable, validated, and clinically appropriate measures), share (results are shared and discussed with the patient and other providers involved in the patient's care), and act (results are used by the patient and provider to make clinically appropriate adjustments in care). As of January 2018, the Joint Commission requires MBC use in all mental health treatment programs accredited under behavioral health standards. The evidence reviewed, including a systematic review, found the overall evidence for MBC was weak, the quality of evidence was rated as poor with none of the studies including all three key elements, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any particular measure though the DoD and VA promote the use of the PHQ-9, and no specific frequency of monitoring can be recommended as superior.

### Comparing clinical guidelines for the management of major… [^116NCrkE]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines from the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, updated in 2022; American Psychological Association, published in 2019; and American College of Physicians, published in 2016, are widely used for the management of major depressive disorder. 3–5 All of these guidelines recommend treatment with pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy. Treatment recommendations are similar among guidelines, with only select differences in patient populations, specific treatments, and strength of recommendations. This editorial highlights the similarities and differences that are most relevant to family physicians and other clinicians treating patients with major depressive disorder. Initial Treatment Recommendations All three guidelines recommend initial treatment with evidence-based psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy.

Notably, the VA/DoD guidelines provide the strongest level of recommendation for the use of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy but a weaker level of recommendation for specific treatment options. This reflects changes in the literature — recent, larger pharmacotherapy trials demonstrate smaller effect sizes than older, smaller trials. Combining Therapies There is a lack of evidence showing a significant benefit from combining psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in most patients with major depressive disorder. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend combining psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy only in patients with depression that is severe, persistent, or recurrent. If psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are combined, the APA recommends cognitive behavior therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy plus a second-generation antidepressant.

Complementary and Alternative Therapies For patients who prefer alternative treatments to pharmacotherapy and are unwilling or unable to participate in psychotherapy, the VA/DoD, ACP, and APA recommend exercise or St. John's wort for major depressive disorder, based on low-quality evidence. The benefit of exercise was consistent across various exercise types. Although St. John's wort is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for depression, the most studied extracts were hypericin 0. 1% to
0. 3% and hyperforin 1% to 6% at a daily dose of 500 to 1, 800 mg. Telemedicine The VA/DoD found insufficient evidence to determine whether telemedicine is inferior or superior to in-person treatment. Telemedicine may have many positive downstream effects, including improved health care equality and expanded mental health accessibility. However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different modalities, including audio-only telemedicine.

### Diagnostic assessment of major depressive disorder [^1116AFTh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent disorder that is also highly comorbid with other psychiatric and medical conditions. After diagnosing a major depressive episode, clinicians should screen for suicide risk to establish patient safety. Once the patient is in the appropriate treatment setting, clinicians should evaluate the patient for MDD by assessing the differential diagnosis, accompanying symptoms, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and sociodemographic factors. Proper assessment of patients with MDD can lead to targeted treatment and a better chance of remission.

Shared decision making — guidance for clinicians underscores collaborative choices informed by evidence and patient values. The guideline states, "This CPG encourages providers to practice shared decision making, which is a process in which providers and patients consider clinical evidence of benefits and risks as well as patient values and preferences to make decisions regarding the patient's treatment". It further notes, "Providers must be adept at presenting information to their patients regarding individual treatments, expected risks, expected outcomes, and levels and/or settings of care, especially where there may be patient heterogeneity in risks and benefits", and concludes, "Providers are encouraged to use shared decision making to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, and preferences".

### The clinical characterization of the adult patient with depression aimed at personalization of management [^113v9FiP]. World Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Depression is widely acknowledged to be a heterogeneous entity, and the need to further characterize the individual patient who has received this diagnosis in order to personalize the management plan has been repeatedly emphasized. However, the research evidence that should guide this personalization is at present fragmentary, and the selection of treatment is usually based on the clinician's and/or the patient's preference and on safety issues, in a trial-and-error fashion, paying little attention to the particular features of the specific case. This may be one of the reasons why the majority of patients with a diagnosis of depression do not achieve remission with the first treatment they receive. The predominant pessimism about the actual feasibility of the personalization of treatment of depression in routine clinical practice has recently been tempered by some secondary analyses of databases from clinical trials, using approaches such as individual patient data meta-analysis and machine learning, which indicate that some variables may indeed contribute to the identification of patients who are likely to respond differently to various antidepressant drugs or to antidepressant medication vs. specific psychotherapies. The need to develop decision support tools guiding the personalization of treatment of depression has been recently reaffirmed, and the point made that these tools should be developed through large observational studies using a comprehensive battery of self-report and clinical measures. The present paper aims to describe systematically the salient domains that should be considered in this effort to personalize depression treatment. For each domain, the available research evidence is summarized, and the relevant assessment instruments are reviewed, with special attention to their suitability for use in routine clinical practice, also in view of their possible inclusion in the above-mentioned comprehensive battery of measures. The main unmet needs that research should address in this area are emphasized. Where the available evidence allows providing the clinician with specific advice that can already be used today to make the management of depression more personalized, this advice is highlighted. Indeed, some sections of the paper, such as those on neurocognition and on physical comorbidities, indicate that the modern management of depression is becoming increasingly complex, with several components other than simply the choice of an antidepressant and/or a psychotherapy, some of which can already be reliably personalized.

### Pharmacological approaches to manage persistent symptoms of major depressive disorder: rationale and therapeutic strategies [^11348yug]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent chronic psychiatric illness associated with significant morbidity, mortality, loss of productivity, and diminished quality of life. Typically, only a minority of patients responds to treatment and meet criteria for remission as residual symptoms may persist, the result of an inadequate course of treatment and/or the presence of persistent side effects. The foremost goal of treatment should be to restore patients to full functioning and eliminate or relieve all MDD symptoms, while being virtually free of troublesome side effects. The current available pharmacological options to manage persistent depressive symptoms include augmentation or adjunctive combination strategies, both of which target selected psychobiological systems and specific mood and somatic symptoms experienced by the patient. As well, non-pharmacological interventions including psychotherapies may be used in either first-line or adjunctive approaches. However, the evidence to date with respect to available adjunct therapies is limited by few studies and those published have utilized only a small number of subjects and lack enough data to allow for a consensus of expert opinion. This underlines the need for further longer term, large population-based studies and those that include comorbid populations, all of which are seen in real world community psychiatry.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112PgFnJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for major depressive disorder (MDD) — initial monotherapy selection states that MDD can be treated efficaciously with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy as monotherapy, honoring patients' preference, and that for patients with an initial episode of MDD or those who have previously responded well to monotherapy there was not sufficient evidence to recommend one specific therapeutic modality over another, with both modalities having established efficacy as monotherapy in RCTs. In selecting treatment, the provider should explain the risks and benefits of all treatments to achieve a shared decision, and patient preference should drive the decision process; offering either treatment modality is far superior to no treatment, and the confidence in the quality of evidence for specific treatment modalities was very low. The Work Group determined a Strong recommendation is warranted and decided upon a Strong for recommendation for Recommendation 6. Regardless of treatment choice, patients should be made aware of the risks and benefits of each option and the importance of full engagement in treatment to maximize benefit, and neither pharmacotherapy nor psychotherapy is as effective when delivered at less than the recommended frequency or dose.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112wSsbF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder — diagnosis, severity, and comorbidity are described as follows: Major depressive disorder is defined as the presence of a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities that occurs along with at least 4 additional diagnostic criteria or symptoms for at least 2 weeks and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Based on severity of symptoms, functional impairment, and level of patient distress, MDD can be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe. One third of patients with MDD have severe MDD, which is associated with more difficulty in achieving treatment response and remission. In addition, about 75% of people with MDD also have a co-occurring anxiety disorder, which can make their symptoms worse and recovery more difficult.

### Differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder [^111FGPG8]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with bipolar disorder spend approximately half of their lives symptomatic and the majority of that time suffering from symptoms of depression, which complicates the accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

Methods

Challenges in the differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder are reviewed, and the clinical utility of several screening instruments is evaluated.

Results

The estimated lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (i.e., unipolar depression) is over 3 and one-half times that of bipolar spectrum disorders. The clinical presentation of a major depressive episode in a bipolar disorder patient does not differ substantially from that of a patient with major depressive disorder (unipolar depression). Therefore, it is not surprising that without proper screening and comprehensive evaluation many patients with bipolar disorder may be misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder (unipolar depression). In general, antidepressants have demonstrated little or no efficacy for depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, and treatment guidelines recommend using antidepressants only as an adjunct to mood stabilizers for patients with bipolar disorder. Thus, correct identification of bipolar disorder among patients who present with depression is critical for providing appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes.

Limitations

Clinical characteristics indicative of bipolar disorder versus major depressive disorder identified in this review are based on group differences and may not apply to each individual patient.

Conclusion

The overview of demographic and clinical characteristics provided by this review may help medical professionals distinguish between major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Several validated, easily administered screening instruments are available and can greatly improve the recognition of bipolar disorder in patients with depression.
