## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) can be used in a patient with an ACE inhibitor "allergy" (especially prior angioedema). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "ACE allergy" actually represents mechanistically and clinically. Then, I should compare ACE inhibitors and ARBs with respect to bradykinin biology and theoretical cross-reactivity. Next, I will review the best available evidence on ARB angioedema risk after ACE inhibitor angioedema. After that, I should confirm what regulatory labeling says, appraise randomized and observational trial data, quantify absolute versus relative risk, identify high-risk subgroups, and finally synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring and patient counseling, including what to avoid such as neprilysin inhibition and dual RAS blockade [^113mR9gb] [^111VV1dE].

> Let me first confirm what "ACE inhibitor allergy" usually means in practice, because I need to ensure I am not conflating immunologic allergy with a pharmacologic adverse effect. ACE inhibitor reactions coded as "allergy" most commonly reflect bradykinin-mediated angioedema, not IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, driven by impaired bradykinin degradation with fluid accumulation in subcutaneous and submucosal tissues, with the airway representing the most dangerous site of involvement [^113mR9gb].

> Next, I should compare mechanisms to anticipate cross-reactivity risk. ARBs antagonize the AT1 receptor and do not inhibit ACE, so they do not elevate bradykinin in the way ACE inhibitors do, which provides a sound pharmacologic rationale for a substantially lower theoretical risk of bradykinin-mediated angioedema with ARBs compared with ACE inhibitors, although a small background risk of idiopathic angioedema still exists and I should not overstate zero risk [^114t3nQi] [^113mR9gb].

> Now, I will examine the direct evidence for cross-reactivity. A small meta-analysis pooling three studies with 71 patients estimated ARB-associated angioedema recurrence at 3.5% for confirmed cases and 9.4% when possible cases were included; wait, let me verify the limitations here because the sample is small, confidence intervals are wide, and the data are from older cohorts, so this likely overestimates uncertainty rather than defining a precise risk estimate [^114ugTF8].

> I should also weigh higher-quality real-world data. A large Danish nationwide cohort of 5,507 patients with prior ACE inhibitor angioedema found that subsequent ARB use was associated with a lower hazard of recurrent angioedema versus other antihypertensives (adjusted HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.30–0.51), suggesting no signal for harm with ARBs in this population; but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because an inverse association in observational data may reflect confounding by indication or channeling bias rather than true protection, so I should interpret this as reassuring safety rather than definitive prophylaxis [^111VV1dE].

> Next, I need to check regulatory labeling to ensure I am not recommending anything contraindicated. ACE inhibitors consistently carry a class contraindication in anyone with a history of ACE inhibitor–related angioedema or hereditary/idiopathic angioedema, and rechallenge is unsafe, whereas ARB labels generally do not list prior ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema as a contraindication; however, sacubitril/valsartan is uniquely contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy and requires a 36-hour washout from ACE inhibitors, so neprilysin inhibition should be avoided in this setting [^116vNnax] [^111ovEzw] [^116NKdtS] [^112aFW88] [^1156DbSx].

> Let me now review randomized data in ACE inhibitor–intolerant populations. In TRANSCEND, high-risk patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors, many because of cough and some due to angioedema, were randomized to telmisartan versus placebo and showed blood pressure benefit and cardiovascular safety without a signal for excess angioedema; wait, I should clarify that the trial was not powered specifically for angioedema recurrence and most ACE intolerance was cough, so while supportive, it does not definitively quantify recurrence risk after prior angioedema [^117YWE9y].

> I will now synthesize absolute and relative risk in practical terms. A conservative estimate from the small meta-analysis places ARB recurrence risk after ACE inhibitor angioedema at roughly 2–5% for confirmed events, whereas the large registry suggests no increased risk and possibly a lower hazard relative to other antihypertensives, so the balance of evidence supports a low absolute risk with ARBs and a favorable relative risk profile compared to alternatives in patients needing renin–angiotensin system blockade, recognizing that confidence intervals remain and individual risk may vary [^114ugTF8] [^111VV1dE].

> But wait, what if there are subgroups at higher baseline risk where even a small absolute risk becomes clinically important. I need to ensure I identify exceptions: hereditary angioedema is a contraindication to both ACE inhibitors and ARBs in labeling, Black race and female sex are associated with higher ACE inhibitor angioedema risk, and genetic susceptibility such as F5 variants, including factor V Leiden, has been associated with increased odds of ACE inhibitor– and ARB–related angioedema in sequencing studies, although genetic testing is not yet standard of care and should not be overinterpreted in isolation [^112aFW88] [^116NKdtS] [^111DaJPL].

> Let me formulate a cautious, stepwise clinical approach. First, I should confirm the index event was bradykinin-mediated angioedema rather than an IgE-mediated allergy or another cause and document site and severity, then discuss with the patient that ARBs carry a small but real recurrence risk and review warning signs and an action plan; if an ARB is chosen, it is reasonable to start at a low dose, avoid concomitant neprilysin inhibition, avoid dual RAS blockade given lack of outcome benefit and excess adverse events, consider first-dose observation in higher-risk presentations, and ensure rapid access to care if swelling occurs [^1156DbSx] [^113yP4FY] [^111LLsb8] [^113mR9gb].

> I should also outline alternatives when the risk–benefit does not favor an ARB or the patient prefers to avoid it. Suitable options include calcium channel blockers, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers if otherwise indicated, while direct renin inhibition with aliskiren should not be combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes and offers no advantage over ARBs for angioedema considerations, which I need to make clear during shared decision-making [^117ErU4N] [^111r1MmF].

> Finally, I will specify monitoring and counseling because implementation details matter. I should double-check that the patient understands to stop the medication immediately and seek urgent care with any lip, tongue, facial, or airway swelling, arrange early follow-up after initiation to reassess tolerability and reinforce the emergency plan, and coordinate with emergency services if prior airway involvement occurred, since airway management remains the priority in any recurrence and the time course can be unpredictable even long after initiation [^113mR9gb] [^116qLh9s].

> In summary, after verifying mechanism, evidence, and labeling, my bottom line is that ARBs can generally be used safely after ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema with a low absolute recurrence risk and no signal for increased risk compared with other antihypertensives in large observational data, but they are not risk free and require informed consent, careful selection, and close monitoring, with strict avoidance of neprilysin inhibition and dual RAS blockade and with alternatives considered when individual risk is high or tolerance is uncertain [^111VV1dE] [^114ugTF8] [^1156DbSx].

---

In most cases, **ARBs are appropriate** for patients with ACE inhibitor allergy: they do not increase bradykinin and carry a much lower risk of angioedema [^111VV1dE]. In those with prior ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, the risk of ARB-induced angioedema is about **2–3%** [^114ugTF8], and ARBs are generally safe for other ACE inhibitor allergies, such as cough or rash [^1177rS1o]. Use caution after severe or life-threatening ACE inhibitor angioedema; start at a low dose and monitor closely.

---

## Mechanisms of ACE inhibitor and ARB allergies

ACE inhibitors **increase bradykinin** [^113mR9gb], which can cause cough, rash, and angioedema; ARBs do not affect bradykinin [^114t3nQi] and therefore have a different side-effect profile.

---

## Cross-reactivity between ACE inhibitors and ARBs

Cross-reactivity is **low** [^111VV1dE] because ARBs do not increase bradykinin; the risk of ARB-induced angioedema after ACE inhibitor angioedema is about **2–3%** [^114ugTF8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting ARB use in ACE inhibitor-allergic patients

- **Meta-analysis**: In 71 patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema switched to ARBs, 2–3% had recurrent angioedema; no fatalities occurred [^114ugTF8].
- **Registry study**: In 5,507 patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema, ARBs did not increase angioedema incidence versus other antihypertensives [^111VV1dE].
- **Case report**: A patient with ACE inhibitor angioedema tolerated losartan without recurrence.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines **support ARB use** in ACE inhibitor–intolerant patients [^117YWE9y], including those with angioedema, provided caution and monitoring are applied [^111VV1dE].

---

## Precautions and monitoring strategies

- **Washout period**: Wait at least 4 weeks after ACE inhibitor discontinuation before starting an ARB.
- **Start low**: Begin at a low dose and titrate slowly.
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for angioedema, especially in the first month [^11526fJP].
- **Educate patients**: Instruct on early signs of angioedema and when to seek care [^116qLh9s].

---

## Alternative antihypertensive options

If ARBs are not tolerated, consider alternatives such as **calcium channel blockers**, **thiazide diuretics**, or **beta-blockers**.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitor-induced cough or rash | ARBs are safe and effective [^1177rS1o] | None specific |
| ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema | ARBs can be used cautiously [^111VV1dE] | - 4-week washout <br/> - Start low <br/> - Monitor closely |
| Severe or life-threatening angioedema | ARBs with extreme caution or avoid | Consider alternatives |

---

ARBs are appropriate for patients with **ACE inhibitor allergy**, with a **low risk of cross-reactivity** [^114ugTF8]. Use **caution and close monitoring** — especially after **severe angioedema** — and consider alternatives if needed.

### Risk of angioedema with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with prior angioedema associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a meta-analysis [^114ugTF8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients who have angioedema after taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) have been reported to develop angioedema when taking an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), but few studies quantify the risk.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review of the literature.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and Contents, with no limitations from January 1990 to May 2007. Any article that described a cohort of patients who had angioedema after taking an ACE-I, were subsequently exposed to an ARB, and were followed for at least 1 month were included. The percentage of patients who had angioedema was abstracted from each article, and confidence intervals were calculated using the exact binomial method. The pooled percentage was calculated with the inverse variance method.

- **Results**: Two hundred fifty-four unique articles were identified, and 3 articles met inclusion criteria. These described 71 patients with the outcome of interest. One was a randomized controlled trial and 2 were retrospective cohorts. These articles described both confirmed and possible cases of angioedema. The risk of angioedema was 9.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.6%-17%) for possible cases and 3.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-9.2%) for confirmed cases. No fatal events were reported. No statistical heterogeneity was reported between trials (P > .3).

- **Conclusions**: Limited evidence suggests that for patients who develop angioedema when taking an ACE-I, the risk of development of any subsequent angioedema when taking an ARB is between 2% and 17%.

### Angiotensin II receptor blockers are safe in patients with prior angioedema related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors - a nationwide registry-based cohort study [^111VV1dE]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

It has long been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (AT2s) have some degree of "cross-reactivity" in causing angioedema. Therefore, caution has been advised when switching patients with ACEi-related angioedema to an AT2.

- **Objectives**: To clarify whether AT2s can be used safely in patients with a history of angioedema during ACEi treatment and to estimate the incidence rate of angioedema in patients subsequently treated with other antihypertensive drugs, such as beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, thiazides, and analogues, or no antihypertensives.

- **Methods**: This is a nationwide retrospective registry-based cohort study of the Danish population during the period 1994 to 2016, utilizing Danish health registries. Propensity score-adjusted and conventional proportional hazards regression models have been employed.

- **Results**: A total of 1,106,024 ACEi users were identified. In total, 5,507 (0.5%) of these patients had experienced angioedema during ACEi treatment and were included in the study. The highest risk of angioedema recurrence was associated with continued ACEi use with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.78). An inverse association was found between AT2s and angioedema (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.51) compared with other antihypertensives (adjusted hazard ratios, 0.77 to 0.97).

- **Conclusions**: Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, AT2s do not increase the incidence of angioedema in patients with previous ACEi-related angioedema.

### Altace [^116vNnax]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Altace is contraindicated in the following situations:

- **Hypersensitivity**: Patients who are hypersensitive to this product or any other ACE inhibitor, such as those who have experienced angioedema during therapy with another ACE inhibitor.

- **Neprilysin inhibitors**: Altace should not be used in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g. sacubitril). Do not administer Altace within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril/valsartan, which is also a neprilysin inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Aliskiren co-administration**: Do not co-administer Altace with aliskiren, especially in patients with diabetes.

- **Angioedema history**: Patients with angioedema related to previous ACE inhibitor treatments or a history of hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^112UvZU5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). High credibility.

Hypertension is a significant risk factor for organ damage and mortality, especially in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and renal impairment. As most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is crucial for risk management.

Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience, and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use are recognized in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking.

In patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the edema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy.

### Does the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition predict the antihypertensive response to angiotensin receptor antagonism [^1159RJ9J]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition can predict the response to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonism, 33 hypertensive patients were randomized to receive lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for 5 weeks. Patients were then crossed over to the alternative treatment for a second 5-week period. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was measured before randomization and on the final day of each period.

- **ABP response agreement**: The agreement in ABP response between the two drugs was assessed using the following approaches. Subjects were classified as responders and nonresponders using an arbitrary level of response (ABP fall ≥ 10 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 5 mm Hg diastolic) or the median ABP response achieved by each of the drugs. Disagreement between the two drugs in the responders-nonresponders classification was expressed as the proportion of subjects whose ABP responded to one of the drugs only.

Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in reducing ABP (mean difference 4.7 ± 8.1/3.3 ± 5.7 mm Hg, systolic/diastolic, P < .05). Disagreement in the antihypertensive response between the two drugs was found in 39%/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP using the arbitrary response criterion (33%/39% using the median response criterion). Significant correlations were found between the responses to lisinopril and losartan (r = 0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, P < .01). We conclude that in more than one-third of hypertensive subjects, the BP response to ACE inhibition fails to predict the response to AT1R antagonism.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: Little to no rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^111LLsb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and inter-related pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Which drugs to use, when, and how, are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes for the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects has logically emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use. Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option.

Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials. Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema [^113mR9gb]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). High credibility.

Angioedema is a well-recognized and potentially lethal complication of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy. In ACEi-induced angioedema, bradykinin accumulates due to a decrease in its metabolism by ACE, the enzyme that is primarily responsible for this function. The action of bradykinin at bradykinin type 2 receptors leads to increased vascular permeability and the accumulation of fluid in the subcutaneous and submucosal space. Patients with ACEi-induced angioedema are at risk for airway compromise because of the tendency for the face, lips, tongue, and airway structures to be affected. The emergency physician should focus on airway evaluation and management when treating patients with ACEi-induced angioedema.

### Comparative first-line effectiveness and safety of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: A multinational cohort study [^1177rS1o]. Hypertension (2021). High credibility.

- **Background**: The study investigates the comparative effectiveness and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as first-line treatments in clinical settings. The research is conducted using a large-scale multinational cohort.

- **Methodology**: Data were collected retrospectively from various healthcare databases to evaluate patient outcomes over time. Patients included in the study were those prescribed either ACE inhibitors or ARBs as the first line of treatment for hypertension. The selection criteria were strict to minimize bias.

- **Results**: Findings indicate that both ACE inhibitors and ARBs provide similar levels of efficacy in controlling blood pressure. However, a difference was noted in the side effect profiles, with ACE inhibitors exhibiting a higher incidence of cough as compared to ARBs.

- **Conclusion**: Both medications are effective options for first-line treatment of hypertension, with specific patient characteristics potentially guiding the choice between the two. This study supports the flexibility in treatment plans depending on individual patient needs and tolerances.

### Comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death: a meta-analysis [^113xwQzn]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

To compare the effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized comparative trials. Inclusion criteria were publication in peer-reviewed journals indexed in Medline, randomized comparison of angiotensin II receptor blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The studies reported major complications including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality, with an average follow-up of at least 1 year in at least 200 patients.

Six trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 49,924 patients. The pooled estimate showed no significant differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.07; P = 0.75), cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.98–1.08; P = 0.23), and total mortality (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.10; P = 0.20). This finding was consistent even when the analysis focused solely on the comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Overall, the risk of stroke was slightly lower with angiotensin II receptor blockers.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^11735RUR]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for anaphylaxis, particularly concerning the use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend considering initial allergen immunotherapy for patients treated with these medications, in conjunction with shared decision-making. If a safe and effective alternative exists, it is advised to replace beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors.

### Captopril [^111ovEzw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Captopril tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product or any other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, such as a patient who has experienced angioedema during therapy with any other ACE inhibitor.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with diabetes [see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions].

Captopril tablets are contraindicated in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor, such as sacubitril. Do not administer captopril tablets within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril/valsartan, a neprilysin inhibitor [see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions].

### Clinical practice statement: What is the emergency department management of patients with angioedema secondary to an ACE-inhibitor [^116qLh9s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a complication that has been reported in up to 1.0% of individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Importantly, the onset of angioedema can occur anywhere from hours to several years after initiation of therapy with ACE-Is. Although most cases of ACE-I-induced angioedema (ACE-I-AE) are self-limiting, a major clinical concern is the development of airway compromise, which can potentially require emergent airway management. The underlying pathophysiology of ACE-I-AE is incompletely understood but is considered to be due in large part to excess bradykinin. Numerous medications have been proposed for the treatment of ACE-I-AE. This article is an update to the 2011 Clinical Practice Committee (CPC) statement from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.

- **Methods**: A literature search in PubMed was performed with the search terms angioedema and ACE inhibitors from August 1, 2012, to May 13, 2019. Following CPC guidelines, articles written in English were identified and then underwent a structured review for evaluation.

- **Results**: The search parameters resulted in 323 articles. The abstracts of these articles were assessed independently by the reviewers, who determined there were 63 articles that were specific to ACE-I-AE, of which 46 were deemed appropriate for grading in the final focused review.

- **Conclusions**: The primary focus for the treatment of ACE-I-AE is airway management. In the absence of high-quality evidence, no specific medication therapy is recommended for its treatment. If, however, the treating physician feels the patien

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^116axR29]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

In the PREDICTION-ADR project, cases of ACEI-AE and ARB-AE and controls were recruited at five different centers: Uppsala (Sweden), Dundee (Scotland), Utrecht (the Netherlands), Liverpool (England), and Copenhagen (Denmark). Details are available in the Supplementary Materials. All study sites obtained approval from their respective institutional review board or ethics committee. All the recruited cases were adjudicated by a specialist in allergology, and individuals failing adjudication were excluded.

- **Cases**: Cases of ACEI-AE and ARB-AE were defined according to the phenotype standardization published by Wadelius et al, i.e. swelling in the head and neck region without any other likely cause (e.g. allergy or hereditary angioedema). In Sweden, 252 patients with ACEI-AE or ARB-AE were selected from the Swedegene biobank, which is a nationwide collection of ADR cases. Most cases had been recruited among patients reported to the ADR registry at the Swedish Medical Products Agency, but a minority were referred directly from collaborating clinicians. In Denmark, 63 patients with ACEI-induced or ARB-induced angioedema were referred by physicians from seven hospitals and by a collaborating general practitioner. In Scotland, 15 cases were recruited via electronic medical records with the Scottish Health Registry (SHARE), as well as the Genetics of Scottish Health Registry for Adverse Drug Reactions (GoSHARE-ADR) website. Individuals who had either stopped using ACEIs or had switched from an ACEI to an ARB were included.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^114KcPiC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Angioedema occurring in the head and neck region is a rare and sometimes life-threatening adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Few studies have investigated the association of common variants with this extreme reaction, but none have explored the combined influence of rare variants yet. Adjudicated cases of ACEI-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE) or ARB-induced angioedema (ARB-AE) and controls were recruited at five different centers. Sequencing of 1,066 samples (408 ACEI-AE, ARB-AE, and 658 controls) was performed using exome-enriched sequence data.

A common variant of the F5 gene that causes an increase in blood clotting (rs6025, p. Arg506Gln, also called factor V Leiden) was significantly associated with both ACEI-AE and ARB-AE (odds ratio: 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.89–4.25). A burden test analysis of five rare missense variants in F5 was also found to be associated with ACEI-AE or ARB-AE (P = 2.09 × 10⁻³). A combined gene risk score of these variants, and the common variants rs6025 and rs6020, showed that individuals carrying at least one variant had 2.21 (95% CI, 1.49–3.27, P = 6.30 × 10⁻⁹) times the odds of having ACEI-AE or ARB-AE.

The increased risk due to the common Leiden allele was confirmed in a genome-wide association study from the United States. A high risk of angioedema was also observed for the rs6020 variant that is the main coagulation defect-causing variant in Black African and Asian populations. We found that deleterious missense variants in F5 are associated with an increased risk of angioedema.

### Entresto [^1156DbSx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Entresto is contraindicated in the following cases:

- **Hypersensitivity**: In patients with hypersensitivity to any component.

- **History of angioedema**: In patients with a history of angioedema related to previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

- **Concomitant use with ACE inhibitors**: Do not administer within 36 hours of switching from or to an ACE inhibitor [see drug interactions (7.1)].

- **Concomitant use with aliskiren**: In patients with diabetes [see drug interactions (7.1)].

Each of these conditions serves as a contraindication for using Entresto.

### Strategies to meet lower blood pressure goals with a new standard in angiotensin II receptor blockade [^115WHzoc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The continued poor rates of blood pressure (BP) control to the recommended target BP of < 140/90 mm Hg in patients with hypertension indicate a persistent need for improved antihypertensive therapy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) constitute the newest approved class of antihypertensive agents. As with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system but do so through a more specific mechanism.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but angiotensin II may be produced by several alternate pathways. In contrast, angiotensin II receptor blockers inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, independent of the pathway of angiotensin II production. Comparative safety and efficacy trials indicate that ARBs are similar to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of BP-lowering effectiveness and have superior tolerability.

Olmesartan medoxomil is the newest and one of the most effective ARBs. In controlled trials, it has been shown to provide 24-hour BP control with antihypertensive efficacy at least as good as that of the calcium channel blockers amlodipine besylate, felodipine, and the beta-blocker atenolol. In a comparative study, olmesartan medoxomil demonstrated significantly greater reductions in diastolic BP than did three other leading ARBs — losartan potassium, irbesartan, and valsartan. With the convenience of placebo-like tolerability and once-daily dosing, combined with excellent antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan medoxomil stands out as a preferred option for hypertension management.

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^116uKXLt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease causing significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Comorbidity in asthma is common; 62.6% of people with asthma were reported to have one or more comorbidities, and the likelihood of having coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease is significantly greater in people with asthma compared with the general population. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are commonly prescribed medicines indicated for the management of these chronic diseases. They block the enzyme responsible for converting the peptide hormone angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, which stimulates aldosterone release and causes vasoconstriction. Although ACEIs have beneficial effects in managing these chronic diseases, many patients are intolerant of long-term ACEIs. The most common reason is a dry persistent cough. This adverse drug reaction is thought to occur in around 10% of people treated with ACEIs and may be related to increased levels of bradykinin. This adverse reaction is considered a class effect of ACEIs, which suggests that even low doses may also alter bradykinin levels in susceptible patients.

In people who develop ACEI intolerance from cough, it is recommended that patients are switched to angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Angiotensin-II receptor blockers have properties similar to those of ACEIs but do not cause a persistent dry cough. They inhibit angiotensin-II in a similar manner.

### Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with the risk of hospitalization and death in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 [^115y2dtA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We constructed cohorts of enrollees for each of the two studies. For the outpatient study, we included individuals aged 18 years or older with six or more months of enrollment in Medicare Advantage or commercial insurance from January through December 2019 and available claims data. These individuals had a diagnosis of hypertension in claims, were receiving one or more antihypertensive agents, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in an outpatient setting between March 6, 2020, and May 3, 2020. The Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals in the study represented all individuals with available claims in the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database who satisfied the inclusion criteria.

For the inpatient study, we identified an inpatient cohort of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. This included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least six months of health insurance enrollment in 2019 with available claims data, a diagnosis of hypertension in one or more claims, who were receiving one or more antihypertensive agents, and were hospitalized with a primary or secondary diagnosis of COVID-19 between January 5, 2020, and May 10, 2020.

For both studies, the diagnosis of hypertension was based on ICD-10 codes, and drug treatment for hypertension was defined by the receipt of one or more agents included in the 2017 American Heart Association hypertension guidelines. These include first-line agents such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^113i4CED]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

It is now accepted that most hypertensive patients will not reach and maintain blood pressure (BP) goals on monotherapy. Therefore, initial combination therapy is increasingly used and recommended by guidelines, particularly for patients with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as a history of prior CV events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and evidence of organ damage, such as renal disease. Guidelines also recommend the use of single-pill combinations (SPCs) over free-drug combinations due to their improved adherence.

In patients with evidence of renal disease or those at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as individuals with diabetes and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines clearly recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared to other classes of antihypertensive agents. Combinations containing an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) rather than an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may be preferred because ARBs are associated with superior tolerability, potentially leading to improved adherence. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with proteinuria and/or renal insufficiency, ARB-based treatment is recommended because these agents delay the progression of nephropathy.

### Are angiotensin II receptor blockers more efficacious than placebo in heart failure? Implications of ELITE-2. Evaluation of losartan in the elderly [^116gNASN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

In light of the recent randomized controlled trials in chronic heart failure, it is now commonly assumed that treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) is equivalent to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. We performed an imputed placebo analysis using previous placebo-ACE inhibitor trials and ACE inhibitor-ARB comparison studies, which shows that ARBs may not even be superior to placebos, let alone an ACE inhibitor.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: What is the 'right' dose [^114qnoHY]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

A further underappreciated consideration is the influence of concomitant therapy on the dosing of an added treatment. This can be best seen in two trials (CIBIS III and CARMEN), which compared the initiation of treatment with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) or a beta‐blocker (bisoprolol or carvedilol) first, and subsequently adding the alternative second. When enalapril was used first, the dose achieved was larger than when it was used second, i.e. added to a beta‐blocker rather than used before a beta‐blocker. Of course, in the trial on which our target dose of enalapril is based (the treatment arm of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction, SOLVD‐T), the use of a beta‐blocker was minimal.

This 'target dose' approach, used in the original placebo‐controlled landmark trials involving renin–angiotensin system blockers, also influenced the design of subsequent trials comparing and adding alternative agents such as the neprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination sacubitril/valsartan and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren.

### Association of use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers with testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^112cDDBy]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) during the COVID-19 pandemic is a topic of significant debate. Recommendations have emerged suggesting the discontinuation of these medications, which are vital in managing several chronic diseases. In contrast, absent clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated for their continued use.

The objective of this study was to explore the association between the use of ACEIs/ARBs and the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. Furthermore, it aimed to assess outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive, focusing on the severity of clinical outcomes such as hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation.

This retrospective cohort study, employing overlap propensity score weighting, was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. It included all patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020.

The exposures involved included a history of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing.

Main outcomes and measures included the results of COVID-19 testing in the full cohort, along with the number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive.

Results indicated that a total of 18,472 patients were tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years; 7,384 (40%) were male, and 12,725 (69%) were white. Of the 18,472 patients tested for COVID-19, 2,285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs.

### Angioedema, ACE inhibitor and COVID-19 [^112pDbnU]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, binds to the ACE2 receptors. ACE2 is thought to counterbalance ACE in the renin-angiotensin system. While it is presently advised that patients continue to use ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, questions still remain as to whether adverse effects are potentiated by the virus. Here, we report a case of a 57-year-old man, unknowingly with COVID-19, who presented to the emergency department with tongue swelling, shortness of breath, and difficulty in speaking following four months of taking benazepril, an ACE inhibitor. Finally, we also describe possible pathways that exist for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with the mechanism behind angioedema.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^1141AH8S]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Angioedema occurring in the head and neck region is a rare and sometimes life-threatening adverse reaction to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Few studies have investigated the association of common variants with this extreme reaction, but none have explored the combined influence of rare variants yet. Adjudicated cases of ACEI-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE) or ARB-induced angioedema (ARB-AE) and controls were recruited at five different centers.

Sequencing of 1,066 samples (408 ACEI-AE, ARB-AE, and 658 controls) was performed using exome-enriched sequence data. A common variant of the F5 gene that causes an increase in blood clotting (rs6025, p. Arg506Gln, also called factor V Leiden) was significantly associated with both ACEI-AE and ARB-AE (odds ratio: 2.85, 95% confidence interval, 1.89–4.25).

A burden test analysis of five rare missense variants in F5 was also found to be associated with ACEI-AE or ARB-AE, P = 2.09 × 10⁻³. A combined gene risk score of these variants, and the common variants rs6025 and rs6020, showed that individuals carrying at least one variant had 2.21 (95% CI, 1.49–3.27, P = 6.30 × 10⁻⁹) times the odds of having ACEI-AE or ARB-AE.

The increased risk due to the common Leiden allele was confirmed in a genome-wide association study from the United States. A high risk of angioedema was also observed for the rs6020 variant that is the main coagulation defect-causing variant in black African and Asian populations. We found that deleterious missense variants in F5 are associated with an increased risk of angioedema.

### Risk for anaphylactic reaction from cardiac catheterization in patients receiving β-adrenergic blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors [^111W9Ywq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

β-Adrenergic blockers (BBs) have been associated with an increased risk of severe anaphylactic reaction (AR) from contrast media; however, this was demonstrated with intravenous contrast media before the widespread use of low osmolar contrast media, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-Is), and cardioselective BBs.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk for AR during cardiac catheterization (CC) associated with BB or ACE-I exposure.

- **Methods**: Patients who experienced adverse reactions during CC from January 2004 to December 2013 were identified; 1 to 2 matched controls were assigned for each case. We analyzed AR rates in association with demographic variables, medication exposures (BBs, ACE-Is, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aspirin), and comorbidities: cardiovascular disorders, asthma, and atopy.

- **Results**: We analyzed 71,782 CCs. Of these, 70 severe reactors were identified — 46 (0.06%) fulfilled AR criteria. There were 35 cases of mild to moderate AR and 11 cases of severe AR (0.015%). There were no significant differences in age (61.3% vs 61.5%), sex (63% vs 64% males), cardiovascular disorder rate (78% vs 93%), and exposure to BBs (46% vs 51%; cardioselective: 77% vs 80%) and ACE-Is (37.0% vs 37.2%) in cases versus controls. Via multivariate logistic regression, BB exposure was not associated with greater AR frequency (P = 0.35) or severity (P = 0.40). Neither cardioselective BBs (P = 0.2) nor noncardioselective BBs (P = 0.5) influenced AR severity. ACE-Is had no effect on AR frequency (P = 0.35) or severity (P = 0.14). Lower AR frequency was associated with cardiovascular di

### ACE inhibitors: upper respiratory symptoms [^114sHPRV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Cough and angioedema are well-known adverse reactions of ACE inhibitors. However, other adverse effects involving the upper airways, such as postnasal drainage, rhinitis, and nasal blockage, are less frequently recognized. These might share the same pathophysiological mechanism: bradykinin accumulation. We present two patients with ACE inhibitor-induced upper respiratory symptoms that improved after the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and substitution with angiotensin II receptor blockers. The incidence of these adverse events is not accurately known since these are not required to be reported, but it is estimated to be low. This presents challenges to the physician and demonstrates the importance of keeping it as a differential diagnosis. Most physicians are aware of ACE inhibitor-induced cough but not of ACE inhibitor-induced nasal blockage, rhinitis, or postnasal drainage. Identifying these can avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatment.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^1178oxk7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The mechanisms by which ACEi/ARB could improve COVID-19-related outcomes are unclear. Initial fears regarding the risks of ACEi/ARB in COVID-19 have largely been based on murine and human studies that have shown increased ACE2 expression in various tissues after ACEi/ARB administration and the discovery that ACE2 serves as the SARS-CoV-2 host receptor. Conversely, studies have demonstrated that ACE2 has a lung protective effect in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, further complicating the overall theoretical role that ACEi/ARB may have in patients with COVID-19. Our study provides supportive evidence for a beneficial impact of ACEi/ARB in patients with COVID-19, which may be due to its purported lung protective mechanisms. In sensitivity analyses, we found the association to be stronger in patients with chronic kidney disease, consistent with its known renoprotective effects in this patient subgroup.

Another potential mechanism for the benefits of ACEi/ARB is through the attenuation of the inflammatory response. ACEi/ARB have previously been shown to attenuate vascular microinflammation in hypertensive patients via angiotensin II receptor blockade and are associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines such as C-reactive protein, a mechanism that could theoretically counter the inflammatory state of COVID-19. We found the use of ACEi/ARB was indeed associated with lower levels of suPAR and C-reactive protein measured on admission, consistent with prior observations of an anti-inflammatory effect for ACEi/ARB.

### Allergic reaction related to ramipril use: A case report [^11565KHy]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely prescribed for patients with diabetes as a nephroprotective drug or to treat hypertension. Generally, they are safe for clinical practice, but the relationship between these drugs and angioedema is known. The exact mechanism for ACE inhibitors-induced angioedema is not clear and remains a matter of discussion.

- **Case report**: We reported a case of a 23-year-old black female with an 11-year history of type 1 diabetes, regularly monitored in the department of diabetes, using 0.98 UI/kg/day of human insulin, who presented an allergic reaction 24 hours after ramipril use. The drug had been prescribed to treat diabetic nephropathy. There was no previous history of drug-induced or alimentary allergy. The patient was instructed to discontinue the use of ramipril, and oral antihistaminic drug and topical corticosteroid were prescribed. Skin biopsies were performed and confirmed the clinical hypothesis of pharmacodermy. The evaluation of ACE polymorphism identified DD genotype. Six months after the withdrawal of ramipril, the patient was prescribed the angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) losartan as a nephroprotective agent. She remained well without adverse reactions.

- **Conclusions**: ACE inhibitors-induced angioedema is uncommon, and the clinical presentation is variable, with lips, tongue, oropharynx, and larynx as the most common locations. The presence of angioedema during treatment requires the immediate cessation of treatment due to the risk of possible severe complications. The case reported presented moderate symptoms.

### β-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not a risk factor for severe systemic sting reactions and adverse events during venom immunotherapy [^116TRcBY]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

From August 2014 until January 2018, a total of 1,425 patients were included in the study. Of these, 330 patients were included in Austria, 41 in the Czech Republic, 68 in Germany, 254 in Italy, 269 in Poland, 279 in Slovenia, 44 in Spain, and 140 in Turkey. Seventy‐five patients refused VIT, and eight patients were lost to follow‐up; therefore, Visit 2 was performed with 1,342 patients. The majority of patients returned to the clinics for the first annual checkup, and Visit 3 was conducted with 1,186 patients.

Of all patients included, 388 (27.2%) took antihypertensive drugs: 10.4% took β‐blockers, 11.9% took ACE inhibitors (ACEI), and 5.0% took both β‐blockers and ACEI. Ninety-three (7.0%) patients who underwent VIT experienced a systemic adverse event, with reactions predominantly being mild. Only one patient suffered from a Grade III reaction, which included flushing and bronchospasm. Large local reactions (LLR) were observed in 348 (26.3%) patients undergoing VIT.

### Renin-angiotensin system blockers and the COVID-19 pandemic: At present there is no evidence to abandon renin-angiotensin system blockers [^113qfQnc]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, some reports of data, still emerging and in need of full analysis, indicate that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of these patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.

Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The present article discusses this concept. ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates, including angiotensins I and II.

ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. Moreover, there is no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 levels without increased virus susceptibility.

### Risk factors for severe reactions in food allergy: Rapid evidence review with meta-analysis [^115sceJi]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of 15 observational studies reported that β-blockers (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–3.8) or ACE inhibitors (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.2) increased (all-cause) anaphylaxis severity; however, the authors were unable to adjust for underlying cardiovascular disease or any differences between food and non-food triggers. Age is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and use of β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or other vasodilators in patients presenting with anaphylaxis; so, it is unclear whether these medicines have a direct impact on severity or if the association is due to confounding factors, such as underlying cardiovascular disease. In a prospective series of accidental allergic reactions to food, prescription of β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers were not more common in those experiencing more severe reactions.

Cofactors such as NSAIDs and exercise may influence severity through an impact on allergen absorption. The gastrointestinal epithelial barrier can be impaired in food allergy, although consistent evidence is lacking. Intestinal permeability is not predictive of food allergy but may have a key role in wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). Measuring food proteins in serum following ingestion is difficult. Nonetheless, greater absorption kinetics for peanut have been reported in peanut-allergic subjects compared with non-allergic controls: significantly lower amounts of peanut (30 mg protein) were required to detect Ara h 6 in serum samples in peanut-allergic individuals, and for any given peanut dose ingested, higher Ara h 6 was found in sera from peanut-allergic individuals.

### Investigation of angioedema associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^11526fJP]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are known to cause angioedema.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the time to onset of angioedema and the subsequent episodes of angioedema in patients initially experiencing ACE-I- or ARB-induced angioedema.

- **Methods**: A manual medical record review was conducted on 64 patients with a diagnosis of urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis as a result of taking an ACE-I or ARB. Data recorded included demographic characteristics, time to onset of symptoms, concomitant medication use, laboratory test results, re-episodes of angioedema, urticaria, or anaphylaxis; and morbidity and mortality.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients with angioedema was 60.2 years (age range, 32–92 years). Women (60%) and African Americans (69%) were affected more commonly. The primary location for angioedema was the lips and tongue. Sixty-one of 64 patients developed at least one episode of angioedema as a result of taking an ACE-I, and 3 patients had angioedema associated with an ARB. The mean time to onset of angioedema after initiation of therapy in 51 patients was 1.8 years, with 13 patients (25%) presenting within the first month and 6 patients (12%) developing angioedema in the first week. No patients required a tracheostomy or died. Also, none of the 6 patients, whose angioedema was attributed to an ACE-I and who then received an ARB, developed re-angioedema in more than 8.1 patient-years of follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Angioedema attributable to an ACE-I or ARB resolves on discontinued use of the medication.

### Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113yP4FY]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The concept of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system originated from an experimental model purporting to show a "synergistic" effect between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. The concept seemed so logical and appealing that seemingly beneficial changes in surrogate endpoints such as blood pressure, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction became accepted as a free pass for dual blockade having cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects. Despite a lack of solid evidence on the safety and efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, this type of therapy has been mentioned in several sets of guidelines. Thus, dual therapy was commonly used in patients with hypertension and with diabetes or proteinuria, or both, and also to a lesser extent in those with heart failure resistant to treatment. Even patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension were not entirely able to escape this fashionable trend. In the United States, more than 200,000 patients are currently treated with dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, most of them by the combination of an angiotensin receptor blocker and ACE inhibitor (70%). Some other combinations are also used, such as two ACE inhibitors (15%), two angiotensin receptor blockers (5%), and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in combination with a direct renin inhibitor (8%). The long-term efficacy and safety of dual blockade is not, however, well-defined.

We compared the long-term efficacy of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (any two of these components)…

### Are ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers dangerous in patients at risk for anaphylaxis [^112BtuPf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers and their effect on patients at risk for anaphylaxis. A literature search was conducted in PubMed to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy.

Some studies show an increased risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, whereas others do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective controlled trials are needed on this important topic.

For those patients at risk of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors. However, for those patients with cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to increase life expectancy. Consideration should be given for the concomitant use of these medications while patients are receiving venom immunotherapy.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers: evidence for preserving target organs [^114t3nQi]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major problem throughout the developed world. Although antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant, and medications may not completely normalize blood pressure. As a result, therapy frequently does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the activity of the RAS, but these two classes of antihypertensive medications have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacologic profiles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. The ACE inhibitors also block the degradation of bradykinin, which may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. Bradykinin is, however, the presumed cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials on ACE inhibitors support the involvement of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease.

Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor selectively. Thus, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target-organ function and reversing cardiovascular damage.

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^116hCGvH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

An increased risk for cough or switching to ARB therapy in people with asthma was recently reported. However, no studies used an active asthma population, examined associations by asthma severity or type of ACEI, or provided information relating to ACEI dose or the rate of health care use before switching. Moreover, information on absolute risk is lacking but is necessary to guide robust health economic and clinical decision-making. Women in the general population are considered to have a 1.5- to 2.3-fold increased risk for switching to ARBs after ACEI therapy; however, the impact of increasing age has been less consistently reported, and a paucity of data remains regarding the association with BMI. We clearly show that all three characteristics are relevant for people with asthma and are strong determinants of the NNT.

- **Strengths and limitations**: This study had several strengths and limitations. First, we analyzed a large clinical population identified using a validated data source and definitions. Although cough is by far the most common reason for ACEI intolerance and switching to an ARB, we were unable to measure ACEI-induced cough directly as an outcome. This would be challenging because cough may not be recorded sufficiently to distinguish between cough related to ACEIs as opposed to another condition, particularly in patients with asthma. Although cough is the predominant reason for ACEI intolerance in the general population, we cannot exclude the possibility that other symptoms such as wheeze or dyspnea may have occurred, which have been reported among asthma patients.

### Intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in asthma and the general population: A UK population-based cohort study [^112dJtTX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

It is recognized that managing comorbidities in patients with asthma may be associated with additional risk. When evaluated for the management of hypertension, ARBs are thought to have similar effects on blood pressure, mortality, and cardiovascular disease outcomes compared with ACEIs, yet fewer patients in the general population withdraw from clinical trials because of adverse effects when treated with ARBs compared with ACEIs. Despite the potentially higher incidence of switching with enalapril, the largest determinant regarding absolute risk in people with asthma appeared to be a person's age, sex, and BMI. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the population combined with the increasing age of patients, such factors are important determinants for considering whether ARBs should be recommended as first-line therapy. This would be particularly relevant in people with asthma, for whom discriminating ACEI-induced cough from symptoms of uncontrolled asthma may be complex, potentially leading to unnecessary asthma treatment if not immediately recognized. Many guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease continue to recommend ACEIs as first-choice therapy, reserving ARBs as an alternative when patients are intolerant to ACEIs. This has led to recent calls to change these recommendations because of the equal efficacy but fewer adverse reactions with ARBs. This would potentially avoid unnecessary healthcare appointments, patient treatment disutility, and delays in establishing effective therapy for the underlying clinical condition.

### Icatibant: A novel approach to the treatment of angioedema related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [^116E6r8p]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Angioedema related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (AE-ACEi) has, so far, been treated with antiallergic drugs with questionable results. Because angioedema in this setting is likely related to increased levels of bradykinin, we decided to use icatibant, a bradykinin receptor antagonist licensed for use in hereditary angioedema, in a patient with AE-ACEi. In the same patient, the time to resolution of the angioedema during previous attacks was about two days when classic antiallergic drug regimens were used. When icatibant was used, this time shortened to 10 hours. Icatibant is a promising drug in the treatment of AE-ACEi.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^1159sAQ5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

This study represents the largest whole-exome sequencing analysis of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE) and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema (ARB-AE). It was found that both common and rare variants of the F5 gene are associated with ACEI-AE and ARB-AE. Among these, the factor V Leiden variant (rs6025) showed the strongest correlation. The association with angioedema increased when rs6025 was evaluated alongside rare F5 variants, indicating that both common and rare genetic variants contribute to the risk of developing angioedema.

However, replication of the genetic risk score (GRS) association was not feasible in the Vanderbilt study due to the absence of rare variants in the genotyping data, as these were not detectable when the minor allele frequency (MAF) was less than 1% or the quality of imputation was less than 0.8. Additionally, given the possibility that ACEI-AE and ARB-AE are distinct conditions, the association was further examined excluding the 44 ARB-AE cases. The analysis still demonstrated a significant association with F5 Leiden, as reflected in Table S6, suggesting that the inclusion of ARB-AE cases does not obscure the effect.

### Exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in F5 associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema [^111DaJPL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). High credibility.

Studies have reported that the risk of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema (ACEI-AE) varies according to ethnicity and gender, with women and Black Africans being more likely to develop this particular adverse drug reaction (ADR).

Although previous studies assessed common variants in the association between ACE inhibitors and angioedema, they have had limited success in identifying a genetic basis for this ADR. This study used next-generation sequencing technology to assess the influence of low frequency variants with intermediate penetrance and higher relative risks. It combined the association with common variants in ACEI-AE and angiotensin receptor blocker-induced angioedema (ARB-AE), using cases and controls recruited in Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and England.

We report novel results from both analyses of common and rare variants. Replication was performed in a cohort from the United States, and we developed a gene risk score (GRS) for angioedema using common and rare variants of F5.

### Risk of severe COVID-19 disease with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: Cohort study including 8.3 million people [^116SUNiL]. Heart (2020). High credibility.

Although several studies have considered the effect in hospitalized patients of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system on disease course, none has looked at population use of these drugs to determine if they modulate susceptibility. We report a large, population-based study where we examined the drug histories of approximately 20% of all patients who tested positive for coronavirus in England to determine if there was an independent association between ACE inhibitor and ARB drug prescription and severe COVID-19 disease susceptibility and progression.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension: To use or not to use [^115tMHxs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-choice therapy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are merely considered an alternative for ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The aim of this review was to compare outcomes and adverse events between ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients. In patients with hypertension and hypertension with compelling indications, we found no difference in efficacy between ARBs and ACE inhibitors with regard to the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure and outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. However, ACE inhibitors remain associated with cough and a very low risk of angioedema and fatalities. Overall withdrawal rates because of adverse events are lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. Given the equal outcome efficacy but fewer adverse events with ARBs, risk-to-benefit analysis in aggregate indicates that at present there is little, if any, reason to use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension or its compelling indications.

### β-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not a risk factor for severe systemic sting reactions and adverse events during venom immunotherapy [^1175M4gP]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

- **Primary outcome**: Of all patients who underwent VIT, 338 (25.2%) took β‐blockers and/or ACEI. Only 19 (5.6%) patients, who were taking β‐blockers or ACEI, experienced a systemic AE compared to 74 (7.4%) patients not taking such drugs, resulting in an odds ratio (OR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43–1.22, p = 0.25). In detail, 4 of 123 (3.3%) had systemic AE taking β‐blockers, 13 of 157 (8.3%) experienced systemic AE under ACEI treatment, and 2 of 58 (3.5%) had systemic AE taking both β‐blockers and ACEI (p = 0.15). All systemic AE in patients with antihypertensive treatment were mild‐to‐moderate reactions. The most severe reaction occurred in a patient not taking AHT drugs.

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- **Adverse events**: The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases or hypertension was no risk factor for systemic AE during VIT (p = 0.11). Bee venom caused more systemic AE during VIT: 13.0% of patients treated with bee venom had systemic reactions, but only 4.3% of patients treated with vespid venom (p < 0.001). We did not detect a statistically significant effect of elevated basal tryptase levels on the frequency of systemic AE during VIT: 6.8% of patients with normal tryptase levels compared with 10.8% of patients with elevated tryptase levels had systemic AE (p = 0.16). There was still no effect on systemic AE when the analysis was performed separately for bee venom– and vespid venom–allergic patients (p = 0.23 and p = 0.18, respectively).

### Enalaprilat [^112kM1vk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including enalaprilat injection) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.

- **Angioedema**: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalaprilat. This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases, enalaprilat injection should be promptly discontinued, and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips, the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g. subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided (see adverse reactions).

Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also indications and usage and contraindications). Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing were noted.

### Tekturna [^117ErU4N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tekturna has several contraindications to consider:

- **Contraindications for use with ARBs or ACEIs**: Do not use Tekturna with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in patients with diabetes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Hypersensitivity concerns**: Tekturna is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Pediatric contraindications**: Tekturna is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risk of high aliskiren exposures identified in juvenile animals, attributed to immaturity of transporters and metabolic enzymes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Updated report on comparative effectiveness of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors for patients with essential hypertension: Much more data, little new information [^111r1MmF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: A 2007 systematic review compared angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with hypertension. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have since been introduced, and significant new research has been published. We sought to update and expand the 2007 review.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (through December 2010) and selected other sources for relevant English-language trials.

- **Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions**: We included studies that directly compared ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or DRIs in at least 20 total adults with essential hypertension; had at least 12 weeks of follow-up; and reported at least one outcome of interest. Ninety-seven (97) studies (36 new since 2007) directly comparing ACE inhibitors versus ARBs and three studies directly comparing DRIs to ACE inhibitors or ARBs were included.

- **Study appraisal and synthesis methods**: A standard protocol was used to extract data on study design, interventions, population characteristics, and outcomes; evaluate study quality; and summarize the evidence.

- **Results**: In spite of substantial new evidence, none of the conclusions from the 2007 review changed. The level of evidence remains high for equivalence between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for blood pressure lowering and use as single antihypertensive agents, as well as for the superiority of ARBs for short-term adverse events (primarily cough). However, the new evidence was insufficient on long-term cardiovascular outcomes, quality of life, and progression of renal disease.

### Are two better than one? Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors plus angiotensin receptor blockers for reducing blood pressure and proteinuria in kidney disease [^113YzA3U]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). High credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers each reduce proteinuria and blood pressure. Several studies have compared the antiproteinuric and antihypertensive effects of combination therapy using both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with those of therapy using either drug class alone. This article reviews those trials as well as evidence suggesting a mechanism for the benefits observed with combination therapy.

### Effects of the angiotensin-receptor blocker telmisartan on cardiovascular events in high-risk patients intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a randomised controlled trial [^117YWE9y]. Lancet (2008). High credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce major cardiovascular events but are not tolerated by about 20% of patients. We therefore assessed whether the angiotensin-receptor blocker telmisartan would be effective in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors with cardiovascular disease or diabetes with end-organ damage.

- **Methods**: After a 3-week run-in period, 5,926 patients, many of whom were receiving concomitant proven therapies, were randomised to receive telmisartan 80 mg/day (n = 2,954) or placebo (n = 2,972) by use of a central automated randomisation system. Randomisation was stratified by hospital. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalisation for heart failure. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00153101.

- **Findings**: The median duration of follow-up was 56 (IQR 51–64) months. All randomised patients were included in the efficacy analyses. Mean blood pressure was lower in the telmisartan group than in the placebo group throughout the study (weighted mean difference between groups 4.0/2.2 [SD 19.6/12.0] mm Hg). A total of 465 (15.7%) patients experienced the primary outcome in the telmisartan group compared with 504 (17.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.81–1.05, p = 0.216). One of the secondary outcomes — a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke — occurred in 384 (13.0%) patients on telmisartan compared with 440 (14.8%) on placebo (0.87, 0.76–1.00, p = 0.048 unadjusted; p = 0.068 after adjustment).

### Relationship between anaphylaxis and use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^111xLyLm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers (BBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been associated with an increased risk and severity of anaphylaxis. However, the evidence supporting these findings is contradictory.

- **Objective**: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assess the influence of BBs and ACEIs on anaphylaxis.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science for relevant observational studies. We searched for studies where the presence and severity of anaphylaxis were compared between patients taking BBs, ACEIs, both types of drugs, or neither type of drug. We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: A total of 21 studies met the study criteria. Of these, 15 assessed the severity and 9 the incidence of anaphylaxis. The studies brought together 22,313 anaphylaxis episodes for the severity studies and 18,101 anaphylaxis episodes for the studies of new cases of anaphylaxis. BBs and ACEIs increased the severity of anaphylaxis (BBs, odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–3.84; ACEIs, OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12–2.16), but not the presence of new cases of anaphylaxis (BBs, OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.91–2.14; ACEIs, OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.39–4.86). It was not possible to perform an analysis adjusted for cardiovascular diseases, because only one study each for BBs and ACEIs, respectively, had adjusted data.

- **Conclusions**: The quality of evidence showing that the use of BBs and ACEI increases the severity of anaphylaxis is low owing to differences in the constituent data.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^111hBVNg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anaphylaxis, particularly concerning the use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of venom immunotherapy in patients with a history of insect sting anaphylaxis treated with β-blockers or ACE inhibitors. This should involve shared decision-making regarding the benefits and potential harms of continuing immunotherapy and medication compared to withholding either the immunotherapy or the medication.

### Pollen count and presentation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^111pcMWf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema is increased in patients with seasonal allergies.

- **Objective**: We tested the hypothesis that patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema present during months when pollen counts are increased.

- **Methods**: Cohort analysis examined the month of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema and pollen counts in the ambulatory and hospital setting. Patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema were ascertained through: (1) an observational study of patients presenting to Vanderbilt University Medical Center; (2) patients presenting to the Marshfield Clinic and participating in the Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project; and (3) patients enrolled in The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). Measurements include date of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema, population exposure to ACE inhibitors by date, and local pollen counts by date.

- **Results**: At Vanderbilt, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with tree pollen months (P = 0.01 from χ² test). When separate analyses were conducted in patients with a history of seasonal allergies and patients without, the rate of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema was increased during tree pollen months only in patients with a history of seasonal allergies (P = 0.002). In Marshfield, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with ragweed pollen months (P = 0.025). In ONTARGET, a positive trend was observed between the ACE inhibitor use and angioedema events, but the result was cut off and incomplete in the publication.

### Renin-angiotensin system blocker and outcomes of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hoBtM]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

The association of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with disease severity in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate if ACEI/ARB use is associated with the risk of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: We searched all available clinical studies that included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who could be classified into an ACEI/ARB group and a non-ACEI/ARB group up until 4 May 2020. A meta-analysis was performed, and primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and severe disease.

- **Results**: ACEI/ARB use did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality both in meta-analysis for 11 studies with 12,601 patients reporting ORs (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.37 to 0.72, moderate certainty of evidence) and in 2 studies with 8,577 patients presenting HRs. For 12,848 patients in 13 studies, ACEI/ARB use was not related to an increased risk of severe disease in COVID-19 (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.44 to 1.07; I² = 95%, low certainty of evidence).

- **Conclusions**: ACEI/ARB therapy was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality or severe manifestations in patients with COVID-19. ACEI/ARB therapy can be continued without concern of drug-related worsening in patients with COVID-19.

### Multiple drug intolerance in antihypertensive patients: What is known and what is missing [^113wUvdX]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Drug allergy and intolerance are increasingly recognized as significant public health concerns, leading to adverse reactions in patients undergoing pharmacological treatments. Multiple drug intolerance syndrome (MDIS), characterized by adverse reactions to at least three different drug classes without a clear immunological mechanism, poses a substantial challenge, particularly in hypertensive patients. Despite its link to suboptimal adherence and uncontrolled blood pressure, MDIS in the context of hypertension remains insufficiently explored.

This review synthesizes existing literature on MDIS, emphasizing clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, and psychiatric comorbidity. Furthermore, it delves into MDIS in the context of hypertension, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosis and management, including innovative therapeutic strategies such as novel therapeutic algorithms or renal denervation. The review concludes by emphasizing the necessity for further research and clinical trials to enhance our understanding and address MDIS, especially in hypertensive patients.

### Association of albuminuria levels with the prescription of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^11296y51]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple clinical guidelines recommend an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for patients with elevated albuminuria, which can be measured through urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), protein-to-creatinine ratio, or dipstick. However, how albuminuria test results relate to the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB is uncertain. We identified individuals with an ACR measurement between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2018, who had no contraindications or allergies to ACE inhibitors/ARBs.

We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association between ACR level and the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB within 6 months after the test. Similar methods were applied to investigate the association of the protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement results with the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB.

Among 67,237 individuals with an ACR measurement, 47.7% were already taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB at the time of the first ACR measurement. Among the 35,138 individuals not on ACE inhibitor/ARB, those with higher ACR levels were more likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitor/ARB in the following 6 months, with steep increases in prescriptions until ACR reached 300 mg/g, after which the association plateaued. The majority (80.9%) of ACE inhibitor/ARB prescriptions were made by family medicine and internal medicine. A similar pattern was observed in the cohorts tested by protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement.

Our study provides evidence that albuminuria test results change patient care, suggesting that adherence to albuminuria testing guidelines can impact clinical decision-making.

### SPL drug information for captopril [^115GuUkj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (n.d.). High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of captopril PO (also known as Capoten):

- **Ace inhibitor-induced angioedema**: Use caution in patients taking mTOR inhibitors.

- **Anaphylactoid reactions**: Use caution in patients on hemodialysis with high-flux membranes, undergoing desensitization treatment with hymenoptera venom, or LDL apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.

- **Decreased blood neutrophil count, agranulocytosis**: Use caution in patients with connective tissue diseases (such as SLE or systemic sclerosis) or impaired renal function.

- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients with heart failure or those who are volume or salt depleted, such as individuals receiving diuretics or undergoing dialysis.

- **Increased serum potassium**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia, including renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, or those taking medications causing hyperkalemia or potassium supplements.

- **Increased urine protein, jaundice, ALF**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as captopril has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue in case of jaundice or a marked increase of liver enzymes.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^112HdZPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been t

### Combination inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Is more better [^116iPGGy]? Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are considered the standard of care for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Combination therapy with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers effectively inhibits the renin-angiotensin system and potentiates the vasodilatory effects of bradykinin. It is advocated that this dual blockade approach should theoretically result in improved clinical outcomes in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

Clinical trial evidence for the use of combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in cardiovascular disease has provided conflicting results in hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Clinical trial evidence to support combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic kidney disease has largely been based on proteinuria reduction as a surrogate marker for clinically meaningful outcomes. Recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have not been able to validate protection in halting progression in chronic kidney disease with a dual blockade approach. This review serves as an appraisal of the clinical evidence of combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade in both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.
