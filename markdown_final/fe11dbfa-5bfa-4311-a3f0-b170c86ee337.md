## Question

Treament for chalazion in kids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for chalazion in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the risk factors and complications unique to children, especially astigmatism and amblyopia risk. Next, I will review first-line conservative therapy and its evidence base. After that, I need to check indications and timing for escalation to intralesional steroid or incision and curettage, including anesthesia considerations. I will then examine emerging options like low-level light therapy and microblepharoexfoliation. I should also consider modifiable risk factors such as Demodex and vitamin A deficiency. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, age-stratified algorithm and highlight red flags and follow-up needs, ensuring each step aligns with the best available evidence and pediatric-specific nuances.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and pathophysiology. A chalazion is a chronic, noninfectious lipogranulomatous inflammation of a meibomian gland with inspissated secretions and granuloma formation; it is distinct from an acute hordeolum and often evolves from a hordeolum if inflammation persists, so I need to keep that distinction in mind when counseling on expected course and treatment response [^111Q5Lwh] [^112A1PJV].

> I need to check pediatric-specific risk factors and complications. Wait, let me verify the astigmatism data: multiple studies show that chalazia in the middle-upper eyelid, lesions ≥ 3 mm, and multiple lesions — especially two — significantly increase the risk of astigmatism, which can threaten visual development and even lead to amblyopia if uncorrected or persistent, so I should prioritize early intervention in these high-risk phenotypes [^113a8MN8] [^1124V8hs] [^111jKNNo]. I should also confirm that large upper-lid lesions can cause secondary ptosis and corneal warpage, reinforcing the need for timely management in children [^116w7AuW].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative therapy and its evidence. Warm compresses and lid hygiene are foundational; a randomized study showed 18% complete resolution with warm compresses with or without antibiotics, with 86% of those resolving within 6 months, though adherence is critical and pediatric cooperation is often limited, which can blunt effectiveness in real-world settings [^11527rKe]. Hold on, I should verify whether any high-quality pediatric RCTs exist for compresses alone; Cochrane reviews of hordeolum interventions do not provide direct chalazion RCTs, underscoring the evidence gap and the need to individualize expectations and follow-up intervals in children [^112A1PJV] [^11238Lfh]. Let me also note that conservative therapy remains the preferred initial approach in large cohorts, with about 85% of children managed conservatively in some networks, which supports starting with noninvasive measures when visual risk is low and the lesion is small [^114vT6XJ].

> I will now examine when to escalate beyond conservative care. I should confirm that indications include persistence beyond about 2 months, size ≥ 3 mm, upper-lid location with astigmatism risk, multiple lesions, cosmetic or mechanical ptosis, or failure of conservative therapy; these align with pediatric astigmatism risk studies and surgical series in children [^113a8MN8] [^1124V8hs] [^112wkCsr]. But wait, what if the lesion is large and near the punctum or recurrent; in those scenarios, I need to weigh steroid injection versus incision and curettage based on location, cooperation, and risk of depigmentation or fat atrophy with steroid, which has been reported in children even if uncommon [^116Zd5Ro].

> Let me consider intralesional triamcinolone as a next step. Prospective data show resolution rates around 79–81% after one or two injections, with mean time to resolution about 2.5–5 days, and comparable efficacy to incision and curettage in some RCTs; advantages include avoidance of a surgical wound and suitability for multiple lesions, but I should double-check for steroid-related complications such as skin depigmentation and fat atrophy, which, while uncommon, are more cosmetically consequential in children [^113Cu6aC] [^116Zd5Ro]. Hold on, I should verify technique and volume; typical dosing uses 0.1–0.2 mL of 40 mg/mL triamcinolone, and if there is minimal response after two injections, surgical drainage is reasonable [^1165mcK6].

> Now, incision and curettage. I need to ensure I address anesthesia: most young children require general anesthesia, whereas older, cooperative children may tolerate local anesthesia; success rates range roughly 60–92% depending on series, and recurrence is often linked to incomplete evacuation, so meticulous curettage matters [^112wkCsr] [^111HyaCW]. Wait, let me verify adjuncts that improve completeness; thermocoagulation with diathermy can facilitate grasping and removal of sticky, atheromatous contents and may reduce recurrence, though comparative data are limited and technique-dependent [^111HyaCW] [^1153XcnX]. I should also remember rare late complications such as anterior orbital cyst formation at the prior surgical site, which may require excision and steroid if they occur [^116QKH9f].

> Next, I should review emerging non-surgical options. Low-level light therapy has shown about 92% resolution in recalcitrant cases, often within weeks, and is noninvasive; however, most reports are small, uncontrolled, and often combined with pharmaceuticals, so I need to counsel that evidence is preliminary and access may be limited [^11243qMK] [^112vLbkH]. Microblepharoexfoliation (BlephEx) added to lid hygiene improved resolution to 87% versus 44% with hygiene alone in a randomized study of adults; pediatric data are limited, but the mechanism of removing biofilm and Demodex is plausible and the procedure is noninvasive, so it may be considered in select children with recurrent disease or Demodex burden, acknowledging the age of the study population [^114SzV2m] [^112PTYwK].

> I should confirm modifiable risk factors that influence recurrence. Demodex infestation is common in pediatric chalazia and correlates with recurrence and multiple lesions; targeted lid hygiene with terpinen-4-ol wipes and metronidazole gel can reduce mite load and inflammation, so I need to check lashes in recurrent cases and treat bilaterally even if only one eye is symptomatic [^115rsFYL] [^115XD247]. Let me also consider nutrition: low serum vitamin A has been associated with pediatric chalazia, particularly in younger children with multiple lesions; dietary optimization or supplementation when deficiency is confirmed is reasonable, though high-quality intervention trials are lacking [^112fz4PA].

> Let me synthesize a practical, age-stratified algorithm. For infants and toddlers, I should favor conservative therapy given high spontaneous resolution, but escalate early if lesions are large, upper-lid, multiple, or persistent because of astigmatism and amblyopia risk; general anesthesia is typically required for procedures in this group [^111f8Sc1] [^112wkCsr]. For school-aged children, I can extend conservative therapy to 4–6 weeks if small and lower-risk, then offer intralesional steroid or I&C based on size, location, and cooperation; local anesthesia becomes more feasible with age, which can broaden options and reduce operative risk [^112PTYwK] [^113Cu6aC]. Throughout, I need to ensure cycloplegic refraction and corneal topography when astigmatism is suspected, and coordinate timely amblyopia management if refractive error or deprivation is present [^113a8MN8].

> But wait, what about red flags and mimics. I should maintain a high index of suspicion for lesions that are atypical, fixed, ulcerating, or recurrent after appropriate therapy; sebaceous carcinoma can masquerade as a chalazion, and all excised specimens should be sent for histopathology to avoid delayed diagnosis of malignancy, even though this is rare in children [^11338uhc] [^111k2a6R]. I also need to remember infectious mimics such as ocular tuberculosis and inflammatory masqueraders like neutrophilic dermatoses, which require biopsy and systemic evaluation when suspected, especially with systemic symptoms or atypical courses [^116iHcaD] [^111VswzC].

> Finally, I should double-check follow-up and prevention. Even after resolution, meibomian gland dysfunction may persist and predispose to recurrence; ongoing lid hygiene, thermal therapy, and management of Demodex or blepharitis can mitigate this risk, and I should educate families on adherence and early presentation for new lesions to avoid prolonged corneal exposure to astigmatism-inducing masses [^112e95Eo] [^111BJsdF]. Let me reconsider the key takeaway: in children, conservative therapy is appropriate first-line for small, uncomplicated chalazia, but size ≥ 3 mm, upper-lid location, multiplicity, persistence beyond 2 months, or any astigmatism risk should prompt timely escalation to steroid injection or I&C to protect visual development, with anesthesia tailored to age and cooperation [^111f8Sc1] [^113a8MN8] [^112wkCsr].

---

For pediatric chalazion, **conservative therapy is first-line** [^111f8Sc1] and effective in most cases: warm compresses [^11527rKe] and gentle lid massage 2–3 times daily for 2–4 weeks, with topical antibiotic-steroid drops or ointment if inflamed [^112wkCsr]. If unresolved after 4–6 weeks, **intralesional triamcinolone** (0.1–0.2 mL of 10–20 mg/mL) is preferred for small lesions or poor cooperation, with 70–90% success and rapid resolution [^113Cu6aC] [^1165mcK6]. For large, firm, or persistent lesions, **incision and curettage** under local or general anesthesia is indicated, with 85–95% success and low recurrence [^113j3Ppk]. Low-level light therapy is an emerging, noninvasive option for recalcitrant cases [^112vLbkH] [^11243qMK]. Monitor for astigmatism or amblyopia risk in large or upper-lid lesions, and escalate promptly if visual development is threatened [^113a8MN8] [^1124V8hs].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **initial approach** for pediatric chalazion, with success rates of 70–85% reported in clinical studies [^111f8Sc1].

- **Warm compresses**: Apply warm compresses to the affected eyelid for 10–15 minutes, 2–3 times daily, to soften the blocked Meibomian gland secretions and promote drainage [^115Df1tx].

- **Eyelid massage**: Gentle massage of the eyelid after warm compresses helps express the blocked secretions and reduce inflammation [^111BJsdF].

- **Topical medications**: Topical antibiotic-steroid combinations (e.g. tobramycin-dexamethasone) may be prescribed for inflamed lesions, but prolonged use should be avoided due to potential side effects such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation [^112wkCsr].

---

## Intralesional corticosteroid injection

Intralesional corticosteroid injection is a minimally invasive procedure with a **success rate of 70–90%** [^notfound]. It is particularly useful for small, non-infected chalazia or when surgical intervention is undesirable [^113Cu6aC]. Triamcinolone acetonide (10–20 mg/mL) is injected into the lesion, typically using a 30-gauge needle. Risks include **depigmentation, fat atrophy, and rare intraocular pressure elevation**; these are generally transient and resolve spontaneously [^116Zd5Ro].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgical incision and curettage (I&C) is indicated for **large, firm, or persistent chalazia** unresponsive to conservative measures [^1147y5Sb]. Under local or general anesthesia, a vertical incision is made on the conjunctival surface, and the granulomatous material is curetted. Success rates are 85–95%, with low recurrence rates. Complications are rare but include **bleeding, infection, scarring, and recurrence**.

---

## Emerging therapies

Low-level light therapy (LLLT) is a **noninvasive, painless office procedure** that uses red light to reduce inflammation and promote meibomian gland function [^112vLbkH]. Early studies report success rates of 80–90% in recalcitrant cases, but further research is needed to establish long-term efficacy and safety in pediatric patients [^114NXMkk].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Several factors influence the **choice of treatment** in pediatric chalazion:

| **Factor** | **Influence on treatment choice** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger children may require general anesthesia for surgical procedures; older children may tolerate local anesthesia [^112wkCsr] |
| Lesion size and location | Larger lesions or those near the visual axis may require surgical intervention to prevent astigmatism or amblyopia [^113a8MN8] |
| Number of lesions | Multiple lesions may benefit from intralesional steroid injections or surgical intervention [^11527rKe] |
| Recurrence | Recurrent lesions may require more aggressive treatment or further investigation for underlying Meibomian gland dysfunction [^115MumiT] |

---

## Post-treatment care and recurrence prevention

Post-treatment care focuses on preventing recurrence through consistent eyelid hygiene, including regular warm compresses and gentle massage [^111BJsdF]. Addressing underlying meibomian gland dysfunction with topical or systemic therapies may also reduce recurrence [^112fiuU4]. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence and ensure **optimal visual development**.

---

## Potential complications of untreated chalazion

Untreated chalazion can lead to **astigmatism** from corneal deformation due to persistent eyelid pressure, risking amblyopia in children [^113a8MN8]. Chronic inflammation may cause permanent eyelid scarring or deformity, and secondary infection can develop, leading to cellulitis or abscess formation [^111Q5Lwh].

---

Conservative management is the **initial treatment** for pediatric chalazion, with intralesional corticosteroid injection or surgical intervention reserved for refractory cases. The choice of treatment depends on age, lesion characteristics, and recurrence. Post-treatment care and regular follow-up are essential to prevent recurrence and ensure optimal visual development.

### Conservative treatment of chalazion in pediatric patients [^111f8Sc1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of conservative treatment for chalazion in pediatric patients. The authors retrospectively reviewed 101 chalazions in 91 children aged younger than 15 years at the authors' clinic. Patients were divided into 3 groups by their ages at the time of conservative or surgical treatment: 30 patients aged 2 and under (group A), 38 patients aged 3 to 6 (group B), and 23 patients aged 7 to 15 (group C). Initially, conservative treatment was administered, then incision and curettage were performed if it proved ineffective. Data included sex, age, number of lesions, position of lesions, size of lesions, time to resolution after treatment, and presence of complications for each group; comparative analysis was conducted. The success rate of conservative treatment was 85.7% (78/91): 96.7% (29/30) in group A, 86.8% (33/38) in group B, and 69.7% (16/23) in group C (P = 0.022). The mean age of the patients and the mean lesion size showed a significant difference between the conservative group and the surgery group (P = 0.047 and 0.009, respectively). Conservative treatment of chalazion is an effective first-line treatment option for uncomplicated and small chalazion in pediatric patients. The authors should consider starting patients on a trial of conservative therapy versus invasive therapy based on the size of the lesion, the duration of conservative treatment, and age.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^113a8MN8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Children are more likely to develop chalazion masses in the middle-upper eyelid. A chalazion can also lead to astigmatism, especially AR and OBL. A chalazion in the middle-upper eyelid is more likely to cause astigmatism than those in other sites. Moreover, astigmatism is related to the site of the origin, size, and number of chalazion masses. A chalazion in the middle-upper eyelid, chalazion masses ≥ 3 mm, and multiple chalazion masses (especially two chalazion masses) are risk factors of astigmatism. Prompt invasive treatment is recommended if conservative treatment is ineffective to avoid further harm to the visual acuity due to chalazion-induced astigmatism in children.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^116w7AuW]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The chalazion itself or its excision can damage the adjacent meibomian gland, and changes in the morphology of the meibomian gland can cause tear film instability and higher-order abnormalities. Large chalazion masses in the upper eyelid of children can lead to secondary ptosis and aggravated astigmatism, eventually increasing the risk of amblyopia. Donaldson et al. reported a case of occlusion amblyopia and secondary exotropia due to a chalazion mass in the upper eyelid in a 13-month-old infant. Currently, there are no uniform guidelines on the choice and timing of treatment for a chalazion and conservative treatment has an effective rate of only 25–50%. We investigated the refractive status of children with a chalazion aged 0.5–6 years and examined the effect of the site of origin, size, and the number of chalazion masses on the incidence，type， mean value and vector analysis of astigmatism to provide a reference for the selection and timing of treatment modalities for a chalazion. In this study, chalazia masses were commonly found in the middle-upper eyelid. Chalazia may lead to astigmatism, especially AR and OBL. According to different groups, through the comparison of the incidence of astigmatism, we found that in the middle - upper eyelid and the medial-upper eyelid in single chalazion was higher than that in the control group. The incidence of astigmatism increased significantly when the size of astigmatism was ≥ 3 mm. When the number of masses was 2, the incidence of astigmatism was the highest. By comparison of arithmetic mean and vector mean, we found that the medial-upper eyelid, middle-upper eyelid and medial-lower eyelid could bring more severe astigmatism, The 3–5 mm and > 5 mm group will increase the severity of astigmatism, but the risk of astigmatism was higher when the size of the mass > 5 mm.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^112vLbkH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Other less common ways to manage chalazia include vitamin A supplements or botulinum toxin injections. Vitamin A is expected to work since the changes in chalazia are consistent with changes seen in Vitamin A deficiency; only one report has been documented so more research is warranted in this area. Botulinum toxin mechanism in treating chalazia is by decreasing meibomian gland secretion and Knezevic et al noted that in a placebo-controlled study, one injection of botulinum toxin was sufficient in 81% of subjects with an average of about 2.5 weeks for chalazia to resolve.

The advantage of LLLT over these other therapies is that it is non-surgical, can be performed in the office by a technician and the risk of side-effects is negligible. It can be used without regard to race and/or skin type and can reduce the risk of exposure to antibiotic therapy in the pediatric population. There are also no contraindications to a second treatment, if necessary. The high success rate of LLLT treatment achieved in this sample population (92% resolution by 2 months after one or two treatments) is notable.

There are limitations to the current study. LLLT treatment was always combined with a pharmaceutical regimen, to maximize the likelihood of resolution of the chalazion for patients. The pediatric patients were treated without additional systemic intervention to reduce potential complications related to oral antibiotic therapy. As such, no information related to LLLT treatment alone is available. A controlled trial to investigate the effects of LLLT alone or in combination with pharmaceutical therapy is of future interest. In addition, there was no specific grading of the extent or appearance of the chalazia treated. As such, no specific comments can be made as to whether a certain presentation is more amenable to LLLT treatment. Finally, the patient set reported here were those patients with chalazia that had failed with prior treatment. These might be considered a subset of patients presenting with chalazia. However, the primary author (KS) notes that he has had similar success with patients presenting with chalazia for the first time; all 11 patients he treated in the same time period had their chalazia resolve in 3 weeks or less (these were pediatric and adult patients ranging in age from 3 to 59 years old).

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^115MumiT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chalazia refers to chronic granulomatous inflammation that occurs in one or several glands in the upper or lower eyelids and is one of the most common eyelid diseases affecting individuals of all ages, including children. As a special eyelid disease, chalazion is closely related to the meibomian gland, and the meibomian gland is responsible for secreting meibum, which can reduce evaporation of the tear film, facilitate lubrication of the ocular surface, and provide a smooth optical surface. Although chalazion is a local lesion of the meibomian gland, previous studies have reported that patients with a history of chalazion, especially recurrent chalazion or multiple chalazion, were more likely to suffer from meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC). Therefore, focusing on the effects of chalazion on the function and morphology of local meibomian glands rather than only on treating chalazion is important, especially for patients with preexisting abnormal meibomian gland function and morphology. However, most prior studies on chalazion only compared the effects of different treatments. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to observe changes in meibomian gland function and morphology in the chalazion area using different methods before and after treatment.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^113j3Ppk]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Children often develop chalazia, which are lipogranulomatous lumps in the eyelids caused by obstruction of sebaceous glands. Multiple lumps can occur in an individual. In Bagheri et al 's study,11.8% of patients (aged 7–71 years) presented multiple chalazia. Although there were few reports about the incidence rate of multiple chalazia in children, pediatric ophthalmologists have encountered multiple chalazia more and more frequently in clinical settings.

Multiple chalazia are usually classified into three types according to the location of lesions — internal, external, and marginal. An internal chalazion is caused by inflammation of a tarsal meibomian gland that spreads into the conjunctiva. An external chalazion is caused by a plugged sebaceous gland that extends anteriorly to the surface of the palpebral skin and presents as a reddish subcutaneous nodule. A marginal chalazion arises from an inflamed gland at the eyelid margin.

Conservative treatments commonly include warm compress, topical antibiotics or steroids. There are some problems of applying conservative treatments in children. For example, young kids may not cooperate well with warm compress, it is difficult to apply topical eyedrops, and long-term use of steroids may increase the risk of glaucoma, cataract or infection. Incision and curettage (I&C) surgery will be needed if conservative treatments are ineffective or poorly performed. In addition, an early I&C should be considered when astigmatism or cosmetic problems occur in the patients with some types of chalazia.

Because children tend to present multiple chalazia and may not be able to cooperate well during examination, surgeons might miss some nodules in clinical examination, with subsequent increase in the recurrence rate or the possibility of requiring another general anesthesia for repeating I&C. Thus, for patients with multiple chalazia, analyzing the location of the three types of chalazia is important for the timing of surgery and for complete incision during I&C.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^1124V8hs]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chalazion may affect visual acuity. This study aimed to evaluate refractive status of chalazia and effect of different sites, sizes, and numbers of chalazion on astigmatism.

Methods

Three hundred ninety-eight patients aged 0.5–6 years were divided into the chalazion group (491 eyes) and the control group (305 eyes). Chalazia were classified according to the site, size, and number. Refractive status was analyzed through the comparison of incidence, type, mean value and vector analysis.

Results

The incidence, type, refractive mean and of astigmatism in the chalazion group were higher than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). For comparison of the incidence, the middle-upper eyelid (50%) was highest, followed by 41.77% in the medial-upper eyelid, both higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). In medium (54.55%) and large groups (54.76%) were higher than that in the control group (27.21%) (P < 0.05). In multiple chalazia, the astigmatism incidence for chalazion with two masses was highest (56%), much higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). However, this difference was not significant in chalazion with ≥ 3 masses (P > 0.05). For comparison of the refractive mean, the medial-upper eyelid, middle-upper eyelid and medial-lower eyelid were higher than the control group (P < 0.05) (P < 0.05). The 3–5 mm and > 5 mm group were higher than those in the control group and < 3 mm group(P < 0.05), and the > 5 mm group was larger than the 3–5 mm group，suggesting that the risk of astigmatism was higher when the size of masses > 5 mm. Astigmatism vector analysis can intuitively show the differences between groups, the results are the same as refractive astigmatism.

Conclusion

Chalazia in children can easily lead to astigmatism, especially AR and OBL. Chalazia in the middle-upper eyelid, size ≥ 3 mm, and multiple chalazia (especially two masses) are risk factors of astigmatism. Invasive treatment should be performed promptly if conservative treatment cannot avoid further harm to the visual acuity due to astigmatism.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^111zhZ9H]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A chalazion is an idiopathic chronic nonpurulent inflammation of the meibomian gland that progresses slowly with pressing pain. A deep chalazion is caused by inflammation of the meibomian gland, whereas a superficial chalazion is caused by inflammation of the Zeis gland. A chalazion causes swelling of the eyelids and ptosis and can develop in children and adults. Several risk factors have been reported, including local factors such as eyelid mite infection, meibomian gland dysfunction and blepharitis, and rosacea in children, as well as systemic factors such as vitamin A deficiency, low serum ferritin levels, and androgen imbalance in adolescents. Currently, chalazion masses have various treatment options. Conservative treatment includes hot compresses and/or combined with medications such as tobramycin or tobramycin dexamethasone eye drops and ophthalmic ointment. If conservative treatment fails, invasive treatment such as local steroid injections or surgical excision can be performed.

Some common eye diseases, such as congenital ptosis, eyelid hemangioma, allergic conjunctivitis and bad eye rubbing habit, can cause astigmatism in children. It has been confirmed that large chalazions in the middle- upper eyelid could cause corneal astigmatism. In an elderly man with farsightedness due to a chalazion mass in the middle-upper right eyelid, visual acuity returned to normal after the mass was removed. In another case, a patient undergoing laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis had an upper eyelid chalazion that resulted in the loss of visual acuity.

Astigmatism is a common type of refractive error, and its effect on visual acuity is determined based on both dioptric and axial aspects. Traditional methods compare astigmatism mainly according to the incidence and degree of astigmatism, ignoring the influence of astigmatism direction. Eydelman MB et al. introduced vector analysis to calculate eye astigmatism changes. For astigmatism screening in younger children, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS) recommends using the Spot binocular visual acuity screener that can screen children aged over 6 months and has a high specificity for children with refractive abnormalities (including astigmatism) and high-risk factors for amblyopia.

### Demography and clinical features of chalazion among patients seen at a multi-tier eye care network in India: an electronic medical records driven big data analysis report [^114vT6XJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the prevalence, demographics and clinical presentations of chalazion in patients presenting to a multi-tier ophthalmology network in India.

Materials and Methods

This was a cross-sectional observational multi-centric hospital-based study of 1,982,058 new patients presenting between 2010 and 2019. Patients with both symptoms and signs of chalazion were considered as subjects. The data were retrieved using an electronic medical record system.

Results

Overall, 11,270 (0.57%) new patients were diagnosed with chalazion. Of these, 1,085 (10%) patients had recurrent chalazia. The prevalence rates were 0.95% in children and 0.51% in adults. Males accounted for 51% of the cases, and 79% had unilateral affliction. The commonest age group affected was the third decade of life (31%). Of the 13,691 affected eyes with chalazion, 39% were located in the upper eyelid, 6% were lateral in position and 3% have multiple swellings at presentation. Conservative treatment was the preferred treatment modality in 85%. Incision and curettage were performed in 15% eyes and intralesional steroid in 0.55% eyes. Of the 15% patients that were advised surgery, 9% underwent the procedure with a conversion rate of 58%.

Conclusion

Only a miniscule percentage of patients seeking eye care in India are affected by chalazion. It is slightly more common in males and is usually unilateral and largely affects the upper eyelids. It is recurrent in a tenth of the cases. Conservative management is the preferred modality.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^113nXHEu]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple chalazia are common in children, and many are treated by surgery. However, the distribution of different types of multiple chalazia has not been studied. This research aimed to investigate the location and number of multiple chalazia in pediatrics who need surgical treatments.

Methods

Patients with multiple chalazia treated by incision and curettage surgery (I&C) in a tertiary children's hospital between June and December 2016 were reviewed. Demographic data, locations, and numbers of chalazia were recorded. Data were analyzed using generalized linear models of the counts and the occurrences of chalazia. Hypotheses were tested using likelihood ratio tests appropriate for each type of data.

Results

The study included 128 subjects, most of which were 1–3 years old. The majority of patients had bilateral chalazia (95.3%), and the proportions of patients with internal, external, and marginal chalazion differed dramatically (99.2%, 61.7%, and 2.3%, respectively). The number of internal and external chalazia did not vary significantly with gender, age, or residence of the patients. Internal chalazia were located more frequently in the upper lids (p < 0.001). External chalazia showed no preference of localization. The average number of internal chalazia in each eyelid did not relate to the presence of external chalazia.

Conclusions

Multiple chalazia are common among younger children in southeast China. The anatomical distribution varies depending on the type of chalazion. Multiple chalazia often occur bilaterally and internally. If doctors are more aware of the anatomical distribution of chalazia, this might result in a higher success rate of I&C.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^111jKNNo]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chalazion may affect visual acuity. This study aimed to evaluate refractive status of chalazia and effect of different sites, sizes, and numbers of chalazion on astigmatism.

Methods

Three hundred ninety-eight patients aged 0.5–6years were divided into the chalazion group (491 eyes) and the control group (305 eyes). Chalazia were classified according to the site, size, and number. Refractive status was analyzed through the comparison of incidence, type, mean value and vector analysis.

Results

The incidence, type, refractive mean and of astigmatism in the chalazion group were higher than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). For comparison of the incidence, the middle-upper eyelid (50%) was highest, followed by 41.77% in the medial-upper eyelid, both higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). In medium (54.55%) and large groups (54.76%) were higher than that in the control group (27.21%) (P < 0.05). In multiple chalazia, the astigmatism incidence for chalazion with two masses was highest (56%), much higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). However, this difference was not significant in chalazion with ≥ 3 masses (P > 0.05). For comparison of the refractive mean, the medial-upper eyelid, middle-upper eyelid and medial-lower eyelid were higher than the control group (P < 0.05) (P < 0.05). The 3–5mm and > 5mm group were higher than those in the control group and < 3mm group(P < 0.05), and the > 5mm group was larger than the 3–5mm group，suggesting that the risk of astigmatism was higher when the size of masses > 5mm. Astigmatism vector analysis can intuitively show the differences between groups, the results are the same as refractive astigmatism.

Conclusion

Chalazia in children can easily lead to astigmatism, especially AR and OBL. Chalazia in the middle-upper eyelid, size ≥ 3mm, and multiple chalazia (especially two masses) are risk factors of astigmatism. Invasive treatment should be performed promptly if conservative treatment cannot avoid further harm to the visual acuity due to astigmatism.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^11527rKe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The authors reviewed LLLT treatment of chalazia since 2017 in one practice in patients ranging in age from 4 to 93 years old. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first series of patients reported in the literature.

As noted earlier, alternative treatment options range from warm compresses to surgical excision. A randomized multicenter clinical trial of 105 patients (141 cases), found 18% (with an additional 30% lost to follow-up presumably due to chalazia resolving) had complete resolution after warm compresses treatment with or without the addition of topical antibiotic or antibiotic steroid combination; despite similar outcomes, patients had higher satisfaction if they were given prescription medication. Of the cases that completely resolved, 86% resolved within 6 months; chalazia that resolved fully took less time than those which partially resolved (1.5 vs 2.2 months). If chalazia were present for greater than 2 months, then they were more likely to benefit from the initial procedure being more invasive. Jackson et al noted that treatment success was 29% with warm compresses and chloramphenicol ointment within 3 months versus 72% after I&C. Steroid injections offer advantages over surgical excision since they can be used for multiple lesions and for chalazia close to the punctum to avoid injury and potential epiphora as well as when the patient is less cooperative such as in a pediatric population. Steroid injections using triamcinolone acetonide are usually administered directly to the lesion. Intralesional steroid injection reduced chalazia size by more than 80% in 60% of patients after one injection and 20% of patients after two injections over an average time of 2.5 weeks with no difference between new and recurrent cases; if significant improvement was not noted after two injections then surgical intervention appears more suitable.

### Non-surgical interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^112A1PJV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be either internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves without treatment; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, an acute internal hordeolum can become chronic, or can develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness, and when possible, the safety, of non-surgical treatments for acute internal hordeola compared with observation or placebo.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register (2016; Issue 12)), MEDLINE Ovid, MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, MEDLINE Ovid In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE(R) Ovid Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1947 to December 2016), PubMed (1948 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS (January 1982 to December 2016)), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT; www.controlled-trials.com (last searched 26 July 2012)), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of participants diagnosed with an acute internal hordeolum. Studies of participants with external hordeola (styes), chronic hordeola, or chalazia were excluded. Non-surgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared with observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

No trials were identified for this review. Most of the references identified through our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeola reported recommendations for treatment, were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs, and were published more than 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for the treatment of an internal hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful to determine which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeola.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^111Q5Lwh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The most common benign granulomatous inflammatory lid masses of the eye are chalazia. The main etiology behind the formation of a chalazion is inflammation of the meibomian gland and inspissation of the meibum in the gland. Chalazia are generally self-limiting but may become chronic and recur, with patients complaining of a non-tender lid mass that has slowly enlarged over weeks or months. Chalazia can take several months to resolve on their own, with an older study noting that 25% may resolve on their own over an average period of 6 months. However, chalazia are generally treated when noted, because they may grow big enough to impair vision or become infected, resulting in possible cellulitis.

The most common non-surgical and surgical treatment options for chalazia, from least invasive to most invasive, are warm compresses, topical medications (i.e. antibiotic, corticosteroid or antibiotic corticosteroid combinations), systemic medications (i.e. oral antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline), steroid injection or surgical incision and curettage (I&C). Warm compresses or therapeutic masks offer the lowest complication rate but also the least success; this may be due to the high dependence of the procedure being performed by the patient at home in a non-controlled setting. The most invasive treatment is the I&C surgical procedure. It has been demonstrated to be more effective than steroid injection alone after one treatment. It is generally effective but can result in lid notching if the lid margin is involved, or eyelid perforation with resultant scarring and hemorrhaging. Globe perforation is also possible with both I&C and steroid injection. Given that current treatments either have low success or carry some risk of complications, new non-surgical treatment approaches are of interest.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^11243qMK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 26 eyes of 22 patients with relevant history and treatment were identified in the clinical records. Of these, all had prior pharmaceutical treatment; previous I&C had been performed on one patient. Prior treatments typically involved some combination of antibiotics, an antibiotic/steroid combination and/or oral doxycycline. Table 1 summarizes the relevant pre-treatment and post-treatment data for each patient.

Table 1
List of patients treated

As can be seen, 46% of eyes (12/26) required only one 15 min LLT treatment with the prescribed pharmaceutical regimen to resolve the chalazion; resolution was noted from 3 days to one-month post-treatment. Ten patients (14 eyes) received a second treatment within two months of the first. In all but two of these patients (two eyes) the chalazion resolved. The overall success rate with LLLT treatment was therefore 92% (24/26). There was no observable pattern in terms of who might need a second treatment, though the two youngest patients were both treated twice; neither of these patients received systemic treatment or surgical intervention.

Only two eyes of the 26 (8%) required incision and curettage after LLLT treatment. One eye of one patient received an intralesional corticosteroid at the time of I&C.

Figure 1A shows a young patient with a significant chalazion on the upper left lid, and some notable swelling on the other lids. She had failed multiple non-surgical options, including warm compresses, topical antibiotic/steroid drops and topical antibiotic ointments. Figure 1B shows the LLLT treatment mask being applied to the face of this patient, being held on her mother's lap. Figure 1C shows the results one week after LLLT treatment; significant improvement is evident.

In another example, Figure 2A shows an adult patient with a chalazion on the lower left lid. As with the previous patient, she had been treated in the past with warm compresses, topical antibiotic/steroid drops, topical antibiotic ointments. She had also received oral doxycycline prior to the LLLT treatment without resolution. Figure 2B shows the same patient two weeks after her LLLT treatment.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^1118NkuD]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study was the first to describe the detailed anatomical distribution of multiple chalazia in Chinese children. The strength of the study lies in a large sample size focusing on chalazion distribution in young pediatrics whose eyes are difficult to be examined, and our results highlight the importance of examining every eyelid even if it seems to be normal. However, there are some limitations: (1) All the patients in our study came from one hospital in southeast China, and they all underwent I&C operations. Thus, the patients who did not receive surgery under general anesthesia were not included; (2) The subjects included in the present study were all preschoolers because cooperative old children might receive operations in the outpatient clinic; (3) Patients with two or more external chalazia on one lid were quite rare in our study, possibly because parents would opt for early treatment due to cosmesis as soon as they developed external lesions. For the external chalazion, the parents have two extreme attitudes: some people are eager for surgery because the growing external chalazion may cause more significant scar on the lid, while the others believe that spontaneous resolution with conservative management may leave smaller scar than surgical excision; (4) We did not assess the localization of chalazion in the eyelid, such as medial, central or lateral, because the classification is complex if the nodules are large or are adjacent to each other. However, this information is valuable because medial chalazion might lead to canaliculitis, which requires more complicated medical and surgical treatments or even destroys the structure of puncta or lacrimal canaliculi; (5) We did not collect the follow-up results, which would give us recurrence information. In the future, a multicentered study with a longer observation time and better definition of localization would help us learn more about the distribution of multiple chalazia.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^116RQ6dN]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, chalazion as a form of chronic granulomatous inflammation causes meibomian gland loss, and the range of meibomian gland loss after chalazion resolution is not related to the treatment method but to the range of the chalazion itself. Given that surgery does not aggravate meibomian gland loss but rather facilitates faster complete chalazion resolution, we suggest that ophthalmologists, particularly those in subspecialty clinics, can perform surgery earlier. At the same time, complete chalazion resolution should not be the ultimate goal of treatment as improving meibomian gland function in the non-chalazion area is more important.

### Demography and clinical features of chalazion among patients seen at a multi-tier eye care network in India: an electronic medical records driven big data analysis report [^1131UCF6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

This is a cross-sectional hospital-based observational study. Patients newly diagnosed with chalazion presenting between August 2010 and December 2019 to our eye care network located in 200 different geographical locations spread across four states of India were included. The patient or their parents or guardians filled a standard consent form for electronic data privacy at the time of registration. None of the identifiable parameters of the patient were used for analysis of the data. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (Ethics approval no. LEC-BHR-R-05–20–442). Each patient underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination and the clinical data was entered into a browser-based electronic medical records system (eyeSmart EMR).

Data Retrieval and Processing

The data of 1,982,058 patients were retrieved from the electronic medical record database and segregated into a single excel sheet based on the departments. The 11,270 eligible chalazion patients in this group were segregated for analysis. A total of 13,691 eyes of 11,270 patients were included for the study. The columns with data on demographics, clinical presentation and ocular diagnosis were exported for analysis. The excel sheet with the required data was then used for analysis using the appropriate statistical software. The geographic categorization of the districts of India was performed in accordance to the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) which defines "rural" as an area with a population density of up to 400 per square kilometer. The Constitution (seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992 defines a metropolitan area in India as an area having a population of one million or more, comprised in one or more districts and consisting of two or more municipalities or panchayats or other contiguous areas, specified by the Governor by public notification to be a metropolitan area. The remaining districts were classified as urban. The general principle of treatment followed was to offer conservative treatment if the chalazion was 10 mm or less in size, marginal in location, in close association with the punctum or associated with secondary infection. However, if a patient was keen on incision and curettage in the first sitting itself, that was the treatment provided. Conservative treatment consisted of warm compress, tetracycline eye ointment, and eyelid massage.

### Effects of chalazia on corneal astigmatism: large-sized chalazia in middle upper eyelids compress the cornea and induce the corneal astigmatism [^113TFco2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A chalazion is a meibomian gland lipogranuloma which accompanies swelling on the eyelid and eyelid tenderness. It is a common eyelid disease that causes eye morbidity due to inflammation and cosmetic disfigurement. A variety of factors are believed to be associated with the development of chalazia including meibomian gland dysfunction, chronic blepharitis, seborrheic dermatitis, gastritis, and smoking. Chalazia treatment includes medical treatments, such as warm compression and topical antibiotic eye drops or ointment, and surgical incision and curettage, with or without triamcinolone intralesional injection.

Corneal topographic changes are important factors in corneal refractive surgery, intraocular lens power calculations for cataract surgery, and visual acuity assessments. In addition, amblyopia may develop in children with corneal astigmatism. It has been reported that the pressure of an upper lid chalazion induces hyperopia and astigmatism.7 Chalazia can increase higher-order aberrations (HOAs), as measured by the Hartmann–Shack aberrometer; these can affect the preoperative evaluation and refractive surgery outcomes, especially wavefront-guided approaches. In addition, decreased vision due to a chalazion of the upper eyelid has been documented in a patient following laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Furthermore, corneal aberration has been reported to contribute to the visual function. The changes in corneal astigmatism according to chalazion size and location is necessary for better outcome of ocular surgery.

However, the effects of chalazia on corneal astigmatism have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we investigated changes in corneal astigmatism according to chalazion size and location.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^113SZbpz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

According to different sites of groups, by the analysis of incidence, type, mean and vector of astigmatism, suggesting that the location of chalazion affects the occurrence of astigmatism, and the middle and inner side of upper eyelid are high-risk factors. Some studies analyzed the changes in corneal topography before and after chalazion removal and concluded that a chalazion increases irregularities in the corneal surface, increasing higher-order abnormalities and thus causing corneal astigmatism. Previous studies have confirmed that a chalazion in the middle-upper eyelid can cause corneal astigmatism; however, the effect of chalazion masses at other sites on astigmatism has not been explored. In the present study, we found that chalazion masses at all sites and in the middle-upper eyelid can also lead to astigmatism. We hypothesized that this is related to mass compression that alters corneal curvature and scleral tension.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^11238Lfh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or can develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nonsurgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared with observation or placebo.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of participants diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum. Studies of participants with external hordeolum (stye), chronic hordeolum, or chalazion were excluded. Nonsurgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared with observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

No trials were identified for inclusion in this review. Most of the references identified from our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeolum reported mostly recommendations for treatment or were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs and were published more than 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for the treatment of hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful in determining which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeolum.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^112wgE6N]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Most studies on the relationship between chalazion and astigmatism have focused on corneal astigmatism rather than total astigmatism. However, these studies have reported single-site masses, mainly larger masses in the middle-upper eyelid, and lack comprehensive studies of all site. Moreover, the aforementioned studies have included mainly older children (> 7 years old) or adults with no reports on preschool children (except for case reports), and the sample size is small. However, children aged 1–6 years old are more likely to develop chalazion, especially those between 2 and 5 years old. Nevertheless, no large-sample studies have examined the effects of chalazion masses on the incidence rate and type of astigmatism in children. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the features of astigmatism in a large sample of children aged 0–6 years with chalazion masses. By the comparison of incidence, type, mean value and vector analysis of astigmatism to investigate the effect of the site, size, and the number of chalazion masses in astigmatism and to clarify the risk factors of chalazion-induced astigmatism.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^11422GcR]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This parameterization of the model implies that β₁,j is the logarithm of the mean number of internal chalazia in the jᵗʰ eyelid of patients with external chalazia. The parameter β₀,j corresponds to the same quantity, but for eyelids without an external chalazion. We tested the null hypothesis that β₀,j = β₁,j to assess whether numbers of internal chalazia depended on the presence or absence of external chalazia.

All the statistics were reported as two-tailed probabilities, with p < 0.05 being regarded as significant.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^113fnysa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

This retrospective chart review was approved by an institutional review board (Salus IRB, Austin, TX), which also granted a waiver of informed consent for use of patients' de-identified clinical data. As this was a retrospective review, no clinical registration (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov) was required. Written informed consent to use the photos in this manuscript was obtained from the guardian (Figure 1) and patient (Figure 2). The chart review included data from one physician at one site. Patient demographics, prior history related to chalazia and treatment specifics were extracted from the file, along with the results of the treatment.

Figure 2
An adult patient before LLLT treatment (A), and 2 weeks after treatment (B). Images used with permission.

All patients were referred for treatment after several unsuccessful attempts at other pharmaceutical treatments, either topical or oral. One patient in the series had had surgical intervention prior to presentation, a standard I&C, with no long-term resolution. Each patient received Low Level Light Therapy (LLLT) for 15 mins delivered via the Epi-C Treatment mask at one sitting. After the LLLT treatment patients received an additional round of antibiotic/steroid eye drops for two weeks. All adult patients also received Doxycycline 100 mg by mouth twice per day; patients under the age of thirteen did not receive oral therapy. If there was no apparent change in the chalazion at the 24–48 hr visit, a second 15 min treatment was considered. Second treatments were performed from 24 hrs to 2 months after the initial treatment. All patients were followed to resolution, defined as no visible sign of the chalazion post-treatment.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^114NXMkk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Plain language summary

A chalazion (plural chalazia) is an eyelid cyst that gives the eyelid a swollen appearance. Chalazia are the result of a plugged meibomian gland, the glands in your eyelids that produce meibum, the oil necessary for good tears. Contents of the gland solidify and restrict the normal flow of meibum, resulting in swelling.

Often warm compresses or drugs are used to treat chalazia. Resolution may take weeks or months. Some individuals have chalazia that recur often, or never resolve, even with such treatment. At that point a minor surgery may be required, cutting the eyelid open to remove the hardened material in the gland.

A new light-based treatment which has recently been shown to be beneficial for dry eye related to meibomian gland problems was tested in the current study, to see if it could help patients with chalazia. The treatment involved using low level red light applied to the upper face (the cheek and over the closed lids). Treatment was administered to patients who had chalazia that did not respond to warm compresses and/or drug therapy or surgery.

In 9 of the 19 patients treated, a single 15 min session was enough to promote resolution of the chalazion. A second treatment was applied to 10 patients, 8 of whom had resolution of their chalazia. Only two cases required surgical intervention. It may be concluded that low level light therapy can promote resolution of chalazia, significantly reducing the percentage of eyes requiring surgery.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^113DoK2c]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

6 SYSTEMIC RETINOID EFFECTS ON THE EYE

To date, there is limited literature about the ophthalmologic effects of retinoids in patients with ichthyosis to provide evidence‐based surveillance and management guidelines. Both topical and systemic retinoids have been shown to reduce the severity of ectropion in children and adults. 9, 17, 90 However, the potential side effects of systemic retinoids on eye health are compounded by any ocular manifestations of the underlying ichthyosis. The acute and long‐term effects of retinoid use on ocular health in children and adolescents are unknown. Most of the current evidence is based on retrospective reviews of short‐term, episodic systemic isotretinoin use in adolescents and young adults with acne vulgaris.

Approximately 13.8% of adolescents on isotretinoin for acne experience ocular side effects. 62, 91, 92 The most common complaints include pruritus, photophobia, eye pain, burning, and gritty feeling or visual disturbance that may occur within days up to a few months following initiation of isotretinoin. These symptoms are dose dependent and can be attributed to ocular surface diseases, as well as refractive changes and retinal dysfunction. 93 Ocular surface diseases including conjunctivitis, hordeolum, chalazion, blepharitis, and dry eyes are likely due to decreased secretion from Meibomian glands that results in poor tear‐film quality. 91, 94, 95, 96 Refractive changes are likely secondary to corneal steepening and edema that cause myopic shift. 97, 98 Corneal opacity resulting from systemic therapy is rare, but can be permanent. 99, 100 Ocular toxicity from acitretin use in psoriasis was not detected after one month of treatment. 101 Nonetheless, the lowest daily retinoid dose able to manage cutaneous symptoms is recommended to minimize risks of ocular toxicity.

### Management and outcomes of proteasome inhibitor associated chalazia and blepharitis: a case series [^111My2fk]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Treatment algorithm. A proposed management sequence for patients with plasma cell disorders and proteasome inhibitor-associated eyelid complications

Ocular therapy choice is up to the ophthalmologist's discretion, but we propose using hot compresses in combination with at least 1 topical antibiotic and/or steroid drop, and possible oral antibiotics as well. A prospective, randomized study conducted by the senior author of this manuscript found that hot compresses alone or in combination with tobramycin or tobramycin/dexamethasone drops and ointment are all effective first-line treatment options for conventional chalazia. In our study, no specific combination of conservative therapies could be evaluated as more effective in this population due to small sample size. If eyelid complications persist after a 1.5–2 month trial of ocular therapy alone, proceed to bortezomib omission plus continuation of ocular therapy, and consider possible switch to an alternate proteasome inhibitor (carfilzomib or ixazomib) depending on the patient's oncologic status. If eyelid signs persist after bortezomib omission, consider specific addition of oral doxycycline, which has been shown to resolve persistent blepharitis after bortezomib cessation in prior studies. If eyelid complications resolve after bortezomib omission, bortezomib may be rechallenged once, based on the patient's oncologic status and willingness depending on prior severity of eyelid complications. However, if eyelid complications recur upon bortezomib rechallenge, the drug should be discontinued again.

Limitations of our study include small sample size and retrospective design. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine the true incidence and prevalence of proteasome inhibitor-associated eyelid complications, as well as the most effective ocular treatments. More data is needed regarding specific time periods when patients can be rechallenged with bortezomib, or if they may be rechallenged at all. In our study, only one patient underwent bortezomib rechallenge, making interpretation of this clinical situation more challenging. Our study could have been strengthened by using a standardized method to grade severity of each chalazion and blepharitis episode in order to see how severity affected management and outcomes. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study, no specific severity grading systems were employed.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^112wkCsr]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical managements for chalazion

Patients with chalazion were recommended to have warm compresses on lids four times a day. Tobramycin-dexamethasone (Tobradex; Santen, Japan) or fluorometholone 5 mg/mL (Flumetholone; Santen, Japan) eye drops were sometimes given with close monitoring of intraocular pressure. If the nodules were painful or accompanied by purulent discharge, levofloxacin eye drops 5 mg/mL (Cravit; Santen, Japan) four times a day would be given. If the eyelid was highly inflamed, the nodules ruptured, patients had fever, or a routine blood test before surgery showed elevated white blood cell counts, oral azithromycin 10 mg/kg (Zithromax; Pfizer, USA) once a day for 3 days would be added. For lesions unresponsive to conservative treatments, lasting for more than 2 months, or showing potential visual or cosmetic risks, I&C surgeries under general anesthesia were performed. The specimens were submitted for histopathology examinations to confirm the diagnosis.

Data collection

To allow accurate counting of the lesions, we included only patients that underwent I&C under general anesthesia which allowed the surgeons to evert all eyelids to count the number of chalazia. Some lesions were adjacent to each other, integrated or overlapped. We counted adjacent or overlapped lesions separately and counted integrated lesions as one. We collected the following information for analysis: age, gender, place of residence (city vs country), type of chalazion, number and location of lesions, duration of presence of chalazion, and medical/ophthalmic history.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using R software V.4.0.2 (Vienna, Austria.). We analyzed the counts of chalazia using two classes of statistical models, one for the total number of chalazia observed at all locations and another for the number of chalazia observed at each location. The latter observations are needed to estimate the anatomical distribution of chalazia. The counts of internal and external chalazia were analyzed separately.

To be more specific, we assumed that the total number N of chalazia at all eyelid locations had either a Poisson distribution or a negative binomial distribution, whose mean µ was allowed to differ among patients of different gender, age category, or residence. That is, we assumed either

where log(µ) = β' ' X specifies the mean as a function of observed covariates X and their effects β, or

Purpose

To report on the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of a large cohort of pediatric patients who presented with severe blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC).

Design

Retrospective consecutive cohort study.

Subjects

Patients aged under 18 years with BKC presented to the Cornea Service at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, between 2006 and 2021.

Methods

Children with severe BKC, defined as BKC with inflammation, new vessel formation, scarring, thinning and lipid deposits affecting the peripheral and/or central cornea, and a follow-up of at least six months were included. Basic demographics, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error, disease laterality, type and duration of antibiotic therapy, flare-up rate and extent of corneal involvement were analyzed.

Main Outcome Measures

BCVA, refraction, extent of corneal involvement, procedures, flare-up of BKC, and time to flare-up rate after cessation of systemic antibiotics treatment.

Results

Out of 2,542 patients with blepharitis, 197 patients (315 eyes) were identified with severe BKC. The mean age at the first presentation was 7.6 years, with a 2:1 female predominance. At the presentation, 65% had a history of chalazion, and 28% had BCVA worse than 0.3 logMAR, which improved to 17% at final follow-up (p = 0.007). The most striking corneal pathologies affecting the peripheral and central cornea were scarring (83%) and new vessel formation (49%). One hundred forty-two patients (72%) required systemic antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin or doxycycline) of whom 23% experienced flare-ups requiring an escalation in treatment with topical steroids and/or systemic antibiotics, and 75% of these occurred within the first year of treatment cessation. Ninety-one percent of patients achieved complete response, defined as no disease activity and no use of topical steroids or systemic antibiotic treatment. Fifteen patients required surgical intervention.

Conclusion

Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is a serious disease in children, potentially causing irreversible ocular morbidity and vision loss. Central scarring and astigmatism can affect vision in a significant proportion of children. Therefore, early identification and treatment are necessary to reduce disease morbidity. Close follow-up is crucial as one in four patients may experience a flare-up, especially within the first year of treatment cessation. Most patients with severe BKC require both topical steroids and systemic antibiotics to control disease activity.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^112Hbiiy]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The recommended treatments for BKC is long term eyelid hygiene (e.g. warm compresses, meibomian gland, eyelid scrubs) in combination with antibiotic and steroids as needed. Despite this consensus, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials in pediatric BKC.3 Most of the pediatric studies showed improvement in the majority of patients with various treatments, but a high recurrence rate ranging from 40 to 60%. Eyelid hygiene was recommended for all patients in our study, but compliance is difficult to ascertain. However, the majority of patients also received erythromycin ointment and/or topical steroids, with a smaller percentage placed on oral antibiotics. Importantly, there was no difference between Hispanic and non-Hispanic children in the percentage recommended/prescribed erythromycin ointment, topical steroids, or oral antibiotics, yet the Hispanic children had worse visual outcomes. This may be due to worse initial BCVA in the Hispanic children or better compliance to treatments in the non-Hispanic children.

Though this is one of the largest US-based studies focused on BKC epidemiology with clinical data, it is limited by the relatively small cohort (n = 95) and no control group. In addition, due to its retrospective nature, there are various lengths of follow-up and differences in charting between multiple ophthalmologists within the practice. The exam findings reported in this study are limited to a binary nature, when elements such as corneal scarring occur on a spectrum regarding the effect on vision and eye health. Other studies have graded the severity of the BKC (mild, moderate, and severe); however these grading systems were arbitrary and not dictated by the consensus statement. In addition, as this was a chart review, grading the severity was challenging and thus not included. Several studied factors, including diagnoses of chalazion, PEE/SPK, presence of stromal scarring, and use of traditionally more aggressive treatments were deemed not significant, though greater disparities could be seen with a higher-powered investigation given the significant impact seen on BCVA seen in the Hispanic population compared to the non-Hispanic population. Further, our study did not include the socioeconomoic status, insurance type, or other markers for social determinants of health which could certainly affect access to care and compliance with treatments and ultimately outcomes.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^11784vNq]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, previous studies relevant to the location of chalazia are limited or dated. In Herman et al 's study (published in 1951), 1693 patients from children to elderly showed a prevalence of chalazia in the lower lids, especially for the right eye. In Mustafa and Oriafage's study, they reviewed 26 pediatric patients aged 3–16 years old with no more than two chalazia and reported that lesions were usually located in the upper lids. Ben et al reported a high occurrence of chalazion in the right upper lid (RUL) in adult patients who had planned to receive triamcinolone injection, but whether the chalazion was single or multiple was not mentioned. In Knezevic et al 's study, the right lower lid (RLL) was the most commonly affected site in a group of patients above 16 years old who received botulinum toxin injection for chalazion treatment; however, cases with infected nodules or small lesions less than 2 mm were excluded. Wu et al reported a higher frequency of chalazia in the left upper lid (LUL) in adult patients but excluded those with multiple chalazia in a single lid. Overall, few literature have targeted on pediatrics with multiple chalazia.

The aim of our paper was to use an optimized statistical scheme to investigate the distribution and relationship of three types of chalazia in pediatrics with multiple chalazia that required I&C surgery based on a tertiary children's hospital in southeast China.

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^115keSsj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is a common, painful, inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared to observation or placebo.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2010), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 June 2010.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of patients diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum. Studies of patients with external hordeolum (stye), chronic hordeolum or chalazion were excluded. Non-surgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared to observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by the electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

There were no trials identified for inclusion in this review. The majority of the references identified from our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeolum reported mostly recommendations for treatment or were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs and were published over 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for the treatment of hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful in determining which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeolum.

### Photorefraction screening plus atropine treatment for myopia is cost-effective: a proof-of-concept Markov analysis [^11343rcv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

For optimal results, long-term treatment compliance and adherence is crucial. Our model assumed full compliance to treatment which is unlikely to be true in the real-world setting. Atropine 0.01% has been shown to have fewer adverse effects (photophobia, poor near vision acuity, allergies, headache, chalazion, systemic effects) while being as effective as higher doses for slowing the progression of myopia. For treatment duration between 12 and 60 months, a meta-analysis comparing atropine 0.01% eye drops with the control found that the odds ratio of adverse events was 0.26 (95% CI 0.11, 0.61). One study with five-year follow-up reported that only 2% of subjects reported side effects (photophobia, reading difficulty, mydriasis and headaches) that required treatment cessation. With atropine 0.01% having less side effects, compliance has been found to be high. The ATOM2 RCT defined compliance as > 75% expected use and found that 98.8% of those in the atropine 0.01% were compliant within the two-year period. Using the same definition, the LAMP Phase 3 study reported that 84.7% of those in the atropine 0.01% group were compliant within the three-year period. Another study in European children found that 78% of children adhered to high-dose atropine for the one-year of treatment, with 90% of the children adhering to treatment more than 6 times a week.

Our model assumed that those considered treatment responders have a reduced lifetime risk of progression to high myopia and pathological myopia. It will be important to follow the results of ongoing studies to understand the duration of effect of low-dose atropine treatment and revise the model accordingly. Our results suggest that a real-world cost-effectiveness trial is warranted given the long delay while awaiting life-long follow-up data.

Screening at age 11 is convenient in the New Zealand context because there is already a school-based vision check at this age. The prevalence of myopia in this age group was estimated to be approximately 10% in the model. Children developing myopia after this one-off screening point will not be detected by screening. The model did not include atropine treatment for children developing myopia later than age 11. However, incident (non-screen-detected) myopia at older ages could still be treated similarly.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^114M8tmS]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we demonstrated that multiple chalazia that need surgical treatment were prevalent in Chinese young children. The mean number of lesions per person was 8.3. Bilateral chalazia and internal chalazion were most common, external chalazion occurred in more than half of the patients, and marginal chalazion was relatively rare. In addition, the abundance of internal chalazia in upper lids was higher than that in lower lids, whereas the abundance of external chalazia was similar in each eyelid.

Nemet et al demonstrated a high incidence of chalazion in people from urban areas and in females aged from 10 to 29 years. Chen et al found that the proportion of multiple chalazia was significantly higher in younger children (6 months to 6 years of age) compared with older children (7–12 years of age). Wagner mentioned that children with multiple and bilateral chalazia were often between 3 and 5 years old. In our study, multiple chalazia were more common in children aged 1–3 years than in those aged 3–7 years; however, the number of multiple chalazia did not differ by gender, age category or residence groups. The reason that multiple chalazia were more prevalent in younger children than in older children may be due to decreased serum vitamin A in the younger group, and the consequent keratinization of the ducts of the meibomian glands.

### Sebaceous carcinoma presenting as chronic chalazion [^111k2a6R]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We present a case of sebaceous carcinoma presenting as treatment-resistant chalazion. Diagnosis was made by excisional biopsy after failed treatment with warm compresses, eyelid hygiene and erythromycin ointment. Conjunctival map biopsies excluded local spread. MRI of the orbits and whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated no metastatic disease. Definitive treatment was accomplished by wide local excision with no recurrence at 1-year follow-up. Sebaceous carcinoma often masquerades as benign diagnoses, such as blepharitis and chalazion, yet it is an aggressive cancer with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Thus, a high level of suspicion is required to avoid vision loss and death by metastatic disease. There are currently no targeted therapies for advanced disease, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis. Furthermore, recognition of the association of sebaceous carcinoma with Muir-Torre Syndrome is important to guide future cancer screening and management.

### Randomized prospective evaluation of microblepharoexfoliation blephEx as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of chalazia [^114SzV2m]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chalazia are benign eyelid lesions caused by the obstruction and inflammatory reaction of the meibomian glands. Demodex mites are one potential cause of chalazia leading to mechanical obstruction of the meibomian gland. In this prospective randomized study, we examine a novel approach to treating chalazia with the use of microblepharoexfoliation (MBE), an in-office lid hygiene technique that exfoliates the eyelid margins.

Methods

Fifty patients with clinical evidence of acute chalazion were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned to a MBE plus lid hygiene group (23 patients, mean age 66.6 ± 16.6 years) or a lid hygiene alone group (27 patients, mean age 62.1 ± 14.4). The MBE plus lid hygiene group received MBE treatment and were evaluated 1 month after the baseline visit. The main outcome measured was the resolution of the chalazion at the 1-month follow-up visit.

Results

The lid hygiene plus MBE treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant resolution of the chalazion compared with the lid hygiene group alone (P = 0.007; chi-square test). Among the MBE plus hygiene group, 87% of the patients had resolution of their chalazion as opposed to the lid hygiene alone group, which had 44% resolution.

Conclusions

This is the first prospective, randomized clinical trial that demonstrated efficacy of MBE as a noninvasive adjunctive treatment method for chalazion resolution.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^11278MKE]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, among the children who needed I&C, multiple chalazia were more common in patients aged 1–3 years. Different types of chalazion presented different distributional characteristics. Multiple chalazia often occurred bilaterally and internally. Internal lesions were more abundant in the upper eyelids. There was no correlation between the distributions of internal and external chalazia. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the anatomical distribution of multiple chalazia in young pediatrics that need I&C. We would like to reinforce the importance of checking every eyelid, especially the upper lids in a young patient with chalazion, because the nodules tend to grow and multiply internally, therefore requiring careful examination in this age group.

### Randomized prospective evaluation of microblepharoexfoliation blephEx as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of chalazia [^116PSkdc]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

There was a total of 50 patients with confirmed chalazion who were enrolled in this study: 23 randomized to the MBE plus lid hygiene treatment group and 27 were randomized to the lid hygiene alone group. There were 2 patients who were lost to follow-up in the lid hygiene group. Of the 50 patients, 32 patients (64%) experienced resolution of their chalazion and 16 patients (32%) did not have resolution; the MBE plus lid hygiene group demonstrated a statistically significant resolution of chalazion compared with the lid hygiene alone group (P = 0.007; χ² test). In the lid hygiene alone group, 44% (12) of patients' chalazion resolved and 48% (13) of patients' chalazion did not. In the MBE plus lid hygiene group, 87% (20) of patients had their chalazion resolve, whereas 13% (3) did not have their chalazion resolve. The demographic characteristics and baseline test results of both treatment arms were relatively evenly matched with no significant differences, as given in Table 2. No patient in either group developed new chalazia during this month-long observation period.

### The association of demodex infestation with pediatric chalazia [^115XD247]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Demodex infestation and follow-up

Considering the biological pathogenicity and the contagiousness of Demodex, the children with demodicosis were recommended for treatment in both eyes. The comprehensive treatment for demodicosis was initiated 10 days after chalazia removal surgery. A warm compress (warm towel or hot compress eyeshade, 40–45 °C, 10–15 min) was applied first, followed by using a terpinen-4-ol wipe to scrub the lash roots from one end to the other in one stroke, which was repeated for at least 30 s. Metronidazole gel was manually applied on the lash roots with the eyes closed. This procedure was repeated twice daily. Routine assessment was performed monthly, with initiation of a second course of treatment if Demodex mites persisted.

Statistical analyses

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). Continuous data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation and discrete data are expressed as rates (%). Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to analyze the correlation strength between relevant factors and Demodex infestation. The Pearson chi-square test was used for comparative and correlative analyses between subgroups. The Fisher's exact test was used for data with low prediction frequency to avoid statistical bias. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### The association of demodex infestation with pediatric chalazia [^117JfdYM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, ocular discomfort was often difficult to interpret due to difficulty for children to describe the sensation, causing complaints to be overlooked. In order to prevent development of demodicosis, it is important for children and their parents to maintain good ocular hygiene, including applying warm compresses and contact-isolation of demodicosis to control ocular Demodex infection.

This study had several associated limitations. Although adult or larvae Demodex were observed, Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis were not recorded separately for further study of which species was more prevalent in pediatric demodicosis with chalazia. Sampling the eyelash in the correct places is essential for microscopic Demodex detection, and there may be a non-invasive alternative, such as in vivo confocal microscopy, to sample eyelashes for Demodex detection, which could potentially avoid the failure to remove Demodex completely during epilation. This would also be more conducive to the review of pediatric patients. Since metronidazole gel has been reported to be both effective and safe in the treatment of demodicosis, comparing the effectiveness of different anti-mite treatments may be beneficial.

The majority of chalazia patients, especially those with recurrent and multiple chalazia, suffered more from demodicosis than healthy children. Demodicosis should be considered as a risk factor of chalazia. In children with chalazia, Demodex examination and comprehensive treatment of Demodex mites should be applied to potentially prevent recurrence.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^114t4phv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

General information

A total of 796 eyes of 398 children (male, n = 167; female, n = 231) were included in the study. The youngest and oldest participants were 6 months and 71 months, respectively (mean age, 2.86 ± 1.301 years). Of the total eyes, 491 had a chalazion, while 305 had no chalazion. There were 345 eyes (70.26%) with single chalazion and 146 eyes (29.74%) with multiple chalazion masses. For solitary chalazion, 1) according to site of the chalazion, differences in the distribution were noted in the lateral-upper (n = 64), middle-upper (n = 98), medial-upper (n = 79), lateral-lower (n = 38), middle-lower (n = 41), and medial-lower (n = 25) eyelids. More chalazion masses were observed in the upper eyelid than in the lower eyelid and in the middle eyelid than in the lateral and medial eyelids. Meanwhile, the highest number of chalazion masses was in the middle-upper eyelid. 2) according to size of the chalazion, small group (n = 159), medium group (n = 143) and large group (n = 43). In multiple chalazia: 1) according to site of the chalazion, the upper eyelid (n = 59), the lower eyelid (n = 53), and both eyelids (n = 112), 2) according to number of the chalazion, two masses (n = 100), more than three masses (n = 46) (Table 1).

### The usefulness of diathermy thermocoagulation in chalazion surgery [^111HyaCW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study showed our devised surgical technique of thermocoagulation of chalazion contents using diathermy. Incomplete removal of chalazion contents causes recurrence, although surgical excision of a chalazion is helpful for early improvement. Our surgical technique using thermocoagulation of chalazion contents facilitates grasping chalazion contents with forceps and detaching them from the tarsus and surrounding tissues. This enables secure and complete chalazion content excision. Resolution of a chalazion in all the cases even 1 week postoperatively without recurrence or complications during the follow-up period showed the usefulness of our technique.

Our technique has other significant benefits. Easy grasp and dissection of chalazion contents may be advantageous, especially for inexperienced surgeons and pediatric patients with difficulty enduring surgery for a long time under local anesthesia. Additionally, simultaneous hemostasis using diathermy lowers the risk of bleeding and leads to early eyelid edema resolution.

This study did not compare the results of chalazion surgery with or without diathermy. In a previous study, a cautery was applied to the edges of the conjunctiva, tarsus, and inside wall of a chalazion after curettage of the lesion; however, the success rates were not different between surgery with (78%) and without cautery use (74%). In this study, a cautery was used only to reduce bleeding time. Additionally, it was unclear whether the chalazion was completely removed or not. The use of a cautery may not improve the surgical success rate. Moreover, our success rate was higher than the previous study.

Previous studies showed that surgical success rates of single TA injection and I&C ranged from 8.7–86.7% and 60%–92%, respectively. A previous study demonstrated the resolution of multiple chalazia in all 25 patients after combined I&C and following TA injection. Our technique may provide better surgical outcomes compared to sole TA injection or I&C and comparable outcomes to a combination of I&C and TA injection.

There were several limitations to this study. As mentioned above, this study did not include comparative results with or without diathermy. Additionally, a follow-up period was short.

In conclusion, thermocoagulation of chalazion contents facilitates grasping with forceps and detaching from the surrounding tissues, which enables secure and complete chalazion excision.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^113R8TNM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings from this non-randomized, prospective observational clinical study demonstrate that chalazion causes meibomian gland loss, and the range of meibomian gland loss after complete chalazion resolution is related to the range of chalazion itself, that is, the range of chronic granulomatous inflammation. Interestingly, despite our initial concern, surgery did not expand the range of meibomian gland loss. One previous study reported that chalazion itself or chalazion excision may cause meibomian gland loss; however, due to the limitations of the retrospective study design, the factor responsible for meibomian gland loss was unclear. This finding clearly supplemented the conclusions of the study. According to monitoring of the progression of chalazia by infrared meibomian gland photography, we found that the meibomian gland morphology could not be observed in the chalazion area before treatment (conservative treatment or surgery), and after complete chalazion resolution, the area showed meibomian gland loss. In this study, the calculation method of the proportion of the chalazion area was the chalazion area/the whole area of the tarsal plate, although the lower eyelid was everted more difficult than the upper eyelid, The calculation method of the whole area of the tarsal plate (original meibomian gland area) was the same as upper eyelid, that is, total area of tarsal plate can be seen in the image. The total area of the tarsal plate was only measured once (before treatment), so, in this formula the denominator remains unchanged before and after treatment. As the results show, no statistically significant difference was found between the range of meibomian gland loss after complete chalazion resolution and the range of the initial chalazion area before treatment using either method. The reasons for these results are discussed below.

### Eyelid fat atrophy and depigmentation after an intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide to treat chalazion [^116Zd5Ro]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Two patients with depigmentation and fat atrophy after an intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) to treat chalazion are reported. A 2-year-old girl with chalazion in her right lower eyelid received a subconjunctival injection of TA and developed fat atrophy and depigmentation around the injected area. These changes subsided after 7 months. The second patient was a 5-year-old boy who received a triamcinolone injection into a chalazion through the eyelid skin and also developed fat atrophy and depigmentation but these changes improved after 1 year.

Management and Indications for Surgery

A total of 2,067 (18.34%) patients opted for no treatment. The chalazion was managed conservatively with warm compresses, tetracycline eye ointment and eyelid massage in 8,217 (72.91%) patients. Incision and curettage was indicated and advised in 1,652 (14.66%) patients and intralesional steroid Injection was advised in 62 (0.55%) patients. Overall, 1,714 (15.21%) patients were advised to have an intervention and it was performed in 986 (8.75%) with a surgical conversion rate of 57.53% (986/1714) (Figure 2).

Seasonal Variation

The presentation of patients did not follow any seasonal pattern during the year which was steady from the month of January to December with an average of 8.33% per month. The percentage of the lowest cases being 7.29% in April to the highest being 9.36% in December. The month wise percentage of chalazion cases compared to the footfalls of the total patients presenting to the eye care centers is described in Figure 3.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^115Df1tx]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatments

The conservative treatment method consisted of the following practices: A hot eye mask (Shandong Zhushi Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd.) was applied for 10 min in the morning and at night, one drop of 0.5% levofloxacin eye solution was applied four times a day, and ofloxacin eye ointment was applied before bed. The local antibiotics were used for 4 weeks.

The surgical method consisted of the following procedures: 1) The chalazion area was infiltrated with approximately 1 mL of 2% lidocaine, and after local anesthesia infiltration, the eyelid was everted using a chalazion clamp. 2) A single vertical incision was made at the site of the chalazion, the contents of the chalazion were removed completely, and the chalazion's capsule was incised and removed. 3) The eye was bandaged with an eye patch after ofloxacin eye ointment had been applied. The patient was instructed to remove the patch 3 h later. Eye drops and eye ointment were used according to the methods described above.

All operations were performed by the same doctor in the outpatient procedure room on the same day of the examinations. All patients were followed up weekly before complete chalazion resolution.

Statistical analyses

A paired-sample t test was used to compare meibomian gland function scores before and after complete chalazion resolution. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare the proportion of meibomian gland loss at 1 month after complete chalazion resolution and the proportion of the initial chalazion area. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical software used was IBM SPSS Statistics Desktop Version 18.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^1166X2Cw]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the relationship between internal and external chalazion has not been reported previously. Sometimes an external chalazion comes from a growing internal chalazion that penetrates the tarsus and appears superficial on the skin. This can be proven by a hole running through the tarsal plate after the removal of a chalazion. However, our study showed no relationship between these two types of chalazia for each lid, which could indicate that the formation of internal and external chalazion is relatively independent.

Sometimes, doctors may only focus on the eyelid with external nodule or big internal lump that is especially conspicuous when the patient closes his eyes and may overlook the other eyelids that appear to be normal. Though doctors should evert each eyelid for examination during I&C, we still may find hidden internal chalazion in a seemingly normal eyelid that patients or primary care providers have not noticed. The present study highlights the facts that children are susceptible to multiple chalazia and that the nodules tend to grow bilaterally and internally. It should be emphasized that during I&C, especially in young children, an examination of both eyelids, especially the upper lids, should be conducted to detect any internal chalazion.

### Multivariate analysis of the effect of chalazia on astigmatism in children [^115VQBri]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

Participants

A total of 398 children aged 0.5–6 years who complained of chalazion masses and attended the Department of Ophthalmology of the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from June 2020 to June 2021 were included in the study. All children were distributed into the chalazion group (491 eyes) and the non-chalazion group (control group, 305 eyes) according to their chalazion status. The sites, sizes, and numbers of chalazion masses in each eye were recorded and classified, and the refractive status was examined. Chalazion masses were also divided into the single chalazion group and the multiple chalazion group (≥ 2) according to the number of chalazion masses. Moreover, single chalazion masses were classified into the following six groups according to the location in the eyelid: lateral-upper, middle-upper, medial-upper, lateral-lower, middle-lower, and medial-lower eyelids. Finally, single chalazion cases were divided into three groups according to the size of the masses: small (< 3 mm), medium (3–5 mm), and large (> 5 mm). Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were included: (1) consent of the child's parents or legal guardians for participation in the study, good compliance of the child, and signed informed consent form; (2) children aged 0–6 years diagnosed with chalazion masses in one or both eyes; and (3) no allergic conjunctivitis, trichiasis or often rubbing the eye and other symptoms; (4) no opacity of the refracting media and no other ophthalmic diseases such as strabismus. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) children aged ≥ 6 years; (2) eyelid abnormalities such as congenital or acquired ptosis, lower eyelid entropion and trichiasis, and eyelid masses other than chalazion; (3) corneal abnormalities such as ocular trauma, history of wearing contact lens, keratoconjunctival dermoid tumor, corneal scarring, and severe xerophthalmia; and (4) children with a history of diseases other than a chalazion and who were uncooperative in the examination of visual acuity. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The protocol adhered to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Case report: unveiling the unseen-ocular tuberculosis presenting as chalazion [^116iHcaD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Any part, compartment, and tissue of the eyes can be involved in the tubercular infectious process. Eyelid TB is often confused with a chalazion. Because TB is often not included in the differentials, proper evaluation is frequently not undertaken. Most patients are initially treated with oral antibiotics and topical anti-inflammatory agents considering possibility of chalazion; however, there is not enough evidence regarding the therapeutic efficacy of these treatment options in the management of a chalazion. The actual incidence of eyelid TB is unknown, but according to one retrospective study by Babu et al.from southern India, about 2% of cases of extrapulmonary TB are due to ocular TB. They found that the most common manifestation of ocular TB was choroidal tuberculoma. However, because this study was done on immunodeficient individuals, the findings may not be generalizable to immunocompetent patients. Only a few case reports of eyelid TB are available, – showing the lack of awareness regarding this uncommon presentation. Among the published literature, one case was presented as a unilateral chalazion similar to our case, but this patient had submandibular lymphadenopathy associated with the eye symptom. Another case was presented as a mass along the lower eyelid that was later diagnosed as an extra tarsal chalazion of tubercular origin. Other manifestations of TB in the eyelid are chronic blepharitis or nodules, which may recur after excision. Another case report showed bilateral involvement of the lower eyelid with a chalazion-like presentation in a patient suffering from pulmonary TB. In our patient there was no history of past infection with TB or TB contact. He also had no symptoms or signs suggestive of active TB infection in other sites. Although the patient had a history of fall while playing in the recent past, contribution of this event to the eye lesion was difficult to confirm.

In such cases, the opinion of an infectious diseases specialist and appropriate sampling allow the early detection of any pathogen.

Tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic ocular pathology. Microbiological demonstration of M. tuberculosis is important to avoid empirical therapy, as drug-resistant TB is a serious problem that can arise because of improper use of antitubercular therapy. There should be a high index of suspicion for ocular TB not only in endemic areas but also in other parts of the world. Early diagnosis and treatment can avoid progression to impaired vision due to TB.

### The usefulness of diathermy thermocoagulation in chalazion surgery [^1147y5Sb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A chalazion is a chronic lipogranulomatous inflammation caused by meibomian gland occlusion. An acute chalazion is initially managed conservatively using a warm compress and antibiotic/steroid eye drops or ointment. Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injection or incision and curettage (I&C) is considered for a persistent chalazion. The advantages of I&C in comparison to TA injection include earlier resolution and less recurrence, although TA injection is a quick and effective therapy. A large chalazion has better responses to I&C. However, incomplete chalazion drainage results in partial chalazion resolution or recurrence, and excisions of the entire chalazion contents are a requisite.

The chalazion contents are atheromatous and sticky; thus, they are difficult to grasp with forceps and detached from the surrounding tissues. Therefore, we devised a chalazion surgery with diathermy thermocoagulation of the chalazion contents for easy grasp and detachment to address this knowledge gap. The present study aimed to present our devised surgical method.

### Distribution of multiple chalazia in eyelids of pediatrics requiring surgery in southeast China: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^114j7Hcz]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Subject characteristics

A total of 128 consecutive children with multiple chalazia were included in the study. No patients met the exclusion criteria. All the histopathological evaluations confirmed the diagnosis of chalazion by showing inflammatory granuloma with multinucleated cells and infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes.

The majority of children (74.2%) were under 3 years old, with a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 2.5 ± 0.9 years (range 1.0–6.5 years). The mean ± SD disease duration was 2.2 ± 1.7 months (range 0.3–12.0 months). Fifty-seven patients were male (44.5%), 122 had bilateral lesions (95.3%), 127 presented internal chalazion (99.2%), 79 external chalazion (61.7%), and 3 marginal chalazion (2.3%). The mean ± SD number of lesions per person was 8.30 ± 3.75 (range 2–22). Typical examples of multiple chalazia are shown in figure 1.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^116Sje8E]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To observe the effects of chalazion and its treatments on meibomian gland function and morphology in the chalazion area.

Methods

This nonrandomized, prospective observational clinical study included 58 patients (67 eyelids) who were cured of chalazion, including 23 patients (23 eyelids) treated with a conservative method and 35 patients (44 eyelids) treated with surgery. Infrared meibomian gland photography combined with image analysis by ImageJ software was used to measure the chalazion area proportion. Slit-lamp microscopy was employed to evaluate meibomian gland function, and a confocal microscope was used to observe meibomian gland acinar morphology before treatment and 1 month after complete chalazion resolution.

Results

At 1 month after chalazion resolution, the original chalazion area showed meibomian gland loss according to infrared meibomian gland photography in both groups. In patients who received conservative treatment, the meibomian gland function parameters before treatment were 0.74 ± 0.75, 0.48 ± 0.67, and 1.22 ± 0.60, respectively. One month after chalazion resolution, the parameters were 0.35 ± 0.49, 0.17 ± 0.49, and 0.91 ± 0.60, respectively; there was significant difference (P < 0.05). The proportion of the chalazion area before treatment was 14.90 (11.03, 25.3), and the proportion of meibomian gland loss at 1 month after chalazion resolution was 14.64 (10.33, 25.77); there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). In patients who underwent surgery, the meibomian gland function parameters before surgery were 0.93 ± 0.87, 1.07 ± 0.70, and 1.59 ± 0.76, respectively, and at 1 month after chalazion resolution, they were 0.93 ± 0.82, 0.95 ± 0.75, and 1.52 ± 0.70, respectively; there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The proportion of the chalazion area before surgery was 14.90 (12.04, 21.6), and the proportion of meibomian gland loss at 1 month after chalazion resolution was 14.84 (11.31, 21.81); there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The acinar structure could not be observed clearly in the meibomian gland loss area in most patients.

Conclusions

Chalazion causes meibomian gland loss, and the range of meibomian gland loss is not related to the treatment method but to the range of chalazion itself. A hot compress as part of conservative treatment can improve meibomian gland function at the site of chalazion in the short term.

### Randomized prospective evaluation of microblepharoexfoliation blephEx as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of chalazia [^112PTYwK]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Classically, lid hygiene with warm compresses and lid massages can lead to complete resolution of a majority of chalazia within 4 to 6 weeks. If refractory to lid hygiene and other conservative measures, second-line remedies include corticosteroid injections or incision and curettage (I&C). These procedural solutions, however, are not without risks such as atrophic skin changes and accidental injection into the ophthalmic artery with the steroid injection or the potential for delayed bleeding and pain with I&C. In procedural studies, most patients who underwent these more invasive treatment methods experienced complete resolution of their chalazia (75% to 81%), whereas around one fifth of patients did not have their lesions cured. However, in this current study, 87% of patients treated through MBE using BlephEx experienced resolution of their chalazion. MBE, a completely noninvasive treatment modality, achieved resolution rates comparable or even slightly higher than those of the historically more invasive injections and I&C procedures. When compared with the lid hygiene treatment alone group, which had a resolution rate of 44%, significantly higher percentage of patients experienced resolution of their symptoms through MBE (P = 0.007). However, no patient in either group developed any new chalazia, supporting the positive effect of lid hygiene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive MBE for achieving complete resolution of chalazia.

In this study, 22% of patients with chalazia were positive for Demodex in their lashes, lower than a previously published prevalence of 69.2%. A possible explanation for the lower prevalence of Demodex in this study is that only 1 eyelash was epilated from each eyelid, whereas in the previous study, 2 eyelashes were removed. In addition, the percentage of Demodex positivity was similar in both treatment arms of this study, suggesting that the significantly higher rate of chalazion resolution in the MBE group was not due to a difference in the prevalence of Demodex infestation but rather was due to the efficacy of the treatment alone. This notion is further supported by the fact that there were no significant differences in the demographics or baseline characteristics of the MBE and lid hygiene alone treatment cohorts. In addition, this indicates that the efficacy of MBE is less likely to be related to the presence of Demodex in the patients' lashes.

### Large anterior orbital cyst as a late complication of chalazion surgical drainage [^116QKH9f]. Eye (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present four patients who developed large cystic lesions attached to the tarsal plate at the site of previously drained chalazion.

Methods

Medical records for all patients who developed cystic lesion as a complication of chalazion surgery were retrospectively reviewed for clinical and radiological findings, treatment provided, histopathological findings, and complications.

Results

Four patients (one male and three females) with a mean age of 22 years (range, 11–36 years) were enrolled in the study. A history of chalazion surgery was present in all patients at the same site of the cyst attachment to the tarsal plate. The mean interval between the presentation with the cystic lesion and the chalazion surgery was 13 weeks (range, 6–24 weeks). All patients were treated with surgical excision of the cysts, along with local triamcinolone injection. Histopathological findings of the excised cysts were consistent with chalazion. There was no evidence of recurrence or other complication observed during the follow-up visits (the minimum follow-up duration was 6 months).

Conclusions

Anterior orbital cystic formation (prolapsed chalazion) may occur as a late complication of chalazion surgery. Surgical excision along with steroid injection was effective to manage this rare complication among our patients.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^116TGfTH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Basic patient information

Seventy-one (82 eyelids) patients were initially enrolled. At 1 month after complete chalazion resolution, 5 patients who received conservative treatment and 8 patients who underwent surgery were lost to follow-up. Finally, a total of 58 patients (67 eyelids), including 23 patients (23 eyelids) who received conservative treatment and 35 patients (44 eyelids) who underwent surgery, were included in the statistical analysis. Compared to those in patients who underwent surgery, the average chalazion size was smaller and the average chalazion duration was shorter in patients who received conservative treatment, but the average chalazion resolution time was longer. The basic information of the patients who received the two treatment methods is shown in Table 1.

Changes in meibomian gland function in the chalazion area before and after complete chalazion resolution

Before treatment, meibomian orifice plugging was observed in the chalazion area in some patients, and meibum with a more opaque and toothpaste-like appearance was difficult to express. Meibomian gland function at 1 month after complete chalazion resolution was better than that before conservative treatment (P < 0.05). Meibomian gland function before surgery did not significantly differ from that at 1 month after complete chalazion resolution (P > 0.05) (Table 2).

### Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injection for primary and recurrent chalazia: is it really effective? [^1165mcK6]. Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injection in primary and recurrent chalazia.

Design

Retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series.

Participants

One hundred forty-seven patients with primary or recurrent chalazia (155 cases) treated at the oculoplastic clinic at the Jules Stein Eye Institute between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003.

Methods

Patients received an intralesional injection of 0.1 to 0.2 mL TA (40 mg/ml). Data regarding lesion size, including digital color photography, lesion regression or recurrence, and complete ophthalmic examination, were recorded at the time of injection and at different intervals until resolution or surgical excision. Success was defined as at least an 80% decrease in size with no recurrence. If the lesion recurred or regression was minimal (< 50%), further injections were given as needed. Patients who declined injection or who did not respond to 2 to 3 injections were referred for surgical excision and drainage.

Main Outcome Measures

Lesion size, clinical resolution, time to resolution, recurrence, and complications.

Results

Most of the patients received 1 injection (93 patients; 60%) or 2 injections (31 patients; 20%) with resolution of the lesion (more than 80% decrease in size), with an average time to resolution of 2.5 weeks. Patients who did not respond to 2 injections were more likely to fail treatment (minimal or no regression), to respond to further injections, or to undergo surgical excision and drainage (P = 0.0001, chi-square test). Patients with blepharitis required more injections to resolution (2 ± 1.3 vs. 1.4 ± 1; P = 0.05, independent samples t test). Intraocular pressure and visual acuity remained stable after treatment. No complications, such as visual loss, subcutaneous fat atrophy, or skin depigmentation changes, were noted with steroids injections; assuming a complication rate of 2%, our power was adequate to rule out these complications.

Conclusions

Intralesional TA injection in primary and recurrent chalazia is effective in achieving lesion regression. Most cases resolve with an average of 1 to 2 injections. Chalazia that fail to respond to 2 or 3 injections are more likely to benefit from surgical excision. It may be considered as a first treatment in cases where diagnosis is straightforward.

### Demography and clinical features of chalazion among patients seen at a multi-tier eye care network in India: an electronic medical records driven big data analysis report [^111MLekS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Incidence and Prevalence

Of the 1,982,058 new patients who presented for an eye examination between August 16, 2010 and December 312019, in the multi-tier hospital network, 11,270 new patients were diagnosed with chalazion translating into a prevalence rate of 0.57% (95% CI 0.569–0.571) or 5,686/million population. The number of patients with recurrent symptoms was 1,085 patients at a recurrence rate of 9.63% (95% CI 9.1–10.2%).

Age

The mean age of the patients with chalazion was 27.48 ± 15.64 years while the median age was 25 (IQR:17–36) years. Around 23.57% of the patients were children and 76.43 adults. The distribution of chalazion in each age-decade is presented in Figure 1. The overall prevalence of chalazion was 0.95% (2656/280,034) in children and 0.51% (8614/1,702,024) in adults. The prevalence of chalazion increased steadily from the first decade (12.7%) with peaking in the third decade of life (30.84%) followed by a decline from the fourth decade (15.1%).

Figure 1
Decade-wise distribution of chalazion cases.

Gender

There were 5,738 (50.91%) male and 5,532 (49.09%) female patients with chalazion. The overall prevalence of chalazion was slightly lower in males (0.54%; 5,738/1,051,339) compared to females (0.59%; 5,532/930,719) (p = 0.00001). (Figure 2) Among the patients with chalazion, the mean and median age were 30.89 ± 16.47 and 29 (IQR: 20–41) years for males and 23.94 ± 13.87 and 21 (IQR: 15–29) years for females, respectively. The overall mode was 26 years in males and 21 years in females.

### Conjunctival lymphoma in a child [^111ii89k]. Cornea (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a rare case of large conjunctival B-cell lymphoma in a child.

Methods

A 13-year-old girl was initially diagnosed with a right lower eyelid chalazion. After 3 weeks during which the mass was growing, she was referred for treatment to our department. Because of the unusual appearance of the mass, an excisional biopsy was performed.

Results

Pathological findings were consistent with those of a large B-cell lymphoma. CD20 and Ki67 staining were positive, and polymerase chain reaction analysis showed monoclonality of B cells.

Conclusions

Although conjunctival lymphoma is a very rare entity in children, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of an eyelid or conjunctival mass.

### Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injection versus incision and curettage for primary chalazia: a prospective, randomized study [^113Cu6aC]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare treatment outcomes of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injection with incision and curettage (I&C) for primary chalazia.

Design

Prospective, randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Institutional.

Study Population

Ninety-four patients with primary chalazia after failed conservative treatment were randomized to either intralesional TA injection (4 mg) or I&C performed under local anesthesia. All patients underwent comprehensive eye examinations that included digital photography of the lesion. Complete resolution was defined as lesion regression of 95% to 100%. Treatment was considered a failure if no resolution was achieved after the first attempted I&C or TA injection.

Main Outcome Measures

Lesion resolution measured as 95% to 100% regression.

Results

Ninety-four patients participated in the study: 42 underwent I&C and 52 underwent TA injection as the first treatment. Complete resolution was achieved in 33 (79%) of 42 patients in the I&C group and in 42 (81%) of 52 patients in the TA group (P = 0.8, chi-square analysis). The average time to resolution in the TA group was 5 days, with most patients (48/52; 92%) having received a single injection and 4 (8%) of 52 patients having received 2 injections. TA precipitates were detected in 6 (11.5%) of 52 patients and resolved spontaneously. There were no complications, such as eyelid depigmentation, increased intraocular pressure, or any loss of vision, in either group.

Conclusions

Intralesional TA injection is as effective as I&C in primary chalazia. Injection may be considered as an alternative first-line treatment in cases where diagnosis is straightforward and no biopsy is required.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^116b4XFj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Changes in meibomian gland morphology in the chalazion area

Normal meibomian gland morphology in the chalazion area could not be observed before treatment, but after complete chalazion resolution, meibomian gland loss was observed in the chalazion area with both treatment methods. Moreover, no statistically significant difference between the proportion of meibomian gland loss and the proportion of the initial chalazion area (P > 0.05) was noted in either treatment group (Table 3) (Figs. 2 and 3).

Changes in the acinar structure in the chalazion area

In this study, we intended to observe the acinar structure in the chalazion area at the cellular level. However, due to the limitation of current ophthalmic in vivo LSCM, clear acinar images can be obtained only at or near the eyelid margin. In our study, only 3 patients (3 eyelids) with conservative treatment had chalazia located near the eyelid margin, and in vivo LSCM examination revealed a large number of inflammatory cells in the chalazion area before treatment. At 1 month after complete chalazion resolution, no obvious inflammatory cells were present, but the intact acinar structure was not found at the area. (Fig. 4).

### The usefulness of diathermy thermocoagulation in chalazion surgery [^111mwCAe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Report of Cases

Case 1

A 52-year-old male patient noticed a mass in the left lower eyelid 1 month before presenting for surgery. The mass did not improve with antibiotics, eye drops, and ointment. He was referred for surgical treatment. Half of the chalazion contents were removed using scissors after a skin incision. The residual chalazion contents were coagulated using diathermy and removed by scissors. The skin was closed with 6–0 Nylon ® (see). The chalazion mass disappeared 1 week postoperatively. The patient had no evidence of recurrence or any complications 6 months postoperatively.

Case 2

A 27-year-old female patient presented with a chalazion in the left upper eyelid. The chalazion contents were coagulated with diathermy, detached from the tarsus, and completely removed after a palpebral conjunctival incision (see).

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^115K42NL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Determine blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC) presentation and outcomes in Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic pediatric patients.

Methods

Retrospective review of pediatric patients (< 18 years old) with BKC and at least 2 examinations (2018–2022). Details obtained were self-reported race/ethnicity, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp findings, and prescribed treatments.

Results

Ninety-five patients (59 Females) presented at a median of 8.1 [IQR 5.7, 10.9] years of age and had 4 (IQR 3, 4) visits over 1.3 ([QR 0.8, 2.2] years. Sixty-five (68%) patients identified as Hispanic. There was no difference in age at presentation, number of visits, or follow-up between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients. Initial (0.22 [IQR 0.10, 0.40] vs. 0.06 [IQR 0.00, 0.18], p < 0.01) and final (0.13 [IQR 0.10, 0.40] vs. 0.02 [IQR 0.00, 0.18], p < 0.01) LogMAR BCVA were significantly worse in Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic patients. Logistic analysis showed an association between Hispanic ethnicity and worse initial and final BCVA. However, ethnicity did not correlate with any subset of BKC diagnoses (e.g. corneal scar or ulcer, chalazion, marginal or superficial keratitis) or slit lamp findings. The presence of corneal stromal scarring was associated with worse initial BCVA, regardless of ethnicity. There were no differences in prescribed treatments between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic patients, and no treatments were associated with visual outcomes.

Conclusions

BKC was common in Hispanic patients and despite no difference in slit lamp findings or prescribed treatments, Hispanic patients had worse initial and final BCVA. The presence of corneal stromal scarring was also associated with worse visual outcomes.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^113vpQUC]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infrared meibomian gland photography

After the eyelids affected by chalazion were everted, a morphological picture was taken by a noncontact infrared meibography system with the Oculus Keratograph (Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) as described previously. ImageJ software was used to calculate the area of the chalazion and the whole area of the tarsal plate where the chalazion was located. The proportion of the chalazion area = the chalazion area/the whole area of the tarsal plate (Fig. 1). The whole area of the tarsal plate was also used to calculate the area at 1 month after complete chalazion resolution; that is, the denominator was unchanged.

Fig. 1
The method of calculating the proportion of chalazion area in the image of the infrared meibomian gland is shown (a shows the end of the gland at the upper margin of the iliac crest, b shows be the most visible tarsal conjunctiva of the everted lid, c shows the gland at the iliac crest, d shows the nasal border was defined as the tear punctum, e shows the chalazion area). a shows the whole area of the tarsal plate, and b shows the chalazion area

In vivo laser scanning confocal microscopy

All patients were examined by in vivo LSCM (HRT III Corneal Rostock Module; Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously. Before each examination, one drop of 0.4% oxybuprocaine eye solution (Santen, Osaka, Japan) was instilled into the conjunctival fornix. After the eyelid where the chalazion was located was everted, the center of the Tomo-cap was applanated onto the palpebral conjunctiva of the chalazion area, the chalazion area was scanned first, followed by the non-chalazion area nearby. The two-dimensional image size was 384 × 384 pixels, with a 400x400μm field of view.

### The association of demodex infestation with pediatric chalazia [^115rsFYL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to investigate the association of Demodex infestation with pediatric chalazia.

Methods

In a prospective study, 446 children with chalazia and 50 children with non-inflammatory eye disease (controls) who underwent surgical treatment were enrolled from December 2018 to December 2019. Patient ages ranged from 7months to 13years old. All patients underwent eyelash sampling for light microscope examination, and statistical correlation analysis between Demodex infestation and chalazia, including the occurrence, recurrence, and course of disease, morphological characteristics, and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) in chalazia patients was performed.

Results

Demodex was found in 236 (52.91%) patients with chalazia and zero control patients. Demodicosis was significantly more prevalent in chalazia patients than the control group (P < 1×10–14). Recurrent chalazia (P = 0.006) and skin surface involvement (P = 0.029) were highly correlated with Demodex infestation. Demodicosis was also associated with multiple chalazia (P = 0.023) and MGD(P = 0.024). However, Demodex infestation was comparable in the course of disease (P = 0.15), seasonal change (P = 0.68) and blepharitis subgroups (P = 0.15). Within the group of chalazia patients who underwent surgical removal of cysts, 4 (0.9%) patients with concurrent demodicosis experienced recurrence.

Conclusions

Demodex infestation was more prevalent in pediatric chalazia patients than healthy children, and was associated with recurrent and multiple chalazia. Demodicosis should be considered as a risk factor of chalazia. In children with chalazia, Demodex examination and comprehensive treatment of Demodex mites should be applied to potentially prevent recurrence.

Patients were expected to be recruited from 2 cohorts of patients from OCLI and NUMC. Because of delays of the NUMC IRB, all 50 patients were recruited from OCLI. Study subjects were required to be 18 years or older with the ability to consent for eye examination, diagnostic testing, and noninvasive ophthalmic office procedures (epilation). All patients were examined by an experienced clinician and had to have clinical evidence of chalazion in the acute, inflammatory phase on slit-lamp examination and symptoms from their chalazion for 7 days or less. All lesions that were not clearly chalazia were not included in this study. Potential subjects also had 1 eyelash epilated and examined under the microscope to assess for Demodex positivity with the total number of Demodex mites on the lash counted and recorded. Subjects were excluded if they were pregnant, younger than 18 years, lacked the ability to consent for diagnostic procedures, illiterate, or had BlephEx (MBE) treatment within 1 month of study enrollment.

After the discussion and the procurement of informed consent for participation in this study, subjects were enrolled and given an identification (ID) number ranging from 1 to 50, which were preassigned to either A (MBE plus lid hygiene) or B (lid hygiene alone) using a randomization table based on block randomization. For the 50 total subjects, there were no 2 ID numbers with the same enrollment number and if a patient exited the study secondary to any reason, their study ID number was vacated and was not reused. Subjects randomized to group A received MBE treatment performed in the office by a certified technician, and all subjects (groups A and B) were given verbal and written instructions to perform lid hygiene with twice daily warm saltwater-soaked cotton balls for 1 month.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112e95Eo]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Management — detection and clinical suspicion are emphasized. Detection and appropriate treatment can reduce signs and symptoms of blepharitis, and in severe cases it can prevent permanent structural damage and possible vision loss. This is particularly important in children, in whom chronic blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is often unrecognized and can be more severe, and it should be suspected in a child with recurrent conjunctivitis, keratitis, neovascularization, eyelid inflammation, hordeolum, chalazia, corneal opacification, and amblyopia. The presentation can be asymmetric and is often confused with herpetic disease. Tear film break-up time using fluorescein is significantly shorter in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), even if aqueous tear production is normal, which suggests that meibomian gland secretions are important in maintaining a stable precorneal tear film.

### Effects of chalazion and its treatments on the meibomian glands: a nonrandomized, prospective observation clinical study [^111BJsdF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, we found meibomian orifice plugging and toothpaste-like meibum in one or several meibomian glands where chalazion was located before treatment, which may suggest that local meibomian gland function had already changed before chalazion formed, and meibomian gland obstruction may lead to chalazion, which was also one of the causes of chalazion formation. As the results showed, meibomian gland function improved at 1 month after complete chalazion resolution with conservative treatment. However, no statistically significant differences were noted before and after surgery. One reason was patients with conservative treatment used hot masks before complete chalazion resolution, and frequent and regular heating melted the meibum of the non-chalazion part, allowing the meibum to discharge on the eyelid margin. Another reason was the improvement of meibomian gland function might differ between the two groups, because the size of chalazion was smaller in the conservative group, but chalazion size is often related to the pre-treatment duration in the clinic, not meibomian gland function. Moreover, hot compress is an effective method to improve meibomian gland function, in this study, hot compresses was only used in conservative group. So we consider the improvement of meibomian gland was related to hot compress.

Notably, complete chalazion resolution does not indicate the end of treatment. If meibomian gland function in the non-chalazion area does not improve, the meibomian glands will become obstructed and cause chalazion again, which is why some people are prone to suffer from chalazion. No specific preventive strategy is available for chalazia because chalazion is closely related to the meibomian gland. Previous studies have shown that meibomian gland function can be improved by various methods. A hot compress combined with meibomian gland massage is considered a traditional and effective method, while LipiFlow treatment and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment are optional choices, and intraductal meibomian gland probing can be used in patients with severe meibomian gland obstruction. Therefore, further research on personalized treatments according to the condition of meibomian glands after complete chalazion resolution is needed.

### Differential diagnosis of the swollen red eyelid [^116TyHyn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The swollen red eyelid is a common presentation in primary care. An understanding of the anatomy of the orbital region can guide care. Factors that guide diagnosis and urgency of care include acute vs. subacute onset of symptoms, presence or absence of pain, identifiable mass within the eyelid vs. diffuse lid swelling, and identification of vision change or ophthalmoplegia. Superficial skin processes presenting with swollen red eyelid include vesicles of herpes zoster ophthalmicus; erythematous irritation of contact dermatitis; raised, dry plaques of atopic dermatitis; and skin changes of malignancies, such as basal or squamous cell carcinoma. A well-defined mass at the lid margin is often a hordeolum or stye. A mass within the midportion of the lid is commonly a chalazion. Preseptal and orbital cellulitis are important to identify, treat, and differentiate from each other. Orbital cellulitis is more often marked by changes in ability of extraocular movements and vision as opposed to preseptal cellulitis where these characteristics are classically normal. Less commonly, autoimmune processes of the orbit or ocular tumors with mass effect can create an initial impression of a swollen eyelid.

### Visual outcome and corneal changes in children with chronic blepharokeratoconjunctivitis [^114rbsXt]. Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the cause, management, and effect of chronic blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC) on the cornea and visual function in children.

Design

Noncomparative, interventional, retrospective case series.

Participants

Twenty-seven children with BKC.

Methods

Presenting age, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error, and any corneal or eyelid pathologic features were recorded. Treatment included modified lid hygiene, topical antibiotics, and steroids. Systemic therapy included oral antibiotics and, from 2003 onward, flaxseed oil as an alternative to long-term antibiotics. Amblyopia therapy included refractive correction, occlusion, or atropine therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

Corneal and eyelid status, visual acuity (VA), and refractive error at final examination.

Results

Mean age at presentation was 6.9 years (range, 7 months-15.9 years), and mean follow-up was 2.3 years (range, 5 months-6.1 years). All patients had discomfort, conjunctival injection, and signs of posterior blepharitis at presentation. Photophobia was reported in 14 patients (52%), whereas anterior eyelid inflammation was noted in 6 (22%). Acne rosacea was confirmed in 3 patients (11%). Corneal involvement occurred in 44 eyes (81%), and a history of recurrent chalazia was seen in 18 patients (67%). Median monocular BCVAs in affected eyes were 0.28 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units (interquartile range [IqR], 0.02–0.40) at presentation and 0.02 logMAR units (IqR, 0.00–0.18) at last visit. Best-corrected VA improved in 70% of affected eyes and remained unchanged in 30%. Superimposed amblyopia was present and treated in 15 patients (48%). All 8 patients (20%) who failed to achieve VA of 0.2 logMAR units or better at the final examination had bilateral corneal involvement at presentation. One child experienced a systemic side effect from oral antibiotics. No child had significant side effects from topical treatment. Twelve patients (44%) received flaxseed oil as part of their tapering regimen. A 2-year lag between symptom onset and treatment resulted, on average, in a reduction of 0.06 logMAR units of VA (95% confidence interval, 0.00–0.12; P = 0.054).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that visual loss may be significant in BKC and that delayed treatment may result in decreased final BCVA. Adequate management needs both topical and systemic treatment. Flaxseed oil may be an effective antiinflammatory nutritional therapy alternative to long-term antibiotics.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^114MaDYK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Determine blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC) presentation and outcomes in Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic pediatric patients.

Methods

Retrospective review of pediatric patients (< 18 years old) with BKC and at least 2 examinations (2018–2022). Details obtained were self-reported race/ethnicity, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp findings, and prescribed treatments.

Results

Ninety-five patients (59 Females) presented at a median of 8.1 [IQR 5.7, 10.9] years of age and had 4 (IQR 3, 4) visits over 1.3 ([QR 0.8, 2.2] years. Sixty-five (68%) patients identified as Hispanic. There was no difference in age at presentation, number of visits, or follow-up between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients. Initial (0.22 [IQR 0.10, 0.40] vs. 0.06 [IQR 0.00, 0.18], p < 0.01) and final (0.13 [IQR 0.10, 0.40] vs. 0.02 [IQR 0.00, 0.18], p < 0.01) LogMAR BCVA were significantly worse in Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic patients. Logistic analysis showed an association between Hispanic ethnicity and worse initial and final BCVA. However, ethnicity did not correlate with any subset of BKC diagnoses (e.g. corneal scar or ulcer, chalazion, marginal or superficial keratitis) or slit lamp findings. The presence of corneal stromal scarring was associated with worse initial BCVA, regardless of ethnicity. There were no differences in prescribed treatments between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic patients, and no treatments were associated with visual outcomes.

Conclusions

BKC was common in Hispanic patients and despite no difference in slit lamp findings or prescribed treatments, Hispanic patients had worse initial and final BCVA. The presence of corneal stromal scarring was also associated with worse visual outcomes.

### Oral tacrolimus for ocular involvement in pediatric neutrophilic dermatoses [^111VswzC]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutrophilic dermatoses (ND), including pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and Sweet syndrome (SS), are rare in children. One study showed that only 2% of PG cases occurred in patients younger than 18 years old. While both disorders are associated with extracutaneous features, ocular involvement is uncommon and often a diagnostic challenge. One French case series found ocular involvement in less than 15% of the 27 pediatric patients with PG or SS. Ocular manifestations include conjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis, and retinal vasculitis. Periorbital inflammation and eyelid lesions are also considered ocular manifestations, as eyelid lesions can lead to decreased visual acuity and occasionally vision loss. Most of the current literature describes ocular involvement in adults and highlights the risk of misdiagnosis as cellulitis or other bacterial infections, chalazion, or malignancy, resulting in inappropriate treatment. Early recognition and timely initiation of immunosuppressive therapy are imperative to prevent ocular damage and unnecessary antimicrobial exposure. To our knowledge, only 9 case reports have been published detailing the ocular manifestations of ND in pediatric patients, and even more limited data exists regarding the optimal treatment. We report 2 additional children with ocular manifestations of ND, refractory to other immunosuppressants, with excellent response to systemic tacrolimus.

### Randomized prospective evaluation of microblepharoexfoliation blephEx as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of chalazia [^113eHKem]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

Chalazia are common lipogranulomatous lesions resulting from the blockage and subsequent inflammation of the meibomian glands. It is one of the most common benign eyelid lesions, with a reported prevalence of 0.57% in a large observational study. Although most chalazia are typically asymptomatic, larger ones can cause visual dysfunction as a consequence of mechanical ptosis or induced astigmatism. The treatment of chalazia initially begins with conservative treatment (lid hygiene) including warm saline compresses; surgery is considered second line for chalazia refractory to conservative management. Other treatments for chalazia include oral doxycycline, antibiotic–steroid ointments, and meibomian gland expression.

One suspected cause of chalazia is the Demodex mite, the most common human skin ectoparasite. Although chalazia are most often due to ocular rosacea or generalized lid inflammation, Demodex has been characterized as a possible risk factor for recurrent chalazia in adults. The 2 species known to infest the skin of humans are Demodex folliculorum (D. folliculorum) and Demodex brevis (D. brevis). Although the exact mechanism of how Demodex mite infestation results in chalazia formation remains undetermined, suggested theories include the mite causing mechanical obstruction leading to meibomian gland dysfunction and that the exoskeleton of the mite could induce a granulomatous reaction. A histopathologic study examining full-thickness eyelid wedge resections reported that mean numbers of D. folliculorum were significantly higher in biopsies with chalazia when compared with biopsies without chalazia, and that D. brevis was only found in meibomian glands that had chalazia.

A novel approach to the treatment of Demodex infestation of the eyelid is the use of microblepharoexfoliation (MBE). – MBE is a novel method of in-office lid hygiene that works by exfoliating the eyelid margins to remove accumulated biofilm debris along with any Demodex mites to clean the lid margin, reduce lid inflammation, and improve meibomian gland function. Although studies have investigated MBE use in the context of blepharitis, no study to the best of our knowledge has examined the use of MBE for the treatment of chalazia. In this prospective randomized study, we aim to evaluate the utility of MBE for resolving chalazia in conjunction with traditional lid hygiene. Second, we attempt to correlate Demodex infestation with the incidence and severity of chalazia.

### Demography and clinical features of chalazion among patients seen at a multi-tier eye care network in India: an electronic medical records driven big data analysis report [^112qRNZE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chalazion is one of the commonest type of eyelid lesions seen in the ophthalmology clinic. Pathologically, chalazion is a chronic, lipogranulomatous inflammatory lesion caused by the blockage of the meibomian glands. They usually are asymptomatic, may have a cosmetic blemish or may rarely cause local infections like conjunctivitis or cellulitis. Large chalazia can occasionally cause visual loss by obstructing the pupil. Conservative treatment measures include the use of eyelid hygiene, hot compresses, and antibiotic and/or steroid drops. In case of failure of the above measures, intralesional corticosteroid injections or incision and curettage (I&C) to excise the lesion can be resorted to.

Though abundant literature exists on comparison of management modalities in chalazion, large data on the demographics and epidemiology of chalazion is scarce. The largest data set available in the literature describing the demography and epidemiology in chalazion included 97 patients. This represents a very miniscule number with respect to the general footfall of chalazion patients over the world. In the current age of data informatics, it is possible to extract large volumes of data from electronic medical record systems which can assist further understanding of disease demography and management. In the current communication, we report the demography, epidemiology and clinical patterns of patients with chalazia presenting to our multi-tier eye care network, a big data analysis retrieved from an indigenous developed electronic medical record system.

### Pediatric eyelid cutaneous horns: a case series and literature review [^111GCuD9]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical and histopathologic features of pediatric eyelid cutaneous horns.

Design

Retrospective observational case series and review of literature.

Subjects

Five pediatric patients with eyelid cutaneous horns.

Methods

Five cases with eyelid cutaneous horns were retrospectively identified using departmental databases. Patients' records were analyzed for demographic data, clinical appearance, histologic findings, and clinical course. An excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed in 3 patients. The remaining 2 patients were managed conservatively.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical outcome and histopathologic evaluation with emphasis on excluding malignancy.

Results

All 5 cutaneous horn lesions resolved surgically or conservatively. The average age at presentation was 6.6 years (range 5–11 years). Clinically, 4 lesions were preceded by a hordeolum or chalazion and all excised lesions had benign features on histologic examination. Mitotic figures or atypia were not observed. None of the patients developed recurrence during the follow-up period ranging from 1 to 96 months. Five previous reports of five cases were found on review of the literature. Our case series doubles this number to support the benign nature of these lesions in children.

Conclusions

Pediatric eyelid cutaneous horns are closely related to eyelid margin inflammatory disease and appear to follow a benign course. This contrasts with the adult population where cutaneous horns are frequently associated with neoplasia.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^113mzVQk]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCLAIMER

The Work Group acknowledges that the ichthyoses and other disorders of cornification are a heterogeneous group of disorders with widely varying prevalence and pathogenetic mechanisms. Clinically, the severity of cutaneous expression, systemic associations, and comorbidities are also disparate. High quality, randomized clinical trials are not available. Thus, these recommendations are made using best available data and the collective clinical experience of the Work Group. These recommendations should not be applied to any patient without careful individualization of the therapeutic plan based on specific patient information and thoughtful provider‐patient discussion of potential risks and benefits.

### Ocular and orbital tumors in childhood [^112iu48X]. Clinics in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric tumors of the eye and orbit can be benign or malignant as well as congenital or acquired and are usually distinctively different than those seen in adults. Although most of these neoplasms are benign (eg, dermoid cyst, chalazion, molluscum), their location near and within a vital organ can result in serious dermatologic and ophthalmologic sequelae. Lesions discussed include vascular lesions, retinoblastomas (the most common primary pediatric intraocular malignancy), rhabdomyosarcoma (the most common primary pediatric orbital malignancy), Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and metastatic lesions to the orbit (neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma). Although cysts and ocular melanoma can occur within the pediatric population, these conditions are covered in other contributions in this issue of Clinics in Dermatology.

### Oral tacrolimus for ocular involvement in pediatric neutrophilic dermatoses [^115cnitg]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

Case 1 is a 15-year–old female with a history of dermatitis herpetiformis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis currently treated with subcutaneous methotrexate and intravenous tocilizumab, who presented with 2 weeks of worsening joint pain and new skin findings. Skin examination showed diffuse, indurated papules and plaques, a painless, violaceous nodule of the left upper eyelid (Fig 1, A), and right-eye conjunctivitis. Ophthalmologic examination showed normal visual acuity and intra-ocular pressures, but her right bulbar conjunctiva had an unusual follicular reaction inconsistent with viral conjunctivitis. Her left eyelid lesion was clinically suggestive of a chalazion. A biopsy of a leg papule demonstrated an intense superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of neutrophils consistent with SS. She was then started on intravenous methylprednisolone with substantial improvement in her skin lesions, eyelid lesion, conjunctivitis, and joint pain. With the unusual follicular reaction of the bulbar conjunctiva and improvement with steroids, the eye findings were recognized as manifestations of SS, rather than a viral process or chalazion.

Fig 1
A, Eyelid lesion on presentation. B, Untreated leg ulcer.

For her SS, topical clobetasol ointment and oral dapsone were added as prednisone was tapered. Simultaneously, and due to persistent arthritis, tocilizumab was replaced with rituximab infusions. Despite dapsone, methotrexate, and rituximab, she developed a persistent leg ulcer (Fig 1, B) and recurrence of her right-eye conjunctivitis when her prednisone was tapered off. Dapsone and methotrexate were then discontinued, and she was trialed on tacrolimus 3 mg orally twice daily. The addition of tacrolimus resulted in the resolution of ocular and cutaneous lesions over 6 months and spared her from additional systemic steroids (Figs 2, A and 2, B). She continued rituximab for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and resumed oral dapsone for a dermatitis herpetiformis flare. Three years after her SS diagnosis, the patient continues to do well with no exacerbations of SS, including ocular involvement, and no side effects from combination immunosuppressive therapy.

### The March toward rational therapeutics in children [^115h7egQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Although children suffer from many of the same diseases as adults, the majority of drugs are not approved for pediatric use. This places children at risk, either that they will not be treated adequately because of the lack of approved agents or that their physician will be lacking the necessary labeling information to treat appropriately with a given agent. This paper details the slow progress over the last 25 years toward providing pediatric labeling and thus providing children with optimal protection and range of treatment options.

We report a case of periorificial dermatitis caused by suboptimal inhalation of budesonide for asthma. The initial skin lesions presented in the eye surroundings, leading to diagnostic difficulties and treatment of presumed chalazion and staphylococcal folliculitis. After several months, the patient developed perioral papules and pustules and was diagnosed with periorificial dermatitis. He was efficiently treated with topical metronidazole and oral erythromycin.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^111hAnWM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Demographics

Fifty-two (54%) patients had asymmetry in diagnoses and slit lamp findings. Diagnoses including blepharitis, BKC, chalazion, corneal ulcer, and marginal keratitis were not associated with worse initial or final BCVA (Table 2). Corneal stromal scarring, was associated with worse initial BCVA (OR 7.3 with 95% CI [2.1, 27.2]), but not final BCVA (OR 3.7 with 95% CI[0.8, 16.0]). In contrast, superficial keratitis was associated with worse final BCVA (OR 15.8 with 95% CI[2.1, 123.9), but not initial BCVA (OR 3.3 with 95% CI[0.4, 18.3). There was no association between erythromycin ointment or topical steroids with initial or final BCVA. Oral antibiotics were associated with worse initial BCVA (OR 3.6 with 95% CI [1.3, 11.10], but not final BCVA (OR 2.7 with 95% CI [0.8, 9.4]). The number of chalazion/hordeolum surgeries was not associated with initial or final BCVA (p = 0.87, p = 0.91).

### The usefulness of diathermy thermocoagulation in chalazion surgery [^1153XcnX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the usefulness of diathermy thermocoagulation in chalazion surgery.

Methods

This prospective, observational study included 30 sides from 24 patients who underwent chalazion surgery using diathermy thermocoagulation. The eyelid was fixed with a chalazion clamp under local anesthesia. The skin or palpebral conjunctiva was incised, and the chalazion was partially curetted. The residual chalazion contents were coagulated with diathermy and detached from the surrounding tissues using forceps and scissors. Then, the residual chalazion contents were completely removed.

Results

The chalazion was not palpable in all cases 1 week postoperatively. A small chalazion redeveloped close to the primary lesion 2 weeks postoperatively in one patient; however, it spontaneously improved. No other cases experienced recurrence or complication during the follow-up periods.

Conclusion

Thermocoagulation of chalazion contents using diathermy facilitates grasp, dissection, and excision of chalazion contents.

### Pediatric orbital lesions: non-neoplastic extraocular soft-tissue lesions [^111LVurn]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Orbital pathologies can be broadly classified as ocular, extraocular soft-tissue (non-neoplastic and neoplastic), osseous, and traumatic. In this paper, we discuss the key imaging features and differential diagnoses of congenital and developmental lesions (dermoid cyst, dermolipoma), infective and inflammatory pathologies (pre-septal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, optic neuritis, chalazion, thyroid ophthalmopathy, orbital pseudotumor), and non-neoplastic vascular anomalies (venous malformation, lymphatic malformation, carotid-cavernous fistula), emphasizing the key role of CT and MRI in the imaging work-up. In addition, we highlight the adjunctive role of ocular ultrasound in the diagnosis of dermoid cyst and chalazion, and discuss the primary role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of vascular malformations.

### Idiopathic facial aseptic granuloma: review of an evolving clinical entity [^1167BsEQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic facial aseptic granuloma (IFAG), originally termed pyodermite froide du visage, describes a generally asymptomatic facial nodule presenting in childhood with clinical resemblance to pyoderma or cystic, granulomatous, or vascular lesions. Clinical understanding is constantly evolving, with recent observations indicating that IFAG may represent a subtype of childhood rosacea. We present a case of IFAG associated with eyelid chalazions in a 19-month-old boy. Although his clinical course paralleled previously reported IFAG cases, we observed a unique ultrasound variation during initial diagnostic examination. Further delineation of clinical, imaging, and histologic properties of IFAG may reveal insights into etiologic associations and ideal management.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^113wRHud]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data including demographic information, medical and ocular history, ophthalmic diagnoses, examination findings, and BKC treatments were collected at initial presentation (baseline), 6-month, 1-year, and successive annual increments until disease clearance or final follow-up. Unilateral refractive amblyopia was defined as > 2 line interocular difference in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) due to anisometropia (hyperopic, myopic, or astigmatic). Bilateral refractive amblyopia secondary to high hyperopia (> + 3.00), high myopia (< -6.00), or high astigmatism (> + 2.00) was defined as BCVA less than 20/25 in both eyes. In addition, history of eye and eyelid surgeries (e.g. chalazion incision and drainage) was recorded. BCVA for each eye was measured with age-appropriate optotypes (e.g. LEA figures, HOTV, or Snellen) and then converted into LogMAR format. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by iCare tonometry (Icare USA, Inc, Raleigh, NC) or Tonopen (Reichert, Depew, NY). Cycloplegic refraction was performed by retinoscopy and when age-appropriate fine-tuned in the phoropter. Slit lamp findings included MGD, punctate epithelial erosions/superficial punctate keratopathy (PEE/SPK) as identified by fluorescein staining, eyelid scurf, chalazion/hordeolum, corneal infiltrates, corneal neovascularization, and corneal stromal scarring. Treatments such as eyelid hygiene (e.g. warm compresses, eyelid scrubs), erythromycin ointment, topical steroids, and oral antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, doxycycline) were recorded.

### Accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of chalazion [^11338uhc]. Eye (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

A chalazion, localized lipogranulomatous inflammation of the eyelid, may simulate various eyelid lesions. This study was conducted to determine the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of chalazion and demonstrate the importance of histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis.

Methods

Histopathological diagnoses of 1060 cases with the clinical diagnosis of chalazion, submitted to the Henry C Witelson Ophthalmic Pathology Laboratory and Registry between September 1993 and December 2001, were retrospectively evaluated. Discrepancies between clinical and histopathological diagnoses were classified.

Results

A total of 1033 (97.4%) of the 1060 cases were clinically diagnosed as primary and the remaining 27 (2.6%) as recurrent chalazions. Agreement was noted between clinical and histopathological diagnoses in 992 (93.6%) cases. Of the 68 (6.4%) clinically misdiagnosed cases, 15 (1.4%) were found to be malignant, two (0.2%) premalignant, and 51 (4.8%) benign conditions. Sebaceous cell carcinoma was the most commonly missed malignancy (12 cases, 1.1%) followed by basal cell carcinoma (three cases, 0.3%). Premalignant lesions, which masqueraded as chalazion, were chronic inflammation with cellular atypia and mitotic figures (two cases, 0.2%). Of these 17 cases with premalignant and malignant histopathologies, only six (35.3%) had a clinical diagnosis of recurrent chalazion, whereas the others (64.7%) were primary cases. Of the various benign conditions that were misdiagnosed as chalazion, different types of chronic inflammation (24 cases, 2.2%) were the most frequent.

Conclusions

A number of different benign, premalignant, and malignant conditions may clinically masquerade as a chalazion. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of sebaceous cell carcinoma, which is the most frequently missed malignancy, may be life threatening for the patient. Therefore, all chalazion specimens, primary or recurrent, should be submitted for histopathological examination.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112u5r9f]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis — intense pulsed light (IPL) for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is described as a noncoherent polychromatic light source with a broad wavelength spectrum of 500 to 1200 nm and is used for MGD, though the exact mechanism is unclear; several groups have reported that IPL improved meibomian gland function and dry eye symptoms, including one small independent 28-patient contralateral eye study showing improved symptoms and tear quality, but this treatment is not covered by insurance, is relatively costly, and has to be repeated. IPL should be used with caution in more darkly pigmented individuals (above Fitzpatrick skin type IV) because burns and pigmentation changes can occur. In one study, IPL had a high Demodex eradication rate and improved Ocular Surface Disease Index score, tear break-up time, and meibum quality compared with topical in-office tea tree oil on 30 and 60 days post-treatment. IPL plus meibomian gland expression was found to be superior to meibomian gland expression alone in patients with moderate-to-severe blepharoconjunctivitis signs and symptoms, low-energy IPL has been found to be effective and safe for moderate to severe blepharitis in children, and retrospective reports indicate IPL with meibomian gland expression can be used as a nonsurgical treatment option for recurrent multiple chalazia; although evidence is insufficient for rosacea, one small study showed clinical benefit and improvement of some signs of rosacea-associated MGD.

### Idiopathic facial aseptic granuloma in a child: a possible expression of childhood rosacea [^113yYHti]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic facial aseptic granuloma is a chronic, benign, and painless facial nodule occurring exclusively in childhood. Its pathogenesis is unclear, although some interesting hypotheses have been advanced. On the basis of the relationship existing between this disease and recurrent chalazions and conjunctivitis, we hypothesize that it could be considered to be a possible marker of childhood rosacea.

### Chalazion in a patient with multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib [^115yGLcU]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

We present a case of a woman in her early 60s with multiple myeloma who, while undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD), noticed a whitish nodular swelling on the eyelid. This occurred after one cycle of CyBorD and on subsequent treatment, it also involved the contralateral eyelid. The lesions were initially managed with conservative measures by applying warm compresses, but the lesions progressively increased in size. CyBorD was discontinued and topical antibiotics and anti-inflammatories were initiated, resulting in a decrease in size of the lesions. On resolution of symptoms, she was rechallenged with CyBorD, and symptoms did not recur. The temporal relationship between bortezomib and the development of chalazion is based on connection and no association has been proven.

### Oral azithromycin versus oral doxycycline in the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112fiuU4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral doxycycline has been documented to elicit systemic adverse events when administered for the treatment of MGD, including gastrointestinal, dermatological, and allergic events. Conversely, oral azithromycin has been reported as a well-tolerated medication with a lower incidence of systemic side effects. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that our study revealed a reduced occurrence of systemic adverse events in the azithromycin group compared to the doxycycline group, with consistent findings across the study population. Additionally, the subgroup analysis focusing on gastrointestinal side effects demonstrated a similarly diminished occurrence in the azithromycin group.

Despite the high heterogeneity observed in this meta-analysis, it is important to note that all the studies included in the analysis exhibited comparable baseline characteristics and low risk of bias and employed similar assessment tools and scores for measuring the impact of the intervention on MGD. The underlying causes of this observed heterogeneity in the assessment scores remain incompletely understood; however, it is plausible that variations in therapeutic dosage, frequency, and duration across the included studies may have contributed to the pooled results being influenced. Furthermore, another factor that could have potentially influenced the results of our analysis is the early effect of azithromycin on the sign score in the initial 2–3 months, as demonstrated in studies by Kashkouli et al and Bendeti et al. These studies provide evidence of a potential temporal variation in the efficacy of azithromycin treatment for MGD.

As mentioned before, MGD is a chronic disease that is usually managed with conservative treatment such as lid hygiene, lubrication, or warm compressors as first line therapy. There are multiple treatment options that can be used as an adjunctive treatment if the oral administration of antibiotics is contraindicated such as intraductal meibomian gland probing, topical N-acetyl-cysteine, omega-3 essential fatty acids, or topical cyclosporine A. A new treatment approach that worth mentioning is the intense pulsed light (IPL), which work as adjunctive treatment to improve the signs and symptoms of MGD, and can be used if oral antibiotics are contraindicated. IPL can also be combined with the oral doxycycline to decrease the recurrence of chalazion and improve the MGD. However, no studies have mentioned the use of oral azithromycin with IPL treatment.

### Surgical interventions for bilateral congenital cataract in children aged two years and under… [^111QoRpr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital cataracts are lens opacities in one or both eyes of babies or children present at birth. These may cause a reduction in vision severe enough to require surgery. Cataracts are proportionally the most treatable cause of visual loss in childhood, and are a particular problem in low-income countries, where early intervention may not be possible. Paediatric cataracts provide different challenges to those in adults. Intense inflammation, amblyopia (vision is obstructed by cataract from birth which prevents normal development of the visual system), posterior capsule opacification and uncertainty about the final trajectory of ocular growth parameters can affect results of treatment. Two options currently considered for children under 2 years of age with bilateral congenital cataracts are: (i) intraocular lens (IOL) implantation; or (ii) leaving a child with primary aphakia (no lens in the eye), necessitating the need for contact lenses or aphakic glasses. Other important considerations regarding surgery include the prevention of visual axis opacification (VAO), glaucoma and the route used to perform lensectomy.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of infant cataract surgery or lensectomy to no surgery for bilateral congenital cataracts in children aged 2 years and under.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 25 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared infant cataract surgery or lensectomy to no surgery, in children with bilateral congenital cataracts aged 2 years and younger. This update (of a review published in 2001 and updated in 2006) does not include children over 2 years of age because they have a wider variety of aetiologies, and are therefore managed differently, and have contrasting outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Two review authors extracted data independently. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using RoB 1 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria with each trial comparing a different aspect of surgical intervention for this condition. The trials included a total of 79 participants under 2 years of age, were conducted in India and follow-up ranged from 1 to 5 years. Study participants and outcome assessors were not masked in these trials. One study (60 children) compared primary IOL implantation with primary aphakia. The results from this study suggest that there may be little or no difference in visual acuity at 5 years comparing children with pseudophakia (mean logMAR 0.50) and aphakia (mean logMAR 0.59) (mean difference (MD) -0.09 logMAR, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) -0.24 to 0.06; 54 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain as to the effect of IOL implantation compared with aphakia on visual axis opacification (VAO) (risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% CI 0.23 to 7.13; 54 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The trial investigators did not report on the cases of amblyopia. There was little evidence of a difference betwen the two groups in cases of glaucoma at 5 years follow-up (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.10; 54 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Cases of retinal detachment and reoperation rates were not reported. The impact of IOL implantation on adverse effects is very uncertain because of the sparse data available: of the children who were pseudophakic, 1/29 needed a trabeculectomy and 8/29 developed posterior synechiae. In comparison, no trabeculectomies were needed in the aphakic group and 2/25 children had posterior synechiae (54 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The second study (14 eyes of 7 children under 2 years of age) compared posterior optic capture of IOL without vitrectomy versus endocapsular implantations with anterior vitrectomy (commonly called 'in-the-bag surgery'). The authors did not report on visual acuity, amblyopia, glaucoma and reoperation rate. They had no cases of VAO in either group. The evidence is very uncertain as to the effect of in-the-bag implantation in children aged under 1 year. There was a higher incidence of inflammatory sequelae: 4/7 in-the-bag implantation eyes and 1/7 in optic capture eyes (P = 0.04, 7 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We graded the certainty of evidence as low or very low for imprecision in all outcomes because their statistical analysis reported that a sample size of 13 was needed in each group to achieve a power of 80%, whereas their subset of children under the age of 1 year had only 7 eyes in each group. The third study (24 eyes of 12 children) compared a transcorneal versus pars plana route using a 25-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy system. The evidence is very uncertain as to the effect of the route chosen on the incidence of VAO, with no cases reported at 1 year follow-up in either group. The investigators did not report on visual acuity, amblyopia, glaucoma, retinal detachment and reoperation rate. The pars plana route had the adverse effects of posterior capsule rupture in 2/12 eyes, and 1/12 eyes needing sutures. Conversely, 1/12 eyes operated on by the transcorneal route needed sutures. We graded the outcomes with very low-certainty because of the small sample size and the absence of a priori sample size calculation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no high level evidence for the effectiveness of one type of surgery for bilateral congenital cataracts over another, or whether surgery itself is better than primary aphakia. Further RCTs are required to inform modern practice about concerns, including the timing of surgery, age at which surgery should be undertaken, age for implantation of an IOL and development of complications, such as reoperations, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Standardising the methods used to measure visual function, along with objective monitoring of compliance with the use of aphakic glasses/contact lenses would greatly improve the quality of study data and enable more reliable interpretation of outcomes.

### Prevalence of low serum vitamin a levels in young children with chalazia in southwest China [^112fz4PA]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To detect risk factors that may be related to chalazia in children in southwest China.

Design

Prospective case-control study.

Methods

The case group, 88 children with chalazia, was divided into 2 subgroups. One had 48 children 6 months to 6 years of age (defined as young children), and the other had 40 children 7 to 12 years of age (defined as older children). The control group consisted of 40 young children and 32 older children. Clinical findings for patients were recorded. Serum was tested for concentrations of vitamin A, vitamin D3, and immunoglobulin E.

Results

World Health Organization definitions were used for vitamin A deficiency (< 0.7 μmol/L) and marginal vitamin A deficiency (0.7 to 1.05 μmol/L). The average level of serum vitamin A in the case group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < .001). Analyses failed to find significant differences in vitamin D3 or immunoglobulin E levels between the case and control groups. The average vitamin A level in young children with multiple chalazia (0.65 ± 0.12 μmol/L) was low. Blepharitis was less prevalent than low serum vitamin A levels in the young child subgroup (odds ratios, 8.5 and 96.9, respectively), but higher than in older children (odds ratios, 17.5 and 9.0, respectively).

Conclusions

Low serum vitamin A is associated with a chalazion in young children in southwest China, especially young children with multiple chalazia.

### The usefulness of diathermy thermocoagulation in chalazion surgery [^111kWZWC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Our study includes 30 sides (16 right upper eyelids; 4 right lower eyelids; 8 left upper eyelids; 2 left lower eyelids) from 24 patients (10 males and 14 females; mean age, 39.0 years; age range, 22–65 years). Transconjunctival and transcutaneous approaches were performed on 11 and 19 sides, respectively. The average duration from the onset of symptoms to surgery was 3.1 months (range, 0.5–12 months).

The chalazion was not palpable in all cases 1 week postoperatively (Figure 1). A small chalazion developed close to the primary lesion 2 weeks postoperatively in one patient, which was resolved spontaneously. Afterward, no recurrence occurred within 3 months postoperatively. Any complications, including wound infection, wound dehiscence, madarosis, excess bleeding, decreased vision, and ocular surface damage, were not observed in the patients. Pathological examinations of all specimens confirmed the diagnosis of chalazion showing lipogranuloma with inflammatory cells. None of the patients were pathologically diagnosed with sebaceous gland carcinoma.

### Treatment of atopic dermatitis-AAP… [^114oUvfv]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

- **Infants**: Use a low-potency preparation.
- **Young children**: Use a low-potency preparation or, if necessary, a mid-potency preparation.
- **Older children and adolescents**: Use a mid-potency preparation; a high-potency agent may be needed for resistant, non-facial areas during a flare. Generally, a topical corticosteroid is prescribed for 2 to 3 weeks. The family should be instructed to contact the physician if no improvement occurs in that time. Treatment failure can be due to
- Too low of a potency for the age of the child and skin site
- Incorrect application of treatment by the family
- Bacterial infection.
- **Diagnosis**: usually made clinically with confirmation by polymerase chain reaction testing or viral culture of vesicular fluid
- Treatment
- Acyclovir administered orally or intravenously for 7 to 10 days.
- Because recurrences are common, daily antiviral prophylaxis may be warranted. Janus kinase pathway inhibitors
- Ruxolitinib 1. 5% topical cream was approved in September 2021 for use in children 12 years and older. It is intended for short-term use for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, for not more than 20% of body surface area, and not to exceed 60 g per week.
- **Methotrexate**: A low-cost, off-label option for long-term symptom control of severe atopic dermatitis, methotrexate is well-tolerated in children.

Gastrointestinal distress is the most common side effect; folic acid supplementation may be considered to mitigate the antagonistic effect on folic acid. Subcutaneous delivery is better tolerated than oral delivery. Methotrexate is usually given only once per week and requires blood work monitoring.
