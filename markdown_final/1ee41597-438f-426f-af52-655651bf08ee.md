## Question

How should hypercalcemia be evaluated in a primary care setting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hypercalcemia should be evaluated in a primary care setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypercalcemia and classifying severity. Then, I should map the diagnostic branch based on intact PTH. Next, I will delineate PTH-mediated versus non–PTH-mediated pathways, including special scenarios like normocalcemic PHPT and pregnancy. After that, I need to specify referral thresholds, monitoring, and follow-up. Finally, I will emphasize key takeaways and acute management pearls, ensuring each point is anchored to high-credibility guidance where possible [^115mxSJ5] [^111f3qBb] [^115WdPx8].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality before anchoring a diagnosis. I need to repeat serum calcium to exclude lab error and use albumin-corrected total calcium or, if available and especially when albumin is abnormal or NHPT is suspected, ionized calcium to verify true hypercalcemia; I should also classify severity because severe hypercalcemia (generally > 14 mg/dL or > 3.5 mmol/L) changes urgency and management, and that threshold is consistent with Endocrine Society guidance for hypercalcemia of malignancy [^115mxSJ5] [^111f3qBb].

> Next, I should take a focused history and perform a targeted exam. I need to check for symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, neurocognitive changes, nephrolithiasis, and bone pain; I should verify medication contributors like thiazides, lithium, calcium or vitamin D supplements, and review malignancy red flags or family history suggestive of familial disease, while on exam I should assess volume status and look for signs of dehydration or bone tenderness; I must be careful not to over-attribute to dehydration or medications without biochemical corroboration, given frequent diagnostic delays in practice [^111ct6Gh] [^116SKEqF] [^111Pk86F].

> I will now order a core laboratory panel to establish the diagnostic fork. Intact PTH is the critical branching test, and I should obtain adjusted total calcium or ionized calcium, phosphorus, creatinine with CrCl or eGFR, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and consider magnesium, since vitamin D deficiency and renal insufficiency can secondarily elevate PTH and confound interpretation; I should confirm any abnormalities on at least two occasions if the picture is equivocal, particularly when NHPT is under consideration [^113LrxeF] [^115mxSJ5] [^114vqPTs].

> Now, let me interpret the PTH level carefully and avoid premature closure. If PTH is elevated or inappropriately normal in the setting of confirmed hypercalcemia, that points toward primary hyperparathyroidism after I exclude secondary drivers such as vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney disease; I should replete vitamin D and then re-check after 3–6 months if deficiency is present, because uncorrected deficiency can mask or mimic PHPT biology; once PHPT is likely, I need baseline skeletal and renal risk assessment with DEXA at lumbar spine, hip, and distal one-third radius, renal imaging for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and a 24-hour urine calcium with Ca/Cr clearance ratio to evaluate for FHH, where a ratio < 0.01 suggests FHH though there is overlap; I should refrain from ordering localization imaging in primary care, because diagnosis is biochemical and localization should be directed by the operating team, typically using ultrasound and sestamibi or advanced modalities as needed [^111H4sYr] [^111aZ7bs] [^115JXTye] [^115DeQBZ] [^115EuFiE] [^112goaqb] [^114LkNyV].

> Hold on, I should also map the suppressed PTH pathway. If PTH is suppressed, I need to consider hypercalcemia of malignancy, vitamin D–mediated etiologies, thyrotoxicosis, adrenal insufficiency, granulomatous disease, milk-alkali syndrome, and drugs; in practice, I should review cancer history, obtain age-appropriate cancer screening, consider PTHrP when humoral malignancy is suspected, and order 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D with chest imaging and ACE if granulomatous disease is on the table, while recognizing that vitamin D intoxication raises 25(OH)D and granulomatous or lymphoma mechanisms raise 1,25(OH)₂D [^111f3qBb] [^117UQjw1] [^116uRQtU].

> I need to consider special diagnostic scenarios so I do not miss atypical presentations. For normocalcemic PHPT, I should confirm normal adjusted and ionized calcium with elevated intact PTH on at least two occasions over 3–6 months, after excluding secondary causes such as vitamin D deficiency, renal impairment, malabsorption, or hypercalciuria; in patients with hypercalciuria and elevated PTH where differentiation from secondary hyperparathyroidism due to idiopathic hypercalciuria is difficult, a thiazide challenge test may aid discrimination and clinical decision-making; in pregnancy, I should manage mild cases with hydration and monitoring and consider second-trimester surgery if calcium is ≥ 11 mg/dL and symptomatic, while planning neonatal monitoring for hypocalcemia if surgery is deferred; if calcium is ≥ 14 mg/dL or there are severe symptoms, I need to arrange emergency care immediately [^114KmBRe] [^111bxVg2] [^116eKQaq] [^116zsMrm] [^117J3Lao] [^111f3qBb].

> Next, I should set clear referral thresholds and destinations. Patients with severe hypercalcemia, symptomatic moderate hypercalcemia, or suspected malignancy require urgent evaluation, often in the ED; confirmed or strongly suspected PHPT, NHPT, complex metabolic pictures, or diagnostic uncertainty warrant endocrinology referral; surgical referral is indicated for symptomatic PHPT or asymptomatic PHPT meeting criteria such as serum calcium > 1 mg/dL above ULN, fragility fracture, nephrolithiasis, T-score ≤ −2.5 at any site, or CrCl < 60 mL/min, with surgery ideally performed by an experienced parathyroid surgeon [^115WdPx8] [^1136SaFb] [^111MsztM].

> Let me outline monitoring when patients do not meet surgical criteria or decline surgery, but I should double-check the recommended cadence. Annual serum calcium and 25(OH)D, with PTH as indicated, plus annual CrCl and clinically indicated renal imaging or 24-hour urine calcium are reasonable; DEXA at three sites every 1–2 years unless BMD is normal, with vertebral imaging as clinically indicated; I need to counsel that a meaningful proportion will progress, as about 27% of conservatively managed patients developed surgical indications over 10 years in observational data, so reassessment each visit is crucial [^1145Xcuv] [^117MfMgy].

> Documentation and education must not be an afterthought, and I should verify gaps known from health system data. I need to explicitly document the workup, differential, rationale for referral, and return precautions, and educate patients that PHPT is often underdiagnosed and undertreated and that adherence to follow-up matters; importantly, PTH testing is underutilized, with only about one-third of hypercalcemic patients receiving PTH testing in large cohorts, which I should aim to correct in my practice [^114xjQLs] [^112jCwYy].

> I should crystallize key takeaways, but let me be careful with wording. Never assume hypercalcemia is underdiagnosed — wait, that's imprecise; what I should say is that primary hyperparathyroidism is frequently underdiagnosed and missed even when both calcium and PTH are elevated, so I need a structured approach and a low threshold to check PTH in confirmed hypercalcemia; additionally, ionized calcium can be more specific than albumin-corrected calcium in mild cases or when albumin is abnormal, so I should use it when available to avoid misclassification [^112jCwYy] [^115q72UJ] [^1137a78P].

> Finally, I need to be ready for acute and adjunctive management while definitive care is arranged. For severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia, isotonic IV hydration is first-line while awaiting antiresorptive effects; calcitonin offers rapid, short-lived reduction, and IV bisphosphonates or denosumab are recommended for hypercalcemia of malignancy, with therapy tailored to renal function and, in some cases, denosumab preferred; in parathyroid carcinoma with refractory hypercalcemia, a calcimimetic and antiresorptives should be considered; in life-threatening, refractory cases, dialysis may be necessary [^1165qPtd] [^111f3qBb] [^114bM9tf] [^111PoG78] [^116M4fpB].

---

The primary care workup for elevated calcium should start with **repeat calcium testing** to confirm true hypercalcemia and exclude lab error [^111ct6Gh], then **measure PTH** to distinguish PTH-mediated from non–PTH-mediated causes [^114vqPTs]. Next, check **25-hydroxyvitamin D**, creatinine/eGFR, and phosphorus [^113LrxeF]; obtain a **24-hour urine calcium** to differentiate PHPT from FHH (CCCR < 0.01 suggests FHH) [^111aZ7bs] [^115DeQBZ]. If **PTH is low**, order **PTHrP**, 25(OH)D, and 1,25(OH)₂D to evaluate for malignancy or granulomatous disease [^117UQjw1] [^116uRQtU]. Review medications, supplements, and family history [^115u3zma], and refer to endocrinology or oncology if PHPT, malignancy, or other complex causes are suspected.

---

## Step 1: confirm true hypercalcemia

To confirm true hypercalcemia, **repeat testing** should verify the elevation by correcting total calcium for albumin or measuring ionized calcium to exclude lab error or pseudohypercalcemia [^113jGG36]. Also, **exclude pseudohypercalcemia** by identifying elevated total calcium with normal ionized calcium in high protein states (e.g. multiple myeloma).

---

## Step 2: initial laboratory evaluation

- **Parathyroid hormone (PTH)**: Measure intact PTH to distinguish PTH-mediated from non–PTH-mediated hypercalcemia [^115mxSJ5].

- **Vitamin D status**: Measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D to assess deficiency or excess [^111H4sYr].

- **Renal function**: Check serum creatinine and eGFR to evaluate renal involvement or secondary hyperparathyroidism [^111aZ7bs].

- **Phosphorus**: Measure serum phosphorus; low-normal or low phosphorus supports PHPT [^116DmzkM].

---

## Step 3: differentiate PTH-mediated from non–PTH-mediated hypercalcemia

| **PTH level** | **Likely etiology** | **Next steps** |
|-|-|-|
| Elevated or inappropriately normal | - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) <br/> - Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) <br/> - Tertiary hyperparathyroidism | - 24-hour urine calcium <br/> - Calcium-creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) <br/> - Parathyroid imaging if surgery considered [^112goaqb] [^114vqPTs] |
| Suppressed | - Malignancy (PTHrP-mediated) <br/> - Vitamin D intoxication <br/> - Granulomatous disease <br/> - Medications (thiazides, lithium) | - PTHrP <br/> - 25(OH)D <br/> - 1,25(OH)₂D [^117UQjw1] <br/> - Malignancy workup [^116uRQtU] <br/> - Medication review [^111ct6Gh] |

---

## Step 4: 24-hour urine calcium and calcium-creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR)

A **24-hour urine calcium** helps differentiate PHPT from FHH; PHPT usually shows elevated urine calcium, whereas FHH has low urine calcium [^111aZ7bs]. The **CCCR** is interpreted as follows: < 0.01 suggests FHH, 0.01–0.02 is indeterminate, and > 0.02 supports PHPT [^115DeQBZ].

---

## Step 5: medication and supplement review

As part of the medication and supplement review, **medications** to assess include thiazide diuretics, lithium, and calcium or vitamin D supplements, which can cause or worsen hypercalcemia [^111ct6Gh].

---

## Step 6: imaging studies (if indicated)

- **Parathyroid imaging**: Use cervical ultrasound or sestamibi scan if PHPT is confirmed and surgery is considered; imaging is for localization, not diagnosis [^112goaqb] [^115EuFiE].

- **Renal imaging**: Obtain renal ultrasound or CT if nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis is suspected [^115JXTye].

- **Malignancy workup**: If malignancy is suspected, consider chest X-ray, CT, or PET-CT based on clinical context [^116uRQtU].

---

## Step 7: referral to specialists

- **Endocrinology**: Refer if PHPT, FHH, or other endocrine causes are suspected.

- **Oncology**: Refer if malignancy-related hypercalcemia is suspected.

- **Nephrology**: Refer if significant renal impairment or nephrolithiasis is present.

---

## Step 8: follow-up and monitoring

For follow-up, **monitoring** should include serum calcium, renal function, and bone density (DEXA) as indicated, with **patient education** on hypercalcemia symptoms and when to seek care [^1145Xcuv].

---

In sum, **confirm hypercalcemia, assess PTH, and stratify by PTH status**, then complete vitamin D, renal/phosphorus labs, 24-hour urine calcium/CCCR, and targeted imaging or referrals as indicated [^113LrxeF].

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The two most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, the acuity of treatment will depend on the severity of the calcium level and symptoms.

In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, steroids, and, rarely, furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria, as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: A clinical review [^115Pifru]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategies. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and examine management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies.

Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1137a78P]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A total of 82 patients with plausible primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to a specialist. Cases with differential diagnoses or other explanations for the imbalance in calcium homeostasis were excluded stepwise after answering a survey and based on the results of new blood tests and an assessment by an experienced endocrine surgeon.

A second sampling of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), ionized calcium, and creatinine was arranged for the remaining cohort of 45 patients. Ionized calcium was chosen for these tests to provide a more specific diagnosis of pHPT in a low-range hypercalcemia compared to the formerly used albumin-corrected serum calcium values. Limits for exclusion were set at the same levels for PTH (≥ 4.3 pmol/L) and creatinine (< 175 mmol/L) as in the first inclusion criteria, and the limit for ionized calcium was set at 1.26 mmol/L (reference 1.13–1.30 mmol/L), corresponding to an albumin-corrected calcium of 2.40 mmol/L. All criteria had to be met before patients continued to be included in the study.

Four patients declined further participation. Patients not fulfilling the criteria after this new blood sample (n = 12) were offered one repeated testing. Ten patients did not meet the criteria this second time or declined further samplings and were excluded. If they fulfilled the criteria at this second new sampling, they were included in the study (n = 2).

Patients in the final study cohort (n = 32) were given outpatient appointments at the Endocrine Surgery Unit of the Department of Surgery, Östersund Hospital. At this point, two patients declined further participation in the study. The remainder of the patients continued with the protocol as planned.

### Calciphylaxis due to hyperparathyroidism [^111mvYdQ]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to discuss when and how to workup calciphylaxis for early diagnosis and to delineate medical versus surgical management of the disease.

- **Methods**: Review of evidence-based medical literature on calciphylaxis due to primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism has been conducted.

- **Results**: Calciphylaxis is usually associated with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. However, it can also be seen in the absence of chronic renal failure and has been reported in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. Calciphylaxis occurs when the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood exceed their solubility, leading to calcium-phosphate deposits in arteries that compromise the vasculature. These ischemic changes result in plaque-like lesions that progress to painful nodules. Calciphylaxis is diagnosed based on physical examination, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings. When medical therapy has failed in the setting of secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism with calciphylaxis, parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment. In primary hyperparathyroidism, early recognition and aggressive wound care with debridement are important in managing this condition. However, resection of the offending parathyroid gland should be strongly considered.

- **Conclusions**: When calciphylaxis is present, early detection is critical to successful management. Although medical therapy can be effective, surgical resection of the diseased parathyroid glands can be curative and potentially life-saving. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for optimal outcomes.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: Differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in patients with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

Hypercalcaemia is commonly seen in the context of parathyroid dysfunction and malignancy and, when severe, can precipitate life-threatening sequelae. The differential of hypercalcaemia is broad and can be categorized based on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The acute management of severe hypercalcaemia is discussed along with a brief review of therapeutic advances in the field.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild pHPT is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage, which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage, but even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period.

Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and PTH as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients.

Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and for those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and development of organ damage should be offered.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop [^113jGG36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

- **Participants**: This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

- **Evidence**: Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) both second- and third-generation PTH assays are helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the Fifth International Workshop [^114KmBRe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism by confirming normal adjusted total calcium and normal ionized calcium levels, along with elevated intact PTH levels. This should be done using either a second or third generation assay on at least two occasions over 3–6 months, after excluding all alternative causes for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Hypercalcemia in the ED: prevalence, etiology, and outcome [^114kKjXg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence, demographic, clinical characteristics, and etiologies of hypercalcemia in emergency department patients.

In this retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study, all patients admitted between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2011, to the emergency department of Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, were screened for the presence of hypercalcemia, defined as a serum calcium exceeding 2.55 mmol/L after correction for serum albumin. Demographic, laboratory, and outcome data were gathered. A detailed medical record review was performed to identify causes of hypercalcemia.

During the study period, 14,984 patients (19% of all admitted patients) received a measurement of serum calcium. Of these, 116 patients (0.7%) presented with hypercalcemia. The median serum calcium was 2.72 mmol/L (first quartile, 2.64; third quartile, 2.88), with 4.3 mmol/L being the maximum serum calcium value observed. Underlying malignancy in 44% of patients and hyperparathyroidism in 20% (12% secondary and 8% primary) were the leading causes of hypercalcemia. Twenty-six percent of patients presented with symptomatic hypercalcemia. Weakness was the most common symptom of hypercalcemia, followed by nausea and disorientation.

Hypercalcemia is a rare but harmful electrolyte disorder in emergency department patients. Unspecific symptoms, such as a change in mental state, weakness, or gastrointestinal symptoms, should prompt physicians to order serum calcium measurements, at least in patients with concerning presentations.

### Evaluation of the thiazide challenge test to differentiate primary from hypercalciuria-related hyperparathyroidism [^111bxVg2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and secondary hyperparathyroidism due to idiopathic hypercalciuria (SHPT-IH) is markedly different. However, robust diagnostic tools to differentiate between both entities are lacking.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the thiazide challenge test (TCT) in clinical practice, its aid in clinical decision-making, and evaluate the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity) and potentially useful parameters of the TCT.

- **Methods**: A monocentric observational retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2017 to November 2023 in an outpatient endocrinology department at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium. Twenty-five adult patients with hypercalciuria, elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), and high-normal or elevated serum calcium underwent a TCT. Outcome measures included serum and urinary biochemical parameters before and after testing, as well as clinical and imaging outcomes, treatment, and follow-up.

- **Results**: Patients with a TCT-based working diagnosis of PHPT showed greater increases in albumin-adjusted calcium and total serum calcium concentration than patients with SHPT-IH (+0.11 ± 0.10 vs. +0.0071 ± 0.10 mmol/L; p = 0.025 and +0.14 ± 0.12 vs. +0.012 ± 0.15 mmol/L; p = 0.024, respectively). The TCT-based working diagnosis of PHPT demonstrated a sensitivity of 81.8%, a specificity of 77.8%, and a likelihood ratio of 3.68 for estimating a correct final diagnosis. Urinary calcium excretion, PTH, calcium-phosphorous ratio, PTH inhibition rate, and the parathyroid function index did not differ significantly in patients with PHPT compared with those with SHPT-IH.

- **Conclusion**: The TCT aids in the differentiation and management of hyperparathyroidism, specifically in distinguishing between PHPT and SHPT-IH, offering a high degree of accuracy in diagnosis.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: An update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood due to a lack of long-term health outcomes concerning both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism.

Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and the overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

- **Identification with SPECT and CT**: The identification of abnormal parathyroid tissue is enhanced with SPECT in combination with CT and is particularly valuable in repeat surgical cases.

- **Ultrasound and scintigraphy tools**: Ultrasound and (99m)Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy continue to be useful localization tools; however, they can miss small adenomas and hyperplasia.

- **Additional imaging for difficult cases**: Additional imaging or localization tools for patients failing surgery or suspected of having an ectopic parathyroid gland include CT, MRI, C-methionine PET/CT, and parathyroid scintigraphy. Obtain selective venous sampling only when required for remedial exploration.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. During 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, after new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, and this contributes to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients who present with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation, if these are properly searched for. It is still not clear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcaemia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid, and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, medications, and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^113gWFLf]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data from 92 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism was identified in a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital. The data were collected during 2014, and all patients had been referred to or primarily managed by a specialist.

Median laboratory values were compared in two groups of patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism. These patients were identified in a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital. Patients who had been assessed by a specialist were compared with those who had not been evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U test for significance.

The 82 patients not assessed by a specialist were invited to answer a survey investigating prior medication, comorbidity, and body mass index. From this survey, 12 patients with medications such as thiazides, calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates, which could possibly influence serum calcium and PTH levels, were identified and excluded. Additionally, seven patients with a BMI ≥ 30 were also excluded. Moreover, two individuals had died, and four cases were considered too severely ill with multiple diseases, making them unsuitable for treatment or further investigation of their hyperparathyroidism. Three patients declined further participation, four did not reply to the invitation, and three had moved to other parts of the country and were lost to follow-up. Another two patients had been diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism and consequently cared for. All these cases were excluded from the study cohort.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

In this review, an evidence-based summary of this disorder is provided, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our understanding of the disease. PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis.

Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts about its management and understanding.

### Vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia: Mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment [^117UQjw1]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia occurs in up to 4% of the population in association with malignancy, primary hyperparathyroidism, ingestion of excessive calcium and/or vitamin D, ectopic production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], and impaired degradation of 1,25(OH)₂D. The ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin D₃ (or vitamin D₂) results in hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria due to the formation of supraphysiological amounts of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] that bind to the vitamin D receptor, albeit with lower affinity than the active form of the vitamin, 1,25(OH)₂D, and the formation of 5,6-trans 25(OH)D, which binds to the vitamin D receptor more tightly than 25(OH)D.

In patients with granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis and tumors such as lymphomas, hypercalcemia occurs as a result of the activity of ectopic 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) expressed in macrophages or tumor cells and the formation of excessive amounts of 1,25(OH)₂D. Recent work has identified a novel cause of non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia that occurs when the degradation of 1,25(OH)₂D is impaired as a result of mutations of the 1,25(OH)₂D-24-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (CYP24A1).

Patients with biallelic and, in some instances, monoallelic mutations of the CYP24A1 gene have elevated serum calcium concentrations associated with elevated serum 1,25(OH)₂D, suppressed PTH concentrations, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and on occasion, reduced bone density. Notably, first-time calcium renal stone formers have elevated 1,25(OH)₂D and evidence of impaired degradation.

### Testing for primary hyperparathyroidism in 17,491 patients with hypercalcemia [^112jCwYy]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is underdiagnosed and associated with many adverse health effects. Historically, many hypercalcemic patients have not received parathyroid hormone (PTH) testing; however, the underlying reasons are uncertain. Our goals are to determine the PTH testing rate among hypercalcemic individuals at a large academic health system and to assess characteristics associated with testing versus not testing for PHPT to inform future strategies for closing testing gaps.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included adult patients with ≥ 1 elevated serum calcium result between 2018 and 2022. Based on the presence or absence of a serum PTH result, individuals were classified as "screened" versus "unscreened" for PHPT. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups were compared.

- **Results**: The sample comprised 17,491 patients: 6,567 male (37.5%) and 10,924 female (62.5%), with a mean age of 59 years. PTH testing was performed in 6,096 (34.9%). Characteristics independently associated with the greatest odds of screening were 5+ elevated calcium results (odds ratio [OR] 5.02, P < 0.0001), serum calcium > 12.0 mg/dL (OR 2.48, P < 0.0001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.42, P < 0.0001). Characteristics associated with the lowest odds of screening were age < 35 years (OR 0.60, P < 0.0001), death during the study period (OR 0.68, P < 0.0001), age ≥ 85 years (OR 0.70, P = 0.0007), and depression (OR 0.84; P = 0.0081).

- **Conclusions**: Only 35% of hypercalcemic patients received PTH testing. Although the presence of PHPT-associated morbidity was observed, further conclusions were hindered due to incomplete data.

### Hypercalcemic crisis [^1158y4CC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may decompensate from a more or less chronic status into a critical and life-threatening condition: hypercalcemic crisis. In the majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is the cause, while humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or rarer conditions of hypercalcemia will decompensate less often. The leading symptoms that characterize the crisis are oliguria and anuria, as well as somnolence and coma. After a hypercalcemic crisis is recognized, an emergency diagnostic program must be followed to either prove or exclude primary hyperparathyroidism. In the first case, surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid a fatal outcome. The diagnostic program should be performed within hours; during this time, serum calcium should be lowered. The treatment of choice is hemodialysis against a calcium-free dialysate. Bisphosphonates could be useful as adjuvant drugs.

### Parathyroid disorders [^111ct6Gh]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems.

Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination; repeat measurement of serum calcium level; and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms; serum calcium and creatinine levels; and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol) replacement.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^115q72UJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A surprisingly large portion (n = 82) of the 365 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to specialists, despite the lack of differential diagnosis or other reasons to exclude the patient from treatment. However, eleven patients had a long-term plan of follow-up or were diagnosed with pHPT by the physician ordering the initial blood tests. A total of 42 patients underwent new blood sampling, and 32 of them still had an imbalance of calcium and PTH. Ultimately, 23 patients (28% of those not referred to a specialist) were formally diagnosed with pHPT by an endocrine surgeon.

It is important to remember that patients were excluded stepwise without further investigation, thus, the number of patients with established pHPT but without proper medical management might be higher. Patients with mild pHPT will be subjected to further characterization regarding symptoms and complications due to pHPT, and the results will be published in a forthcoming report.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^116PPaUD]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in ambulatory patients. The condition is most common in postmenopausal women, although it can occur in individuals of all ages, including pregnant women. If symptoms are present, they are attributable to hypercalcemia and may include weakness, easy fatigability, anorexia, and anxiety. However, most individuals have no symptoms, and primary hyperparathyroidism is usually diagnosed after an elevated serum calcium level is incidentally found on multiphasic chemistry panel testing. Persistent hypercalcemia and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone level are the diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism.

Other causes of hypercalcemia are rare and are usually associated with low (or sometimes normal) parathyroid hormone levels. Malignancy is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients. Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. When performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, the procedure has success rates of 90 to 95 percent and a low rate of complications. Asymptomatic patients who decline surgery and meet criteria for medical management must commit to conscientious long-term monitoring. Any unexplained elevation of the serum calcium level should be evaluated promptly to prevent complications from hypercalcemia.

Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117Uskx7]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with biochemically determined, mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are not investigated or followed up properly. The high proportion of patients presenting with biochemically determined, mild pHPT underlines the importance of providing local instructions to ensure that patients are investigated and followed up according to the most recent international guidelines.

### Failure to diagnose and treat hyperparathyroidism among patients with hypercalcemia: Opportunities for intervention at the patient and physician level to increase surgical referral [^111Pk86F]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, but the reasons for these deficiencies have not been described. The purpose of this study was to identify reasons for underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hyperparathyroidism that could be addressed by targeted interventions.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 3,200 patients with hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 10.5 mg/dL) who had parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels evaluated at our institution from 2011 to 2016. We randomly sampled 60 patients and divided them into three groups based on their PTH levels. Two independent reviewers examined clinical notes and diagnostic data to identify reasons for delayed diagnosis or referral for treatment.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 16.5 years; 68% were women, and 55% were white. Fifty percent of patients had ≥ 1 elevated calcium that was missed by their primary care provider. Hypercalcemia was frequently attributed to causes other than hyperparathyroidism, including diuretics (12%), calcium supplements (12%), dehydration (5%), and renal dysfunction (3%). Even when calcium and PTH were both elevated, the diagnosis was missed or delayed in 40% of patients. For 7% of patients, a nonsurgeon stated that surgery offered no benefit; 22% of patients were offered medical treatment or observation, and 8% opted not to see a surgeon. Only 20% of patients were referred for surgical evaluation, and they waited a median of 16 months before seeing a surgeon.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

- **Recent findings**: We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116DmzkM]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

The source of the increase in serum Ca²⁺ varies depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia. In mild-to-moderate disease, both an increase in bone resorption and postprandial calcitriol-mediated intestinal calcium hyperabsorption contribute to the hypercalcemia.

Intestinal calcium transport, which largely takes place in the proximal intestine, occurs by both transcellular and paracellular pathways. The transcellular pathway is a tightly regulated pathway and is increased by 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D. The paracellular pathway can also be regulated by modulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin 2 and claudin 12. Expression of both claudins is increased by 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D, thereby augmenting paracellular calcium transport.

The increase in distal tubular calcium reabsorption plays a greater role in sustaining the hypercalcemia than intestinal calcium absorption does. In the typical patient with mild to moderate PHPT, plasma calcium and PTH levels can remain stable for years. When the hypercalcemia is mild (i.e. less than 11.0 mg/dL [2.75 mmol/L]), patients often have relatively few symptoms. However, when the hypercalcemia is more severe, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, muscle weakness, and impaired mentation can occur. Rarely, a patient may experience sudden worsening of PHPT, known as parathyroid storm or acute hyperparathyroidism.

Although PTH lowers the renal phosphate threshold, frank hypophosphatemia is uncommon in most cases of PHPT. Low-normal phosphate values are commonly seen in PHPT, although it is not as reliable a finding as hypercalcemia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

To review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues relevant to the practicing endocrinologist, the latest information on its presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects is considered.

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels, for whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed.

- **Traditional target organs**: Primary hyperparathyroidism affects the skeleton and kidneys, which remain a focus in patient evaluations. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement, with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared to the lumbar spine, where bone mineral density is generally well maintained.

- **Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects**: These aspects, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for, or against surgery.

- **Surgical recommendations**: Surgery is recommended based on guidelines that focus on serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: Review and recommendations on evaluation, diagnosis, and management. A Canadian and international consensus [^114vqPTs]. Osteoporosis International (2017). High credibility.

For the screening and diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, the CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend confirming the diagnosis if serum calcium is elevated — either total calcium corrected for albumin or elevated ionized calcium — in the presence of an elevated or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH), in the absence of conditions that mimic primary hyperparathyroidism. Such conditions include the use of thiazide diuretics, lithium, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114aSg3C]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

At the Östersund Hospital and in most Swedish laboratories, normal values of albumin-corrected serum calcium range from 2.15 to 2.50 mmol/L and PTH from 1.9 to 6.9 pmol/L. The true ratio between PTH and calcium that correlates with histologically proven pHPT is yet to be established. There are studies including normocalcaemic cases (calcium ≥ 2.1 mmol/L and PTH ≥ 6.9 pmol/L) as well as normohormonal cases (calcium ≥ 2.78 mmol/L and PTH < 4.2 pmol/L). Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that a significant disturbance of calcium homeostasis exists when calcium levels are in the upper part of the normal range together with non-suppressed PTH levels.

To reduce the number of false positive pHPT patients in the final cohort, we have tried to exclude all patients with a plausible other cause of the disturbed balance of serum calcium and PTH. In total, 156 patients were excluded due to possible differential diagnoses during the different steps of exclusion. A suspicion of a differential diagnosis derived from the patients' records or list of medications was deemed reason enough for exclusion. Of course, this approach causes a high risk of excluding patients with mild pHPT. On the other hand, false positive cases are more easily eliminated. The 82 patients not being cared for properly were all asked to voluntarily participate in the coming studies. Only 7 patients declined further participation.

The most common differential diagnosis was sHPT due to renal failure. This was expected, as renal failure is a common disorder and the prevalence of sHPT increases with the degree of renal impairment.

### Clinical review: Rare causes of hypercalcemia [^114AsAaU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Although hypercalcemia is usually caused by primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, a number of other conditions can be important to consider. This review considers unusual causes of hypercalcemia that are generally not found in reviews on this subject.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Articles describing rarely reported associations between hypercalcemia and unusual causes were identified through a computer search of the terms hypercalcemia/etiology and through the references listed in those articles. We grouped the 58 different reports into categories defined by a presumed etiology: increased levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or PTHrP, occult milk-alkali syndrome, and undefined mechanisms. Reports in infants and children are listed separately, as are reports of pseudohypercalcemia, situations that are not truly hypercalcemic because the ionized calcium is normal.

- **Evidence synthesis**: In some situations, as this review points out, a number of unusual causes of hypercalcemia are important to consider. The search for an elusive cause of hypercalcemia is best accomplished by the most likely potential mechanism. An orderly search in this manner is likely to reveal the underlying cause.

- **Conclusions**: That so many patients have been described with rare and usually poorly understood causes of hypercalcemia highlights our incomplete understanding of calcium metabolism in humans and suggests additional areas in which directed clinical investigation might improve our knowledge of the normal metabolism of calcium.

### High ionized calcium in the general population and risk of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115mX5fa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Although it is generally held that in otherwise healthy individuals, primary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely cause of persistent hypercalcemia, solid research supporting this assumption is absent. We aimed to examine the relative and absolute risk of primary hyperparathyroidism associated with an incidental high ionized calcium in the general population.

- **Methods**: We used the Danish Copenhagen General Population Study, a prospective cohort study with inclusion from 2003 to 2015, to investigate the association of ionized calcium on continuous and categorical scales with primary hyperparathyroidism using Cox regression and competing-risk regression. Hazard ratios and absolute 10-year risks of primary hyperparathyroidism were calculated.

- **Results**: In 106,588 individuals, 2,497 (2.5%) had moderately high (1.33–1.40 mmol/L) or high (> 1.40 mmol/L) plasma ionized calcium at baseline, and 441 (0.4%) were diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism during follow-up. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for primary hyperparathyroidism for moderately high and high plasma ionized calcium versus low normal ionized calcium were 65 (95% CI: 46‒92) and 350 (251‒489), respectively. Stratified by sex, the corresponding hazard ratios were 63 (42‒95) and 326 (221‒482) for women and 73 (37‒145) and 490 (256‒935) for men. For women and men above 65 years, absolute risks of primary hyperparathyroidism were 7.9% and 3.3% in those with moderately high plasma ionized calcium, and 44% and 21% in those with high plasma ionized calcium.

- **Conclusions**: High ionized calcium is found in 1:40 individuals in the general population, indicating a notable risk factor for primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: A structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculating adjusted calcium, and a careful history should be taken to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review, we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1125F8xM]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A cohort of 82 patients was identified, all with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) according to preset criteria, with no other explanation for the disturbed calcium homeostasis. Of these 82 patients, 9 had been diagnosed with pHPT and/or had monitoring planned in a primary care centre.

- **Data distribution**: Five patients had both serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and albumin-corrected serum calcium above the reference intervals. Conversely, a total of 27 patients had both PTH and albumin-corrected serum calcium within the reference ranges. Eight cases were normocalcaemic with high serum PTH, while 42 individuals were hypercalcaemic with PTH within the reference interval.

The data were collected during 2014, and none of the patients had been assessed by a specialist. The distribution of albumin-corrected serum calcium and serum PTH in these 82 patients is depicted, with the cases sorted by age. The black dotted lines represent the upper limits of the normal range for albumin-corrected serum calcium (2.50 mmol/L) and serum PTH (6.9 pmol/L).

Patients who were referred to or primarily managed by a specialist were not included in this assessment.

### Imaging features of hypercalcemia: A primer for emergency radiologists [^112iS33U]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a marker for a wide variety of underlying etiologies, and its presentation in the emergency setting may be asymptomatic, incidental, or a primary complaint with associated symptoms and physical examination findings. While the workup is initially driven through serum laboratory testing, imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up. This review covers multiple common and uncommon etiologies of hypercalcemia, details their underlying mechanisms, and identifies the most important associated imaging findings. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these etiologies and imaging findings, particularly in the emergency setting, since hypercalcemia may represent the only significant laboratory abnormality associated with the presenting condition. Furthermore, the radiologist's interpretation of a study may be directly influenced by knowing about a patient's hypercalcemia.
