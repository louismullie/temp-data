## Question

What are the typical symptoms of Buergers disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical symptoms of Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic and vascular distribution context that frames the symptom profile. Then, I should categorize symptoms by temporal evolution from early to late disease. Next, I will integrate characteristic but nonpathognomonic features and briefly consider systemic or ocular manifestations. Finally, I will cross-check with contemporary diagnostic criteria and guideline language to ensure the symptom synthesis aligns with current clinical standards.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and who typically presents, because this shapes the pretest probability and the distribution of symptoms. Buerger's disease is a nonatherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory vasculopathy affecting small- and medium-sized arteries and veins of the distal upper and lower extremities, with onset usually before age 45–50 and a strong association with tobacco exposure including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cannabis; women are affected less often but do develop the disease, and prevalence varies geographically with higher rates in parts of Asia and the Middle East than in Western countries [^113VMMZA] [^113YhpXi] [^111kfHvu] [^113Nz4Wu] [^113YhpXi].

> Now, I will organize symptoms by temporal evolution, starting with early or prodromal features, and I need to ensure I don't overstate specificity. Early disease often brings coldness and episodic color changes in the digits reflecting vasospasm, along with paresthesias such as tingling or numbness and Raynaud's phenomenon with triphasic color change, all of which are consistent with distal microvascular compromise in young smokers and are repeatedly described across cohorts and reviews [^1166g87D] [^1128eUMB] [^113VMMZA] [^112XR7A9].

> Next, I should review ischemic claudication and pain patterns, and wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: foot arch claudication is frequently reported in Buerger's disease and can be mistaken for musculoskeletal pain, which delays diagnosis. Symptoms typically localize to the feet, ankles, or hands and reflect segmental occlusions of distal arteries rather than proximal atherosclerotic disease, and the angiographic pattern classically shows segmental occlusions with corkscrew collaterals and sparing of large proximal arteries [^115DBXDE] [^113VMMZA] [^114JHgQC].

> I will now examine rest pain and nocturnal symptoms, since this marks progression toward critical limb ischemia. Burning or aching pain at rest, often worsened at night, reflects severe distal ischemia and is frequently reported in larger series; this is a pivotal symptom that should prompt urgent smoking cessation counseling and consideration of vasoactive therapy to reduce pain and ulcer burden while definitive strategies are arranged [^112XR7A9] [^113VMMZA] [^116PVXBc].

> Let me consider ischemic ulcers and gangrene carefully, and I should double-check that I'm not conflating prevalence with universality. Ulceration or gangrene of fingers or toes is common in moderate to advanced disease, and the risk of tissue loss and amputation rises with disease progression and with limb infection at presentation; major amputation rates of roughly 26% at 10 years and 34% at 15 years have been reported, and limb infection at diagnosis is associated with a markedly increased risk of amputation, underscoring the importance of infection control and early recognition [^111kun8k] [^111A94br].

> But wait, what about associated features that, while not universal, can support the diagnosis in the right context. Superficial thrombophlebitis, often migratory, is a recognized clue in diagnostic criteria and appears in a meaningful minority of patients; arthralgia and even arthritis occur in a subset and may hint at a broader inflammatory diathesis; digital clubbing and hypertrophic nail changes have been described as secondary to chronic distal ischemia; importantly, many patients have normal acute-phase reactants, which helps distinguish this entity from other systemic vasculitides [^113VMMZA] [^112XR7A9] [^114JHgQC] [^114gdU5U].

> Hold on, I should verify whether ocular or other organ manifestations should be considered "typical" symptoms. Although classically considered a peripheral disease, rare ocular complications have been reported including retinal artery occlusions, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and uveitis; these are exceptional rather than typical, and their inclusion in a symptom list should be framed as uncommon extras that reinforce a potentially systemic vascular vulnerability in selected cases [^111TkPKb] [^117DwW4g] [^114dMyFj].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical spectrum to ensure coherence and completeness. Early disease presents with cold, discolored digits, episodic pallor–cyanosis–rubor changes, tingling or numbness, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Progressive disease brings exertional pain in the feet or hands consistent with claudication, especially arch claudication. Advanced disease features rest pain with burning or aching, ischemic ulcers on fingers or toes, and progression to dry or wet gangrene. Throughout, migratory superficial thrombophlebitis and arthralgia may accompany the vascular picture, while systemic features and abnormal inflammatory markers are not expected, helping differentiate Buerger's from other vasculitides [^113VMMZA] [^112XR7A9] [^114JHgQC] [^114gdU5U].

> I should confirm that this symptom synthesis aligns with contemporary diagnostic consensus, because anchoring to criteria reduces overcalling or missing atypical presentations. The 2022 international Delphi consensus supports tobacco exposure history, distal extremity ischemic manifestations, exclusion of atherosclerotic and embolic etiologies, and recognition of clues such as migratory thrombophlebitis and digital discoloration, while noting variability in age thresholds and laboratory requirements across historical criteria; integrating these with imaging that shows segmental distal occlusions and corkscrew collaterals reinforces the clinical picture and ties symptoms to expected vascular anatomy in Buerger's disease [^114gdU5U] [^114JHgQC].

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) typically presents with **distal extremity ischemia** in young male smokers, characterized by **intermittent claudication**, **rest pain**, and **ischemic ulcers or gangrene** of the fingers or toes [^113VMMZA] [^114JHgQC]. Early symptoms include coldness, numbness, tingling, and color changes (pallor, cyanosis, or rubor) of the digits, often with Raynaud's phenomenon and migratory superficial thrombophlebitis [^114JHgQC] [^11496mTv]. Progression leads to severe rest pain, non-healing ulcers, and **digital gangrene**, with **amputation risk rising** if smoking continues [^114JHgQC] [^115Vt1Ci]. Systemic symptoms are uncommon, but rare ocular or visceral involvement can occur [^111TkPKb] [^111pvJAx].

---

## Early symptoms

Early symptoms reflect **distal small-vessel ischemia** and inflammatory vasculitis:

- **Coldness and numbness**: Fingers and toes feel cold and numb, especially in cold environments [^113Krxta].

- **Tingling sensation**: Pins-and-needles or tingling in the digits [^1166g87D].

- **Color changes**: Pallor, cyanosis, or rubor of the fingers or toes, often triggered by cold or emotional stress [^115DBXDE].

- **Raynaud's phenomenon**: Episodic vasospasm with triphasic color change (white, blue, red) [^1128eUMB].

- **Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis**: Recurrent, tender, red subcutaneous cords in the limbs [^114gdU5U].

---

## Progressive symptoms

As disease advances, **ischemia worsens** and symptoms intensify:

- **Intermittent claudication**: Pain in the feet or calves during walking, relieved by rest [^112FoWSM].

- **Rest pain**: Persistent burning or aching pain in the digits, especially at night [^112FoWSM].

- **Ischemic ulcers**: Small, painful ulcers on the fingers or toes, often non-healing [^112XR7A9].

- **Digital gangrene**: Blackened, necrotic tissue of the digits, sometimes with autoamputation [^113VMMZA].

---

## Advanced symptoms

Advanced disease reflects **severe ischemia** and tissue loss:

- **Severe rest pain**: Intense, unrelenting pain from critical limb ischemia [^111MroYf].

- **Extensive gangrene**: Multiple digits or entire limbs affected, often necessitating amputation [^112MY63Y].

- **Infection**: Limb infection is common and increases amputation risk [^115Vt1Ci].

- **Functional impairment**: Significant disability, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life [^111A94br].

---

## Systemic and atypical manifestations

Although primarily a peripheral vasculitis, **rare systemic features** have been reported:

- **Ocular involvement**: Retinal vasculitis, ischemic optic neuropathy, and visual loss [^111TkPKb].

- **Visceral involvement**: Rare mesenteric, renal, or cerebral artery involvement causing ischemia [^111pvJAx].

- **Autoimmune features**: Occasionally arthralgia or arthritis, but systemic inflammatory markers are usually normal [^113YhpXi].

### Cannabis arteritis: ever more important to consider [^117LENU4]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Cannabis arteritis (CA) is a major and underdiagnosed cause of peripheral arterial disease in young patients. A 34-year-old man, daily smoker of 20 cigarettes and two cannabis cigarettes for 14 years, presented with a necrotic plaque of left hallux for 3 weeks. The Doppler ultrasound and angiography were compatible with severe Buerger's disease. Submitted to a revascularisation procedure and hypocoagulation with rivaroxaban. He had ceased smoking but maintained consumption of cannabis. Owing to the persistence of distal necrosis, amputation of the hallux was performed with good evolution. CA is a subtype of Buerger's disease. It is poorly known but increasingly prevalent and manifests in cannabis users regardless of tobacco use. The drug is considered at least a cofactor of the arteriopathy. The most effective treatment is cessation of consumption. Being cannabis one of the most consumed drugs, its mandatory to ask about its use in all young patients with arteriopathy.

Development and implementation of a stage-specific treatment plan — the treatment of dementia varies through the course of the illness, because symptoms evolve over time, and although many symptoms can and do occur throughout the illness, certain symptoms are typical of the broad stages. This outline of stages conforms most to the typical course of Alzheimer's disease, but it does not apply as well to other types of dementias, particularly the frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders. The following sections provide general recommendations for treating patients in three stages of illness (mild, moderate, and severe) and specific recommendations for the implementation of selected psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments.

### The epidemiologic and clinical findings of patients with buerger disease [^11496mTv]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Buerger disease is a nonatherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease, which is mostly observed in young male smokers. Buerger disease is characterized by the observation of peripheral arterial occlusion by angiography. The condition may be caused by microembolization in the small-sized arteries of the distal extremities. Buerger disease is diagnosed based on the Shionoya's clinical diagnostic criteria, which include: (1) a history of smoking, (2) onset before the age of 50 years, (3) the presence of infrapopliteal arterial occlusions, (4) either upper limb involvement or phlebitis migrans, and (5) the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors other than smoking. Several studies have reported that oral bacterial infections (periodontitis) could activate the onset of Buerger disease. In this study, we report the epidemiologic and clinical manifestations of patients with Buerger disease.

Methods

Fifty-eight patients who were surgically treated between July 1989 and June 2014 at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital were enrolled in this study. All of the patients clinically diagnosed with Buerger disease based on Shionoya's clinical diagnostic criteria. Fifty-five male and 3 female patients were treated. The mean age of the patients was 48 years (range, 21–73 years).

Results

All of the patients were either smokers or had a history of smoking. The mean Brinkman index score was 780 (range, 150–1,640). Their mean age at the onset of Buerger disease was 38 years (range, 21–50). The arterial lesions extended to the femoral arteries in 25% of cases, to the iliac arteries in 8% and to the abdominal aorta and/or visceral arteries in 6% of cases. Upper limb involvement, including cyanosis, paleness, and gangrene, was obvious in 84% of patients, and phlebitis migrans was recognized in 34%. The lower extremities symptoms involved intermittent claudication in 23% of the patients, rest pain in 13% of the patients, and ulceration or gangrene in 64% of the patients. Fifteen patients had undergone surgical arterial reconstruction, 4 patients had received endovascular therapy, 33 patients had undergone lumbar sympathectomy and 8 patients had undergone thoracic sympathectomy. Twenty percent of the patients needed minor limb amputations, and 4% required major limb amputations. In the patients who were examined for their oral conditions, periodontitis corresponding to grades B (moderate periodontitis), C (severe periodontitis), and D (edentulous patients) was revealed in 31%, 56%, and 13% of the patients, respectively.

Conclusions

More than half of the Buerger disease patients in this study were suffering from severe periodontitis. It is possible that not only the cessation of smoking, but also the improvement of periodontal care could improve the clinical symptoms related to Buerger disease.

### Can sensation of cold hands predict Raynaud's phenomenon or paraesthesia? [^1148iX2f]. Occupational Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The question 'Do you have a sensation of cold in your hands/fingers?' can be used in screening to identify persons at risk of developing Raynaud's phenomenon. However, the predictive strength of the question alone does not justify any expensive intervention on individual level, such as removal of vibration exposure, since the positive likelihood ratio is low. It could, however, be used to identify groups that need to be better informed concerning health-related issues regarding hand-arm vibration and more strictly monitored in the future to identify early stages of disease. More longitudinal research in this area is needed to identify early signs of HAVS, such as vascular or neurological symptoms, or objective findings like biomarkers. Future research should assess if there is a model including one or several signs combined that can reliably predict a future onset of HAVS. If this is achieved, a screening procedure that works in a clinical setting at individual level should be the ultimate goal. To strengthen the clinical value of future research, the vascular component needs to be assessed according to international consensus, possibly in combination with objective assessments, and additional neurosensory symptoms need to be included apart from paraesthesia.

### Surgical treatment of respiratory complications associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116yJ8UJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Although the association between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and typical esophageal symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation, is straightforward, this is not the case for the relation between GER and respiratory symptoms. The strongest link is the finding of abnormal reflux in the proximal esophagus or pharynx. This finding, in conjunction with evidence of airway injury such as seen on laryngoscopy, strongly supports the relation between GER and airway disease. Medical therapy provides relief to some patients, but with less consistency than for those with typical symptoms of GER disease. This is likely due to persistent aspiration or injury from supraesophageal reflux. Laparoscopic antireflux surgery is extremely safe and effective for reducing reflux as well as aspiration, and appears to be more effective than medical treatment for treating GER-related respiratory symptoms.

### Deciphering a prodrome: looking for a disease in a haystack [^112rKgpF]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In many chronic diseases, the underlying biological processes begin long before the condition is clinically recognized and diagnosed. After biologic onset of the disease an early, often nonspecific, set of symptoms, or prodrome, may develop before more characteristic symptoms of the disease present. For instance, in Parkinson disease (PD), some of the earliest manifestations, such as smell or taste dysfunction, may occur 2 decades before typical symptoms, such as tremor, appear. 1 Generally, the combination of long prodromal phases and nonspecific symptoms hampers early recognition of disease. Recognizing the prodromal phase of a disease in an individual has 2 potential benefits. First, accurate identification of etiologic factors for disease depends on ensuring that the putative exposure preceded biologic onset of the disease and that the identified symptoms are not related to a delay in diagnosis. Therefore, recognition of a prodromal phase may enhance the ability to identify etiologic factors. Second, accurate prediction that an individual is in the prodromal phase of the disease offers the tantalizing possibility that intervention in this phase could prevent or delay evolution of more typical clinical manifestations. 2.

### The effect of smoking cessation on the technical success of endovascular treatment for thromboangiitis obliterans [^114UrQBR]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To show that smoking cessation improves the technical success of lower extremity endovascular treatment in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), or Buerger disease.

Materials and Methods

One hundred two patients with TAO who underwent endovascular treatment for chronic limb-threatening ischemia or severe claudication of lower extremities in a tertiary hospital between 2015 and 2022 were included in this retrospective study. Data on serum cotinine levels were available for the last 45 patients, and 38 patients constituted the study population. Per the institution's protocol, patients were instructed to quit smoking 15 days before the intervention. However, cotinine levels showed that some of the patients continued smoking. Technical and recanalization successes were assessed as the primary end points. The secondary end point was the improvement in Rutherford scores at the 1-month follow-up. The McNemar test was used to compare the proportion of recanalized arteries after the intervention.

Results

Thirty-seven men and 1 woman (mean age, 42.9 years ± 10.1) were evaluated. The overall technical success rate was 86.8% in the study group. The technical success rate was significantly higher in the nonsmoker group (n = 24 [96%]) than in the smoker group (n = 8 [61.5%]; p = 0.006). One-month clinical data were available for 100% of the patients. The Rutherford category of the nonsmoker group was significantly lower at the 1-month follow-up. In addition, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed lower Rutherford scores after the intervention in the nonsmoker group. The adverse event rate was 8%. One (2.7%) patient in the smoker group underwent a minor amputation.

Conclusions

Cessation of smoking before endovascular therapy improved technical success and recanalization rates in patients with TAO.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^116ZsJiu]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Definitions and nomenclature for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — The guideline states that "The term "critical limb ischemia" (CLI) is outdated and fails to encompass the full spectrum of patients who are evaluated and treated for limb-threatening ischemia in modern practice". It further notes, "Instead, the new term CLTI is proposed to include a broader and more heterogeneous group of patients with varying degrees of ischemia that can often delay wound healing and increase amputation risk", and excludes from scope "patients with purely venous ulcers, acute limb ischemia, acute trash foot, ischemia due to emboli, acute trauma, or mangled extremity and those with wounds related to nonatherosclerotic conditions. These include vasculitides, collagen vascular disease, Buerger's disease, neoplastic disease, dermatoses, and radiation arteritis".

### Symptom assessment tools for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treatment [^113uVpp1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Relief of symptoms, both typical and atypical, is the mainstay of therapy for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, evaluation of GERD symptoms' response to treatment has been hampered by the lack of a questionnaire that meets all the criteria of an ideal evaluative GERD symptom assessment tool. These criteria are: sensitivity in GERD patients, covering all symptom dimensions (multidimensional construct), assessment of frequency and intensity of "typical" and "atypical" GERD symptoms, practical and economical, easy to understand, responsive over short time intervals, use as a patient self-assessment tool, amenable to daily use, psychometrically validated, and translation into many languages with cross-cultural adaptation. Thus far, 14 instruments have been developed to assess GERD symptoms and potentially can be used to evaluate treatment response during a therapeutic trial in GERD patients. However, comparison of the different evaluative tools is needed.

### Diagnosing alexander disease in adults [^117PnsGC]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Alexander disease is a rare, genetic and ultimately fatal neurological disorder that arises from pathogenic variants in the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene. Its presenting symptoms often differ according to age at onset. Although Alexander disease typically presents in young children with seizures and developmental delays, its presentation in adults may include bulbar signs, ataxia and autonomic dysfunction. Because of the heterogeneous and non-specific symptoms associated with adult-onset Alexander disease, the diagnosis typically requires comprehensive clinical and neuroimaging evaluation as well as confirmatory genetic testing. Here, we present detailed case descriptions of patients who first presented with symptoms of Alexander disease as adults, with guidance on recognising distinctive clinical and radiological characteristics associated with the later-onset form. Timely recognition and referral of patients with Alexander disease will enable earlier interventions that may mitigate disease severity or slow disease progression if such interventions become available.

### Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenic gene therapy in patients with peripheral artery disease [^113mmy2C]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This phase 1 clinical trial tested the safety of intramuscular gene transfer by using naked plasmid DNA encoding the gene for VEGF, and analyzed the potential therapeutic benefits in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study was an open-labeled, dose- escalating, single-center trial on nine male patients with severe debilitating PAD who had not responded to conventional therapy. Seven had Buerger's disease and two had arteriosclerosis obliterans. Plasmid DNA (pCK) containing human VEGF165 was given by eight intramuscular injections in and around the area in need of new blood vessels. The study evaluated three escalating total doses (2, 4, and 8 mug of pCK- VEGF165), with half of each total dose given four weeks apart. The follow-up duration was nine months. The gene injections were well tolerated without significant side effects or laboratory abnormalities related to gene transfer. Three patients showed transient edema in their extremities. Ischemic pain of the affected limb was relieved or improved markedly in six of seven patients. Ischemic ulcers healed or improved in four of six patients. The mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) improved significantly. Six of nine patients showed an increase in collateral vessels around the injection sites demonstrated by digital subtraction angiography. However, there was no relationship between the degree of ABI improvement and the dose given. Mean plasma levels of VEGF did not increase significantly. In conclusion, intramuscular injections of pCK- VEGF165 can be performed safely to induce therapeutic angiogenesis in patients with severe PAD.

### Imaging appearances of Buerger's disease complications in the upper and lower limbs [^115AF1v2]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) is a rare, non-atherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory vasculitis that most commonly involves small and medium-sized arteries, veins and nerves of the extremities and affects tobacco smokers between the ages of 25 and 45 years. The manifestations of Buerger's disease can be extremely variable and, therefore, awareness of the condition is important for both general and musculoskeletal radiologists. This paper presents the radiological appearance of the sequelae of Buerger's disease involving the upper and lower limbs.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans: 110 Years old and little progress made [^111kfHvu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Since the landmark article by Leo Buerger in 1908, there has been little progress in the understanding of the cause, pathophysiology, and optimum treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). 1 There are ≈40 to 50 articles published on TAO every year, and for the most part, they comprise case reports, small series, and review articles. There has been only incremental new information published since the articles published from the 1960s to the present time. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

TAO is a nonatherosclerotic, inflammatory vascular disease that affects the small‐ and medium‐size arteries and veins in the upper and lower extremities. The pathological hallmark of this disease is the presence of a highly inflammatory thrombus in the affected arteries and veins. 2, 7 There is a strong association with the use of tobacco products as well as cannabis. 8, 10, 11 There has never been a well‐documented case of Buerger's disease published in a patient proven not to be using tobacco or cannabis in some form (ie, confirmation of smoking cessation by measuring urine nicotine or cotinine levels and toxicology screen). The prevalence of TAO is much higher in the Middle East and Asia as compared with North America and Western Europe. It appears that the prevalence of TAO is declining in North America and Western Europe because of a decline in the rate of smoking and the use of stricter criteria in the diagnosis of TAO. 10, 12, 13 There has been no significant change in the way patients with Buerger's disease are medically treated over the past 20 years. 3, 14 The most effective way to "treat" these patients is to convince them that complete abstinence of tobacco and cannabis use will substantially lessen the likelihood of amputation. 8, 13, 14 However, there have been significant advances in endovascular therapy over the past decade. In 2 recent reports, it was shown that in addition to discontinuing smoking, endovascular therapy may be an effective way to preserve the limb and speed the healing of ischemic ulcers in selected patients with TAO. 15, 16 While the sample size in each of these studies was small (35 and 44 patients, respectively), the technical results and immediate and late clinical outcomes resulted in amputation‐free survival rates similar to those of patients undergoing surgical bypass procedures, and the healing of ischemic ulcers occurs much sooner than with discontinuation of smoking alone.

### Current pathological and clinical aspects of Buerger's disease in Japan [^115t5Jg9]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Since Buerger's disease was first described by Leo Buerger in 1908, many authors have discussed whether it indeed exists and, if so, is a definite clinical entity. Today, Buerger's disease is accepted as a definite vascular disease with a typical clinical picture, natural history, and histopathology; however, the diagnosis of Buerger's disease has been controversial, and the etiology of this vascular occlusive disease has remained unknown because many authors in different countries have their own criteria. Besides, patients with this disease have decreased in number even in Japan, while there has been no change in the number of arteriosclerosis obliterans patients. Currently, only one or two new patients per year are encountered at our outpatient clinic. The purpose of this review is to examine the current epidemiological, pathological, and clinical aspects of Buerger's disease in Japan based on the 222 patient files of our department between 1980 and 2000 and to discuss the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and various treatment modalities.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^111QfjZA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables are presented as median (interquartile range); categorical variables are presented as count (percent). Fifteen‐year vascular event‐free survival was defined as the time from the date of TAO diagnosis and the date of the first vascular event, amputation, death, or last follow‐up. Fifteen‐year amputation‐free survival was defined as the time from the date of TAO diagnosis and the date of the first amputation. Patients with amputation or vascular event before the diagnosis of TAO were excluded for survival analysis only.

Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan‐Meier product‐limit estimator. Factors associated with overall survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. The proportional hazards assumption was checked by examination of Schoenfeld residuals. For the different end points, univariate analyses were first carried out, then a multivariate analysis was used where all factors with P < 0.20 in the univariate analysis were considered. If needed, factors were then sequentially removed from the adjusted model based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) criteria. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

### Ultrasonography evaluation on the protective effect of combination therapy of beraprost sodium and aspirin on arteries occlusion and stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus-a prospective, randomized study [^117QUXEu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with diabetes are susceptible to developing symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is closely related to increased mortality rate and low quality of life. The overall prevalence of PAD has been estimated to be 20% and 29% in patients with diabetes over 40 and 50 years old, respectively. PAD in diabetic patients is diffuse and is most severe in the crural and foot arteries, which is characterized by arterial calcification, large artery stiffness, and occlusion of the arteries. Management of PAD includes exercise, smoking cessation, statin therapy, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel.

Beraprost sodium (BPS) is a stable orally active prostacyclin (PGI2) analog, which has an effect on the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation via binding to PGI2 membrane receptors and inhibiting the release of Ca 2+ from intracellular storage sites. Moreover, BPS also alleviates vascular thrombosis by inhibiting platelet aggregation. BPS has been proven to be an effective agent in the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and Buerger's disease.

Recently, it was reported that BPS reduced lower limb ischemic symptoms and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with PAD. It was also found that chronic diabetic foot ulcer patients experienced a significant increase in the wound healing rate after the administration of BPS, suggesting that BPS might be a potential treatment in treating peripheral circulatory disorders in patients with diabetes. However, the exact effect of BPS on arterial calcification and occlusion of peripheral arteries, especially lower limb arteries in patients with T2DM has not yet been fully investigated. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the difference of changes in the inner diameter and medial arterial calcification (MAC) rate of lower limb arteries between T2DM patients with 5 years combination therapy of BPS and aspirin, and those received solely aspirin treatment.

Vascular Event

The mean follow‐up was 5.7 years, and there were 3 deaths of unknown origin. One hundred thirty‐two patients had at least 1 event other than amputation with a mean of 1.3 events per patient (including events before diagnosis). Thirty of the patients had a claudication worsening, 66 a limb ischemia, and 58 an ischemic ulcer or necrosis. The remaining 21 had a limb infection or superficial thrombosis. Vascular event‐free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 41% and 23%, respectively (Figure 1). In the univariate analysis, nonwhite origin was associated with higher vascular event rate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–3.36: P = 0.006). In multivariable analysis, nonwhite origin (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.30–4.27: P = 0.005) and limb infection (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.02–10.6: P = 0.045) were associated with a higher vascular event rate (Table 2).

Because the study spanned 50 years, we assessed whether the year of diagnosis modified the vascular event‐free survival rate. Year of diagnosis (disease diagnosed before versus in/after 2007, being the median year of diagnosis) has no significant effect on vascular event‐free survival (HR = 1.18 [0.72–1.95], P = 0.51). Nevertheless, we conducted a sensitivity analysis stratified on year of diagnosis (variable coded as described above) with no major change in results.

Conclusion

Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a segmental nonatherosclerotic inflammatory disorder that primarily involves the small and medium arteries, veins and nerves of the extremities, and is observed in young and middle-aged male smokers. It is a rare vasculitis characterized by a highly cellular inflammatory thrombus with relative sparing of the vessel wall and can be distinguished from other types of vasculitis based on the rarity of systemic signs and symptoms and the absence of both elevated acute-phase reactants and immunological markers. Although smoking, genetics, hypercoagulability, endothelial dysfunction, infection and immunologic mechanisms have been proposed as factors influencing the onset of Buerger's disease, the true cause of Buerger's disease is still unknown.

It is typically a disease affecting vessels in distal parts of the extremities, but it has also been reported to involve unusual vascular beds, the great vessels, and pulmonary, proximal extremity, mesenteric, cerebral, coronary, renal, pelvic, and ophthalmic arteries.

The ophthalmic artery (OA) is the main blood supply to the orbit and gives rise to ciliary arteries that supply the choroid and optic nerve head, and to the central retinal artery that supplies the retina. Early sclerotic changes and arteriosclerosis of the retinal arteries were previously reported in Buerger's disease, suggesting that changes in blood flow by vasospasm and thrombotic occlusions ocur within the ocular arteries. However, except for our case, there is only one case in the literature that describes Buerger's disease with dysfunctional regulation of ocular blood flow within the optic nerve head and retinal arteriole having caused NTG.

NTG is a major subtype of glaucoma, associated with IOP, which is within the statistically normal range of the population. The etiology and pathogenesis of NTG remains unclear; however, genetics, autoimmune mechanisms and vasospasm have been suggested as possible major etiologic factors that cause local ocular blood flow disturbance within the optic nerve head. Several authors have demonstrated a difference in resting pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) in relation to IOP, with a lower POBF in those with a higher IOP. Quaranta et al. demonstrated a lower POBF in NTG patients when compared with healthy controls despite similar resting IOP and suggested these findings may be consistent with a lack of myogenic autoregulation in response to IOP induced modifications of the perfusion pressure in these patients.

### Treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease) with high-potency vasodilators [^112cY8Nn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) or Buerger's disease is a vascular inflammatory thrombotic occlusive and segmental disease affecting distal small and medium-sized arteries of the limbs. Tobacco is the main trigger factor and avoiding it is the main treatment. Frequently, it is necessary to use high-potency vasodilators, such as iloprost, bosentan, sildenafil, or alprostadil, to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of amputation. Iloprost is the only one that has been shown to be effective in randomized clinical trials. We report the third case of TAO treated with sildenafil and a new case treated with bosentan. This condition can be diagnosed and treated by a dermatologist. We would like to highlight the excellent clinical response despite the fact that patients continued to smoke. This finding may have important therapeutic implications because early treatment may prevent amputation and can be effective even during the process of giving up smoking.

Discussion

This study is the largest reported to date that assessed long‐term outcome of TAO in a Western country. This French nationwide multicenter study provides important data regarding the prognostic factors associated with vascular events and amputations. The most striking conclusions drawn by this study are that (1) nonwhite patients had a 2‐fold higher risk of vascular events than white patients; (2) the 10‐ and 15‐year amputation rates were 26% and 34%, respectively; (3) limb infection at diagnosis was independently associated with the occurrence of vascular events and of amputation; and (4) smoking cessation was strongly associated with a lower incidence of amputation.

Compared with other cohorts, our French TAO cohort was broadly similar in its demographic features with a predominance of males. 4, 8, 10, 11, 12 Lower limb involvement and claudication were the most prevalent symptoms. Ischemic ulcers or necrosis were present in 30% of cases, whereas they are reported in 76% in the United States 6 and in more than 45% of patients in the Far East and Middle East. 10, 13, 14 Limb infection at diagnosis was evidenced in 8.5% of patients. Clinical characteristics of TAO did not differ between white and nonwhite as well as between cannabis users and nonusers, as previously described. 15

We observed a vascular event‐free survival at 10 years of 23%. Limb ischemia and ulcers were the most frequent events. Ohta et al also described that ulcers/gangrene were the most frequent symptoms during the clinical course of the disease. 16 Prognostic factors have not been well studied in TAO. Although the harmful role of tobacco has been widely demonstrated, 4 the impact of ethnicity, other toxics, and/or sex have never been studied. Herein, we demonstrated that limb infection and nonwhite origin were independently associated with vascular events. Ethnic origin had never yet been reported as a prognostic factor in TAO. White and nonwhite did not differ in terms of clinical features, treatments, or smoking status. Thus, the increase in vascular‐event rates might be explained by genetics, socioeconomic, or immunologic factors. 17

### Symptoms of group B strep disease… [^111NzEgK]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Group B Streptococcus disease includes many different types of infections.
- Symptoms depend on the part of the body that's infected.
- Symptoms of GBS disease are different in newborns compared to people of other ages.
- Learn which symptoms are typical with GBS disease. Symptoms Newborns Most newborns who get GBS disease in the first week of life have symptoms on the day of birth. GBS disease symptoms can seem like other health problems in newborns and babies. Symptoms include:

- Fever
- Difficulty feeding
- Irritability or lethargy
- Difficulty breathing
- Blue-ish color to skin. Others Symptoms depend on the part of the body that's infected. Listed below are symptoms associated with the most common infections caused by GBS bacteria in adults.

Symptoms of bacteremia and sepsis include:

- Fever
- Chills
- Low alertness. Symptoms of pneumonia include:

- Fever
- Chills
- Cough
- Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing
- Chest pain Skin and soft tissue infections often appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that may be:

- Red
- Swollen
- Warm to the touch
- Full of pus or other drainage. People with skin infections may also have a fever. Bone and joint infections often appear as pain in the infected area and might also include:

- Fever
- Chills
- Swelling
- Stiffness or inability to use the affected limb or joint. Complications Babies Babies may have long-term problems, such as deafness and developmental disabilities, due to having GBS disease. Babies who had meningitis are especially at risk for having long-term problems.

Adults Serious GBS infections, such as bacteremia, sepsis, and pneumonia, can also be deadly for adults. On average, about 1 in 20 men and non-pregnant women with serious GBS infections dies. Risk of death is lower among younger adults and adults who do not have other medical conditions.

### Risk of Raynaud's phenomenon among workers in the occupational disease surveillance system [^116FowEB]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Outcome

Cases of Raynaud's phenomenon were identified using OHIP physician billing records from 1999 to 2020. Cases were defined using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) ninth revision (ICD‐9) diagnosis code 443 ("Other peripheral vascular disease"), which includes Raynaud's phenomenon and other and unspecified peripheral vascular diseases. Although this ICD code includes other conditions, RP is much more common than the other peripheral vascular diseases (Buerger's disease, other arterial dissections, and other peripheral vascular diseases, etc.). The 443 ICD code also includes a more common condition, intermittent claudication, however this only refers to unspecified claudication whereas ICD code 440 includes atherosclerosis‐related claudication which makes up the majority of claudication cases and was not used in this case definition. Furthermore, RP has known associations with work‐related factors, unlike the other conditions. Using the OHIP physician billing records, an RP diagnosis was based on at least two visits with a physician on two separate days, within 5 years of cohort entry. There was no required lag time between diagnoses, other than the separate day requirement. The diagnostic codes for RP may include both PRP and SRP as there is no way to differentiate between the two types in diagnostic coding. Although RP cases could be identified in OHIP records as early as January 1, 1999, the earliest possible date for cohort entry was January 1, 2002, to account for a 3‐year washout (disease‐free) period. The latent period for the onset of occupational‐related RP depends on the type and severity of the exposure. There is evidence that RP symptoms can appear after 1 year of vibration exposure, with one study finding up to 70% of exposed workers developing symptoms after 3 years. While less is known about the latency of RP‐related to cold or chemical exposure, the latency for a vinyl chloride‐related condition (acro‐osteolysis), which can cause RP, is 5 months to 3.5 years. Therefore, a 3‐year washout period is useful in capturing as many RP cases as possible, while still removing prevalent cases. Those with an OHIP RP diagnosis date before their cohort entry were also considered prevalent cases and therefore excluded from the analysis (n = 3096).

Results

Characteristics of the Study Population and Treatment

Main demography, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings of the 224 patients with TAO are presented in Table 1. The median [lower quartile, upper quartile] age at symptom onset and diagnosis was 36 [29–44] and 38.5 [32–46] years, respectively. Fifty‐one patients (22.8%) were women. One hundred eighty‐three patients (81.7%) were classified as white, the other 41 patients (18.3%), classified as nonwhite, originated from North Africa (31 [13.8%]), Sub‐Saharan Africa (6 [2.7%]), and Far East (4 [1.7%]). All but 3 patients declared they were current smokers with a median consumption of 22 [12–30] pack‐year. Fifty‐one (23%) patients were also cannabis users. Demographic characteristics were not different between men and women or between whites and nonwhites.

Table 1
Main Characteristics of Patients With TAO According to Ethnicity

At diagnosis, 114 (52.8%) patients had a claudication, 162 (73.3%) a limb ischemia, 69 (31.5%) ischemic ulcers or necrosis, and 19 (8.8%) a limb infection. Exclusive lower‐limb involvement was more frequent with 119 patients (53.9%), and involvement of both upper and lower limb was present in 21 patients (9.5%). Superficial thrombophlebitis, Raynaud phenomenon, and arthralgia were present in 41 (18.3%), 93 (41.5%), and 17 (7.6%) patients, respectively. Raynaud phenomenon was more frequent in women than in men, 29 (56.9%) versus 64 (37.2%), respectively, P = 0.019. Clinical presentation was not different between white and nonwhite (Table 1), and between patients who consumed cannabis or not.

### Substitution of smokeless tobacco for cigarettes in Buerger's disease does not prevent limb loss [^115VZckz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Buerger's Disease, characterized by segmental, inflammatory, occlusive disease of the distal small and medium sized arteries, predominantly affects young men who are cigarette smokers. The disease may lead to ischemia, necrosis, and amputation of distal extremities; most patients have significant improvement in symptoms if smoking is discontinued. We report a patient who experienced progression of biopsy-proven Buerger's disease, after substituting smokeless tobacco for cigarettes. The patient's disease was severe enough to eventually require bilateral below-knee amputations. The association of smokeless tobacco with progressive limb ischemia should lead clinicians to discourage the substitution of smokeless tobacco for cigarette smoking in patients with Buerger's disease.

Venous Thrombosis. (5.3)

5.1	Anaphylaxis

Severe allergic reactions have been reported following administration of liquid polidocanol, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Observe patients for at least 10 minutes following injection and be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately.

5.2	Tissue Ischemia and Necrosis

Intra-arterial injection or extravasation of polidocanol can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene Patients with underlying arterial disease, such as marked peripheral arteriosclerosis or thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's Disease) may be at increased risk for tissue ischemia. If intra-arterial injection of polidocanol occurs, consult a vascular surgeon immediately.

5.3 Venous Thrombosis

VARITHENA can cause venous thrombosis [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Follow administration instructions closely and monitor for signs of venous thrombosis after treatment. Patients with reduced mobility, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or recent (within 3 months) major surgery, prolonged hospitalization, or pregnancy are at increased risk for developing thrombosis.

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterised by episodic vasospasm of the fingers and toes typically precipitated by exposure to cold. Mild Raynaud's is common and is not usually a harbinger of clinically important disability; its onset, however, can be startling and uncomfortable for patients, and the well recognised association in some cases with systemic rheumatic conditions often precipitates aggressive assessments for underlying diseases. Advances in vascular physiology have shed light on the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's. We review clinical aspects of the disorder and new insights with respect to pathophysiology, and we discuss potential new therapeutics based on the disease mechanism, such as prostacyclin analogues, serotonin antagonists, and calcitonin gene-related peptides.

### Chapter 10: pertussis | Manual for the surveillance of vaccine… [^111No3Fn]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease Description Pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, is a contagious, respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The illness is typically characterized by a prolonged paroxysmal cough that is often accompanied by an inspiratory whoop. Disease presentation can vary with age and history of previous exposure or vaccination. Young infants may present to a clinic or hospital with apnea and no other disease symptoms. Adults and adolescents with some immunity may exhibit only mild symptoms or have the typical prolonged paroxysmal cough. In all persons, cough can continue for months. In addition to B. pertussis, 3 other Bordetella species can cause disease in humans: B. parapertussis, B. holmesii, and B. bronchiseptica. B. parapertussis causes a pertussis-like illness that is generally milder than pertussis, likely because the bacteria do not produce pertussis toxin.

Case Definitions The following case definition for pertussis was approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists in June 2019 and went into effect January 1, 2020. Clinical case definition In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, a cough illness lasting ≥ 2 weeks with at least one of the following signs or symptoms:

- Paroxysms of coughing, OR
- Inspiratory "whoop, " OR
- Posttussive vomiting, OR

- In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, illness meeting the clinical criteria, OR
- Illness with cough of any duration, with
- **At least one of the following signs or symptoms**:

- Paroxysms of coughing, or
- Inspiratory "whoop", or
- Posttussive vomiting, or
- Apnea. Laboratory confirmation of pertussis is important because other pathogens can cause symptoms similar to pertussis. All patients with cough and a positive B.

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^117BNWdF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although the number of publications we have found might not be impressive (13), we need to remember that Buerger's disease is rare and the ocular manifestations in its course are extremely rare. Furthermore, there seems to be no specific features that would make it possible to predict which patient with Buerger's disease is likely to develop ophthalmological complications. The patients described in the review articles did not differ from a typical patient suffering from thromboangiitis obliterans. That is why all patients with this disorder should be treated with caution as potentially at risk for eye problems. Introducing routine eye examination for all patients with Buerger's disease might be helpful. Some of the ocular manifestations of the disorder could be detected during a basic ophthalmic examination comprised of visual acuity and intraocular pressure tests as well as a slight lamp examination. Having analyzed the findings we suspect that Buerger's disease may not be localized vasculopathy but a systemic disease and - like other vasculitis – it may affect various organs and systems. We hope our review may help to raise awareness of possible ocular manifestations in the course of Buerger's disease and encourage physicians taking care of patient with thromboangiitis obliterans to perform ophthalmological examinations.

### Endovascular treatment of critical limb ischemia in buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) with midterm follow-up: a viable option when bypass surgery is not feasible [^1115XPq8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is an occlusive inflammatory disease affecting small- and medium-sized vessels that causes decrease in life quality and eventually limb loss. The only proven treatment method is smoking cessation, but it may be insufficient for limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia. In this single-center retrospective study, the feasibility and efficiency of endovascular treatment in TAO were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS. After approval of the local institutional review board, 41 patients who underwent endovascular treatment of TAO between January 2014 and June 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. Technical success and procedure-related complications were recorded. Decrease in Rutherford classification score, relief of pain, and wound healing were evaluated to determine clinical success. Primary patency, limb salvage rate, and amputation-free survival were also evaluated. RESULTS. A total of 45 limbs were treated during the study period. Technical success was achieved in 82.2% of procedures. Mean follow-up was 29.8 months. Clinical improvement was achieved in 35 limbs. Three patients underwent major amputation and 12 patients underwent minor amputation. Amputation-free survival and limb salvage were both 93.3% at both 1 and 2 years. Reintervention was performed in 14 patients because of occlusion and clinical relapsing of the symptoms. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment of TAO is feasible, has a potential to prevent limb amputation in patients with critical limb ischemia, and has acceptable technical success and limb salvage rates. Because there is no consensus in treatment of TAO, prospective comparative studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of an endovascular approach.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^115Vt1Ci]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In the present study, limb infection at diagnosis was associated with a 4‐fold higher risk of amputation. Fazeli et al reported that smoking duration was the only independent factor associated with major amputations. 20 Interestingly, gangrene or ulcers were not associated with a worse prognosis. Limb infection has not been studied in TAO but it has been proposed as an important prognostic factor in atherosclerotic critical leg ischemia, more specifically in diabetic patients. 21 In diabetics, limb infection increased the odds of amputation by 3‐fold. 22 Therefore, TAO patients with a limb infection may be those who should benefit from a more aggressive and careful therapeutic management.

We found that ex‐smokers did not experience an amputation within 4 years of tobacco cessation. In addition, at the time of the first amputation, 90% of patients were still smokers. These data confirm previous observations that tobacco cessation is the cornerstone of TAO management. In Olin's series of 120 patients with TAO, 94% of ex‐smokers avoided amputation, while 43% of smokers required amputation. Ohta et al reported that all 41 ex‐smokers were free from limb amputation, while 13 of 69 smokers underwent amputation. 3, 5, 6 Fazeli et al confirmed that smoking cessation was highly protective for major amputation events. 20 However, Sugimoto et al did not observe a significant difference in the long‐term limb salvage rate between ex‐smokers and smokers at 20 years. 18 In our study, we did not find a negative association between amputation and the duration of smoking exposure nor with the amount of tobacco consumption. Cannabis consumption was not independently associated with a worse prognosis as previously described in a study of 38 patients with TAO. 15 In a review of the literature, the amputation rate in cannabis‐related limb arteritis was 58%, but no comparison could be done. 23

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^112FoWSM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Buerger's disease or thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a nonatherosclerotic inflammatory arteritis that involves small‐to‐medium‐size arteries and veins of extremities. 1, 2 Despite its strong association with tobacco exposure, the general pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown. TAO mainly affects young patients who present ischemic ulcers, rest pain, claudication, coldness of extremities, but also migratory thrombophlebitis and Raynaud phenomenon. Distal arterial occlusions can ultimately lead to limb amputation. 3, 4

Although it is observed worldwide, TAO seems to be more prevalent in the Middle East and Far East. Prevalence rates among in‐hospital‐treated patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were reported to range from 0.5% to 5.6% in Western Europe, 45% to 63% in India, and 16% to 66% in Korea and Japan. 5 Most series of TAO date back to the 1980s. In North America, Olin et al reported 112 patients with TAO from 1970 to 1987 and showed that the clinical spectrum changed over time with an increase in prevalence in women, and that patients who stopped smoking have a lower rate of amputation. 6 Cooper et al reported 111 patients from 1976 to 1999 at the Mayo Clinic and showed a time‐dependent rate of amputation of 48% at 10 years. 7 In Western Europe, Börner et al showed that the disease resulted in termination of working life by either dismissal or premature retirement. 8

TAO is considered to be rare in Western countries where clinical descriptions and long‐term outcomes are lacking, especially those coming from Europe. Although smoking cessation has shown an overwhelming effect for the prevention of limb amputation, 3, 5, 6 data regarding prognostic factors of TAO are scarce.

Our objective was to report the vascular event‐free survival, and the amputation‐free survival rate in 224 patients with TAO. In this French nationwide study, we analyzed the prognostic factors associated with these 2 outcomes using a multivariate model.

### Where are we with developing diagnostic criteria for skin diseases? Mapping the evidence in 2021 [^1119TLsM]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic criteria provide some guidance for clinical diagnosis and are essential for any research that compares populations. In dermatology, the breadth and scope of diagnostic criteria for skin diseases is not currently known, and the activity of dermatological diagnostic criteria research has not been recorded. We wanted to pioneer an analysis of what diagnostic criteria have been proposed in dermatology and the evidence‐based methods used to generate them. We aimed to create a map of diagnostic criteria to form a central repository of tools for clinicians and researchers to use. Our map also provides a panoramic view of past and ongoing research activity to develop diagnostic criteria, essential for understanding where the current gaps are and what stage of development the diagnostic criteria have reached.

### Treatment of buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) with bosentan: a case report [^111mpoS7]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a non-atherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease strongly associated with tobacco use, and it affects small and medium-sized blood vessels in the upper and lower extremities. The only known treatment for this disease is complete discontinuation of tobacco use. This report describes the case history of a woman with Buerger disease treated with the oral dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan. It is believed that this is the first description in the literature of this use for bosentan.

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^111TkPKb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

It appears that patients suffering from Buerger's disease may develop non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), occlusive retinal vasculitis and periphlebitis, papillophlebitis, central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), normal tension glaucoma (NTG), uveitis, chorioretinal atrophy, retinitis, papillitis, optic atrophy, changes typical for hypertensive retinopathy. Additionally, the abnormalities in electroretinography might be present. In the presented cases the occlusion of retinal vessels was the most common ocular manifestation of thromboangiitis obliterans (3 cases: 1 patient with central retinal artery occlusion and 2 patients with branch retinal artery occlusion), followed by normal tension glaucoma (2 cases) and uveitis (2 cases). The first condition mentioned above could be explained by vasospasm and thrombotic occlusion in the course of Buerger's disease. Vasospasm may also be responsible for the development of normal tension glaucoma and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, as it may lead to disturbances in the blood flow within the optic nerve head. There are studies suggesting an autoimmune background in thromboangiitis obliterans, which might be connected with the development of uveitis (also an autoimmune disease) in two cases.

The types of tests which may be useful when examining patients suffering from Buerger's disease mainly depend on the symptoms. However, in many cases fluorescein angiography was conducted and delivered important information. The treatment options and the possible outcome also depend on the type of ocular manifestations, so it seems impossible to propose a universal therapy.

To our knowledge, there seems to be no publication which would discuss all the articles we have managed to find. The most comprehensive review published by Fakour and Fazeli summed up 5 positions. The limitation of our review might be that we did not restrict the time span within which the publications for the analysis were to be found. Only 5 articles were published in the past 5 years. Finally, our inclusion criterion regarding the diagnosis of Buerger's disease in the reviewed works was not based on any specific classification.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113eJD3b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis — cryoglobulinemia is often found in many conditions that result in vasculitis; it arises from immunoglobulins that precipitate when body temperature decreases and is associated with cold-induced urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, pernio (chilblains), Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Schamberg vasculitis (pigmented purpura), and hepatitis B and C infection. Presentations can include livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, and purpura in cold-exposed areas with occasional necrosis, and in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia there is palpable purpura with petechiae of the lower extremities producing a "cayenne pepper" appearance with brawny edema of the lower legs. Classification is by immunoglobulin type; type I is usually associated with a monoclonal gammopathy (IgM > IgG > IgA or light chain).

### Efficacy of bosentan in digital ischemic ulcers [^111247yz]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (also known as Buerger's disease) is an inflammatory vascular disorder that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins in the extremities. There is no specific treatment and the only effective intervention is absolute cessation of tobacco use. Endothelial dysfunction appears to be of relevance to this condition and a report has even found that high serum levels of endothelin correlate with the presence of necrosis. We report two cases of digital necrosis showing a very satisfactory response to treatment with bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist.

### Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) [^1155727M]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Buerger disease is a nonatherosclerotic vasculitis that is triggered by substantial exposure to tobacco. This disease usually affects small- and medium-sized arteries in the upper and lower extremities. All clinicians who take care of patients with peripheral arterial disease should know the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of Buerger disease. In this article, we review the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria for Buerger disease. We describe the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of having Buerger disease and discuss the typical findings on noninvasive arterial studies and angiography. Lastly, we review the management of these patients, including medical therapy, with an emphasis on smoking cessation, as well as the potential role of revascularization, both surgical and endovascular.

### Autologous bone-marrow mononuclear cell implantation reduces long-term major amputation risk in patients with critical limb ischemia: a comparison of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease and buerger disease [^116TT8Lh]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bone-marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) implantation improves ischemic symptoms in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes after autologous BM-MNC implantation in patients with CLI.

Methods and Results

We assessed long-term clinical outcomes after BM-MNC implantation in 51 patients with CLI, including 25 patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and 26 patients with Buerger disease. Forty-six CLI patients who had no BM-MNC implantation served as control subjects. Median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 4-year amputation-free rates after BM-MNC implantation were 48% in PAD patients and 95% in Buerger disease, and they were 0% in control PAD patients and 6% in control Buerger disease. The 4-year overall survival rates after BM-MNC implantation were 76% in PAD patients and 100% in Buerger disease, and they were 67% in control PAD patients and 100% in control Buerger disease. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that BM-MNC implantation correlated with prevention of major amputation and that hemodialysis and diabetes mellitus correlated with major amputation. In Buerger disease, ankle brachial pressure index and transcutaneous oxygen pressure were significantly increased after 1 month and remained high during 3-year follow-up. However, in patients with PAD, ankle brachial pressure index and transcutaneous oxygen pressure significantly increased after 1 month and gradually decreased during 3-year follow-up and returned to baseline levels.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that BM-MNC implantation is safe and effective in patients with CLI, especially in patients with Buerger disease. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/angio/. Unique identifier: 001769.

### An international Delphi consensus on diagnostic criteria for Buerger's disease [^114gdU5U]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Buerger's disease (BD) remains a debilitating condition. Despite multiple published diagnostic criteria for BD, none is universally accepted as a gold standard.

Methods

We conducted a 2-round modified Delphi consensus study to establish a consensus on the diagnostic. The questionnaire included statements from several commonly used diagnostic criteria for BD. Qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were performed. An agreement level of 70% was applied.

Results

Twenty nine experts from 18 countries participated in this study. Overall, 75 statements were circulated in Round 1. Of these, 28% of statements were accepted. Following comments, 21 statements were recirculated in Round 2 and 90% were accepted. Although more than 90% of the experts did not agree that the diagnosis of BD can be based only on clinical manifestation, none of the nonclinical manifestations of BD were agreed as a part of the diagnostic criteria. There was an agreement that a history of tobacco consumption in any form, not necessarily confined to the current use, should be a part of the diagnostic criteria of BD. The history of thrombophlebitis migrans, even if not present at presentation, was accepted as a clue for BD diagnosis. It was also agreed that discoloration of the toes or fingers could be included in the diagnostic criteria of BD. Experts agreed that histology results could differentiate BD from atherosclerosis obliterans and other types of vasculitis. The presence of corkscrew collaterals on imaging and burning pain reached the agreement at the first round but not at the second. There was no consensus regarding age cut-off, the requirement of normal lipid profile, and normal blood glucose for BD diagnosis.

Conclusions

The present study demonstrated discrepancies in the various published diagnostic criteria for BD and their selective utilization in routine clinical practice worldwide. We propose that all published diagnostic criteria for BD be re-evaluated for harmonization and universal use.

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^114dMyFj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The first reports concerning ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease date back to the 1930s and 1940s. The following presentations were described: narrowing and obliteration of a vascular lumen in the vessels of the retina, iris and ciliary body in retinal periphlebitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, complicated cataract, phthisis bulbi, choroiditis, vitreous opacities, choroid atrophy, white colouring of the retinal artery, white sheath on the retinal arteries, embolism of the central retinal arteries, hemorrhages in the retina and the vitreous body, retinitis proliferans, retinal atrophy, optic atrophy and Eale's disease. Except for the case report published in the 1980s, the topic was not further researched until the next millennium. We managed to review 13 articles describing the involvement of the eyes in the course of thromboangiitis obliterans. We presented 10 isolated cases and 3 studies (conducted by Homma et al, Arslan et al, Valdes et al and Homma et al) showing ophthalmological changes in more than one patient. There seems to be no more studies on a larger group.

The criteria for the diagnosis of Buerger's disease differ depending on the author. Ollin et al have included the following aspects in the diagnosis: "an age of less than 45 years and current (or recent) history of tobacco use; the presence of distal-extremity ischemia (indicated by claudication, pain at rest, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene) documented by noninvasive vascular testing; exclusion of autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and diabetes mellitus by laboratory tests; exclusion of a proximal source of emboli by echocardiography and arteriography; and consistent arteriographic findings in the clinically involved and noninvolved limbs". The slightly different criteria were proposed by Papa et al, Mills and Porter or Shionoya. The reviewed articles were written from the ophthalmological perspective and in many cases the patients had been diagnosed with Buerger's disease prior to the eye problems. That is why the information on the exact criteria on the basis of which Buerger's disease was actually diagnosed is frequently missing.

### Brain properties predict proximity to symptom onset in sporadic Alzheimer's disease [^1141WuPG]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a lengthy preclinical period involving progressive changes in brain structure and function that precede overt cognitive symptoms. These brain alterations are subtle but measurable, allowing researchers to use neuroimaging to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's dementia well before cognitive symptoms manifest. Few studies have examined how neuroimaging features can predict the timing of symptom onset in preclinical individuals. This is an important topic of research, considering the preclinical period of Alzheimer's disease can last decades, and yet clinical trials typically only last a few years. The ability to predict symptom onset timing could increase the power of such trials by enriching for individuals on the precipice of their symptom onset. As yet, there is no consensus on biomarkers that can accurately reflect the temporality of preclinical disease progression, and no studies exist that have used a prediction/validation study design to establish generalizability of such markers.

A small proportion (< 1%) of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is attributable to autosomal dominant genetic mutations for which a single copy of a pathogenic allele is sufficient to cause symptoms. In such cases, the age at symptom onset is similar within and across generations. By comparing a mutation carrier's chronological age with his/her family's typical age of symptom onset (age of the person minus the age of familial onset), one can estimate the number of years to symptom onset. The study of disease characteristics related to years to estimated symptom onset has revealed a sequence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers that become increasingly abnormal as predisposed individuals approach their expected onset timing. This pattern has been observed using markers specific to Alzheimer's disease pathology, as well as using MRI data representing structural and functional properties of the brain.

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^117DwW4g]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

What needs to be emphasized is that diagnosing thromboangiitis obliterans is based mainly on excluding some other systemic diseases (eg autoimmune diseases). In almost each reviewed article the process of diagnosing was explained in details. Laboratory tests, imaging tests (eg color duplex ultrasound, extremities angiography, photoplethysmographic waveform analysis) and clinical presentation were taken into account. This also explains how the ophthalmological manifestations were attributed to Buerger's disease, as patients suffering from thromboangiitis obliterans are usually thoroughly examined in search for any other comorbidity. That is why the chance of some other disorder causing the involvement of the eye in Buerger's disease is low.

We understand the necessity of providing strict inclusion criteria for Buerger's disease, uniform for all articles and based on the acknowledged classifications. Yet, we could not follow such rigorous methodology because of all articles reviewed in our analysis only two referred to a specific classification of criteria for diagnosing Buerger's disease (Dimopoulos et al and Arslan et al.). In the remaining works the diagnosis was taken for granted as the starting point for further investigation of ocular problems. Some researchers stated that other causes, risk factors or systemic diseases had been excluded (Eris et al, Korkmaz et al, Re-Sainz et al, Zaoui et al, Marques et al.). Ohguro et al mentioned the patient's past medical history. We assumed that the diagnoses of Buerger's disease in the reviewed papers were accurate.

### Beyond peripheral arteries in Buerger's disease: angiographic considerations in thromboangiitis obliterans [^116fohu6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2002). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans is an inflammatory peripheral vascular disease that is strongly associated with smoking. It predominantly affects distal small- and medium-sized blood vessels of both the upper and lower extremities. We present histological evidence of this disease process affecting the internal mammary arteries. This can be of paramount clinical significance for patients with Buerger's disease who present with obstructive coronary artery disease and require coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). Internal mammary arteries involved with thromboangiitis obliterans cannot be utilized as arterial conduits during CABG and other alternatives have to be used. Therefore, we recommend preoperative angiography of both internal mammary arteries in patients with Buerger's disease requiring CABG to prevent extensive intraoperative dissection of diseased internal mammary arteries.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^1113GaE4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Effect of Smoking Cessation

In order to assess the effect of smoking cessation on the occurrence of amputation, patients who stopped their tobacco consumption at 1 year of follow‐up were considered as ex‐smokers, and patients who did not stop their consumption or who declared resuming smoking during follow‐up or at the amputation were considered as smokers. The next 4‐year amputation‐free survival rate was analyzed. Patients who stopped their tobacco consumption had a lower risk of amputation than those who continued (P = 0.001) (Figure 3 A). At the first amputation, among 48 patients, 5 (10.4%) were ex‐smokers and 43 (89.6%) were current smokers. At next amputation, among 34 patients, 8 (23.5%) were ex‐smokers and 26 (76%) were current smokers (Figure 3 B). Smoking age at onset and amount of tobacco exposure at diagnosis were not associated with amputation rate.

### CT angiography of the lower extremities [^114kwWLx]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

CT angiography (CTA) of the lower extremities has evolved into a robust noninvasive angiographic technique with the advent of 16 and 64 multidetector computed tomographic systems and advances in system design. CTA has displaced conventional catheter arteriography in a large range of applications and is predominantly used in the evaluation of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial occlusive disease in symptomatic patients who are candidates for intervention. Other disease entities including atheroembolism and thromboembolism, aneurysmal disease, and arteritides including Buerger disease and Takayasu arteritis can be precisely evaluated by CTA. Particular applications include arterial vascular mapping for free flap transfers and fibular grafts and evaluation of trauma, before and following orthopedic and plastic surgery interventions. Patients with intravascular stents and arterial bypass grafts who usually undergo serial evaluation by noninvasive, nonangiographic testing are potential candidates for angiographic study when clinical findings of noninvasive tests are in disagreement. The key to a successful clinical application is in understanding how to acquire, display, and interpret high-quality CTA in diverse clinical circumstances.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^111kun8k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Data regarding long‐term outcome of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans are lacking and most series come from India and Japan. In this study, we assess long‐term outcome and prognostic factors in a large cohort of thromboangiitis obliterans.

Methods and Results

Retrospective multicenter study of characteristics and outcomes of 224 thromboangiitis obliterans patients fulfilling Papa's criteria were analyzed. Factors associated with vascular events and amputations were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 38.5 (32–46) years, 51 (23.8%) patients were female, and 81.7% were whites. After a mean follow‐up of 5.7 years, vascular events were observed in 58.9%, amputations in 21.4%, and death in 1.4%. The 5‐, 10‐, and 15‐year vascular event‐free survival and amputation‐free survival were 41% and 85%, 23% and 74%, and 19% and 66%, respectively. Ethnic group (nonwhite) (hazard ratio 2.35 [1.30–4.27] P = 0.005) and limb infection at diagnosis (hazard ratio 3.29 [1.02–10.6] P = 0.045) were independent factors of vascular event‐free survival. Factor associated with amputation was limb infection (hazard ratio 12.1 [3.5–42.1], P < 0.001). Patients who stopped their tobacco consumption had lower risk of amputation (P = 0.001) than those who continued.

Conclusions

This nationwide study shows that 34% of thromboangiitis obliterans patients will experience an amputation within 15 years from diagnosis. We identified high‐risk patients for vascular complications and amputations.

### Pharmacological treatment for Buerger's disease [^117PuV4U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a non-atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The etiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularization to improve the condition. Pharmacological treatment is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischaemic ulcers or rest pain.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of any pharmacological agent (intravenous or oral) compared with placebo or any other pharmacological agent in patients with Buerger's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator searched their Specialised Register (last searched in April 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (Issue 3, 2015). The review authors searched trial registers and the European grey literature; screened reference lists of relevant studies, and contacted study authors and major pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving pharmacological agents used in the treatment of Buerger's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis.

Main Results

Five randomised controlled trials (total 602 participants) compared prostacyclin analogue with placebo, aspirin, or a prostaglandin analogue, and folic acid with placebo. No studies assessed other pharmacological agents such as cilostazol, clopidogrel and pentoxifylline or compared oral versus intravenous prostanoid. Compared with aspirin, intravenous prostacyclin analogue iloprost improved ulcer healing (risk ratio (RR) 2.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 6.11; 98 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), and helped to eradicate rest pain after 28 days (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.52; 133 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), although amputation rates were similar six months after treatment (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.15; 95 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence). When comparing prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) with prostaglandin (alprostadil) analogues, ulcer healing was similar (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.69; 89 participants; two studies; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence), as was the eradication of rest pain after 28 days (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.72 to 3.44; 38 participants; one study; low quality evidence), while amputation rates were not measured. Compared with placebo, the effects of oral prostacyclin analogue iloprost were similar for: healing ischaemic ulcers (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.54 to 2.29; 133 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.93; 135 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), eradication of rest pain after eight weeks (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.63; 207 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.59; 201 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), and amputation rates after six months (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56; 209 participants; one study, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.31; 213 participants; one study). When comparing folic acid with placebo in patients with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia, pain scores were similar, there were no new cases of amputation in either group, and ulcer healing was not assessed (very low quality evidence). Treatment side effects such as headaches, flushing or nausea were not associated with treatment interruptions or more serious consequences. Outcomes such as amputation-free survival, walking distance or pain-free walking distance, and ankle brachial index were not assessed by any study. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low to moderate, with few studies, small numbers of participants, variation in severity of disease of participants between studies and missing information regarding for example baseline tobacco exposure.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence suggests that intravenous iloprost (prostacyclin analogue) is more effective than aspirin for eradicating rest pain and healing ischaemic ulcers in Buerger's disease, but oral iloprost is not more effective than placebo. Verylow and low quality evidence suggests there is no difference between prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) and the prostaglandin analogue alprostadil for healing ulcers and relieving pain respectively in severe Buerger's disease. Very-low quality evidence suggests there is no difference in pain scores and amputation rates between folic acid and placebo, in people with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia. High quality trials assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents (intravenous or oral) in people with Buerger's disease are needed.

### Mesenteric inflammatory veno-occlusive disease occurring during the course of ulcerative colitis: a case report [^111cjRUx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The first case of isolated mesenteric venous inflammation and associated thrombosis leading to mesenteric ischemia was described in 1976. Since then, various terminologies have been used to describe these pathological findings, including necrotizing and enterocolic lymphocytic phlebitis, idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia, intramural mesenteric venulitis, and most recently, MIVOD.

The clinical symptoms of patients with MIVOD are abdominal pain and mucus per rectum or bloody diarrhea of variable duration. Endoscopic findings are not typical. Several reports show that contrast-enhanced CT and angiography are useful. However, in our case, contrast-enhanced CT showed colonic wall thickening, but was unable to detect the abnormalities of the mesenteric veins. The diagnosis of MIVOD is based on histopathological findings combined with the exclusion of other systemic diseases such as Buerger's disease, Behçet's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Histopathological findings of MIVOD show isolated vasculitis of the small mesenteric veins and their intramural tributaries with thrombosis as a secondary manifestation, but arterial involvement is not seen. Some subacute cases show granulomatous phlebitis and myointimal hyperplasia, as observed in our case.

In addition to the similarity of the clinical symptoms and endoscopic images between MIVOD and UC, endoscopic biopsies from patients with MIVOD show nonspecific mucosal inflammation consistent with UC because these endoscopic biopsies may not include the submucosal vessels that are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, MIVOD is often misdiagnosed and treated as UC, and when the appropriate treatment for UC is unsuccessful, colectomy must be performed, resulting in the pathological diagnosis of MIVOD.

Although our case was clinically and pathologically consistent with UC at the disease onset, his clinical course suddenly worsened 3 years later, resulting in a subtotal colectomy and the pathologically proven diagnosis of MIVOD. Because UC and MIVOD have similar endoscopic findings and there are no endoscopic findings specific to MIVOD, it is very difficult to diagnose MIVOD with endoscopic findings alone. In addition, since the postoperative specimen revealed that the surface mucosal structure of the colon at the site where phlebitis and venous thrombus existed was relatively maintained, it seemed unlikely that secondary thrombus was formed by exacerbation of UC. Therefore, we contend that this case of MIVOD developed during the course of UC.

### Ischemic intestinal involvement in a patient with buerger disease: case report and literature review [^114stH9X]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old Japanese man who had undergone amputation of the left leg below the knee because of Buerger disease required emergency thrombectomy 7 months later. He complained of acute abdominal pain after thrombectomy. At aortography the distal superior mesenteric artery and its branches were not well visualized. Emergency laparotomy was performed because of suspected intestinal ischemia, and the terminal ileum and cecum and part of the ascending colon were resected. In total, the patient underwent laparotomy four times. Histopathologic findings revealed that the arteries and veins of the resected small intestine were occluded with organized thrombi. Inflammatory cell infiltration was recognized mainly in the intima. These findings are compatible with Buerger disease.

A young male patient with a history of heavy smoking and low-extremity Buerger's disease was operated on because of small bowel infarction. The postoperative histopathological diagnosis was mesenteric involvement of Buerger's disease. Mesenteric Buerger's disease is extremely rare, the early diagnosis is difficult, and the prognosis is poor. Considering the difficulty in diagnosis and the poor prognosis, patients with Buerger's disease presenting with gastrointestinal manifestations should be carefully evaluated, and early surgical intervention is recommended.

### Buerger's disease [^112MY63Y]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease of small- and medium-sized arteries of the distal extremities of predominantly young male tobacco users. Early symptoms may include episodic pain and coldness in fingers, and late findings may present as intermittent claudication, skin ulcers, or gangrene requiring eventual amputation. Tobacco cessation is the cornerstone of treatment. Other modalities of reducing pain or avoiding amputation have not been as successful. This review summarizes in tabular form the types of treatment that have been used, including therapeutic angiogenesis.

Brandon C.

Nine years later, after losing both his legs and several fingertips to this terrible disease, he quit smoking for good. Smokefree for 4 years now, Brandon hasn't had any more amputations, but he still must manage the consequences of being a double amputee. Brandon C. 's Biography Brandon, age 31, started smoking in his mid-teens, and by age 18, he was diagnosed with Buerger's disease, a disorder linked to tobacco use that causes blood vessels in the hands and feet to become blocked and can result in infection or gangrene. Although there is no cure for this disease, quitting tobacco use can stop the symptoms. "I was young. I didn't believe it. I was going to prove the doctors wrong, " says Brandon.

"Ultimately, it took 9 years and the amputation of both my legs and several fingertips for me to quit smoking". Smokefree for 4 years now, Brandon hasn't had any more amputations, but he still must manage the consequences of being a double amputee. "If I have to go to the bathroom in the night, I either have to put my legs on or crawl, " he says. "I can only spend a limited amount of time on my prosthetic legs or I run the risk of getting sores — then I have to use a wheelchair". Brandon is also keenly aware of the consequences for his loved ones. "My cigarette smoking affected so many people, " he says. "My parents, my wife, my daughter, and now my infant son. I can sit on the floor with him now when he's a baby, but when he gets older, I won't be able go out and run and play football with him. Smoking is never just about you". Brandon is participating in the Tips From Former Smokers ® campaign because he is disgusted by tobacco and wants people to quit using it.

"I took smoking too far, " he says. "Quit today, not tomorrow. You just don't know the consequences of that next cigarette. " More About Brandon C. More Related Stories More Real Stories about Buerger's Disease:

### Diatrizoate sodium (Hypaque sodium) [^117DUmgT]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

PERIPHERAL ANGIOGRAPHY

HYPAQUE sodium 50 percent may be administered for peripheral arteriography and for venography.

PRECAUTIONS

See PRECAUTIONS — General. Extreme caution is advised in considering peripheral arteriography in patients suspected of having thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) since any procedure (even insertion of a needle or catheter) may induce a severe arterial or venous spasm. Caution is also advisable in patients with severe ischemia associated with ascending infection.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

See ADVERSE REACTIONS — General. Soreness in extremities has also been reported.

Adverse reactions observed during peripheral arteriography may sometimes be due to arterial trauma during the procedure (ie, insertion of needle or catheter, subintimal injection, perforation) as well as to the hypertonicity or effect of the medium. Reported adverse reactions include transient arterial spasm, extravasation, hemorrhage, hematoma formation with tamponade, injury to nerves in close proximity to artery, thrombosis, dissecting aneurysm, arteriovenous fistula (eg, with accidental perforation of femoral artery and vein during the needing), and transient leg pain from contraction of calf muscles in femoral arteriography. Transient hypotension has been reported after intra-arterial (brachial) injection of the medium. Also, brachial plexus injury has been reported with axillary artery injections.

During venography in the presence of venous stasis, inflammatory changes and thrombosis may occur. Thrombosis is rare if the vein is irrigated following the injection.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Diagnostic arteriograms may be obtained with 25 mL to 35 mL of HYPAQUE sodium 50 percent introduced into the larger peripheral arteries by percutaneous or operative methods. Visualization of veins in the extremities may be accomplished with 15 mL to 40 mL.

AORTOGRAPHY

HYPAQUE sodium 50 percent may be administered intravenously or intra-arterially by accepted techniques to visualize the aorta and its major branches.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans or Buerger's disease: challenges for the rheumatologist [^111SgibC]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) — a type of vasculitis in young, mostly male subjects — remains strangely linked to smoking, which determines its occurrence, progression and prognosis by currently unknown mechanisms. It affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins of the limbs. Despite the usual absence of systemic signs and symptoms, initially intermittent arthritis, even if not observed in all cases, confer on this disease the status of a systemic vasculitis. Diagnosis requires the elimination of many other diseases. The severity of the disease lies in the need for amputation in more than a quarter of all patients. Complete cessation of smoking remains the cornerstone of therapy. Local care is the second essential element of treatment. Prostacycline analogues can be used to help the patient through critical ischaemia. Blockade with antagonists of cannabinoid or endothelin receptors and the use of gene- or cell-based therapy to induce therapeutic angiogenesis have opened up new possibilities for treatment.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^111A94br]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

We observed only 3 deaths. TAO is not a life‐threatening disease. Previous series have reported a 6% death rate. 6, 16 However, the functional prognosis is seriously impaired. The 10‐and 15‐year amputation rate was 26% and 34%, respectively, in our study. In other series with a time‐dependent evaluation of amputations, the amputation rate ranged between 20% and 50% at 10 years. 7, 14, 18 The lower rate of amputation in our cohort compared with previous published reports could be explained by the difference of severity of patients across reports. Thirty percent of our TAO patients had ischemic ulcers or necrosis at baseline, whereas it was observed in 45% to 80% of patients in other cohorts. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 The study by Fazeli et al, who reported a similar amputation rate (ie, 30%) as in our cohort, had a similar percentage of ischemic ulcers and gangrene (ie, 20%–23%) at baseline. 20

### Buerger's disease in the 21st century: diagnosis, clinical features, and therapy [^113VMMZA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans or TAO) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the development of segmental thrombotic occlusions of the medium and small arteries of the extremities. It is clinically and pathologically distinguishable from arteriosclerosis and necrotizing arteritis. Afflicted patients are mostly young, male, inveterate tobacco smokers who present with distal extremity ischemia, ischemic ulcers, or frank gangrene of the toes or fingers. Large arteries are typically spared, as are the coronary, cerebral, and visceral circulations. While mortality is not increased, patients with Buerger's disease often suffer from severe ischemic pain and tissue loss culminating in minor and major limb amputation. Clinical diagnostic criteria generally include the following: (1) history of smoking or tobacco abuse; (2) age of onset less than 45 to 50 years; (3) infrapopliteal, segmental arterial occlusions with sparing of the proximal vasculature; (4) frequent distal upper extremity arterial involvement (Raynaud's syndrome or digital ulceration); (5) superficial phlebitis; and (6) exclusion of arteriosclerosis, diabetes, true arteritis, proximal embolic source, and hypercoagulable states. Typical arteriographic patterns have been described that are suggestive, but not pathognomonic. While the cause of Buerger's disease remains unknown, the disease onset and clinical course are inextricably linked to tobacco abuse. Acute Buerger's disease is characterized histopathologically by intensely cellular vessel wall inflammation, giant cell foci, and hypercellular thrombi, but with preservation of the elastic lamina and the overall vascular wall architecture. Most investigators feel that Buerger's disease is an immune-mediated endarteritis; recent immunocytochemical studies have identified the linear deposition of immunoglobulins and complement factors along the elastic lamina. The inciting antigen has not been discovered. Tobacco abstinence generally results in disease quiescence and remains the mainstay of treatment.

### Buerger's disease in a 19-year-old woman [^113Krxta]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old female college student had numbness and the sensation of coldness of her left toes. She had a 3-year smoking history. Gangrene of the left foot developed rapidly. Angiography revealed peripheral arterial occlusion of both legs and arms. Detailed laboratory examination excluded collagen disease, a hypercoagulable state, and juvenile atherosclerosis. Below-knee amputation of the left leg was performed. Typical histologic findings of Buerger's disease were observed in the crural arteries and saphenous veins. The clinical course was uneventful after the patient stopped smoking. This is the second case report of Buerger's disease in a woman in the second decade of life. It is important that a correct diagnosis of Buerger's disease be established, because the disease process is benign, compared with collagen disease, if the patient stops smoking.

### Smoking and Buerger's disease… [^115DBXDE]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Smoking and Buerger's Disease Buerger's disease affects blood vessels in the body, most commonly in the arms and legs. Blood vessels swell, which can prevent blood flow, causing clots to form. This can lead to pain, tissue damage, and even gangrene. 1 In some cases, amputation may be required. 2 The most common symptoms of Buerger's disease are: 2
- Fingers or toes that appear pale, red, or bluish
- Cold hands or feet
- Pain in the hands and feet that may feel like burning or tingling
- Pain in the legs, ankles, or feet when walking — often located in the arch of the foot
- Skin changes or small painful sores on the fingers or toes. The exact cause of Buerger's disease is unknown, however tobacco use is strongly linked to its development. 3 Researchers believe that chemicals in tobacco may irritate the lining of the blood vessels, causing them to swell.

3 Almost everyone diagnosed with Buerger's disease smokes cigarettes or uses other forms of tobacco, such as cigars and chewing tobacco. 3 If you want to prevent getting Buerger's disease, don't smoke cigarettes or use any other tobacco products. 1 There is no cure for Buerger's disease. The only way to keep Buerger's disease from getting worse is to stop using all tobacco products. Medicines don't usually work well to treat the disease, but can help control the symptoms. 2 Surgery may help restore blood flow to some areas. 1 It may be necessary to amputate the hand or foot if infection or widespread tissue death occurs.

Nonhealing lower-extremity wounds with normal physiological testing — alternative diagnoses and distinguishing features: Alternative diagnoses include venous ulcer, distal small arterial occlusion (microangiopathy), local injury, medication related, neuropathic, autoimmune injury, infection, malignancy, and inflammatory. Venous ulcer typically occurs at the distal leg, especially above the medial malleolus and develops in regions of skin changes due to chronic venous disease and local venous hypertension and is typically wet (i.e., wound drainage) rather than dry lesion. Distal small arterial occlusion (microangiopathy) involves toes, foot, leg with causes including diabetic microangiopathy, end-stage renal disease, thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's), sickle-cell anemia, vasculitides, scleroderma, cryoagglutination, embolic, and thrombotic etiologies. Neuropathic ulcers occur at pressure zones of foot and may show hyperkeratosis surrounds the ulcer with diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy without diabetes mellitus, and leprosy.

### Pregnancy complicated with Buerger's disease [^116D5m3v]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

Buerger's disease is an inflammatory occlusive vascular disorder involving small- and medium-sized arteries in the distal extremities and is usually complicated with thrombophlebitis. Since Buerger's disease develops most frequently in men who smoke, pregnancy complicated with this disease is extremely rare. Only three pregnancies have been reported previously. All cases indicate that Buerger's disease worsens during pregnancy. However, anti-coagulant therapy appeared to be effective in this case. Accordingly, careful observation is mandatory in pregnancies complicated with Buerger's disease.

### Update on thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease)… [^113YhpXi]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a nonatherosclerotic inflammatory disease of the small-sized and medium-sized arteries and veins of the arms and legs. Although inflammatory by nature, it spares the blood vessel walls. Unlike other types of vasculitis, the acute-phase reactants are normal in patients with Buerger's disease. A pathologic finding of acute disease is an occlusive, highly cellular, inflammatory thrombus. The disease is found worldwide, but the highest incidence of thromboangiitis obliterans occurs in the Middle East and Far East. Prevalence ranges from about 12 percent in the United States to 63 percent in India to 80 percent among Jews of Ashkenazi ancestry living in Israel. Part of this difference in disease incidence may be due to variability in diagnostic criteria. Olin reviewed the current concepts of this disease.

Although the cause of Buerger's disease is unknown, the strongest association is with tobacco use. Occurrences of the disease have been reported, but uncommonly, in persons who use smokeless tobacco or snuff. A current or previous history of smoking is usually a required diagnostic criterion. The onset of Buerger's disease occurs between 40 and 45 years of age, and men are most commonly affected. It begins with ischemia of the distal small vessels of the arms, legs, hands and feet. Patients often present with claudications in affected limbs and progress to ischemic pain at rest and ulcerations of the toes or fingers. Claudications in the foot or arch may be misdiagnosed as an orthopedic problem. More proximal arteries may bcome involved as the disease progresses. If a proximal source of embolization is suspected, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography and arteriography should be performed.

Angiographic findings include severe distal, segmental occlusive lesions, but the more proximal arteries are normal. The only truly effective treatment for thromboangiitis obliterans is smoking cessation or discontinuation of tobacco-containing products. In one study, 94 percent of affected persons who quit smoking avoided amputations compared with 57 percent who continued to smoke. Therapy with intravenous iloprost has been studied.

Medical and noninterventional management — Reported adjunctive therapies and conservative care: Respondents reported widespread routine use of antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents, ACEIs, and vasoactive drugs (such as cilostazol and pentoxifylline), while anticoagulants were used selectively. IV prostanoids and vasodilators were used by some as adjuncts to revascularization and in those with nonreconstructible disease. Use of arterial assist devices (compression pump), HBOT, and SCS was uncommon, and lumbar sympathectomy was performed by a third of respondents, possible in patients with Buerger's disease.

### Hypotensive unawareness in Parkinson's disease-related autonomic dysfunction [^1148F5sQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

This case demonstrates how orthostatic hypotension in the absence of typical symptoms of light-headedness/dizziness when changing posture, can contribute to the burden of falls in Parkinson's disease. At least one-third of people with severe orthostatic hypotension do not report typical symptoms, and this figure appears to be higher in patients with Parkinson's disease. This is important clinically as it can increase the difficulty in ascribing falls to orthostatic hypotension, especially given the other competing reasons in Parkinson's disease and orthostatic hypotension symptoms can act as a prompt for the patient to act to prevent falls-related injuries. There is a clinical requirement, therefore, to screen for and manage orthostatic hypotension in patients with Parkinson's disease to prevent falls, even in those who do not report typical symptoms.

### CT angiography and MRI of hand vascular lesions: technical considerations and spectrum of imaging findings [^114JHgQC]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans

Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a rare, non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology. It typically affects young male smokers (younger than 45 years). Cannabis use has also been implicated. Although Buerger's disease has a worldwide distribution, it is more prevalent in the Middle East and Far East than in North America and Western Europe.

This disease primarily affects small- and medium-sized arteries and veins in the upper and lower extremities, usually beginning in the small distal vessels, resulting in distal ischaemia. As the disease progresses, it may involve more proximal arteries. The upper limbs are affected in 25% of cases. Arthralgia and even arthritis are present in 12% of cases. Superficial venous thrombosis is also a typical finding.

CTA, MRA, or angiography shows involvement of the small- and medium-sized vessels in the upper (and lower) extremities, including the palmar and plantar arches, the RA and UA, and the digital arteries of the fingers (Fig. 4). The most common imaging findings are segmental occlusive lesions with bridging or corkscrew collaterals around the areas of occlusion. The disease tends to be more severe distally, with interspersed normal vessels. There should be no evidence of atherosclerosis or other proximal source of emboli (e.g. dissections or aneurysms).

The cornerstone of treatment of Buerger's disease is strict abstinence from exposure to all tobacco-containing products. Vasodilator therapy with iloprost should be considered in acute phases, and bypass surgery may be indicated for limb salvage in critical ischaemia.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^116C75ps]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study in referral centers from the French TAO network between 1970 and 2016. We identified 224 patients fulfilling Papa's criteria 9 for TAO. This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was waived.

Exclusion criteria were evidence of proximal emboli or atherosclerotic disease, thrombophilia, connective‐tissue disease (ie, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective‐tissue disease), and diabetes mellitus.

Baseline clinical characteristics included age at onset and diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, clinical history, tobacco use (pack‐year), other addictions and drugs exposure, cardiovascular risk factors, associated diseases, main clinical (claudication, limb ischemia defined as rest pain and skin color change, ischemic ulcers or necrosis defined as tissue loss, limb infection, phlebitis, arthralgia, Raynaud phenomenon), biological features (complete blood count, serum creatinine, C‐reactive protein levels), and treatments.

Ethnicity was defined as the country of origin of the patient's parents and grandparents, and subjects were classified into 1 of the following defined ethnic groups: white and nonwhite (ie, North African, sub‐Saharan African, and Middle or Far East. Three patients who originated from Turkey were classified as nonwhite).

Definitions of Study End Points

A vascular event was defined as an acute worsening of the disease course requiring treatment modification (ie, occurrence of a claudication worsening, a limb ischemia, ulcers, necrosis, a superficial vein thrombosis, and/or a limb infection related to ischemia or death).

An amputation was defined as major if it involved the tibiotarsal articulation for lower limbs and if it involved the metacarpo‐phalangeal articulation for upper limbs.

At each visit, criteria for disease activity were assessed based on symptoms assessment, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. Clinical evaluation, duplex‐ultrasound, angio–computed tomography, and/or angiography were performed every 6 months or sooner if there was suspicion of disease flare or disease progression.

Smoking Cessation

Smoking patients at diagnosis who stopped their consumption at 1 year were considered as ex‐smokers. Their smoking status was checked at each visit based on self‐declaration. If they declared that they had resumed their consumption during follow‐up or at the amputation, they were considered as smokers.

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^1166g87D]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The symptoms of Buerger's disease are caused by stenosis and occlusion of small blood vessels, which leads to ischemia typically of the upper and lower extremities. The patients suffer from intermittent claudication of the upper and lower extremities, rest pain, ulcers and gangrene, Raynaud's phenomenon, change of skin colour, tingling and numbness of fingers and toes. Although the typical signs and symptoms connected with the extremities are well known, other manifestations of the disease seem understated. Fakour and Fazeli conducted a systematic review, in which they presented 78 case reports, 2 case series and 3 original papers concerning the involvement of the following organs in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans: the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, the central nervous system, the eye, the kidneys, the urogenital system, the mucocutaneous zones, the joints, the lymphohematopoietic system and the ear. In some patients the involvement of other organs had been noted long before the diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans whereas in others the first signs and symptoms later linked to Buerger's disease began after the diagnosis. The results of Fakour and Fazeli's study seem to be consistent with the findings of Leo Burger, who observed visceral arterial involvement in the patients with thromboangiitis obliterans he had examined. According to Fakour and Fazeli, neglecting a possible systemic character of the disease might be unfavourable for the patients. Olin et al also stated that some larger blood vessels (eg cerebral, coronary, pulmonary, mesenteric, renal) might be affected by the disease. Cabezas-Moya and Dragstedt described intestinal involvement of thromboangiitis obliterans in a patient, and Harten et al observed cerebral, splenic, pulmonary and myocardial signs of the disease.

### Preliminary criteria for classification of adult Still's disease [^112Zyi6P]. The Journal of Rheumatology (1992). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Yamaguchi diagnostic criteria for adult-onset Still's disease" for adult-onset Still's disease.

The Yamaguchi diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator used for the diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). This scoring system applies to adult patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of AOSD, a rare systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by high spiking fevers, arthritis or arthralgia, and a distinctive salmon-colored rash.

The clinical utility of the Yamaguchi diagnostic criteria lies in its ability to help clinicians differentiate AOSD from other conditions with similar presentations, such as infections, malignancies, and other rheumatic diseases. It includes both major and minor criteria, with the diagnosis of AOSD being made if the patient meets at least 5 criteria, including at least 2 major ones.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include the presence of infections, malignancies, and other rheumatic diseases that could explain the patient's symptoms. It's important to note that the Yamaguchi diagnostic criteria is not definitive, and a high index of clinical suspicion is still required for the diagnosis of AOSD.

The Yamaguchi diagnostic criteria for adult-onset Still's disease calculator evaluates whether a patient meets the diagnostic criteria based on user inputs regarding major and minor clinical signs.

The input consists of two sets of criteria: major criteria and minor criteria.

Major Criteria Options:

- Fever > 39 degrees C, lasting ≥ 1 week
- Arthralgia or arthritis, lasting ≥ 2 weeks
- Typical rash (a nonpruritic macular or maculopapular rash with a salmon-colored appearance, usually seen over the trunk or extremities during febrile episodes)
- Leukocytosis > 10,000/mm³, with > 80% polymorphonuclear cells

Minor Criteria Options:

- Sore throat
- Recent development of significant lymphadenopathy
- Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly
- Abnormal liver function tests (particularly aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase elevations)
- Negative tests for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor

The calculator processes the input by checking the combination of selected criteria. A diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease is indicated if:

1. There are at least 2 major criteria present, combined with at least 2 minor criteria.
2. The specific combinations of major criteria other than two may also satisfy the diagnostic requirement if they align with Yamaguchi's outlined criteria.

However, if these conditions are not met, the diagnostic criteria are not satisfied. If no selections are made, the result prompts the user to make a selection.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the criteria are evaluated:

1. If Fever and Arthralgia/arthritis are both selected, then the presence of any combination of three minor criteria is checked.
2. If Fever and Rash are both selected, then the presence of any combination of three minor criteria is checked.
3. If Fever and Leukocytosis are both selected, then the presence of any combination of three minor criteria is checked.
4. If Arthralgia/arthritis and Rash are both selected, then the presence of any combination of three minor criteria is checked.
5. If Arthralgia/arthritis and Leukocytosis are both selected, then the presence of any combination of three minor criteria is checked.
6. If Rash and Leukocytosis are both selected, then the presence of any combination of three minor criteria is checked.
7. If combinations of three major criteria with two minor criteria are met as provided in specific patterns, this satisfies the criteria.
8. If all four major criteria are met, even one minor criterion, or any combination of two or more minor criteria, confirms the diagnosis.

The output is a straightforward result that informs whether the diagnostic criteria are met or not based on these rules and combinations.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease) [^115HzqwP]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thromboangiitis obliterans is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease that affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins in the upper and lower extremities. This review will help to familiarize physicians with this vasculitis that is completely different from every other type of vasculitis encountered.

Recent Findings

While tobacco is central to the initiation and continuance of Buerger's disease activity, two interesting pathophysiologic observations have been made. There is endothelial dysfunction in arteries not yet clinically or angiographically involved in thromboangiitis obliterans. There are elevated levels of anti-endothelial cell antibodies and measurement of these antibody titers may be useful in following disease activity in Buerger's disease patients. The only therapy clearly shown to prevent amputation is the complete abstinence of tobacco. There is exciting work under way on the use of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists to help patients stop smoking. In addition, preliminary results on use of therapeutic angiogenesis in patients with Buerger's disease has demonstrated excellent collateral blood vessels formation and clinical improvement.

Summary

The difficulty in studying rare diseases such as thromboangiitis obliterans is that there are no significant research dollars available and even the most active centers only see a few patients per year. Therefore, there has been little progress in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. There are new therapeutic modalities that help patients with this disease, however, and patients can be assured that if they are able to discontinue tobacco use completely, amputation will not occur if critical limb ischemia is not already present.

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^113Nz4Wu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The involvement of the eye in the course of systemic diseases has been the topic of extensive research. In some disorders ocular manifestations have been found to be one of the first signs and symptoms. In others, however, they develop as complications secondary to the initial health problem. The connection between the eye and diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sarcoidosis or multiple sclerosis has been studied for many years. In recent years some interesting links between rare diseases and ocular findings have been observed. Kreuzpointner et al described ophthalmological complications of Lemierre syndrome. The ocular involvement and the role of optical coherence tomography in Fabry disease was studied by Wiest et al. Multimodal imaging was shown by Böni et al to be effective in disclosing choroidal lesions in patients with disseminated Mycobacterium chimaera infection. Carneval et al demonstrated how useful optical coherence tomography angiography was in revealing ocular vascular changes in patients with systemic sclerosis. Even though extensive research has been conducted in the field of systemic diseases and their impact on the eye, we have failed to find a review discussing a possible link between Buerger's disease and some ocular findings.

Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a disease of primarily small and medium arteries and veins of the arms and legs. It was first reported by an Austrian physician Felix von Winiwarter in 1879, however, it was named after an Austrian American physician Leo Buerger, whose description of the pathological basis was very accurate (1908). The highest prevalence of the disease is in the Middle and Far East. It constitutes 45% to 63% of all patients with peripheral arterial disease in India as opposed to Western Europe, where it accounts for 0.5 to 5.6%. The annual incidence in the United States is equal to 12.6 per 100,000. The disease usually affects tobacco smoking men under 45 years of age. The ratio of men to women suffering from thromboangiitis obliterans equals 10:1 respectively. Smoking tobacco has been proven to be one of the main risk factors. However, it was discovered that the disease might also affect smokeless tobacco users (eg tobacco chewers). Another risk factor is chronic gum disease, although the reasons for it are still unknown. When left untreated, Buerger's disease may lead to the development of gangrene because of insufficient blood supply. The most important form of prevention is quitting smoking.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans: 110 Years old and little progress made [^111m9Yn3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the difficulties in doing research on rare diseases, Le Joncour and colleagues have added to the knowledge base regarding outcomes in patients with Buerger's disease. As they noted, this is the largest study of patients with TAO from Western Europe and the United States. It is important to recognize that it took 46 years to accumulate a sample size of 224 patients and longitudinal follow‐up is very difficult in patients with TAO. Thus, there are gaps in our understanding of the natural history in patients with Buerger's disease. The authors confirmed that cessation of tobacco use leads to a better prognosis. They also showed us that milder signs and symptoms at presentation leads to better outcomes and fewer amputations. Thus, it is important to recognize the signs and symptoms pointing to Buerger's disease so that it can be diagnosed earlier, with a goal of preventing major and minor amputations. Those who have advanced disease are more likely to have limb infection, which leads to a high likelihood of needing an amputation.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common reason for referral to neurology. Chronic acquired demyelinating neuropathies are an important and varied group with overlapping presentations, and may have an immune-mediated cause. Their correct diagnosis is important as they respond to different treatments; timely intervention can prevent irreversible axonal degeneration. We present a case that highlights the approach to an adult presenting with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^116qCKJe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

We acknowledge some limitations in our study. Our analysis was performed as a retrospective review. We were unable to collect complete longitudinal data on patients who were seen only on an intermittent consultation basis. Because of the retrospective design of this study, smoking status was made by self‐declaration and patients may have been misclassified. For further prospective studies, tests for carboxyhemoglobin level and urine nicotine level should be obtained. Prospective enrollment and data collection from the time of diagnosis would have been ideal but are difficult to achieve with such rare diseases.

In conclusion, this French nationwide study shows that 34% of TAO patents are likely to experience an amputation within 15 years of initial diagnosis. Nonwhite patients and limb infection at diagnosis were independently associated with the occurrence of vascular events. Limb infection at diagnosis was associated with a 4‐fold higher risk of amputation. We further confirmed that smoking cessation was strongly associated with a lower rate of vascular events and amputation.

Amputations

Forty‐eight patients had at least 1 amputation (including amputation before the diagnosis) and among them 24 had more than 1 (Table 3). Amputations were more frequent in the lower limb, as 38 of the 48 patients (79%) had an amputation in lower limbs. Amputation remained exclusively minor in 33 of the 48 patients (66%). Amputation‐free survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 85%, 74%, and 66%, respectively. Major amputation‐free survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 94%, 91%, and 91%, respectively (Figure 2 A). In the univariate analysis, limb infection at diagnosis was associated with 15‐year amputation‐free survival (HR, 9.46; 95% CI, 2.81–31.8: P < 0.001). Cannabis consumption was not associated with a poor prognosis. In the multivariate analysis, limb infection at diagnosis (HR, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.5–42.1: P < 0.001) was associated with a higher amputation rate (limb ischemia, ischemic ulcers/necrosis, limb infection, and arthralgia were the variables used in the multivariable model). Kaplan‐Meier curve of amputation‐free survival in patients with TAO according to symptoms at diagnosis is shown in Figure 2 B.

Because the study spanned 50 years, we assessed whether the year of diagnosis modified the amputation‐free survival rate. Year of diagnosis (disease diagnosed before versus in/after 2007, being the median year of diagnosis) has no significant effect on amputation‐free survival (HR = 0.62 [0.29–1.31], P = 0.21). Nevertheless, we conducted a sensitivity analysis stratified on year of diagnosis (variable coded as described above) with no major changes on results.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^117PECFx]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease

The term PD can be used both in the presence of a clinically established Parkinson syndrome and in the context of specific symptom constellations that indicate the future development of a Parkinson syndrome, such as premotor or prodromal PD. In the vast majority of cases, PD is non-inheritable and referred to as "sporadic PD". Sporadic PD is a Lewy body disease that results in a Parkinson syndrome. In rare cases, mutations (e.g. in the genes SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA1) can be identified, which are then classified as "hereditary Parkinson syndromes". Parkinson syndromes associated with mutations in other genes (e.g. VPS35, DJ1, PARKIN, and PINK1) typically do not exhibit the typical histopathological features of Lewy body disease. Hereditary PD should be reported with the specific nomenclature recommended by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force (e.g. PARK- VPS35) (Table 2).

Preclinical PD is defined as Lewy body disease in a very early stage that does not yet exhibit obvious motor or non-motor clinical signs (Table 2).

Premotor PD is characterized by Lewy body disease in an early stage that, at the time of examination, only presents non-motor symptoms, such as REM sleep behavior disorder, olfactory dysfunction, and/or depression (Table 2).

Prodromal PD refers to Lewy body disease in an early stage that, at the time of examination, exhibits non-motor symptoms and only mild-motor symptoms but does not yet meet the criteria for the diagnosis of classical Parkinson syndrome (Table 2).

PD with dementia (PDD) is defined as advanced-stage Lewy body disease accompanied by a neurocognitive disorder occurring more than 1 year after the manifestation of motor symptoms of PD (Table 2).

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is defined as Lewy body disease primarily presenting as a neurocognitive disorder, with the onset preceding or following the appearance of motor symptoms of PD by less than 1 year. Neuropathological examination of DLB typically reveals higher stages of Alzheimer-associated changes (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) compared to pure PDD (Table 2).

The term Lewy body dementia refers to all types of dementia associated with Lewy body disease (i.e. an umbrella term for PDD and DLB) (Table 2).

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^115RU3mq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

What also seems noteworthy is the involvement of the eye in other types of vasculitis. The prevalence of ocular symptoms is significant in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (50%), Behçet's disease (60%-80) and giant cell arteritis (12%-70%). One third of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus develop ocular signs and symptoms, too. This made us raise the question whether thromboangiitis obliterans is localized vasculopathy or a systemic disorder like the diseases mentioned above.

The aim of this study was to review current knowledge on the topic of ocular manifestations in Buerger's disease and raise awareness on the possible systemic character of the disease.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^111tojNP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Data regarding long-term outcome of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans are lacking and most series come from India and Japan. In this study, we assess long-term outcome and prognostic factors in a large cohort of thromboangiitis obliterans. Methods and Results Retrospective multicenter study of characteristics and outcomes of 224 thromboangiitis obliterans patients fulfilling Papa's criteria were analyzed. Factors associated with vascular events and amputations were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 38.5 (32–46) years, 51 (23.8%) patients were female, and 81.7% were whites. After a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, vascular events were observed in 58.9%, amputations in 21.4%, and death in 1.4%. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year vascular event-free survival and amputation-free survival were 41% and 85%, 23% and 74%, and 19% and 66%, respectively. Ethnic group (nonwhite) (hazard ratio 2.35 [1.30–4.27] P = 0.005) and limb infection at diagnosis (hazard ratio 3.29 [1.02–10.6] P = 0.045) were independent factors of vascular event-free survival. Factor associated with amputation was limb infection (hazard ratio 12.1 [3.5–42.1], P < 0.001). Patients who stopped their tobacco consumption had lower risk of amputation (P = 0.001) than those who continued. Conclusions This nationwide study shows that 34% of thromboangiitis obliterans patients will experience an amputation within 15 years from diagnosis. We identified high-risk patients for vascular complications and amputations.

### Diatrizoate meglumine (Hypaque sodium) [^113o56qZ]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

PERIPHERAL ARTERIOGRAPHY AND VENOGRAPHY

Indications

HYPAQUE meglumine 60 percent may be administered for peripheral arteriography and for venography.

Precautions

See PRECAUTIONS — General. Extreme caution is advised in considering peripheral arteriography in patients suspected of having thromboangiitis obliterans (Buergers disease) since any procedure (even insertion of a needle or catheter) may induce a severe arterial or venous spasm. Caution is also advisable in patients with severe ischemia associated with ascending infection.

Adverse Reactions

See ADVERSE REACTIONS — General. Soreness in extremities has also been reported.

Adverse reactions observed during peripheral arteriography may sometimes be due to arterial trauma during the procedure (ie, insertion of needle or catheter, subintimal injection, perforation) as well as to the hypertonicity or effect of the medium. Reported adverse reactions include transient arterial spasm, extravasation, hemorrhage, hematoma formation with tamponade, injury to nerves in close proximity to artery, thrombosis, dissecting aneurysm, arteriovenous fistula (eg, with accidental perforation of femoral artery and vein during the needing), and transient leg pain from contraction of calf muscles in femoral arteriography. Transient hypotension has been reported after intra-arterial (brachial) injection of the medium. Also, brachial plexus injury has been reported with axillary artery injections.

During venography in the presence of venous stasis, inflammatory changes and thrombosis may occur. Thrombosis is rare if the vein is irrigated following the injection.

Dosage and Administration

Diagnostic arteriograms may be obtained with 20 mL to 40 mL of HYPAQUE meglumine 60 percent introduced into the larger peripheral arteries by percutaneous or operative methods. Visualization of veins in the extremities may be accomplished with 10 mL to 20 mL.

Contraindication

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is contraindicated in patients with coagulation defects and prolonged prothrombin times until normal, or near normal, coagulation is achieved (eg, with vitamin K).

Precautions

In the presence of acute pancreatitis, direct cholangiography, if necessary, should be employed with caution, injecting no more than 5 mL to 10 mL without undue pressure.

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography should only be attempted when compatible blood for potential transfusions is in readiness and emergency surgical measures are available. The patient should be carefully monitored for at least 24 hours to insure prompt detection of bile leakage and hemorrhage. Cholespastic premedication, as with morphine, should be avoided. Respiratory movements should be controlled during introduction of the needle.

### Pharmacological treatment for Buerger's disease [^116PVXBc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a non-atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The aetiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularisation to improve the condition. Pharmacological treatment is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischaemic ulcers or rest pain. This is an update of the review first published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of any pharmacological agent (intravenous or oral) compared with placebo or any other pharmacological agent in patients with Buerger's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 15 October 2019. The review authors searched LILACS, ISRCTN, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, EU Clinical Trials Register, clincialtrials.gov and the OpenGrey Database to 5 January 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving pharmacological agents used in the treatment of Buerger's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis.

Main Results

No new studies were identified for this update. Five randomised controlled trials (total 602 participants) compared prostacyclin analogue with placebo, aspirin, or a prostaglandin analogue, and folic acid with placebo. No studies assessed other pharmacological agents such as cilostazol, clopidogrel and pentoxifylline or compared oral versus intravenous prostanoid. Compared with aspirin, intravenous prostacyclin analogue iloprost improved ulcer healing (risk ratio (RR) 2.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 6.11; 98 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), and helped to eradicate rest pain after 28 days (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.52; 133 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), although amputation rates were similar six months after treatment (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.15; 95 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). When comparing prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) with prostaglandin (alprostadil) analogues, ulcer healing was similar (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.69; 89 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence), as was the eradication of rest pain after 28 days (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.72 to 3.44; 38 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), while amputation rates were not measured. Compared with placebo, the effects of oral prostacyclin analogue iloprost were similar for: healing ischaemic ulcers (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.54 to 2.29; 133 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.93; 135 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), eradication of rest pain after eight weeks (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.63; 207 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.59; 201 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), and amputation rates after six months (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56; 209 participants; 1 study, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.31; 213 participants; 1 study). When comparing folic acid with placebo in patients with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia, pain scores were similar, there were no new cases of amputation in either group, and ulcer healing was not assessed (very low-certainty evidence). Treatment side effects such as headaches, flushing or nausea were not associated with treatment interruptions or more serious consequences. Outcomes such as amputation-free survival, walking distance or pain-free walking distance, and ankle brachial index were not assessed by any study. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low to moderate, with few studies, small numbers of participants, variation in severity of disease of participants between studies and missing information (for example regarding baseline tobacco exposure).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that intravenous iloprost (prostacyclin analogue) is more effective than aspirin for eradicating rest pain and healing ischaemic ulcers in Buerger's disease, but oral iloprost is not more effective than placebo. Very low and low-certainty evidence suggests there is no clear difference between prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) and the prostaglandin analogue alprostadil for healing ulcers and relieving pain respectively in severe Buerger's disease. Very low-certainty evidence suggests there is no clear difference in pain scores and amputation rates between folic acid and placebo, in people with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia. Further well designed RCTs assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents (intravenous or oral) in people with Buerger's disease are needed.

### On the definition of dermatological disease. part 2: approaches for defining dermatological diseases [^11153bDe]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical approaches

The visual nature of skin diseases facilitates simple descriptive approaches based on distribution, configuration and morphology. Such descriptive approaches, supplemented with histology findings or circulating blood abnormalities, are appropriate in defining disease for clinical work, especially if they become refined as more becomes known about that disease (progressive nosology, described in Part 1). However, problems arise when groups of people need to be compared in clinical research as some clinical signs may not be present in some patients, or histology findings may be supportive but not diagnostic. Definitions using criteria that can consistently define similar groups of people are needed.

Consensus‐based definitions, produced when a group of experts from a country or group of countries get together and suggest diagnostic criteria, are popular. Although the need for consensus implies lack of consensus, it is a convenient first step in disease definition, especially when disease knowledge is scanty. Older consensus criteria often involved a round table of experts proposing cardinal features for a skin disease. The Hanifin and Rajka diagnostic criteria for AD are a good example of such criteria suggested by experts (Table 1). They represented a major milestone in describing the phenotype of AD for clinical practice, but the list of all possible markers is too cumbersome for comparing large groups of people, and features such as 'tendency towards cutaneous infection' are inadequately defined.

Table 1
The Hanifin and Rajka diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis.

The concept of what a typical case of a common disease such as AD looks like may differ between countries, so it is essential that consensus is conducted at a global level if the emergent criteria are to be used globally. Methodologically rigorous consensus approaches using formal Delphi consensus methods and qualitative work with patients and carers are now used. Several such consensus criteria, have been developed for skin diseases and are generally a good starting point for making comparisons.

Epidemiological approaches

Epidemiological approaches offer a scientific approach to reducing a long list of all possible diagnostic features into a minimum list of reliable discriminators. Such an approach was used in developing the UK refinement of the Hanifin and Rajka criteria. Using a case–control approach, the frequency, validity and reliability of symptoms and signs of AD in typical cases and controls with other skin diseases were evaluated in a blinded fashion,(Table 2). Other researchers have used similar methodological approaches successfully.
