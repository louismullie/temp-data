vertigo causes

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of the causes of vertigo, organized by mechanism and with diagnostic and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the core framework for classifying vertigo. Then, I should verify the most common peripheral and central etiologies and their distinguishing features. Next, I will review emergency diagnostic algorithms and the role of bedside oculomotor testing. After that, I need to check imaging indications and common pitfalls. Finally, I will consider special populations, comorbidities, and synthesize a practical approach to the differential diagnosis and initial management, ensuring I continuously validate claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions and classification, because mislabeling dizziness versus vertigo derails the differential early. Vertigo is the illusion of motion when none is occurring, whereas dizziness is impaired spatial orientation without a false sense of motion; importantly, patients often conflate these, so I should not overinterpret descriptors without correlating timing and triggers [^113sqQmb] [^114G7oBs]. The modern, validated approach categorizes presentations by timing and triggers into acute vestibular syndrome, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, and chronic vestibular syndrome, which organizes the differential and guides bedside testing and imaging decisions [^1113UFCo] [^1174MQ9F].

> I will now examine the most common peripheral vestibular causes, starting with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, because missing it is a frequent error with real consequences. BPPV is the most common vestibular disorder, driven by canalithiasis of otoconia in the semicircular canals, producing brief, positional vertigo with characteristic torsional upbeating nystagmus on Dix-Hallpike; it is highly treatable with canalith repositioning maneuvers and should not be confused with central positional nystagmus, which lacks latency and fatigability and may be bidirectional or vertical [^113emS71] [^114SbFtg] [^1118vnru]. Wait, let me verify the epidemiology: lifetime prevalence estimates around 2–3% are consistent across population and clinic cohorts, and BPPV accounts for roughly 17–42% of vertigo in some series, which aligns with guideline summaries and contemporary reviews [^112z8U4J] [^114pmFbF] [^113emS71].

> Next, I should review vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis, since they anchor the acute vestibular syndrome category. Vestibular neuritis presents with severe, continuous vertigo lasting days, absent auditory symptoms, and a unilateral vestibular hypofunction pattern on head impulse testing; labyrinthitis shares the acute vestibulopathy but adds hearing loss and tinnitus, indicating end-organ involvement, and both are commonly preceded by a viral prodrome [^112b1x5y]. Hold on, I should verify treatment nuances: short-course corticosteroids within 72 hours are reasonable to consider in vestibular neuritis, though evidence quality is limited and shared decision-making is advised, and early vestibular rehabilitation accelerates recovery and reduces chronic compensation deficits [^113gwVdV] [^111qjy1c].

> Let me consider Ménière's disease carefully, because it is frequently misattributed to "migraine" when cochlear symptoms are underrecognized. Ménière's disease is defined by recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 12–24 hours with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; endolymphatic hydrops is the pathophysiologic hallmark, and diagnosis is clinical with audiometry rather than vestibular testing or ECOG in routine practice [^117MFVht] [^112hapz6] [^115mFM4w]. I should double-check the prevalence estimate: around 190 per 100,000 in the US is consistent with contemporary summaries, and the disease course is variable but often manageable with salt restriction, diuretics, and in refractory cases intratympanic therapy or surgical options [^112hapz6] [^114T3Wn1].

> Now, vestibular migraine deserves special attention because it is the most common cause of spontaneous episodic vertigo and is frequently underdiagnosed. Diagnostic criteria require at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours, a current or past history of migraine, and migrainous features during at least half of episodes; importantly, there is no objective gold standard test, so diagnosis is clinical and often requires exclusion of mimics such as Ménière's disease and TIA [^116Wishc] [^116zmGxC]. Wait, let me verify treatment evidence: randomized data for prophylaxis are sparse, with only low-certainty evidence for beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers; nonetheless, guideline-concordant migraine prophylaxis, trigger management, and vestibular rehabilitation are reasonable, and I should counsel patients about the heterogeneous presentation and frequent comorbidity with anxiety and motion sickness [^112G18Ug] [^116zmGxC] [^114DqZV1].

> Turning to central causes, I need to ensure I do not miss posterior circulation stroke masquerading as a peripheral vestibulopathy. In acute vestibular syndrome, HINTS performed by trained clinicians has high sensitivity and specificity for stroke, whereas performance by untrained emergency physicians is substantially lower; thus, I should either use HINTS with appropriate caution or rely on alternative structured approaches like STANDING, while remembering that CT is insensitive for posterior fossa ischemia and MRI is preferred when central signs are present or HINTS is equivocal [^112U8kBN] [^11493fTK] [^1158bJLk]. Hold on, I should verify stroke burden in dizziness: about 10–25% of AVS presentations are due to stroke, and misdiagnosis risk is nontrivial, reinforcing the need for disciplined bedside algorithms and judicious imaging rather than routine CT in low-risk phenotypes [^116PCeBB].

> I should also review transient ischemic attack and vertebrobasilar insufficiency in spontaneous episodic presentations, because distinguishing vestibular migraine from TIA changes management entirely. TIA typically produces minutes-long episodes without positional triggers and may lack classic migraine accompaniments; vascular risk stratification and, when indicated, CTA or MRA are appropriate, whereas routine CT is not helpful for differentiating central from peripheral causes in spontaneous episodic presentations [^1113UFCo] [^112daYq2]. But wait, what if the vertigo is purely positional and central in origin? Central positional vertigo and nystagmus can mimic BPPV but often show vertical or direction-changing nystagmus without latency or fatigability, prompting MRI even when other signs are subtle [^1118vnru].

> Let me not overlook demyelinating disease and structural posterior fossa lesions, which can present with isolated vertigo or positional nystagmus. Multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory or neoplastic processes may produce central vestibular signs, and in atypical or persistent cases MRI is warranted to exclude structural disease even when bedside testing is inconclusive [^111Vr8G7] [^112G65mE]. I should confirm that central positional nystagmus patterns and associated oculomotor findings, such as skew deviation or gaze-evoked nystagmus, help flag a central process and guide neuroimaging decisions [^1118vnru].

> Next, I should review nonvestibular contributors that frequently confound the picture, especially in older adults. Cardiovascular causes such as orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias, and medication effects are common, and falls guidelines emphasize routine screening for cardiovascular, neurological, and vestibular causes of dizziness in older adults; anxiety and PPPD often perpetuate chronic dizziness after peripheral insults, so I need to screen for psychiatric comorbidity and consider vestibular rehabilitation as first-line for persistent symptoms [^117SLvEN] [^115mwqJP] [^111qjy1c]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost attributed all chronic dizziness to anxiety — let me reconsider and ensure I also evaluate for bilateral vestibulopathy, medication-induced dizziness, and cervicogenic contributions before concluding a primary psychiatric etiology [^115mwqJP].

> I should double-check the emergency diagnostic algorithms and their limitations. GRACE-3 endorses a timing-and-triggers framework, training in HINTS and BPPV maneuvers, and selective MRI rather than routine CT or MRI, while acknowledging that HINTS accuracy depends on training and that STANDING offers a validated alternative pathway; importantly, many emergency physicians lack HINTS training, so local expertise and safety-netting are critical [^111WGnuB] [^11493fTK] [^1174MQ9F]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging: routine CT is discouraged in both AVS and spontaneous episodic presentations due to low yield and false reassurance, whereas MRI is reserved for central signs, equivocal exams, or vascular suspicion, which aligns with both emergency and otolaryngology guidance [^1158bJLk] [^112daYq2] [^114QbsN3].

> For BPPV specifically, I need to ensure I follow the evidence-based sequence: confirm with Dix-Hallpike for posterior canal involvement, use supine roll testing if horizontal canal is suspected, treat with canalith repositioning maneuvers, avoid routine imaging or vestibular suppressants, and reassess within about a month; patient education on recurrence risk and safety is essential, and persistent symptoms warrant evaluation for multi-canal disease or alternative diagnoses [^114SbFtg] [^114YZfTT] [^111Ar3eC]. Wait, I should verify the role of post-maneuver restrictions — current guidance recommends against routine postural restrictions after Epley, which simplifies care without compromising outcomes [^117AP6bq].

> For vestibular neuritis, I should confirm that early vestibular rehabilitation is the cornerstone, with vestibular suppressants limited to the acute phase to avoid delaying compensation; steroids within 72 hours may be considered with shared decision-making given limited-quality evidence, and follow-up should monitor for conversion to secondary BPPV or persistent imbalance [^111qjy1c] [^113gwVdV]. Let me verify the rehabilitation dosing: guidelines suggest structured home programs with gaze stabilization and balance exercises tailored to acute versus chronic phases, which improves functional recovery and reduces chronic dizziness [^111qjy1c].

> For Ménière's disease, I should confirm that acute vertigo can be managed with vestibular suppressants while long-term therapy focuses on salt restriction and diuretics, with audiometric documentation of fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss; MRI is not routinely indicated unless atypical features or asymmetric findings raise concern for retrocochlear pathology, and intratympanic therapies or surgery are options for refractory cases [^115mFM4w] [^114T3Wn1]. Hold on, I should verify that ECOG is not recommended for routine diagnosis — correct, contemporary guidance advises against routine ECOG, reserving it for select scenarios when the diagnosis remains uncertain [^115mFM4w].

> For vestibular migraine, I need to ensure a comprehensive plan encompassing trigger identification, lifestyle measures, and migraine-directed prophylaxis, while acknowledging the low-certainty pharmacologic evidence; vestibular rehabilitation can reduce attack burden and improve functional outcomes, and I should remain vigilant for comorbid anxiety and PPPD that can perpetuate disability [^116zmGxC] [^112G18Ug] [^114DqZV1]. Let me reconsider acute treatment: triptans may help some patients with concurrent headache, but evidence specific to VM attacks is limited, so individualized trials with close follow-up are reasonable [^notfound].

> Special populations require tailored thinking. In older adults, BPPV is common but underrecognized, multimorbidity and polypharmacy complicate presentations, and falls risk assessment is mandatory; falls guidelines recommend routine dizziness screening and targeted positional testing, even though symptom-based case-finding may be less reliable in this group [^117SLvEN]. In children and adolescents, vestibular migraine and BPPV predominate, and the same timing-and-triggers framework applies, with careful attention to developmental factors and school impact [^113fDiAD]. I should double-check that persistent postural-perceptual dizziness is considered after peripheral insults, especially in anxious patients, because it alters rehabilitation planning and prognosis [^114qC28H].

> To synthesize the differential, I need to ensure I anchor on timing and triggers, then layer in associated symptoms and bedside oculomotor findings. Brief, positional, triggered vertigo suggests BPPV; prolonged, spontaneous, unilateral hypofunction with severe nausea suggests vestibular neuritis; hours-long episodes with fluctuating hearing symptoms suggest Ménière's; minutes-to-hours spontaneous episodes with migrainous features suggest vestibular migraine; and acute continuous vertigo with dangerous central signs or vascular risk factors mandates stroke evaluation with HINTS or STANDING and MRI when indicated [^1113UFCo] [^114G7oBs] [^1132xzrG]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overpromising HINTS accuracy outside expert hands — yes, performance drops without training, so local expertise and safety-netting are essential to avoid misclassification [^112U8kBN].

> Finally, I need to ensure my management recommendations align with guidelines and evidence strength. Most vertigo is peripheral and treatable at the bedside with repositioning maneuvers, vestibular rehabilitation, and targeted pharmacotherapy, while avoiding unnecessary imaging and suppressants; central causes require timely recognition, structured examination, and selective MRI, with explicit attention to posterior circulation stroke and mimics. I should confirm that patient education, follow-up within a month, and reassessment for persistent symptoms are built into the care pathway to catch alternative diagnoses and reduce recurrence [^114SbFtg] [^111WGnuB] [^111Ar3eC].

Vertigo arises from **peripheral vestibular disorders** (BPPV, vestibular neuritis, Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis) [^113emS71] and **central vestibular disorders** (stroke, TIA, multiple sclerosis, tumors, vestibular migraine) [^115YWe8G]. BPPV is the **most common cause** [^113emS71], triggered by canalithiasis and treated with canalith repositioning maneuvers [^114SbFtg]. Vestibular neuritis causes acute, severe vertigo without hearing loss [^112b1x5y]; Ménière's disease features episodic vertigo with fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus [^112hapz6]; labyrinthitis includes hearing loss [^112b1x5y]. Central causes include posterior circulation stroke, TIA, multiple sclerosis, and tumors, and require urgent evaluation [^1132xzrG]. Diagnosis relies on history, exam, and targeted testing [^1149WYQX]; management is cause-specific, with vestibular rehabilitation for persistent symptoms [^111qjy1c].

## Peripheral vestibular causes

Peripheral vestibular disorders are the **most common causes of vertigo** [^113emS71], originating in the inner ear or vestibular nerve [^115fSGEp].

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Clinical features** | **Treatment** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) | Dislodged otoconia in semicircular canals [^113emS71] | Brief, positional vertigo; nystagmus [^114SbFtg] | Canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley, Semont) [^114SbFtg] |

## Central vestibular causes

Central vestibular disorders arise from the **brainstem or cerebellum** and are less common but more serious [^1118vnru].

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Clinical features** | **Treatment** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stroke (posterior circulation) | Infarction of brainstem or cerebellum [^112G65mE] | Acute vertigo, ataxia, dysarthria, cranial nerve deficits | Immediate stroke care, anticoagulation, rehabilitation [^notfound] |
| Transient ischemic attack (TIA) | Temporary ischemia [^notfound] | Brief vertigo, transient neurological deficits | Antiplatelet therapy, risk factor management [^notfound] |

| Tumors (e.g. acoustic neuroma) | Vestibular nerve sheath tumor [^notfound] | Progressive vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus | Surgical excision, radiation therapy [^notfound] |
| Vestibular migraine | Migraine-related vestibular dysfunction [^116zmGxC] | Episodic vertigo, headache, photophobia, phonophobia | Migraine prophylaxis, lifestyle modifications [^116zmGxC] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential [^1174MQ9F]. Begin with a **detailed history** covering onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms, and medical history [^1132xzrG]. Follow with a focused **physical examination**, including cranial nerves, eye movements, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and gait assessment [^111DvR3X]. Use HINTS or STANDING to distinguish central from peripheral causes [^11493fTK] [^112U8kBN]. Reserve neuroimaging (MRI) for suspected central causes or atypical cases [^111WGnuB].

---

## Management strategies

Management is cause-specific: BPPV is treated with **canalith repositioning maneuvers** [^114SbFtg]; vestibular neuritis with vestibular suppressants, corticosteroids, and rehabilitation [^114T3Wn1] [^113gwVdV]; Ménière's disease with dietary changes, diuretics, and intratympanic steroids [^114T3Wn1]; and central causes with stroke care, disease-modifying therapies, or surgery [^notfound]. Vestibular rehabilitation is broadly beneficial for persistent symptoms [^111qjy1c].

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^116zmGxC]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized neurological condition that causes episodic vertigo associated with other features of migraine. It is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting up to 1% of the population. A meta-analysis of preventative treatments for vestibular migraine was published in 2021, but the authors were unable to establish a preferred treatment strategy due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of study design and outcome reporting. Therefore, there remains a clinical need for pragmatic management guidelines specific to vestibular migraine using the available evidence. Here, we provide a practical review utilizing a systematic qualitative assessment of the evidence for abortive and preventative interventions in adults. The overall evidence base for vestibular migraine treatment is of low quality. Nevertheless, we provide practical treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and our experience to help guide clinicians treating patients with vestibular migraine. We also discuss how future clinical trials could be designed to improve the quality of evidence in this condition.

Diagnostic paradigm and terminology — the traditional diagnostic paradigm, developed 50 years ago, based on symptom quality and asking the patient "What do you mean by dizzy?", suggests basing the differential diagnosis and clinical evaluation on the patient's description, but this paradigm was never properly validated, has significant methodological flaws, and does not reliably predict underlying causes; the Barany Society has developed formal international consensus criteria, terminology, and definitions for many vestibular disorders, and the writing committee has tried to use terms aligned with these consensus definitions that make sense to frontline clinicians.

### Vertigo and dizziness in the emergency room [^1149WYQX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an update on diagnostic algorithms for differential diagnosis of acute vertigo and dizziness and swift identification of potentially harmful causes.

Recent Findings

About 25% of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness have a potentially life-threatening diagnosis, including stroke in 4–15%. Diagnostic work-up relies on the combination of symptom features (triggers, duration, history of vertigo/dizziness, accompanying symptoms) and a comprehensive vestibular, ocular motor, and balance exam. The latter includes head impulse, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, gaze-holding, smooth pursuit, skew deviation, and Romberg's test. Recent standardized diagnostic algorithms (e.g. HINTS, TriAGe+) suggest the combination of several elements to achieve a good diagnostic accuracy in differentiation of central and peripheral vestibular causes. Neuroimaging with MRI must be applied and interpreted with caution, as small strokes are frequently overlooked, especially in the acute setting (false-negative rate of up to 50%).

Summary

Diagnostic differentiation of acute vertigo and dizziness remains a complex task, which can be tackled by a structured clinical assessment focusing on symptom characteristics and constellations of ocular motor and vestibular findings. Specific challenges arise in cases of transient or atypical vestibular syndromes.

### Epidemiology of vertigo [^116iDxvp]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Epidemiological findings on the distribution, determinants and outcome of vertigo can be used for clinical decision making and can help understand the underlying causes of vestibular diseases. This article gives an overview of the epidemiology of the vestibular symptom vertigo and of four specific vestibular disorders: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, migrainous vertigo, Menière's disease and vestibular neuritis.

Recent Findings

Based on a neurotologic survey of the general population, 1-year prevalence estimates for vertigo were 4.9%, for migrainous vertigo 0.89% and for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 1.6%. Diagnostic positional manoeuvres and treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, however, are still not being done by most doctors. The female preponderance among patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and migrainous vertigo may be linked to migraine but is not fully understood. A recently reported prevalence of Menière's disease of 0.51% is much higher than previous estimates. Follow-up studies have shown benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence rates of 50% at 5 years and a persistence of dizziness related to anxiety in almost a third of patients 1 year after vestibular neuritis.

Summary

The epidemiology of vertigo and vestibular disorders is still an underdeveloped field. Recent studies have underscored the impact of vertigo at the population level, but its determinants and outcome are not well known yet.

### Vestibular assessment: a practical approach [^1141ejLA]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Neurological update: dizziness [^114qC28H]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of vertigo remains a challenge for clinicians, including general neurology. In recent years there have been advances in the understanding of established vestibular syndromes, and the development of treatments for existing vestibular diagnoses. In this 'update' I will review how our understanding of previously "unexplained" dizziness in the elderly is changing, explore novel insights into the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine, and its relationship to the newly coined term 'persistent postural perceptual dizziness', and finally discuss how a simple bedside oculomotor assessment may help identify vestibular presentations of stroke.

### Vestibular migraine: the most frequent entity of episodic vertigo [^113fDiAD]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common cause of episodic vertigo in adults as well as in children. The diagnostic criteria of the consensus document of the International Bárány Society for Neuro-Otology and the International Headache Society (2012) combine the typical signs and symptoms of migraine with the vestibular symptoms lasting 5 min to 72 h and exclusion criteria. Although VM accounts for 7% of patients seen in dizziness clinics and 9% of patients seen in headache clinics it is still underdiagnosed. This review provides an actual overview on the pathophysiology, the clinical characteristics to establish the diagnosis, the differential diagnosis, and the treatment of VM.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^111WGnuB]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This third Guideline for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE-3) from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine is on the topic adult patients with acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department (ED). A multidisciplinary guideline panel applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations regarding five questions for adult ED patients with acute dizziness of less than 2weeks' duration. The intended population is adults presenting to the ED with acute dizziness or vertigo. The panel derived 15 evidence-based recommendations based on the timing and triggers of the dizziness but recognizes that alternative diagnostic approaches exist, such as the STANDING protocol and nystagmus examination in combination with gait unsteadiness or the presence of vascular risk factors. As an overarching recommendation, (1) emergency clinicians should receive training in bedside physical examination techniques for patients with the acute vestibular syndrome (AVS; HINTS) and the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; Dix-Hallpike test and Epley maneuver). To help distinguish central from peripheral causes in patients with the AVS, we recommend: (2) use HINTS (for clinicians trained in its use) in patients with nystagmus, (3) use finger rub to further aid in excluding stroke in patients with nystagmus, (4) use severity of gait unsteadiness in patients without nystagmus, (5) do not use brain computed tomography (CT), (6) do not use routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a first-line test if a clinician trained in HINTS is available, and (7) use MRI as a confirmatory test in patients with central or equivocal HINTS examinations. In patients with the spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome: (8) search for symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia, (9) do not use CT, and (10) use CT angiography or MRI angiography if there is concern for transient ischemic attack. In patients with the triggered (positional) episodic vestibular syndrome, (11) use the Dix-Hallpike test to diagnose posterior canal BPPV (pc-BPPV), (12) do not use CT, and (13) do not use MRI routinely, unless atypical clinical features are present. In patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, (14) consider short-term steroids as a treatment option. In patients diagnosed with pc-BPPV, (15) treat with the Epley maneuver. It is clear that as of 2023, when applied in routine practice by emergency clinicians without special training, HINTS testing is inaccurate, partly due to use in the wrong patients and partly due to issues with its interpretation. Most emergency physicians have not received training in use of HINTS. As such, it is not standard of care, either in the legal sense of that term ("what the average physician would do in similar circumstances") or in the common parlance sense ("the standard action typically used by physicians in routine practice").

### Neuroimaging of dizziness and vertigo [^111Vr8G7]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms in the primary care and emergency settings, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life and a high cost burden to the US health care system. The etiology of these symptoms is difficult to elucidate owing to a wide range of diseases with overlapping manifestations. The broad differential diagnosis based on whether the disease process is central or peripheral is showcased. Each differential will be categorized into neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory, structural, traumatic, and iatrogenic causes. Computed tomography scans, MRI, and vascular imaging are frequently complimentary in providing diagnoses and guidance in management.

### Vestibular migraine [^114YFB4f]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of vertigo, dizziness and balance disturbance with migraine is called vestibular migraine. Although it is estimated that up to 1% of the population suffers from this disease, it is still widely unknown and often underdiagnosed. Recently, the International Headache Society and the Báràny Society published the first joint document with mutually accepted diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine.

Method

This review summarizes current knowledge on vestibular migraine with regard to epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and therapeutic options.

Results

Approximately 30–50% of patients with migraine report vertigo, dizziness or balance disturbances with at least one migraine attack. Vestibular migraine often appears in a temporal delay to the first onset of migraine headache. In some patients the symptom of sudden onset disequilibrium was the main complaint and more worrisome than the accompanying migraine headache. The duration of attacks varies from a few seconds up to few days. The underlying pathophysiology of vestibular migraine is still widely unknown. As an important differential diagnosis, Ménière's disease has to be considered and excluded.

Conclusion

As randomized controlled treatment trials are still missing in vestibular migraine, the therapeutic recommendations for vestibular migraine are currently based on the guidelines of migraine.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^117SLvEN]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vestibular disorders assessment

Expert recommendation. Routinely ask about dizziness symptoms, and undertake follow-up assessment as necessary to identify cardiovascular, neurological and/or vestibular causes (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Dizziness is a common complaint in older adults who fall, with different meanings between individuals, and often no single explanatory cause. Careful history taking is of particular importance. Presyncope and observable unsteadiness or ataxia may be present.
Additionally, the vestibular system has a key role in the control of posture and gait, and there is evidence of a high incidence of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular dysfunction in those presenting with falls. In younger adults, such disorders can often be identified in the clinical history by a reported sensation of vertigo with clear positional or motion-provoked triggers. Identifying cases of vestibular dysfunction is more challenging in older adults due to more variable symptoms.
Where vertigo is reported, positional tests should be used to identify cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from non-cases (e.g. Dix-Hallpike, Head Impulse Test); however, the sensitivity of case-finding algorithms based purely upon symptoms compared with screening with positional testing in older adults is unknown.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^116tBUVY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline outcomes identify what is being measured: the primary outcome considered is the resolution of symptoms associated with BPPV, with secondary outcomes including an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV; other outcomes include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV.

### The dizzyQuest: to have or not to have… a vertigo attack? [^1175191u]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The lifetime prevalence of vertigo is reported to be 25% in the general population, with a peak prevalence in older adults up to 36%. Vertigo can result from several central and peripheral vestibular disorders. Especially in vestibular diseases with recurrent attacks of vertigo, such as vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or Meniere's disease, diaries can be used to get more insights into the number and nature of attacks, including symptoms, possible triggers and duration. However, there are different ways to report an attack. For example, standardized questionnaires can be administered during or directly after an attack (event sampling), or attacks can be reported at the end of the day or week (time sampling). Both strategies might have their pros and cons regarding adherence (e.g. feeling too sick to report during or directly after an attack) and reliability (e.g. more recall bias when only reporting information about attacks at the end of the day). To our knowledge, it has not yet been investigated in vestibular disorders how these different strategies (event sampling and time sampling) for reporting vertigo attacks relate to each other, and whether they are comparable or complementary. This might be important since reliable reporting on number and nature of attacks can have significant implications for clinical practice and research.

### Validation of the sudbury vertigo risk score to risk stratify for a serious cause of vertigo [^111k6AWg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

There are currently no reliable clinical features that exclude serious causes of dizziness. This results in the overuse of neuroimaging and missed or delayed diagnoses of serious pathologies. Approximately 35% of patients presenting with dizziness are subjected to head computed tomographic (CT) scans, 98% of which show no abnormalities. Despite the extensive investigation of dizzy patients, those discharged with a benign diagnosis are 50 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital within 7 days with a diagnosis of stroke compared to matched controls. Current efforts to stratify patient risk of a serious diagnosis have shown limited effectiveness (see discussion for full details). There have been two recent guidelines to help risk stratify patients with dizziness for a serious diagnosis. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy recommends a standard comprehensive history and physical examination and the use of specific findings such as ABCD2 score, ocular motor examination, presence of additional neurologic deficits, and HINTS (if trained) to risk stratify patients with a possible stroke. The GRACE‐3 guidelines offer a more comprehensive approach using a symptom‐based approach assessing timing and triggers, focusing on the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) as the most common cause of vertigo in the ED and then using the HINTS in those with nystagmus and the STANDING algorithm as an alternative. Although there has been much discussion about how these guidelines differ they align in their recommendations that a full history and physical examination together with an assessment for vascular risk factors are important. The limitation of history and physical for posterior circulation stroke was highlighted in an accompanying systematic review to the GRACE‐3 guidelines. In addition, the HINTS examination is only applicable in those with acute vestibular syndrome a minority of dizzy patients. Lastly the STANDING algorithm, although a useful tool, has a sensitivity that is below the required threshold identified by ED physicians. Thus, developing a validated (external and temporal) clinical risk score to identify serious causes of vertigo in patients presenting with dizziness is essential to improve patient outcomes and care.

### Revisiting benign paroxysmal positional vertigo pathophysiology [^116yKoNw]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common peripheral cause of vertigo. Although its pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear, different locations have been attributed throughout the last century, from the days of Bárány. Disease was initially located by Dix and Hallpike in the utricle, but later, Schuknecht's works elicited the cupulolithiasis and canalolithiasis theories, localizing the pathology to the semicircular canal system and mainly to the posterior one. However, conflicting evidences from temporal bone studies accumulated against this theory, which suggest other explanations. Although this clinical entity is well defined, and can usually be effectively treated with certain physical maneuvers, its pathophysiology is still obscure and is being critically discussed in this article, which reviews the milestones of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo understanding.

### Can emergency physicians accurately rule out a central cause of vertigo using the HINTS examination? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112U8kBN]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dizziness is a common complaint presented in the emergency department (ED). A subset of these patients will present with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). AVS is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of vertigo, nystagmus, head motion intolerance, ataxia, and nausea/vomiting. These symptoms are most often due to benign vestibular neuritis; however, they can be a sign of a dangerous central cause, i.e., vertebrobasilar stroke. The Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test of Skew (HINTS) examination has been proposed as a bedside test for frontline clinicians to rule out stroke in those presenting with AVS. Our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS examination to rule out a central cause of vertigo in an adult population presenting to the ED with AVS. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy when performed by emergency physicians versus neurologists.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane database, and relevant conference abstracts from 2009 to September 2019 and performed hand searches. No restrictions for language or study type were imposed. Prospective studies with patients presenting with AVS using criterion standard of computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging were selected for review. Two independent reviewers extracted data from relevant studies. Studies were combined if low clinical and statistical heterogeneity was present. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5 and SAS 9.3.

Results

A total of five studies with 617 participants met the inclusion criteria. The mean (± SD) study length was 5.3 (± 3.3) years. Prevalence of vertebrobasilar stroke ranged 9.3% to 44% (mean ± SD = 39.1% ± 17.1%). The most common diagnoses were vertebrobasilar stroke (mean ± SD = 34.8% ± 17.1%), peripheral cause (mean ± SD = 30.9% ± 16%), and intracerebral hemorrhage (mean ± SD = 2.2% ± 0.5%). The HINTS examination, when performed by neurologists, had a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI = 93.1% to 98.5%, I² = 0%) and specificity of 94.8% (95% CI = 91% to 97.1%, I² = 0%). When performed by a cohort of physicians including both emergency physicians (board certified) and neurologists (fellowship trained in neurootology or vascular neurology) the sensitivity was 83% (95% CI = 63% to 95%) and specificity was 44% (95% CI = 36% to 51%).

Conclusions

The HINTS examination, when used in isolation by emergency physicians, has not been shown to be sufficiently accurate to rule out a stroke in those presenting with AVS.

### Treatment of vertigo [^114T3Wn1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Vertigo is the illusion of motion, usually rotational motion. As patients age, vertigo becomes an increasingly common presenting complaint. The most common causes of this condition are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, migraine, and anxiety disorders. Less common causes include vertebrobasilar ischemia and retrocochlear tumors. The distinction between peripheral and central vertigo usually can be made clinically and guides management decisions. Most patients with vertigo do not require extensive diagnostic testing and can be treated in the primary care setting. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo usually improves with a canalith repositioning procedure. Acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis improves with initial stabilizing measures and a vestibular suppressant medication, followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Meniere's disease often responds to the combination of a low-salt diet and diuretics. Vertiginous migraine headaches generally improve with dietary changes, a tricyclic antidepressant, and a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker. Vertigo associated with anxiety usually responds to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

### Peripheral vestibular disorders with acute onset of vertigo [^115fSGEp]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Disorders of the vestibular nerve and end organs are the most common causes of vertigo. The advances in recognizing different forms of canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis, which sometimes present with continuous positional nystagmus, have revealed a peripheral vestibular aetiology in which central nervous system lesions were previously suspected. Treatments using repositioning manoeuvres are also successful in cases in which nystagmus does not appear, and when administered by less specialized physicians. In acute vestibulopathy, suspicions of the activation of herpes virus infections as a causative agent are increasing, but no reports on the treatment of such infections are yet available. New treatments are in development for use in Ménière's disease.

Classification of evidence-based statements — principles and interpretation emphasize that guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm, with statements reflecting both quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinical discretion; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than for a recommendation, whereas options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that best serves their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations, and guidelines represent the best judgment of a team addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic.

### Vestibular migraine and its comorbidities [^114DqZV1]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Vestibular migraine (VM) is one of the most common neurologic causes of vertigo. Symptoms and International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria are used to diagnose VM because no objective tests, imaging or audiologic, have been shown to reliably diagnose this condition. Central auditory, peripheral, and central vestibular pathway involvement has been associated with VM. Although the interaction between migraine and other vestibular disorders can be a challenging scenario for diagnosis and treatment, there are data to show that vestibular rehabilitation and a variety of pharmacologic agents improve reported symptoms and vertigo frequency.

### Central vertigo [^115YWe8G]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review considers recent advances in central vertigo in terms of clinical and laboratory features and pathophysiology.

Recent Findings

Strokes presenting dizziness-vertigo are more likely to be associated with a misdiagnosis in the emergency setting. The risk of future strokes after discharge is higher in patients diagnosed with peripheral vertigo than in control patients. Strokes and transient ischemic attacks account for one-quarter of acute transient vestibular syndrome. Diagnosis of acute combined central and peripheral vestibulopathy such as anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction requires additional consideration whenever applying the HINTS (head impulse test, direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus, and test of skew). Heat illness and metronidazole have been recognized as new causes of central vestibulopathy. Some new findings have also been added to the clinical and laboratory features of central vertigo.

Summary

Central vertigo is a heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse clinical spectrums. An integrated approach based on understanding of clinical features, laboratory findings, speculated mechanisms, and limitations of current diagnostic tests will lead to better clinical practice.

### Initial evaluation of vertigo [^113HWbX2]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, acute vestibular neuronitis, and Meniere's disease cause most cases of vertigo; however, family physicians must consider other causes including cerebrovascular disease, migraine, psychological disease, perilymphatic fistulas, multiple sclerosis, and intracranial neoplasms. Once it is determined that a patient has vertigo, the next task is to determine whether the patient has a peripheral or central cause of vertigo. Knowing the typical clinical presentations of the various causes of vertigo aids in making this distinction. The history (i.e., timing and duration of symptoms, provoking factors, associated signs and symptoms) and physical examination (especially of the head and neck and neurologic systems, as well as special tests such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver) provide important clues to the diagnosis. Associated neurologic signs and symptoms, such as nystagmus that does not lessen when the patient focuses, point to central (and often more serious) causes of vertigo, which require further work-up with selected laboratory and radiologic studies such as magnetic resonance imaging.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^114SbFtg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Diagnostic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic aspects of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^112ecydf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder. It can be defined as transient vertigo induced by a rapid head position change, associated with a characteristic paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal is considered the most convincing theory of its pathogenesis and the development of appropriate therapeutic maneuvers resulted in its effective treatment. However, involvement of the horizontal or the anterior canal has been found in a significant rate and the recognition and treatment of these variants completed the clinical picture of the disease. This paper describes the advances in understanding how this disease is generated and discusses the current therapeutic modalities.

### Migraine and dizziness [^116ZCFZU]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Awareness of the importance of migraine in patients with symptoms of vestibular dysfunction is increasing. This article gives an overview of the multiple facets of the link between migraine and vestibular dysfunction.

Recent Findings

The vestibular and the headache community have published a consensual definition of vestibular migraine, which is an important step to promote research on the topic and the awareness of clinicians. Vestibular migraine is considered the most common cause of spontaneous recurrent vertigo. So far, the evidence for vestibular migraine has been mainly epidemiological, but the recent follow-up of a cohort over 9 years could show the robustness of the diagnosis over time. Additionally, migraine and vestibular dysfunction have multiple potential interactions and links through a range of comorbidities such as Menière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, anxiety and motion sickness, which go beyond the diagnostic entity of vestibular migraine.

Summary

The further refinement and wider acceptance of the diagnostic entity of vestibular migraine is an important development as it is one the most common vestibular disorders. But the relationship between migraine and vestibular dysfunction is complex and has many aspects beyond vestibular migraine.

### Bedside diagnosis of vertigo: value of the history and neurological examination [^116rMw5H]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Vertigo is caused by disturbance of the input or central processing of sensory signals from the vestibular apparatus that provide information regarding the position of the body in space. It is caused either by asymmetric disruption of sensory input from the vestibular organs or asymmetric integration of vestibular input into the central nervous system. Vertigo is readily differentiated from other causes of dizziness by a sensation of motion. A crucial aspect of the management of the emergency department patient with vertigo is the differentiation of vertigo associated with acute stroke syndromes from vertigo due to peripheral causes. Routine computerized axial tomography imaging is insensitive for posterior circulation strokes, so for emergency physicians, the history and neurological examination remain the most useful diagnostic tools. This article emphasizes the history and physical examination in the localization of the lesion in patients with vertigo and offers a rational basis for decisions regarding the need for special neurological imaging and consultation. It also emphasizes subtle findings that may prevent the erroneous diagnosis of peripheral vertigo in the presence of an acute stroke syndrome.

### Recent advances in the genetics of recurrent vertigo and vestibulopathy [^116kYtEk]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To focus on recent advances in the genetics of recurrent vertigo, with an overview on episodic ataxia, benign recurrent vertigo (mainly migraine-associated vertigo), bilateral vestibulopathy, and Ménière's disease.

Recent Findings

Since the identification more than a decade ago of the genetic causes of episodic ataxia type 1 with myokymia caused by KCNA1 mutations and episodic ataxia type 2 with nystagmus caused by CACNA1A mutations, the list of episodic ataxia syndromes with distinct clinical features and genetic loci is slowly expanding, now up to episodic ataxia type 7. There is growing recognition for a correlation between benign recurrent vertigo and migraine, and acceptance for vertigo as a manifestation of migraine; efforts to identify susceptibility loci for migraine and migraine-associated vertigo are underway. A handful of families with vestibulopathy spanning several generations have been identified. Although no gene has yet been found, vestibulopathy with normal hearing variably associated with migraine is likely monogenic and heterogeneous, similar to nonsydromic deafness. There is also continuing effort to identify genetic causes of familial Ménière's disease.

Summary

Overlapping clinical features among different familial syndromes of recurrent vertigo and strong association with migraine suggest shared mechanisms. Collaborative efforts in patient identification and recruitment will facilitate progress in understanding disease mechanisms to improve diagnosis and treatment of recurrent vertigo.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease — history and examination emphasize that the history and physical examination should evaluate for neurologic, neurotologic/otologic, oncologic, inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes, and clinicians should ask patients detailed questions about attack onset and duration (second, minutes, hours, or entire day) and concurrent otologic symptoms. Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while "dizziness" is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

### Distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness and vertigo without using HINTS or STANDING [^112bLcJj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Three validated diagnostic algorithms for diagnosing patients with acute onset dizziness or vertigo (HINTS, HINTS-plus and STANDING) exist. All are extremely accurate in distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness when done by experienced clinicians. However, uptake of these diagnostic tools in routine emergency medicine practice has been sub-optimal, in part, due to clinicians' unease with the head impulse test, the most useful component contained of these algorithms. Use of these validated algorithms is the best way to accurately diagnose patients with acute dizziness. For clinicians who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable performing or interpreting HINTS and STANDING, this article will suggest alternative approaches to help with accurate diagnosis of patients with acute dizziness or vertigo.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^113sqQmb]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders, vertigo is defined as a false sensation of motion when none is occurring, or an altered sensation of self-motion during normal movement. Dizziness is defined as a sensation of impaired or disturbed spatial orientation without a distorted sense of motion. Although understanding whether the patient is experiencing "dizziness" or "vertigo" can sometimes have diagnostic value, it can also lead to misdiagnosis – e.g. assuming a patient with orthostasis or a cardiac arrhythmia has a vestibular disorder because they are experiencing vertigo. For the remainder of this manuscript, we will use the terms "dizziness" and "vertigo" interchangeably.

Dizziness is one of the most common complaints in a variety of healthcare settings, accounting for around 5% of ambulatory care visits, and between 2.5 and 4% of emergency department visits. It is estimated to affect nearly 15–20% of adults yearly, yet patients often go undiagnosed for prolonged periods of time. In a variety of settings, vestibular migraine (VM) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are the most common causes of dizziness. Vestibular migraine is a significantly underdiagnosed and underrecognized common cause of dizziness, especially elusive since it can present in a variety of forms and mimic other vestibular disorders. Herein we discuss VM with an emphasis on strategies to gather the salient features of the history to make the correct diagnosis and differentiate VM from its mimics (see Table 1). We discuss effective methods of treating VM and similar vestibular disorders.

### Vertigo and dizziness in the emergency department [^113QTsvo]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Understanding three peripheral vestibular disorders — vestibular neuritis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and Meniere's disease — is the key to the evaluation and management of vertigo and dizziness presentations in the emergency department. Each of these benign disorders is a common cause of a broad category of dizziness presentation. In addition, each of these disorders has characteristic features that allow for a bedside diagnosis. An effective strategy for "ruling-out" a serious disorder, such as stroke, is "ruling-in" a peripheral vestibular disorder. In this article a focus is on the key features of these disorders.

### Episodic vertigo: central nervous system causes [^115sRmgi]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Episodic ataxia type 2 is a prototypical episodic vertigo and ataxia syndrome that is caused by mutations in the calcium channel gene CACNA1A. Recent discoveries regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this syndrome provide a model for understanding the more common familial episodic vertigo syndromes, particularly those associated with migraine. Vertigo due to cerebrovascular disease can be of peripheral or central origin, and can mimic more benign peripheral vestibular disorders. Small infarcts in the cerebellum and lateral medulla can present with vertigo without other localizing symptoms.

Purpose Of Review

The current review covers recent advances in vascular vertigo in terms of diagnostic strategies, clinical/laboratory features, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Acute strokes presenting with isolated dizziness/vertigo without other obvious symptoms or signs of central nervous system involvements may be easily mistaken as peripheral vestibulopathy. For correct diagnosis of vascular vertigo, the importance of clinical history (timing and triggers) and targeted bedside examination cannot be overemphasized. In addition to Head Impulse-Nystagmus-Test of Skew, several differential strategies have been advanced by adopting a combination of clinical history, bedside or laboratory examination, and imaging for diagnosis of vascular vertigo. Circumscribed cerebellar and brainstem lesions may cause isolated central vestibular syndromes with characteristic vestibular and ocular motor manifestations. Recognition of these findings would aid in localizing the lesions and understanding the function of each central vestibular structure. Central positional nystagmus (CPN) may mimic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), but additional oculomotor or neurological findings mostly permit differentiation of CPN from BPPV.

Summary

In acute vestibular syndrome, discriminating vascular causes is still challenging especially when other central symptoms and signs are not evident. An integrated approach based on understanding of clinical features, laboratory findings, speculated mechanisms, and limitations of current diagnostic tests will lead to better clinical practice.

Clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms (Recommendation), and clinicians should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders (Recommendation). Clinicians should educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up (Recommendation).

Otologic disorders causing vertigo — clinical features distinguishing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) from other entities are outlined. BPPV is characterized by acute, discrete episodes of brief positional vertigo without associated hearing loss. Ménière's disease involves discrete episodic attacks with sustained vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, aural fullness, and tinnitus; the vertigo typically lasts longer (usually on the order of hours), is not triggered by any obligate head position changes, and diagnosis requires an associated contemporaneous decline in sensorineural hearing, with protracted nausea and vomiting more common. Acute peripheral vestibular dysfunction (vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis) presents with sudden, unanticipated, severe vertigo with a subjective sensation of rotational (room spinning) motion; if the auditory portion of the inner ear is affected, hearing loss and tinnitus may occur (consistent with labyrinthitis), and these syndromes are commonly preceded by a viral prodrome. The time course differentiates these from BPPV: in vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis the vertigo is of gradual onset, developing over several hours, followed by a sustained level of vertigo lasting days to weeks; vertigo is present at rest but may be exacerbated by positional changes. Superior canal dehiscence (SCD) causes attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia brought on by loud sounds, Valsalva maneuvers, or pressure changes of the external auditory canals and differs from BPPV in that vertigo is induced by pressure changes and not position changes. A perilymph fistula can produce episodes of vertigo and nystagmus triggered by pressure, can occur after surgery involving the middle ear or mastoid region or spontaneously, and may be accompanied by a fluctuating hearing loss. Posttraumatic vertigo can present with vertigo, disequilibrium, tinnitus, and headache.

The following constitutes key background information on Ménière's disease:

- **Definition**: Ménière's disease is a chronic disorder of the inner ear characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of Ménière's disease is multifactorial, with a characteristic sign being endolymphatic hydrops, a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of Ménière's disease in the US is estimated at 190 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Ménière's disease include adult age, family history, certain lifestyle and environmental factors, such as allergies.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients experience intermittent episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, along with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss that can progress over time. Tinnitus and aural pressure are also common symptoms. The severity and frequency of these symptoms can vary greatly among patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of Ménière's disease is generally favorable in terms of symptom management.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient information — definition, triggers, symptoms, and epidemiology are described: BPPV is "the most common inner ear problem and cause of vertigo", and "certain head positions or movements can trigger a spell". Common symptoms are "distinct triggered spells of vertigo or spinning sensations" with nausea, disorientation, and instability, and "these symptoms will be intense for seconds to minutes". In seniors, it can present as "an isolated sense of instability brought on by position change", and BPPV "does not affect your hearing or cause you to faint", with "the natural course of BPPV" being to "become less severe over time". BPPV is very common and "is more common in older people", with most cases occurring "for no reason" though associations include trauma, migraine, other inner ear problems, diabetes, osteoporosis, and prolonged bed rest. Mechanistically, BPPV occurs when inner ear calcium carbonate crystals become "unglued" and "float around and/or get stuck on sensors", and symptom intensity relates to how long the crystal/sensor takes "to settle after you move or change your head or body position".

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — differential diagnosis and prevalence across settings are outlined with policy metadata: Exceptions: None; Policy level: Recommendation; Differences of opinion: None. Differential diagnosis spans otologic, neurologic, and other entities, including Ménière's disease, Vestibular neuritis, Labyrinthitis; neurologic conditions such as Vestibular migraine, Posterior circulation transient ischemic attack and stroke, Demyelinating diseases, Central nervous system lesions, Vertebrobasilar insufficiency, Central positional vertigo; and other entities including Anxiety or panic disorder, Cervicogenic vertigo, Medication side effects, Postural hypotension, and Various medical conditions (eg, toxic, infectious, and metabolic conditions). Epidemiology varies by setting: In a German telephone survey of > 1000 patients with dizziness, BPPV accounted for 8% of cases; in a British general practice setting, BPPV accounted for 42% of cases, followed by vestibular neuritis (41%), Ménière's disease (10%), vascular cases (3%), and other causes (3%); and in subspecialty populations, BPPV accounts for 20% to 53% of patients referred to ear, nose, and throat specialty clinics for dizziness. Diagnostic considerations note that BPPV has been described as occurring in conjunction with, or as a consequence of, other vestibular disorders as well, so clinicians should consider the possibility of > 1 vestibular disorder being present and emphasize that taking a history that focuses on the timing and triggers of a patient's dizziness is more important than the specific descriptor that patients use.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^112G18Ug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed to be used as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing beta‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene‐related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin or hormonal modification with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross‐over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included three studies with a total of 209 participants. One evaluated beta‐blockers and the other two evaluated calcium channel blockers. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining interventions of interest.

Beta‐blockers versus placebo

One study (including 130 participants, 61% female) evaluated the use of 95 mg metoprolol once daily for six months, compared to placebo. The proportion of people who reported improvement in vertigo was not assessed in this study. Some data were reported on the frequency of vertigo attacks at six months and the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, this is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Calcium channel blockers versus no treatment

Two studies, which included a total of 79 participants (72% female), assessed the use of 10 mg flunarizine once daily for three months, compared to no intervention. All of the evidence for this comparison was of very low certainty. Most of our outcomes were only reported by a single study, therefore we were unable to conduct any meta‐analysis. Some data were reported on improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo, but no information was available regarding serious adverse events. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results, as these data come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low.

Authors' conclusions

There is very limited evidence from placebo‐controlled randomised trials regarding the efficacy and potential harms of pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. We only identified evidence for two of our interventions of interest (beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers) and all evidence was of low or very low certainty. Further research is necessary to identify whether these treatments are effective at improving symptoms and whether there are any harms associated with their use.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dizziness and vertigo, more specifically with respect to gait assessment, SAEM 2023 guidelines recommend to consider eliciting a detailed history and performing a physical examination with emphasis on cranial nerves, including visual fields, eye movements, limb coordination, and gait assessment, to distinguish between central (TIA) and peripheral (vestibular migraine, Ménière's disease) diagnoses in adult patients with spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome presenting to the emergency department.

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting. We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, as well as the literature for the diagnostic yield in acute and outpatient settings.

### Management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^115jRnGj]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

In vertigo, people experience an illusion of movement of the environment about them, or of themselves with respect to the environment. Vertigo usually originates in the peripheral nervous system (e.g. due to a disorder of the inner ear) but can, rarely, have a CNS origin (e.g. an intracranial tumour or brainstem lesion). It is commonly due to a peripheral disorder known as 'benign paroxysmal positional vertigo' (BPPV). Here we discuss BPPV and the management of patients with the condition, including diagnostic and therapeutic manoeuvres.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) diagnostic pathway — patients with compatible history or symptoms proceed to differentiate BPPV from other causes of vertigo. If consistent with BPPV, evaluation includes performing the Dix-Hallpike maneuver for posterior canal BPPV with assessment for torsional up-beating nystagmus and, when indicated, the supine roll test for lateral canal BPPV with characteristic direction changing nystagmus. The algorithm also includes do not obtain radiographic imaging and do not order vestibular testing.

Dizziness and vertigo are some of the more frequently encountered symptoms in neurology clinics. In turn, one of the most common causes of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), accounting for a quarter of all patients with dizziness and vertigo. Reviewing the value of the positional manoeuvres available is relevant, particularly in the light of the efficient treatments available for BPPV. In this article I will deal with positional manoeuvres first, and then with how vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR) can be tested in the clinic. I will not discuss VOR suppression assessment.

### Clinical practice. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^113emS71]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benign paroxysmal positional vertigo:

- **Definition**: BPPV is a common disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo and nystagmus.
- **Pathophysiology**: BPPV has an unknown origin but is thought to result from degeneration of the macula. Secondary causes include otoconial dislodgement due to otologic and nonotologic surgery, head trauma, or any means by which mechanical force reaches the inner ear, inner ear disorders (vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
- **Disease course**: The aberrant semicircular canal signaling (canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis) results in BPPV, which causes clinical manifestations of dizziness that lasts < 20 seconds accompanied by a lingering, nonspecific imbalance and characteristic nystagmus with Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Spontaneous resolution occurs in 25% of patients by 1 month and up to 50% at 3 months.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BPPV is not associated with an increase in mortality.

STANDING algorithm for patients with dizziness, vertigo, or instability — structure, validation, and performance: The algorithm directs clinicians to examine for nystagmus and proceed via sequential steps "1: Is nystagmus present? 2: Nystagmus characteristics? 3: If HIT is indicated, what is the result? 4: Patient can stand/walk independently?", with action nodes including "Perform Head Impulse test", "Supine head roll test for hc-BPPV", and "Dix-Hallpike test for pc-BPPV", and terminal labels "Central cause of symptoms" and "Peripheral cause of symptoms". The protocol "has been internally and externally validated" and "is a focused physical examination aimed at differentiating central from peripheral causes of dizziness (and specifically making the diagnosis of pc- and hc-BPPV) in four steps", with step descriptions specifying nystagmus presence/characteristics, head impulse testing for spontaneous direction-fixed nystagmus, and final assessment of gait unsteadiness. Reported performance shows that the "sensitivity for identifying a central cause of the dizziness (mostly strokes) ranged from 93.4% to 100% and the specificities from 71.8% to 94.3%", it "does not include the test of skew (part of HINTS) or test of hearing (part of HINTS plus)", and "The average time needed for emergency physicians to perform the STANDING protocol is less than 3 min".

### Epidemiology of vertigo, migraine and vestibular migraine [^111n2nZy]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Both migraine and vertigo are common in the general population with lifetime prevalences of about 16% for migraine and 7% for vertigo. Therefore, a concurrence of the two conditions can be expected in about 1.1% of the general population by chance alone. However, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that the actual comorbidity is higher, namely 3.2%. This can be explained by the fact that several dizziness and vertigo syndromes occur more frequently in migraineurs than in controls including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, motion sickness, cerebellar disorders and anxiety syndromes which may present with dizziness. In addition, there is increasing recognition of a syndrome called vestibular migraine (VM), which is vertigo directly caused by migraine. VM affects more than 1% of the general population, about 10% of patients in dizziness clinics and at least 9% of patients in migraine clinics. Clinically, VM presents with attacks of spontaneous or positional vertigo lasting seconds to days. Migrainous accompaniments such as headache, phonophobia, photophobia or auras are common but not mandatory. Cochlear symptoms may be associated but are mostly mild and non-progressive. During acute attacks one may find central spontaneous or positional nystagmus and, less commonly, unilateral vestibular hypofunction. In the symptom-free interval, vestibular testing adds little to the diagnosis as findings are mostly minor and non-specific. In the absence of controlled studies, treatment of VM is adopted from the migraine sphere comprising avoidance of triggers, stress management as well as pharmacotherapy for acute attacks and prophylaxis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the physical examination in emergency department patients with acute vertigo or dizziness: a systematic review and meta-analysis for GRACE-3 [^111DvR3X]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

History and physical examination are key features to narrow the differential diagnosis of central versus peripheral causes in patients presenting with acute vertigo. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic test accuracy of physical examination findings.

Methods

This study involved a patient-intervention-control-outcome (PICO) question: (P) adult ED patients with vertigo/dizziness; (I) presence/absence of specific physical examination findings; and (O) central (ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, others) versus peripheral etiology. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) was assessed.

Results

From 6309 titles, 460 articles were retrieved, and 43 met the inclusion criteria: general neurologic examination-five studies, 869 patients, pooled sensitivity 46.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 32.3%-61.9%, moderate certainty) and specificity 92.8% (95% CI 75.7%-98.1%, low certainty); limb weakness/hemiparesis-four studies, 893 patients, sensitivity 11.4% (95% CI 5.1%-23.6%, high) and specificity 98.5% (95% CI 97.1%-99.2%, high); truncal/gait ataxia-10 studies, 1810 patients (increasing severity of truncal ataxia had an increasing sensitivity for central etiology, sensitivity 69.7% [43.3%-87.9%, low] and specificity 83.7% [95% CI 52.1%-96.0%, low]); dysmetria signs-four studies, 1135 patients, sensitivity 24.6% (95% CI 15.6%-36.5%, high) and specificity 97.8% (94.4%-99.2%, high); head impulse test (HIT)-17 studies, 1366 patients, sensitivity 76.8% (64.4%-85.8%, low) and specificity 89.1% (95% CI 75.8%-95.6%, moderate); spontaneous nystagmus-six studies, 621 patients, sensitivity 52.3% (29.8%-74.0%, moderate) and specificity 42.0% (95% CI 15.5%-74.1%, moderate); nystagmus type-16 studies, 1366 patients (bidirectional, vertical, direction changing, or pure torsional nystagmus are consistent with a central cause of vertigo, sensitivity 50.7% [95% CI 41.1%-60.2%, moderate] and specificity 98.5% [95% CI 91.7%-99.7%, moderate]); test of skew-15 studies, 1150 patients (skew deviation is abnormal and consistent with central etiology, sensitivity was 23.7% [95% CI 15%-35.4%, moderate] and specificity 97.6% [95% CI 96%-98.6%, moderate]); HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew)-14 studies, 1781 patients, sensitivity 92.9% (95% CI 79.1%-97.9%, high) and specificity 83.4% (95% CI 69.6%-91.7%, moderate); and HINTS+ (HINTS with hearing component)-five studies, 342 patients, sensitivity 99.0% (95% CI 73.6%-100%, high) and specificity 84.8% (95% CI 70.1%-93.0%, high).

Conclusions

Most neurologic examination findings have low sensitivity and high specificity for a central cause in patients with acute vertigo or dizziness. In acute vestibular syndrome (monophasic, continuous, persistent dizziness), HINTS and HINTS+ have high sensitivity when performed by trained clinicians.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^115piaRv]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is one of the most common chief complaints in both the ambulatory care setting and the emergency department. These symptoms may be representative of a broad range of entities. Therefore, any attempt at treatment must first start with determining the etiology. In this current perspective, we focus specifically on the diagnosis of and treatment of vestibular migraine, which is common and overlaps clinically with a variety of other diagnoses. We discuss the traditional treatments for vestibular migraine in addition to the recent explosion of novel migraine therapeutics. Because vestibular migraine can mimic, or co-exist with, a variety of other vestibular diseases, we discuss several of these disorders including persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, post-concussive syndrome, Ménière's disease, and cerebrovascular etiologies. We discuss the diagnosis of each, as well as overlapping and distinguishing clinical features of which the reader should be aware. Finally, we conclude with evidence based as well as expert commentary on management, with a particular emphasis on vestibular migraine.

Central positional vertigo and nystagmus

Positional vertigo and positional nystagmus (paroxysmal, persistent or both) can be the presenting feature of some focal lesions and diffuse diseases affecting the cerebellum or the brainstem. Downbeating nystagmus on straight head-hanging, upbeating nystagmus on returning to the upright position from supine and apogeotropic nystagmus during the supine head-roll test all occur in central paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The direction of central paroxysmal positional nystagmus aligns with the vector sum of the rotational axes of the semicircular canals that were being inhibited in each position: for example, a straight head-hanging position would inhibit both anterior canals, and so the nystagmus is directly upbeat with no latency to onset and a rapid crescendo phase which decreases exponentially. Time constants for the nystagmus, 3–8 s, correspond to those of the vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The possibility of a central positional vertigo/nystagmus is particularly important to consider in a patient presenting without any other neurological symptoms or signs, just with atypical BPV. Could the cause of the positional vertigo be just migraine or perhaps something more sinister such as a structural lesion? Unfortunately, not even a high-quality, contrast-enhanced MRI with thin, overlapping slices is totally reassuring, as the problem might be an MRI negative, antibody mediated, autoimmune process.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^116PCeBB]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department — epidemiology and stroke burden — In the United States, 3.3% of the approximately 130 million emergency department (ED) patients have dizziness (total n ≈ 4.3 million), of whom roughly 82% are discharged; applying these proportions suggests ~5000–17,500 patients per year are discharged with a peripheral vestibular diagnosis and later return with a stroke, even though the individual risk is very low at 0.14%–0.5%. Among ED patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), approximately 10%–25% of cases are due to stroke. A medicolegal review reported that of 69 alleged malpractice cases related to dizziness, 50 (72.5%) occurred in ED or primary care settings, with central nervous system pathology missed or delayed in nearly all (92.8%).

### Health care utilization, prognosis and outcomes of vestibular disease in primary care settings: systematic review [^111PWwHd]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

With a high lifetime prevalence and high burden of disease, vertigo and dizziness can be severely disabling because of its high impact on daily life. Psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, panic disorders, and specific phobias such as agoraphobia or acrophobia may account for avoidance behavior, increased disability, and increased health care utilization. Finally, vertigo and dizziness are specific and important risk factors for falls and injuries, especially in the aged.

Almost 45% of outpatients with dizziness and vertigo are primarily seen and treated by a primary care physician (PCP) who is often without specific neuro-otological expertise for the diagnosis and management of vestibular disorders. Management in primary care seems to be difficult because dizziness as a symptom is difficult to describe and to standardize. Also, PCPs might reasonably want to exclude potentially life threatening diseases and utilize all possible diagnostic options to avoid litigation. There is evidence that PCPs are referring such "red flag" cases correctly. However, they failed to refer patients to the specialist when referral would have been appropriate.

Most instances of vertigo and dizziness are manageable. Peripheral vestibular disorders are frequent causes for dizziness and vertigo; benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent form of peripheral vestibular disorders with a lifetime prevalence of 2% in the general population. Other, less-frequent peripheral forms of vestibular disorders include Menière's disease and vestibular neuritis. Central vestibular forms of vertigo include cerebrovascular diseases, brain stem and cerebellar lesions, infections, and vestibular migraine. In aged adults, the ageing of vestibular and proprioceptive systems and, most notably, medication are potential risk factors for vertigo and dizziness.

Inappropriate management of patients with the cardinal symptoms of vertigo and dizziness may lead to chronicity, activity limitations and considerable economic impact. Yet studies conducted from the retrospective perspective of specialized tertiary care centers found considerable under-and misdiagnosis and irrational treatment and management practices in primary care. Since vertigo and dizziness are frequent complaints that lead to extensive health care utilization, and since most patients are likely to rely on PCPs for the management of their complaints, it is important to know more about typical management patterns and referral practices as well as about prognosis and outcomes of dizzy patients in primary care.

Objective of this systematic review was to examine health care of patients with vertigo and dizziness in primary care settings. Specifically, we wanted to characterize health care utilization, therapeutic and referral behaviour and to examine the outcomes associated with this.

Neuroimaging in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo — Routine neuroimaging has not been recommended to discern these conditions from the more common causes of vertigo; the costs of routine imaging in cases of BPPV are not justified because it does not improve diagnostic accuracy in the majority of BPPV cases; therefore, neuroimaging should not be routinely used in the diagnosis of BPPV.

### Vertiginous headache and its management [^116E4YMj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Vertiginous headache encompasses patients with dizziness or vertigo as well as headache, even though the symptoms may not occur in an obvious temporal relationship. The type of dizziness experienced by patients is different from the heavy-headedness experienced during rhinogenic headache. Patients may have a personal or family history of typical or atypical migraine. They should be evaluated for possible Meniere syndrome, migraine headaches, and/or eye movement disorders. Management is directed to treatment of the underlying abnormality. Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary, because further otologic abnormalities may present later.

### Migrainous vertigo, tinnitus, and ear symptoms and alternatives [^111b9qN2]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Migraine headaches frequently coexist with vestibular symptoms such as vertigo, motion sickness, and gait instability. Migraine-related vasospasm can also damage the inner ear, which results in symptoms such as sudden sensorineural hearing loss and resultant tinnitus. The pathophysiology of these symptoms is not yet fully understood, and despite their prevalence, there is no universally approved management. This review summarizes the data on complementary and integrative medicine in treating patients with migrainous ear disorders.

### A new diagnostic approach to the adult patient with acute dizziness [^113wqDst]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment.

Objective Of The Review

This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department.

Discussion

Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions.

Conclusions

The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^11254mj8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient counseling and follow-up — expected course, activity guidance, recurrence risk, and actions for persistent symptoms are outlined as follows: Mild sensitivity to movement and unsteadiness can persist, and these mild symptoms can take a few days to a few weeks to resolve; follow up if dizziness or instability do not improve in a few days to a couple of weeks. Balance may be "off", so take precautions to avoid falls, return to normal activities that you can do safely, and note that exposure to motion and movement will help to speed healing. BPPV can sometimes return, with risk shifting from low risk (few experiences in your lifetime) to higher risk from factors such as trauma, other inner ear or medical conditions, or aging; medical research has not found any way to stop recurrence, but it can be treated with a high rate of success. If symptoms persist after initial treatments, it is not uncommon to need more than 1 repositioning session, BPPV can sometimes be in more than 1 canal and/or side requiring multiple treatments, seek a health professional who specializes in BPPV, and recognize that leftover dizziness may require more time (few days to couple of weeks); follow-up is important and further testing may confirm the diagnosis and/or guide future treatment options.

### Epley and beyond: an update on treating positional vertigo [^116GBtnu]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the commonest cause of dizziness. It is characterised by brief episodes of vertigo and imbalance with nystagmus. The direction of nystagmus allows the identification of the culprit semicircular canal. As it is readily treatable — and often curable — BPPV should not be missed. Although recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by movement suggest BPPV, the diagnosis can only be confirmed with the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre. Here we review the diagnostic manoeuvres required to diagnose BPPV, and the various repositioning manoeuvres for treating different types of BPPV.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^116Wishc]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vestibular migraine (VM) is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized condition that causes episodic vertigo, often accompanied by headache. A condition first clearly described by Boenheim in 1917, it is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting between 1% and 2.7% of the general population, 11% of patients in specialized dizziness clinicsand 13% of patients in headache clinics. Previously known variously as 'migrainous vertigo', 'migraine-associated vertigo', 'migraine-associated dizziness', 'migraine-anxiety-associated dizziness' and 'migraine-related vestibulopathy', vestibular migraine has been accepted by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) as the unifying term that identifies both the vestibular and migrainous symptoms.

The clinical presentation of vestibular migraine is diverse. Episodes of dizziness usually last between 5 min and 72 h, although shorter and longer episodes have been reported. Vestibular symptoms can mimic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and prominent auditory symptoms with overlap with Ménière's disease have been reported. Episodes are often, but not invariably, accompanied by other symptoms of migraine, including migrainous headache, photophobia, phonophobia and visual aura. Neurological examination is classically unremarkable, but during acute attacks can reveal spontaneous or positional nystagmus in the majority of patients, and some studies have reported mild abnormalities of semicircular canal function and eye movements interictally. The current diagnostic criteria, first proposed by Neuhauser et al.and ratified by the International Headache Society and the committee for the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD) of the Bárány Society, mandate a history of migraine and the temporal overlap of vestibular and migrainous symptoms in at least 50% of episodes, and allow for the possibility of probable vestibular migraine (see Table 1). Importantly for a disease without an objective diagnostic gold standard, these criteria have been shown to be reliable on repeated assessments over a 9-year period.

### Vertebral artery dissection presenting as isolated vertigo [^116xHdQw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Vertigo is not an uncommon presentation to the emergency department. It is most commonly caused by benign peripheral processes, such as inner ear or vestibular nerve dysfunction, but can be due to central brain lesions. In this report, we present a central cause of isolated vertigo: brainstem infarct secondary to vertebral artery dissection (VAD). VAD is increasingly being recognised as an important cause of stroke in young people. We discuss the important features that need to be elicited to distinguish central from peripheral disease and the relevance of VAD.

### A patient primer on vertigo-spinning out of control… [^1171sdXe]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Vertigo is the symptom of feeling like you are moving when you are not, or that the world is moving when it is not. Some people with vertigo feel spinning, some experience a rocking sensation, and others a sense that they are moving back and forth or side to side. It is a false sensation, happening when our brain or our inner ear balance system does not work properly. The part of the brain and inner ear that help us balance is called the vestibular system. The vestibular system also helps keep our vision steady when we move. If our eyes are the brain's camera, the vestibular system is the gimbal, stabilizing our view of the world from shaking as we move. For example, one of the most common causes of vertigo is called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Many people know this as "loose crystals" disease.

Normally, we do have crystals in the ear, and they serve an important purpose of helping us sense gravity. They are located in 2 tiny organs called the utricle and the saccule, where they are suspended in a gel matrix, floating on a sea of hair cells. To counteract this, the vestibular system instructs the eyes to move in the opposite direction, resulting in a rhythmic twitching called nystagmus. In addition, because our brains trust our inner ears, the crystals fool us into thinking that we are spinning around. It is useful to know that there are many other causes of vertigo in addition to BPPV. Some other causes include vestibular migraine, Meniere disease, vestibular neuritis, stroke, and labyrinthitis. Therefore, if you do experience vertigo, have it checked out by a qualified medical professional.

Some things that can be helpful for your physician, including recording details of the vertigo, such as how long it lasted and any other symptoms that you had. Video recordings of your eyes during a vertigo attack, if possible, can be helpful to the medical professional. There are effective treatments for most causes of vertigo. These include physical therapy, medications, and surgery. By understanding the important job of the vestibular system, we can better evaluate and treat those suffering from vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance.

### Initial evaluation of vertigo | AAFP… [^112cy6SF]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION The cranial nerves should be examined for signs of palsies, sensorineural hearing loss, and nystagmus. Vertical nystagmus is 80 percent sensitive for vestibular nuclear or cerebellar vermis lesions. 15 The combination of a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a history of vertigo or vomiting suggests a peripheral vestibular disorder. 22 If the maneuver provokes purely vertical or torsional nystagmus without a latent period of at least a few seconds, and does not wane with repeated maneuvers, this suggests a central cause for vertigo such as a posterior fossa tumor or hemorrhage. 14, 15. HEAD AND NECK EXAMINATION The tympanic membranes should be examined for vesicles or cholesteatoma. Hennebert's sign indicates the presence of a perilymphatic fistula.

12 Pneumatic otoscopy may cause similar findings. 3 The Valsalva maneuver may cause vertigo in patients with perilymphatic fistulae 12 or anterior semicircular canal dehiscence 12, 23; its clinical diagnostic value, however, is limited.
22. CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION Orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and pulse in patients with vertigo upon standing may identify problems with dehydration or autonomic dysfunction. 10 Carotid sinus stimulation should not be performed; it has been shown to be not useful diagnostically 22 and potentially is dangerous.

26Magnetic resonance or conventional angiography of the posterior fossa vasculature may be useful in diagnosing vascular causes of vertigo such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency, thrombosis of the labyrinthine artery, anterior or posterior inferior cerebellar artery insufficiency, and subclavian steal syndrome. 26 Neuroimaging studies can be used to rule out extensive bacterial infections, neoplasms, or developmental abnormalities if other symptoms suggest one of those diagnoses.
