## Question

Hold amiodarone with pancreatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amiodarone should be held in a patient who develops acute pancreatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence linking amiodarone to pancreatitis. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about pancreatitis and whether it provides management guidance. Next, I will review guideline positions on amiodarone toxicity and drug-induced pancreatitis. After that, I need to weigh the cardiac risk of stopping amiodarone against the potential pancreatic risk of continuing it. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline monitoring and alternatives if amiodarone is held, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the evidence base. A large population-based case-control study from Taiwan found that current amiodarone use was associated with a markedly increased odds of acute pancreatitis, with an adjusted odds ratio around 5.2, whereas recent or past use was not significantly associated, which supports a temporal relationship and strengthens causality inference, albeit with observational design limitations [^2de77e04]. Wait, let me verify consistency across sources: multiple FDA labels list pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis among postmarketing adverse reactions, which independently corroborates a signal even if frequency cannot be estimated from spontaneous reports, reinforcing the plausibility of a drug–pancreas association [^eb3fc3c7] [^16479947] [^2bede515] [^43952a75].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether any authoritative guideline explicitly mandates holding amiodarone for pancreatitis. I need to check the major cardiology guidelines and pancreatitis guidelines. The ACC/AHA/HRS ventricular arrhythmia guideline emphasizes routine monitoring for pulmonary, hepatic, and thyroid toxicity but does not specifically address pancreatitis management, and contemporary AF guidelines similarly focus on extracardiac toxicity surveillance without a pancreatitis-specific directive, while pancreatitis guidelines generally frame drug-induced pancreatitis as a diagnosis of exclusion and do not provide drug-specific stopping rules, which means there is no guideline mandate to stop amiodarone solely for pancreatitis without individualized assessment [^e49ff77c] [^ecbe5a3f] [^0b26cb6c] [^571635a4].

> Next, I should review the risk–benefit balance. Amiodarone is reserved for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or selected refractory atrial fibrillation scenarios, and its extracardiac toxicities are well known; however, abrupt withdrawal can precipitate rebound arrhythmias, so I need to ensure the cardiac indication and alternatives are solid before recommending cessation [^22a7f25f] [^bc37a3a3]. But wait, what if the pancreatitis is severe or there is a compelling temporal link suggesting amiodarone as the culprit? In that scenario, the balance may tilt toward holding amiodarone while arranging alternative antiarrhythmic coverage, recognizing that the drug's long half-life means effects persist for weeks after discontinuation [^e37c924e].

> I will now examine practical decision factors. Let me consider severity and timing: if pancreatitis is mild, resolving, and there are other plausible etiologies, cautious continuation with close monitoring may be reasonable. If pancreatitis is moderate to severe, necrotizing, or there is a clear temporal relationship with amiodarone initiation or dose escalation, holding amiodarone is prudent while evaluating alternatives and ensuring arrhythmia control is maintained [^notfound]. I should double-check for confounders like hypertriglyceridemia, biliary disease, alcohol, or other drugs, because excluding common causes strengthens the case for drug attribution if amiodarone remains the leading candidate [^0b26cb6c].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified recommendation. For low-risk scenarios — mild, improving pancreatitis with alternative explanations — continue amiodarone with heightened vigilance for ongoing pancreatic injury and reassess frequently. For high-risk scenarios — severe or necrotizing pancreatitis, rising enzymes with supportive imaging, or a convincing temporal association — hold amiodarone and initiate alternative antiarrhythmic therapy guided by the underlying arrhythmia and comorbidities, such as sotalol, dofetilide, or catheter ablation where appropriate, while remembering that amiodarone's effects persist and that overlapping coverage may be needed transiently [^e49ff77c] [^bc37a3a3] [^e37c924e]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with guideline philosophy: yes, this approach mirrors the emphasis on individualized risk–benefit assessment and careful monitoring for extracardiac toxicity rather than reflexive discontinuation [^e49ff77c] [^ecbe5a3f].

> Next, I should review monitoring if amiodarone is continued. I need to ensure we are not missing evolving injury: track serial lipase and amylase, liver enzymes given amiodarone's hepatotoxicity risk, and clinical markers such as pain, nausea, and systemic inflammatory response, while also maintaining routine amiodarone surveillance for pulmonary, hepatic, and thyroid toxicity per guideline-directed follow-up intervals [^ecbe5a3f] [^e49ff77c]. If amiodarone is held, I should confirm that arrhythmia monitoring is in place and that any replacement therapy is dosed and titrated safely, with attention to QT interactions, bradycardia, and organ function, consistent with antiarrhythmic safety principles [^cd90544a].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and communication. I need to ensure the rationale for holding or continuing amiodarone is clearly recorded, including the strength of evidence, severity of pancreatitis, alternative etiologies considered, and the plan for alternative rhythm management, and I should counsel the patient about the potential association and warning signs of worsening abdominal pain or systemic illness that warrant prompt reassessment [^notfound]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the FDA label might instruct clinicians to stop amiodarone for pancreatitis, but on rechecking, the labels list pancreatitis as a postmarketing adverse reaction without a specific management directive, so the decision remains clinical and evidence-informed rather than label-mandated [^eb3fc3c7] [^16479947] [^2bede515].

---

In patients with acute pancreatitis, **hold amiodarone if there is a reasonable suspicion of drug-induced pancreatitis** or if pancreatitis is severe [^notfound]. Amiodarone is associated with acute pancreatitis in postmarketing reports [^eb3fc3c7] and a large case-control study showed a **fivefold increased risk** with current use [^2de77e04]. There is no definitive guideline mandating cessation, but given the drug's toxicity profile and long half-life, **discontinuation is prudent when pancreatitis is severe, persistent, or recurrent** [^a9a151f1] [^e37c924e]. If amiodarone is essential for life-threatening arrhythmias, continue with close monitoring; otherwise, stop and consider alternatives.

---

## Evidence linking amiodarone to pancreatitis

Multiple sources document an association between amiodarone and acute pancreatitis:

- **Postmarketing reports**: The FDA labeling for amiodarone lists pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis among postmarketing adverse reactions [^eb3fc3c7] [^16479947] [^2bede515].

- **Case-control study**: A large population-based case-control study found that current amiodarone use was associated with a significantly increased risk of acute pancreatitis (adjusted odds ratio 5.21, 95% CI 3.22–8.43) [^2de77e04].

- **Mechanisms**: Proposed mechanisms include direct pancreatic toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hypersensitivity reactions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

There are **no definitive guidelines** specifically addressing amiodarone management in acute pancreatitis. General principles include:

- **Discontinuation of offending agent**: In drug-induced pancreatitis, discontinuation of the suspected drug is recommended when a causal relationship is suspected or confirmed [^notfound].

- **Risk-benefit assessment**: Amiodarone is reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias due to its significant toxicity profile; therefore, the decision to continue or discontinue should be individualized based on clinical severity of pancreatitis and the necessity of amiodarone for arrhythmia control [^a9a151f1] [^bc37a3a3].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Severe acute pancreatitis (e.g. necrotizing pancreatitis, organ failure) | Discontinue amiodarone immediately |
| Mild acute pancreatitis with suspected drug-induced etiology | Consider discontinuation of amiodarone |
| Life-threatening arrhythmias requiring amiodarone | Continue amiodarone with close monitoring and consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if feasible |
| Recurrent or persistent pancreatitis without other identifiable causes | Discontinue amiodarone |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If amiodarone is continued, **close monitoring** is essential:

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular assessment of abdominal pain, serum amylase, lipase, and inflammatory markers.

- **Imaging**: Repeat imaging (ultrasound, CT) if symptoms persist or worsen.

- **Alternative therapy**: Consider alternative antiarrhythmic medications (e.g. sotalol, dofetilide, dronedarone) based on patient-specific factors and arrhythmia type [^f84e9015] [^5f7c4ce6].

---

## Conclusion and practical approach

Given the evidence linking amiodarone to acute pancreatitis and its significant toxicity profile, **hold amiodarone in patients with acute pancreatitis**, especially if severe or suspected to be drug-induced. Individualize decisions based on the severity of pancreatitis, the necessity of amiodarone for arrhythmia control, and the availability of alternatives. If continued, monitor closely for clinical deterioration.

### Amiodarone use and risk of acute pancreatitis: a population-based case-control study [^2de77e04]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is still lack of strong evidence, based on systematic studies, that support the relationship between amiodarone use and the risk of acute pancreatitis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between amiodarone use and the risk of acute pancreatitis in Taiwan.

Methods

This case-control study was based on the analysis of the claim data from Taiwan's national health insurance program from 2000 to 2011. There were 4986 subjects aged 20-84 years with a first episode of acute pancreatitis as the case group and 19,944 randomly selected subjects without acute pancreatitis matched for sex, age, and index year as the control group. Amiodarone use was defined as "current," "recent," or "past" if the most recent amiodarone prescription was filled within 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, or >6 months before the date of acute pancreatitis diagnosis, respectively. The relative risk of acute pancreatitis associated with amiodarone use was measured by the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval using the multivariable unconditional logistic regression model.

Results

After adjustment for confounding factors, current use of amiodarone was positively associated with acute pancreatitis (adjusted odds ratio 5.21; 95% confidence interval 3.22-8.43). There was no significant association between recent or past amiodarone use and acute pancreatitis.

Conclusion

People with current use of amiodarone are at an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Physicians should be more cautious about acute pancreatitis risk when prescribing amiodarone.

### Prescribing amiodarone: an evidence-based review of clinical indications [^bc37a3a3]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although amiodarone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration only for refractory ventricular arrhythmias, it is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic medications in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate and synthesize evidence regarding optimal use of amiodarone for various arrhythmias.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other studies with clinical pertinence. The search was limited to human-participant, English-language reports published between 1970 and 2007. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, electrical storm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, surgery, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and Wolff-Parkinson-White. Bibliographies of identified articles and guidelines from official societies were reviewed for additional references. Ninety-two identified studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

Evidence Synthesis

Amiodarone may have clinical value in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation, though other agents are available. Amiodarone is useful in acute management of sustained ventricular tachyarrythmias, regardless of hemodynamic stability. The only role for prophylactic amiodarone is in the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. Amiodarone may be effective as an adjunct to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to reduce number of shocks. However, amiodarone has a number of serious adverse effects, including corneal microdeposits (>90%), optic neuropathy/neuritis (< or =1%-2%), blue-gray skin discoloration (4%-9%), photosensitivity (25%-75%), hypothyroidism (6%), hyperthyroidism (0.9%-2%), pulmonary toxicity (1%-17%), peripheral neuropathy (0.3% annually), and hepatotoxicity (elevated enzyme levels, 15%-30%; hepatitis and cirrhosis, <3% [0.6% annually]).

Conclusion

Amiodarone should be used with close follow-up in patients who are likely to derive the most benefit, namely those with atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction, those with acute sustained ventricular arrhythmias, those about to undergo cardiac surgery, and those with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and symptomatic shocks.

### Using oral amiodarone safely [^24a80b0c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists. Here, we discuss safety issues relating to the long-term use of oral amiodarone in adults.

### A practical guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone: 2007 [^5b25d1b5]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Over- and under-use of amiodarone is common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Because of adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for use of amiodarone and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the member of the writing committee.

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^8d6ba648]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with new-onset AF who are treated with amiodarone should receive a loading dose, immediately followed by an infusion. Clinicians should consider continuing amiodarone infusions in patients who are receiving inotropes until the inotrope is ceased. Patients who have pre-existing congestive cardiac failure or SIRS diagnosed on admission into ICU are at a greater risk of recurrence of AF. Vigilance of magnesium replacement, avoiding excessive volume depletion and the resolution of SIRS would appear a reasonable approach to limit AF recurrence, particularly as many known parameters are managed routinely within a tight range for patients in the ICU. A clear dosing guide is not available and further research is required to elicit the best dosing strategy.

### Editorial: drug-induced acute pancreatitis: uncommon or commonplace? [^28f9a08c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Many drugs have been implicated as causing acute pancreatitis (AP), mainly based on the recurrence of pancreatitis following rechallenge with a drug that the patient had been taking at the time of an initial episode of AP. However, estimates of the relative frequency with which drugs cause AP vary widely. This is largely because many patients may be taking a number of drugs, may have co-morbidities such as gallstone disease or hypertriglyceridemia, or may be consuming large amounts of alcohol, making it difficult to determine what actually is the primary cause of an episode of AP. Large, rigorously designed epidemdiological studies are needed to better define the frequency with which the drugs in general cause AP and the specific risk of pancreatitis associated with any individual drug.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^3f293142]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride PO (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone): 
- Cardiac toxicity: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- Hepatotoxicity: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- Pulmonary toxicity: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3-6 months.

### SARS-CoV-2 rebound and post-acute mortality and hospitalization among patients admitted with COVID-19: cohort study [^161b5dad]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our study additionally demonstrated that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 rebound and post-COVID-19 mortality is consistently observed across antiviral treatments provided to the patients, although the association with post-acute sequelae in molnupiravir recipients was not found. This finding builds upon previous studies that have suggested no association of virologic rebound with either nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or molnupiravir treatment, as well as acute COVID-19 outcomes,–, despite a potential variation due to treatment initiation time. Of the post-acute sequelae, we observed a higher risk of post-acute atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, commonly reported post-COVID-19 conditions, in individuals with virologic rebound compared to those without. One speculation is that a prolonged viral persistence due to a deficient antiviral response may exacerbate cardiac function. Another potential explanation is that deprescribing medications for atrial fibrillation (e.g. amiodarone and dronedarone) may be necessary for patients receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to prevent adverse drug interactions. Noncompliance with the medications, combined with persistent virus presence in the body, may increase the risk of worsening cardiac function. While virologic rebound was shown to be related to seizure and pancreatitis among nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients, the low sample size remains a caution for interpretation. The observed association and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms warrant further verification.

Our subgroup analysis demonstrated that the risk of virologic rebound on post-acute death was more pronounced in individuals with more severe comorbidities. Given that these vulnerable populations may suffer from persistent infection with prolonged viral shedding,, the virologic rebound, as an indicator of residual viral burden, likely heightened the risk of adverse post-acute outcomes. The variability in the relationship among these subgroups necessitates further large-sample studies for confirmation.

In this study, we focused on the hospitalized population with COVID-19, as they received close monitoring with regular viral burden assessments during their hospitalization. Consequently, their COVID-19 was generally more severe compared to the non-hospitalized patients, which has been reported in some other investigations,. Similarly, studies have shown variations in the rates of viral persistence between hospitalized patientsand household individuals. However, it is important to note that our findings may not be fully generalized to patients with mild symptoms.

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC and CARDIAC TOXICITY

Amiodarone hydrochloride is intended for use only in patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause pulmonary toxicity (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis) that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of patients. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause hepatoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce dose if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue amiodarone hydrochloride if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC, and CARDIAC TOXICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Reserve amiodarone hydrochloride for patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity, some also life-threatening. Utilize alternative agents first. (1)

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^1117aa44]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^e37c924e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Amiodarone hydrochloride may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone hydrochloride may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but amiodarone hydrochloride can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of amiodarone hydrochloride, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

3.2 Efficacy

Median follow‐up for patients who received ablation for AF/AFL was 666 days in those treated with dronedarone and 688 days in those treated with placebo.

In patients with prior ablation, first CV hospitalization or death from any cause occurred in 35 of 90 patients (38.9%) randomized to dronedarone and in 42 of 106 patients (39.6%) randomized to placebo (HR: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.62, 1.53]; P =.91; Table 3). HR values for first CV hospitalization, death from any cause, and CV death were 1.05 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.66), 0.26 (95% CI: 0.03, 2.2) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.06, 7.5), respectively (Table 3).

Table 3 
Efficacy of dronedarone vs placebo in patients with ablation for AF/AFL before randomization in the ATHENA study

The most common cause of first CV hospitalization was AF/supraventricular rhythm disorders, accounting for 37% of first CV hospitalizations with dronedarone and 46% with placebo (Table S1). One death (because of cardiogenic shock) occurred in the dronedarone group and was not treatment‐emergent; five deaths (two sudden cardiac deaths, and one case each because of pneumonia, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and multi‐organ failure) occurred in the placebo group.

Among the 128 patients who were in sinus rhythm at baseline, AF/AFL recurrence occurred in 36 of 63 patients (57.1%) treated with dronedarone and 46 of 65 patients (70.8%) treated with placebo (Table 3). Median time to first AF/AFL recurrence was longer (561 days [95% CI: 342, 778] vs 180 days [95% CI: 61, 429]) and risk of first AF/AFL recurrence was lower in patients treated with dronedarone compared with placebo (HR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.42, 1.00], P <.05; Table 3 ; Figure 1).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone’s conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^b25abf68]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Acute amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^c1e3bd20]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic that frequently is used during the perioperative period. Amiodarone possesses a significant adverse reaction profile. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) is among the most serious adverse effects and is a leading cause of death associated with its use. Despite significant advances in the understanding of AIPT, its etiology and pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. The diagnosis of AIPT is one of exclusion. The clinical manifestations of AIPT are categorized broadly as acute, subacute, and chronic. Acute AIPT is a rarer and more aggressive form of the disease, most often encountered in cardiothoracic surgery. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the predominating pattern of amiodarone's acute pulmonary toxicity. The incidence, risk factors, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of acute AIPT are speculative. Early cardiothoracic literature investigating AIPT often attributed amiodarone to the development of postoperative ARDS. Subsequent studies have found no association between amiodarone and acute AIPT and ARDS development. As a drug that is frequently prescribed to a patient population deemed most at risk for this fatal disease, the conflicting evidence on acute AIPT needs further investigation and clarification.

### Recognition and management of hemorrhaging in combination with emerging enterogenic sepsis during a hepatectomy: a case report [^2f5cd0f0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The patient had a pre-operative base of cirrhosis. This also likely effected the outcomes, as current studies show that hemorrhagic shock, intestinal obstruction, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, and acute pancreatitis are all risk factors for intestinal flora and endotoxin translocation. During the course of the surgery, the patient experienced intraoperative hemorrhagic shock and we believe the patient was at high risk of intestinal flora translocation. Throughout the second half of the procedure, even after aggressive fluid resuscitation and the administration of vasoactive drugs, the patient continued to demonstrate paradoxical water deficit, inadequate tissue perfusion and low peripheral vascular resistance. In combination with the patient’s history and clinical presentation, we had good reason to suspect the possibility of enterogenic sepsis. The positive follow-up feedback also supports our continued treatment of enterogenic sepsis.

To facilitate the rapid identification of sepsis, particularly sepsis of intestinal origin, there are various screening tools that are now widely used in clinical practice. In addition to traditional screening tools such as Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) criteria and National Early Warning Score (NEWS), there have been several previous studies that have attempted to establish a system for identifying septic shock in patients with intestinal infections. For example, Peiling Chen et al. established a similar early warning scoring system for infection shock in patients with gastrointestinal perforation. It assessed items such as heart rate, lactate, calcitoninogen, C-reactive protein and its Grass score. In their study, Islam M.M. et al. applied mechanistic learning to the prediction of sepsis with better sensitivity and specificity than traditional screening tools. However, most current screening tools cannot be applied during anesthetic management due to the anesthetic state of the patient during surgery and the time it often takes to return test results. Further research should be conducted in the future to develop screening tools and identification systems that effectively offer early warnings of perioperative enterogenic sepsis.

Cardiac arrhythmias in patients with sepsis are often a challenge for anesthetists in the perioperative period. Amiodarone is now the first choice for the correction of arrhythmias due to its low cardiac suppression side effects. Notably, previous studies have shown that the success rate of electrical cardioversion is significantly higher in septic patients who have used amiodarone compared to those who have not used arrhythmia medication.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Nexterone) [^1ad977c5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There have been cases, some fatal, of amiodarone overdose. Effects of an inadvertent overdose of intravenous amiodarone include hypotension, cardiogenic shock, bradycardia, AV block, and hepatotoxicity. Treat hypotension and cardiogenic shock by slowing the infusion rate or with standard therapy: vasopressor drugs, positive inotropic agents, and volume expansion. Bradycardia and AV block may require temporary pacing. Monitor hepatic enzyme concentrations closely. Neither amiodarone nor DEA is dialyzable.

### Meta-analysis comparing the relative risk of adverse events for amiodarone versus placebo [^2c03bddd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone has been associated with adverse events that may restrict its use. We performed a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials to assess the relative risk of adverse events of amiodarone compared with placebo. In total, 43 randomized trials were included. A total of 11,395 patients were included (5,792 patients randomized to amiodarone and 5,603 patients randomized to placebo). The incident rate of adverse events per 10,000 person-years was higher in the amiodarone group compared with placebo for pulmonary (129 vs 74; relative risk (RR) 1.77, p = 0.002), thyroid (201 vs 42; RR 4.44, p <0.001), hepatic (54 vs 25; RR 2.27, p = 0.01), cardiac (771 vs 450; RR 1.94, p <0.001), neurological (140 vs 76; RR 1.93, p <0.001), and skin (81 vs 23; RR 1.99, p = 0.04) adverse events. Low-dose amiodarone was not associated with statistically significant increase in pulmonary adverse events but was still associated with thyroid and liver adverse events. In conclusion, the likelihood of experiencing adverse events related to amiodarone was higher than that of placebo. The overall rate of adverse events however, was low, and severe adverse events were rare.

### Low dose amiodarone causing pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis [^f534eb84]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a commonly used anti-arrhythmic in elderly patients. Abnormal liver function is frequently reported with its use but clinically symptomatic disease is rare. Hepatomegaly, cholestasis, acute hepatitis and rarely fulminant liver failure have been recorded [1, 2], however amiodarone toxicity presenting with cirrhosis is exceedingly rare. Toxic effects of amiodarone are well described with higher dosage but severe hepatic toxicity and cirrhosis with low dose amiodarone has not been reported in the English language literature. We present a report on a patient with pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis with low dose amiodarone.

### Drug-induced acute pancreatitis: an evidence-based review [^c4ce2d10]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of drug-induced acute pancreatitis often is difficult to establish. Although some medications have been shown to cause acute pancreatitis with a large body of evidence, including rechallenge, some medications have been attributed as a cause of acute pancreatitis merely by a single published case report in which the investigators found no other cause. In addition, some medications reported to have caused acute pancreatitis have obvious patterns of presentation, including the time from initiation to the development of disease (latency). There also appear to be patterns in the severity of disease. After reviewing the literature, we have classified drugs that have been reported to cause acute pancreatitis based on the published weight of evidence for each agent and the pattern of clinical presentation. Based on our analysis of the level of evidence, 4 classes of drugs could be identified. Class I drugs include medications in which at least 1 case report described a recurrence of acute pancreatitis with a rechallenge with the drug. Class II drugs include drugs in which there is a consistent latency in 75% or more of the reported cases. Class III drugs include drugs that had 2 or more case reports published, but neither a rechallenge nor a consistent latency period. Class IV drugs were similar to class III drugs, but only 1 case report had been published. Our analysis allows an evidence-based approach when suspecting a drug as causing acute pancreatitis.

### Fatal acute-on-chronic liver failure in amiodarone-related steatohepatitis: a case report [^f93056c9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for postprandial epigastralgia and vomiting for 2 weeks. She had a history of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, and she had undergone bypass surgery for coronary arterial disease 2.5 years previously. She had no alcohol consumption. Initial evaluation revealed distended abdomen, epigastric tenderness, neutrophilic leukocytosis (17.3 k/μL), elevated C-reactive protein, pyuria, liver panel abnormalities (i.e. hepatitis and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia), and coagulopathy. At presentation, the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, and international normalized ratio of prothrombin time were 226 U/L, 108 U/L, 11.72 mg/dL, 6.97 mg/dL, 2.1 g/dL, and 1.44, respectively. Two months before this admission, the serum levels of AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin were 144 U/L, 131U/L, 0.64 mg/dL, and 0.21 mg/dL, respectively. The AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) score was 2.04, an increase from 1.23 in 2 years. A hepatopathy screening including viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C, D, and E), auto-immune and hereditary liver disease was negative, except a document of remote hepatitis A infection. Computed tomography (CT) scanning disclosed hepatomegaly, periportal edema, and ascites (Fig. 1 a, b). Notably, a diffuse increase in hepatic attenuation density, a hallmark of iron or amiodarone deposition, was observed. Amiodarone had been prescribed at a daily dose of 400 mg (estimated total cumulative dose exposure of 360 g) since the bypass surgery for tachyarrhythmia. Liver attenuation was approximately 50 Hounsfield units (HU) before exposure to amiodarone (Fig. 1 c) and had increased one-fold by the following year. Amiodarone was discontinued upon admission. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used to treat a documented vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infection and other potential occult infections without significant clinical improvement. Leukocytosis persisted and a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scan 3 weeks after admission revealed multiple areas of active inflammation within the liver (Fig. 1 d). The pathological findings of a targeted biopsy of the largest hot spot (Fig. 1 d, arrow) in the FDG-PET scan revealed multifocal necrotizing suppurative microabscesses accompanied by aggregates of granulation tissue and histiocytes (Fig. 1 e). No pathogen was observed on acid-fast, periodic-acid-Schiff, and Grocott's methenamine silver staining. Moreover, the liver parenchyma demonstrated cirrhosis and regenerative nodules associated with prominent periseptal ballooned hepatocytes containing numerous Mallory-Denk bodies (Fig. 1 f). The changes of selective liver panels since the initial presentation were illustrated in Fig. 2. A rare presentation of ACLF was confirmed based on the findings of amiodarone-associated chronic steatohepatitis and superimposed microabscesses. The patient’s Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) ACLF score was calculated to be 69.4, and the model for the end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was high (> 30), indicating an unfavorable outcome (Fig. 3). The patient’s clinical condition deteriorated, and she died of progressive liver and renal failure.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drug pharmacodynamics—key interaction risks and monitoring are described: for Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), “Combinations of these drugs reduce cardiac contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia, intracardiac conduction disturbances, and proarrhythmia,” and “Co-administration of Class I AAD with beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and hypotension”; “Lidocaine is less effective in the presence of hypokalaemia; therefore, it should be corrected,” and “Propafenone increases the effects of cyclosporin, desipramine, and theophylline”; with beta‑blockers, “Their combination with Class I AAD, digoxin or amiodarone increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and myocardial depression … [and] The combination with diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided because it increases the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure”; for amiodarone, “Co-administration with digoxin, beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block and hypotension; thus, ECG and blood pressure should be monitored … Severe bradycardia has been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with hepatitis C antiviral drugs (daclatasvir, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir),” while “Combination of amiodarone with fentanyl may cause hypotension, bradycardia, and decreases cardiac output” and “Higher IV doses of dopamine and dobutamine are needed in patients on amiodarone”; torsade risk is highlighted as “Class I and III AAD (particularly dofetilide, ibutilide, and sotalol) prolong the QT interval and should be used with caution (or avoided) … [and] Hypokalaemia increases the risk of torsades de pointes and potentiates digoxin-induced arrhythmias; thus, it should be corrected”; for nondihydropyridine calcium‑channel blockers, “Co-administration of diltiazem or verapamil with disopyramide or inhaled anaesthetics decreases cardiac contractility and increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension; therefore, it should be avoided”; for adenosine, “Its coadministration with beta-blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, or verapamil increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block … Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine potentiating its effects; theophylline blocks adenosine receptors and decreases the effects of adenosine.”

5.2 	Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone

Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI [ledipasvir/sofosbuvir]). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered SOVALDI:

Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia
Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.

Patients who are taking SOVALDI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting SOVALDI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

5.3 	Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers

Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI. The use of rifampin and St. John's wort with SOVALDI is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^88c40261]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

A wide range of dosing regimens are used for treating AF (3–7.5 mg/kg bolus and follow on infusions of 1200–1500 mg/24 hours or 10 mg/kg/24 hours) [–,]. This lack of consensus on the best dosing regimen was reflected in our results. There was no uniform dosing strategy used and 35 % of patients did not receive a loading dose. Patients receiving an amiodarone bolus typically received an “ampoule” of 300 mg regardless of weight and had a median delay in a follow-on infusion of 2 hours. Patients receiving a loading dose and an infusion were less likely to have recurrence when compared to those in whom only a continuous infusion without a bolus was administered.

Several studies have reported risk factors for development of AF in the critically ill patient, mainly in the cardiothoracic surgical setting. Cardiovascular disease has previously been implicated in the development of AF. Factors which are predictive of increasing risk include coronary artery disease, cardiomegaly, low left ventricular ejection fraction, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and right ventricular dysfunction. Other studies have suggested inflammatory processes as a risk factor for AF, with SIRS, sepsis and a raised C reactive protein being implicated. Consistent with these, we found AF recurrence associated with congestive cardiac failure, altered fluid balance, low serum magnesium and an elevated white cell count, the latter supportive of the association with SIRS. The two patients with hyperthyroidism were not suspected clinically of such at the time of amiodarone administration.

### Randomized comparison of intravenous procainamide vs. intravenous amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS tachycardia: the PROCAMIO study [^6939e999]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Unexpected findings?

It is clear from the hypothesis and the sample size considerations that we did not expect such a high incidence of major adverse effects in the amiodarone arm. Leak et al.reported on using a bolus of 150 mg of amiodarone in 11 critically ill patients and stated that ‘hypotension, cardiac failure and bradyarrhythmias were not induced by this treatment’. In 38 critically ill patients, but having atrial tachyarrhythmias, a mean of 242 mg of amiodarone was shown to control heart rate without hypotension in any patient. In a series of 15 patients with recurrent VT, amiodarone at an initial dose of 5 mg/k over 15 min resulted in no significant adverse effect.In severely hypotensive recurrent VT, amiodarone produced less hypotension than bretilium.We hypothesized that if amiodarone was safe in these very sick patients it was going to be so in the stable patient with tolerated VT. However, in retrospect, some findings can explain our results: (i) when the arrhythmia is immediately life threatening, an antiarrhythmic action can produce such a benefit that overcomes potential adverse effects; (ii) in studies performed during resuscitation, all patients had previously received intravenous catecolamines (adrenaline) and in critically ill patientsmost were receiving catecolamines: these drugs may have counteracted the hypotensive effects of amiodarone.

Limitations

The study included less number of patients that were required according to our sample size calculations. Several reasons probably accounted for this: (i) extension of emergency protocols to treat these patients on the ambulance; in these protocols only amiodarone was allowed, precluding participation in the trial; (ii) fast turnover of medical personnel at emergency departments. In any event, recruitment rate was less than expected and declining, which prompted us, after nearly 6 years including patients, to end the study before having reached the number originally planned. In looking now to retrospectives series published in recent years, a low number of patients of this kind seems to be the rule, so it is possible that the condition is indeed rare.

The study design was randomized but not blinded. To avoid assigning less importance to adverse events related to one drug, major adverse events and reasons to stop the study drug were precisely predefined. In fact, since physicians are more familiar with intravenous amiodarone, if anything, less relevance to adverse events related to this drug could have been expected.

In summary, the initial approach to manage AF associated with cancer treatment has been chosen according to the 2 usual considerations, namely, the rhythm versus the rate‐control strategy and thromboembolic prophylaxis. 59, 60, 61 Although no score has been validated to predict the thromboembolic and bleeding risk in the context of active cancer, the working group suggests to indicate anticoagulation according to a multiparametric evaluation including the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score; thromboembolic and bleeding risk of the cancer; hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly (>65 years), drugs/alcohol (HAS‐BLED) score; platelet count; and life expectancy. It seems that lung, gastric, and pancreatic cancer are associated with a high risk of thromboembolic events. 62 Low‐molecular‐weight heparin may be considered as a short‐term measure, while warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants may be considered as long‐term anticoagulation options. The choice should be based on the risk assessment of drug‐drug interactions of each anticoagulant with cancer treatments and the specific bleeding risk of each cancer. Regarding direct oral anticoagulants, Xa inhibitors may be preferred to IIa inhibitors. The uptake of all direct oral anticoagulants is influenced by the P‐glycoprotein system, 60 but dabigatran appears to be the most at‐risk direct oral anticoagulants because of its low bioavailability and important renal elimination, which exposes it to a theoretical increased risk for drug levels outside of the therapeutic range. Regarding the decision on rate versus rhythm control, rate control rather than rhythm control strategy should be preferred, especially if the suspected cancer treatment causing AF is continued. 9, 59, 63 BBs represent the first‐line pharmacological class because of no/few drug‐drug interactions with cancer treatments. Digoxin and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) must be avoided because of the high risk of drug‐drug interactions with cancer treatments (P‐glycoprotein system, cytochrome P450 system). 64, 65 A rhythm control strategy can be discussed in patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control or in cases of hemodynamic instability. 9, 59 However, the potential for drug‐drug and QTc interval prolongation must be considered when associating antiarrhythmic with anticancer drugs.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In a total of 1836 patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 14% of patients received intravenous amiodarone for at least one week, 5% received it for at least 2 weeks, 2% received it for at least 3 weeks, and 1% received it for more than 3 weeks. The mean duration of therapy in these studies was 5.6 days; median exposure was 3.7 days.

The most important adverse reactions were hypotension, asystole/cardiac arrest/pulseless electrical activity (PEA), cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, bradycardia, liver function test abnormalities, VT, and AV block.

Overall, treatment was discontinued for about 9% of the patients because of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of intravenous amiodarone therapy were hypotension (1.6%), asystole/cardiac arrest/PEA (1.2%), VT (1.1%), and cardiogenic shock (1%).

Other adverse reactions reported in less than 2% of patients receiving intravenous amiodarone in controlled and uncontrolled studies included the following: abnormal kidney function, diarrhea, shock, sinus bradycardia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, VF, and vomiting.

### Drug-induced acute pancreatitis in adults: an update [^de7fc497]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced acute pancreatitis (DIAP) is a rare entity that is often challenging for clinicians. The aim of our study was to provide updated DIAP classes considering the updated definition of acute pancreatitis (AP) and in light of new medications and new case reports. A MEDLINE search (1950-2018) of the English language literature was performed looking for all adult (≥17 years old) human case reports with medication/drug induced as the cause of AP. The included case reports were required to provide the name of the drug, and diagnosis of AP must have been strictly established based on the revised Atlanta Classification criteria. A total of 183 medications were found to be implicated in 577 DIAP cases. A total of 78 cases were excluded because of minimal details or lack of definite diagnosis of AP. Drug-induced AP is rare, and most drugs cause mild DIAP. Only 2 drugs are well described in the literature to explain causation rather than association (azathioprine and didanosine). Larger case-control studies and a formal standardized DIAP reporting system are essential to study the true potential of the DIAP-implicated drugs described in this review.

Implantable cardioverter–defibrillator recipients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and frequent appropriate ICD firing—management: This extreme has been called defibrillator (tachycardia) storm and requires the addition of antiarrhythmic drugs and/or catheter ablation to control recurrent VT and associated ICD shocks; sotalol is effective in suppressing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and combining beta blockers with amiodarone is an alternative. Because many such patients have low EF and poor renal function, amiodarone and beta blockers rather than sotalol can be the first-line therapy; sotalol should be avoided in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function or significant heart failure, and intravenous amiodarone has been useful.

### Amiodarone hci [^cd40ea6f]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmics: Other antiarrhythmic drugs, such as quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and phenytoin, have been used concurrently with amiodarone. There have been case reports of increased steady-state levels of quinidine, procainamide, and phenytoin during concomitant therapy with amiodarone. Phenytoin decreases serum amiodarone levels. Amiodarone taken concomitantly with quinidine increases quinidine serum concentration by 33% after two days. Amiodarone taken concomitantly with procainamide for less than seven days increases plasma concentrations of procainamide and n-acetyl procainamide by 55% and 33%, respectively. Quinidine and procainamide doses should be reduced by one-third when either is administered with amiodarone. Plasma levels of flecainide have been reported to increase in the presence of oral amiodarone; because of this, the dosage of flecainide should be adjusted when these drugs are administered concomitantly. In general, any added antiarrhythmic drug should be initiated at a lower than usual dose with careful monitoring. Combination of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmic therapy should be reserved for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent or incompletely responsive to amiodarone. During transfer to oral amiodarone, the dose levels of previously administered agents should be reduced by 30 to 50% several days after the addition of oral amiodarone (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION, Intravenous to Oral Transition). The continued need for the other antiarrhythmic agent should be reviewed after the effects of amiodarone have been established, and discontinuation ordinarily should be attempted. If the treatment is continued, these patients should be particularly carefully monitored for adverse effects, especially conduction disturbances and exacerbation of tachyarrhythmias, as amiodarone is continued. In amiodarone-treated patients who require additional antiarrhythmic therapy, the initial dose of such agents should be approximately half of the usual recommended dose.

### Ritonavir [^a44590dd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pancreatitis

Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed hypertriglyceridemia. In some cases fatalities have been observed. Patients with advanced HIV disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of pancreatitis should occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and ritonavir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made.

5.5 Allergic Reactions/Hypersensitivity

Allergic reactions including urticaria, mild skin eruptions, bronchospasm, and angioedema have been reported. Cases of anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop.

5.6 PR Interval Prolongation

Ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients. Post marketing cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported in patients.

Ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease, preexisting conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities.

The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin and atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

5.7 Lipid Disorders

Treatment with ritonavir therapy alone or in combination with saquinavir has resulted in substantial increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate, taking into account any potential drug-drug interactions with ritonavir and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)] .

Class II

β Blockers are recommended as a first‐line therapy for rate control in AF with COVID‐19 infection. 46 All β blockers may have drug interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir, including PR prolongation, second‐degree heart block, and third‐degree heart block. 24, 47 Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase carvedilol and metoprolol serum concentration through CYP2D6 inhibition, 47 and telemetry should be monitored closely (Figure 1).

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inhibit CYP2D6 and may increase plasma concentration of metoprolol 48 ; a similar effect may be observed in carvedilol but has never been studied.

Carvedilol is a nonselective β blocker. Only immediate release is recommended in AF guidelines and only oral form is available, which limits its utility in acute AF with rapid ventricular response. 17, 49 Metoprolol and esmolol are cardioselective β blockers. 50 Metoprolol comes in both intravenous and oral forms, 17 whereas esmolol only has intravenous preparation. Both are effective when administered in AF, with rapid ventricular response. 17 β Blockers should also be avoided in acute decompensated CHF and bronchospasm. 49

Class III

Amiodarone blocks multiple ion channels, including I Na, I Kr, calcium channel, and acetylcholine‐dependent potassium channel, as well as α and β receptors. 38 It prolongs QT but is rarely associated with torsade de pointes (<0.5%). 51 Amiodarone is the most effective and most common AAD used in AF. 52 It is preferred for AF rate and rhythm control in critically ill COVID‐19 patients with significant CHF or borderline blood pressure. 46 However, information on amiodarone and COVID‐19 pharmacotherapy interactions is limited. Surveillance for liver, lung, and thyroid toxicity is recommended for long‐term amiodarone therapy and for short‐term use if clinically indicated. Long‐ and short‐term presentations of amiodarone toxicity have been reported. 53, 54 Pulmonary toxicity may be a concern for COVID‐19 patients with severe pneumonia who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Amiodarone should be used with extreme caution when coadministered with lopinavir/ritonavir (QT prolongation).

### Clinical insights into drug-associated pancreatic injury [^39ecdbff]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Drug-induced pancreatitis is one of the top three causes of acute pancreatitis. A drug exposure is traditionally determined to be the cause of pancreatitis only after other possible and common causes of pancreatitis have been excluded.

Recent Findings

In this review, we challenge this traditional notion of drug-induced pancreatitis as a diagnosis of exclusion. Instead, we propose to shift the paradigm of conceptualizing what we term drug-associated pancreatic injury (DAPI); as a continuum of pancreatic injury that can be concomitant with other risk factors. The aims of this targeted review are to harness recent literature to build a foundation for conceptualizing DAPI, to highlight specific drugs associated with DAPI, and to describe a framework for future studies of DAPI.

Summary

Our hope is that probing and characterizing the mechanisms underlying the various types of DAPI will lead to safer use of the DAPI-inducing drugs by minimizing the adverse event of pancreatitis.

### Dofetilide (Tikosyn) [^98bb9eb7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and Potassium-Depleting Diuretics

Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may occur with administration of potassium-depleting diuretics, increasing the potential for Torsade de Pointes. Potassium levels should be within the normal range prior to administration of TIKOSYN and maintained in the normal range during administration of TIKOSYN (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Use with Drugs that Prolong QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents

The use of TIKOSYN in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been studied and is not recommended. Such drugs include phenothiazines, cisapride, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants, certain oral macrolides, and certain fluoroquinolones. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with TIKOSYN. In clinical trials, TIKOSYN was administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone only if serum amiodarone levels were below 0.3 mg/L or amiodarone had been withdrawn for at least three months.

Discussion and conclusions

Identifying the cause of acute pancreatitis can be somewhat challenging especially when trying to identify a certain drug as the causative agent. Drugs are responsible for approximately 0.1–2% of acute pancreatitis incidents with most information about drug-induced pancreatitis being collected from case reports and case series which means that true incidence can be even higher. There is no one main mechanism behind drug-induced acute pancreatitis, but several potential mechanisms are currently based on theories. Of the proposed mechanisms include: pancreatic duct constriction with localized angioedema and arteriolar thrombosis, cytotoxic and metabolic effects, and hypersensitivity reactions. As well as drugs with side effects of hypertriglyceridemia and chronic hypercalcemia that are considered risk factors for acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of drug-induced acute pancreatitis requires a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and ruling out all other etiologies. Etiologies that were ruled out in this case comprise all possible causes of pancreatitis: gallstones, biliary sludge and microlithiasis, alcohol, smoking, hypertriglyceridemia, scorpion venom, post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), hypercalcemia, steroids intake, malignancy, infection, trauma, vascular disease. Based on American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, consideration for genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis is based on expert opinion and warranted for pancreatic cancer patients with a personal history of at least 2 attacks of acute pancreatitis of unknown etiology, a family history of pancreatitis, or early-age onset chronic pancreatitis ; therefore, the decision was made by the primary and gastroenterology teams on the case not to forgo with genetic testing to rule out hereditary pancreatitis. Immunoglobulin G4 level was 24 mg/dL (reference range: 1–100 mg/dL) which ruled out autoimmune pancreatitis. The evidence found to implicate a certain drug to the development of acute pancreatitis is often inadequate especially when the mechanism is unknown. Badalov N. et al. proposed a classification system of drug-induced acute pancreatitis. This system was based on the number of case reports found in the literature, the available rechallenge data, latency period and ability to exclude other causes of acute pancreatitis. After reviewing summary of drug induced acute pancreatitis based on drug class, we found that ampicillin and penicillin are considered class IV (single case report published, but neither a rechallenge nor a consistent latency period documented). If the pancreatitis resolves after discontinuation of the drug, suspicion for drug-induced pancreatitis increases. A firm diagnosis can be reasonably established with a rechallenge of the offending drug that results in the recurrence of pancreatitis symptoms. Rechallenge was not done in this case. Very few cases, less than 5 total cases, were documented in the literature regarding ampicillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid induced acute pancreatitis with true mechanism still being unidentified. Table 2 shows the comparison between our patient’s case with published data in the literature.
