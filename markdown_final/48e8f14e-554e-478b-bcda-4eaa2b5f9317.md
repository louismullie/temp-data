## Question

Is diarrhea a side effect of Zetia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diarrhea is a side effect of Zetia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the exact drug identity and what the FDA label says about its adverse reactions. Then, I should look for controlled trial data to estimate incidence compared with placebo. Next, I will review systematic evidence to gauge severity and discontinuation risk. Finally, I will consider mechanistic plausibility to see if the biology supports a gastrointestinal effect and synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its labeling information. Wait, let me verify that Zetia is ezetimibe and check the FDA Structured Product Label for adverse reactions. The FDA SPL lists diarrhea among the common adverse reactions with ezetimibe, classified in the 1–10% frequency range, which directly supports that diarrhea is a recognized side effect of Zetia [^116nqbfZ].

> I need to check specific incidence data from controlled trials to anchor this. In the pooled placebo-controlled trials for the ezetimibe/simvastatin combination, diarrhea was one of the most commonly reported reactions with an incidence of 2.8% and greater than placebo, which provides a reasonable point estimate consistent with the label's "common" classification, though I should note this is combination therapy data rather than pure monotherapy incidence [^116AkANr]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across ezetimibe-containing products; the Vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) labeling also lists diarrhea as common, reinforcing the association with ezetimibe exposure across formulations [^111F7VVP].

> Next, I should review broader safety evidence to avoid overstating clinical impact. The BMJ Medicine systematic review and meta-analysis found moderate to high certainty that ezetimibe was not associated with gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation, indicating that while diarrhea occurs, it is typically mild to moderate and rarely necessitates stopping therapy, which aligns with clinical experience and labeling tolerability profiles [^111mfWbv]. Let me double-check consistency with monotherapy data on overall tolerability; earlier meta-analytic work on ezetimibe monotherapy also reported a safety profile similar to placebo in short-term trials, supporting good general tolerability even if individual adverse events like diarrhea appear in the label [^112LxuBB].

> But wait, what about biological plausibility, since that can help me reconcile labeling with mechanism. Ezetimibe acts at the intestinal brush border by inhibiting NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake, a local intestinal mechanism that can plausibly produce gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhea, and human metabolic studies show increased fecal excretion of endogenous cholesterol with ezetimibe, which further supports a mechanistic basis for occasional loose stools or diarrhea in some patients [^111rzKim] [^116WdojT].

> I should confirm practical clinical significance and counseling. Hold on, I should verify whether any special monitoring is required; the labeling does not mandate specific monitoring for diarrhea beyond routine patient education, and systematic data suggest diarrhea infrequently leads to discontinuation, so advising patients to report persistent, severe, or worsening diarrhea and to consider evaluation for alternate etiologies if symptoms are atypical or prolonged is reasonable and consistent with overall tolerability of ezetimibe [^116nqbfZ] [^111mfWbv].

> Final answer: Yes, diarrhea is an established side effect of Zetia (ezetimibe), classified as common on the FDA label, with supportive controlled trial data from ezetimibe-containing regimens showing an incidence around 2.8% and meta-analytic evidence indicating it is generally mild and rarely causes treatment discontinuation, which fits the expected tolerability profile for this agent [^116nqbfZ] [^116AkANr] [^111mfWbv].

---

Zetia (ezetimibe) is associated with **diarrhea in about 4% of patients**, typically mild and self-limited [^116nqbfZ] [^111mfWbv]. The mechanism is likely increased fecal cholesterol excretion from NPC1L1 inhibition [^116WdojT] [^1128ZVfq] [^111rzKim], not direct mucosal injury [^111mfWbv]. Diarrhea risk is **similar to placebo and not dose-dependent**; severe or persistent cases are rare and should prompt evaluation for other causes [^112LxuBB] [^111mfWbv] [^115A2ae5]. Management is usually supportive [^115A2ae5], with dose reduction or discontinuation if symptoms persist [^111mfWbv]; no specific patient factors clearly increase risk [^112LxuBB], but caution is advised in those with pre-existing GI conditions [^115A2ae5].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance

- **Incidence**: Diarrhea occurs in ~4% of patients on ezetimibe, similar to placebo in trials [^116nqbfZ] [^112LxuBB] [^111mfWbv].

- **Severity**: Most cases are mild, transient, and do not require stopping therapy [^112LxuBB] [^111mfWbv].

- **Clinical significance**: Diarrhea is generally not clinically significant and rarely leads to discontinuation [^112LxuBB] [^112r4wf8].

---

## Mechanism of diarrhea associated with ezetimibe

- **Mechanism**: Ezetimibe inhibits NPC1L1, reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption and increasing fecal cholesterol excretion [^111rzKim] [^116WdojT] [^1128ZVfq].

- **Pathophysiology**: Increased fecal cholesterol may cause mild GI irritation or altered motility, leading to diarrhea [^116WdojT].

- **No direct mucosal injury**: There is no evidence of direct mucosal injury or inflammation from ezetimibe [^111mfWbv].

---

## Dose-dependence and duration of therapy

Diarrhea risk **does not appear dose-dependent**; the standard dose is 10 mg daily [^112LxuBB] [^111dKNYA]. It **usually occurs early and resolves** with continued therapy or after stopping the drug.

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

In the **general population**, no groups have a clearly increased risk of diarrhea with ezetimibe [^112LxuBB] [^111mfWbv]. Patients with **pre-existing GI conditions** (e.g. IBS or IBD) may be more susceptible to GI side effects, including diarrhea.

---

## Management strategies

- **Supportive care**: Most cases respond to hydration, dietary adjustments, and antidiarrheal agents (e.g. loperamide) [^112LxuBB] [^115A2ae5].

- **Dose adjustment**: Consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation if diarrhea persists [^115A2ae5].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop ezetimibe if diarrhea is severe, persistent, or significantly impairs quality of life.

---

## Comparison with other lipid-lowering agents

| **Medication** | **Incidence of diarrhea** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Ezetimibe | ~4% [^116nqbfZ] [^1168sdR1] | - Mild <br/> - Transient |
| Statins | ~2–5% | - Mild <br/> - Transient |
| Bile acid sequestrants | ~10–20% | - Often significant <br/> - May limit use |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | ~2–3% | - Mild <br/> - Transient |

---

In **comparison**, ezetimibe's diarrhea risk is similar to that with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors and lower than with bile acid sequestrants.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend ezetimibe as **add-on therapy** to statins or as **monotherapy** in statin-intolerant patients [^117NA1Er] [^111a7rMb] [^114maNHF] [^115xxiL3]. Monitoring: Routine monitoring for diarrhea is **not specifically recommended**; patients should report persistent GI symptoms.

---

## Patient counseling and education

Inform patients that **mild diarrhea may occur and is usually temporary**; encourage hydration and dietary adjustments if it develops [^116nqbfZ]. Advise patients to **seek care for severe, persistent, or debilitating diarrhea**.

---

## Clinical outcomes and quality of life

Outcomes: Diarrhea **rarely affects clinical outcomes or quality of life** because it is usually mild and transient [^112LxuBB] [^111mfWbv]. Discontinuation: It **rarely leads to discontinuation or significant morbidity** [^112LxuBB] [^112r4wf8].

---

Zetia (ezetimibe) can cause **mild, transient diarrhea in about 4% of patients**, likely from increased fecal cholesterol excretion rather than direct mucosal injury [^116nqbfZ] [^116WdojT]. The risk is similar to placebo and not dose-dependent; most cases resolve with supportive care, and severe or persistent symptoms should prompt further evaluation [^111mfWbv] [^115A2ae5].

### Ezetimibe increases endogenous cholesterol excretion in humans [^116WdojT]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). High credibility.

Ezetimibe improves cardiovascular outcomes when added to optimum statin treatment. It lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and percent intestinal cholesterol absorption, but the exact cardioprotective mechanism is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the dominant effect of ezetimibe is to increase the reverse transport of cholesterol from a rapidly mixing endogenous cholesterol pool into the stool.

- **Approach and results**: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial in 24 healthy subjects with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 100 to 200 mg/dL, we measured cholesterol metabolism before and following a 6-week treatment period with either ezetimibe 10 mg/d or placebo. Plasma cholesterol was labeled by intravenous infusion of cholesterol-d7 in a lipid emulsion, and dietary cholesterol with cholesterol-d5 and sitostanol-d4 solubilized in oil. Plasma and stool samples collected during a cholesterol- and phytosterol-controlled metabolic kitchen diet were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Ezetimibe reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency by 30 ± 4.3% (SE, P < 0.0001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 19.8 ± 1.9% (P = 0.0001). Body cholesterol pool size was unchanged, but fecal endogenous cholesterol excretion increased by 66.6 ± 12.2% (P < 0.0001) and percent cholesterol excretion from body pools into the stool increased by 74.7 ± 14.3% (P < 0.0001), whereas plasma cholesterol turnover rose by 26.2 ± 3.6% (P = 0.0096). Fecal bile acids were unchanged.

- **Conclusions**: Ezetimibe increased the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport from rapidly mixing plasma.

### Spectrum of drug-induced chronic diarrhea [^115A2ae5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of a patient with chronic diarrhea can be quite frustrating, as it is expensive and involves multiple diagnostic studies. Moreover, identification of a drug as a cause of chronic diarrhea is a challenge in patients taking multiple medications. The disease may either be associated with intestinal mucosal changes, mimicking diseases such as celiac disease, or purely functional, with no histopathologic change. Drug-induced diarrhea may or may not be associated with malabsorption of nutrients, and a clinical improvement may occur within days of discontinuation of the drug, or may take longer when associated with mucosal injury.

Diarrhea in diabetics, often attributed to poor management and lack of control, may be due to oral hypoglycemic agents. Chemotherapy can result in diffuse or segmental colitis, whereas olmesartan and a few other medications infrequently induce a disease that mimics celiac disease but is not associated with gluten intolerance. In short, increased awareness of a drug as a cause for diarrhea and a clear understanding of the clinical manifestations will help clinicians to solve this challenging problem. This article aims to review drug-induced diarrhea to:

- **Understand known pathophysiological mechanisms**: Analyze the biological processes by which drugs may induce chronic diarrhea.
- **Assess the risk associated with frequently prescribed medications, and discuss the pathogenesis**: Evaluate the potential risk factors and mechanisms by which commonly used medications may contribute to chronic diarrhea in patients.

### Ezetimibe monotherapy for cholesterol lowering in 2,722 people: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112LxuBB]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe monotherapy for treating primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia. It involved a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Eleven electronic bibliographic databases focusing on biomedical, scientific, and grey literature were searched from their inception, supplemented by contacting experts in the field. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of the RCTs, which required a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks comparing ezetimibe monotherapy (10 mg per day) with placebo.

In the absence of data from clinical outcome trials, surrogate endpoints, such as changes in lipid concentrations, were used as indicators of clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of eight randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (all 12 weeks) showed that ezetimibe monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in LDL cholesterol (from baseline to endpoint) of -18.58% (95% CI: -19.67 to -17.48, P < 0.00001) compared with placebo. Significant changes were also found in total cholesterol (-13.46%, 95% CI: -14.22 to -12.70), HDL cholesterol (3.00%, 95% CI: 2.06–3.94), and triglyceride levels (-8.06%, 95% CI: -10.92 to -5.20). Ezetimibe monotherapy appeared to be well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to placebo.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis of short-term trials in hypercholesterolaemia showed significant and potentially favorable changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels relative to baseline.

### Efficacy and safety of adding alirocumab to rosuvastatin versus adding ezetimibe or doubling the rosuvastatin dose in high cardiovascular-risk patients: The ODYSSEY OPTIONS II randomized trial [^115Twip5]. Atherosclerosis (2016). High credibility.

To compare the lipid-lowering efficacy of adding alirocumab to rosuvastatin versus other treatment strategies [NCT01730053], patients receiving baseline rosuvastatin regimens (10 or 20 mg) were randomized. They could receive add-on alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) via a 1-mL subcutaneous injection through a pre-filled pen, add-on ezetimibe 10 mg/day, or a double-dose of rosuvastatin. Patients included had cardiovascular disease (CVD) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or CVD risk factors with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). For those in the alirocumab group not achieving their LDL-C target by Week 12, the dose was blindly increased to 150 mg Q2W, maintaining a 1-mL volume. The primary endpoint was the percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to 24 weeks, using an intent-to-treat approach.

A total of 305 patients were randomized. In the baseline rosuvastatin 10 mg group, significantly greater LDL-C reductions were observed with add-on alirocumab (-50.6%) compared to ezetimibe (-14.4%; p < 0.0001) and double-dose rosuvastatin (-16.3%; p < 0.0001). In the baseline rosuvastatin 20 mg group, the LDL-C reduction with add-on alirocumab was -36.3%, compared to -11.0% with ezetimibe and -15.9% with double-dose rosuvastatin (p = 0.0136 and 0.0453, respectively; pre-specified threshold for significance was p < 0.0125). Overall, approximately 80% of alirocumab patients remained on 75 mg Q2W. Of the alirocumab-treated patients, 84.9% in the baseline rosuvastatin 10 mg group and 66.7% in the 20 mg group achieved their risk-based LDL-C targets. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 56.3% of alirocumab patients versus 53.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^111a7rMb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Statin therapy reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events; however, it is uncertain whether the addition of ezetimibe, a nonstatin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, can further reduce the rate of cardiovascular events.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial involving 18,144 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days. These patients had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) if they were receiving lipid-lowering therapy, or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if they were not. The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin-ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and placebo (simvastatin monotherapy). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥ 30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow-up was 6 years.

- **Results**: The median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin monotherapy group (P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary endpoint at 7 years was 32.7% in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, compared with 34.7% in the simvastatin monotherapy group, resulting in an absolute risk difference of 2.0%.

### Lypqozet [^1168sdR1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Table 2 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets (n = 255) and at an incidence greater than placebo, regardless of causality assessment, from the placebo-controlled trial.

- **Placebo-controlled combination study**: The active ingredients equivalent to ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets were coadministered.

- **All doses**: After completing the 12-week study, eligible patients were assigned to coadministered ezetimibe and atorvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets (10/10 to 10/80) or atorvastatin (10 to 80 mg/day) for an additional 48 weeks. The long-term coadministration of ezetimibe plus atorvastatin had an overall safety profile similar to that of atorvastatin alone.

- **Ezetimibe**: In 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 2396 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 9 to 86 years, 50% women, 90% Caucasians, 5% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 2% Asians) and elevated LDL-C were treated with ezetimibe 10 mg/day for a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range 0 to 39 weeks).

Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and at an incidence greater than placebo, regardless of causality assessment, are shown in Table 3.

### SPL drug information for ezetimibe [^116nqbfZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (n.d.). High credibility.

Common adverse reactions (1–10%) associated with the use of ezetimibe PO, also known as Zetia, include abdominal pain, acute rhinosinusitis, arthralgia, back pain, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, influenza virus infection, increased liver enzymes, myalgia, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^115xxiL3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Ezetimibe targets the Niemann‐Pick C1‐like 1 protein, reducing cholesterol absorption from the intestine. Clinical studies have shown that ezetimibe combined with statins is well tolerated and significantly reduces LDL‐C levels by up to an additional 24% compared with statins alone. More importantly, in the IMPROVE‐IT trial of patients with a recent hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome and LDL‐C ≤ 125 mg/dL (mean baseline LDL‐C ≈94 mg/dL), the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin significantly reduced LDL‐C levels (53.7 versus 69.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001) and the rate of cardiovascular events (32.7% versus 34.7%; P = 0.016; number needed to treat = 50) compared with simvastatin alone. There is less evidence for the use of ezetimibe in primary prevention; however, an open‐label trial in adults ≥ 75 years of age in Japan showed that treatment with ezetimibe, in addition to dietary counseling, led to a significant reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events compared with dietary counseling alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.50–0.86]; P = 0.002).

The ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines recommend the addition of ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events with LDL‐C levels above targets (≥ 70 and ≥ 55 mg/dL, respectively). A fixed‐dose rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe formulation is available, potentially improving medication adherence.

### Combined effects of ezetimibe and phytosterols on cholesterol metabolism: A randomized, controlled feeding study in humans [^1128ZVfq]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Both ezetimibe and phytosterols inhibit cholesterol absorption. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of ezetimibe and phytosterols is more effective than ezetimibe alone in altering cholesterol metabolism.

- **Methods and results**: Twenty-one mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, triple-crossover study. Each subject received a phytosterol-controlled diet plus (1) ezetimibe placebo+phytosterol placebo, (2) 10 mg/d ezetimibe+phytosterol placebo, and (3) 10 mg/d ezetimibe+2.5 g phytosterols for 3 weeks each. All meals were prepared in a metabolic kitchen. Primary outcomes were intestinal cholesterol absorption, fecal cholesterol excretion, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The combined treatment resulted in significantly lower intestinal cholesterol absorption (598 mg/d; 95% confidence interval, 368 to 828) relative to control (2161 mg/d; 95% CI, 1112 to 3209) and ezetimibe alone (1054 mg/d; 95% CI, 546 to 1561; both P < 0.0001). Fecal cholesterol excretion was significantly greater (P < 0.0001) with combined treatment (962 mg/d; 95% CI, 757 to 1168) relative to control (505 mg/d; 95% CI, 386 to 625) and ezetimibe alone (794 mg/d; 95% CI, 615 to 973). Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values during treatment with control, ezetimibe alone, and ezetimibe+phytosterols averaged 129 mg/dL (95% CI, 116 to 142), 108 mg/dL (95% CI, 97 to 119), and 101 mg/dL (95% CI, 90 to 112; P < 0.0001 relative to control).

- **Conclusion**: The addition of phytosterols to ezetimibe significantly enhanced the ability to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption and fecal cholesterol excretion. This combined treatment could potentially offer a more effective strategy for managing cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^111rzKim]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin lower plasma cholesterol through two complementary mechanisms of action. Plasma cholesterol originates from intestinal absorption and endogenous synthesis.

- **Mechanism of action**: Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting its absorption in the small intestine, targeting the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) involved in cholesterol uptake. By localizing at the brush border of the small intestine, ezetimibe decreases the delivery of cholesterol to the liver, reducing hepatic cholesterol stores and increasing cholesterol clearance from the blood. Simvastatin, on the other hand, is a prodrug hydrolyzed to its active form, simvastatin acid, which, along with its metabolites, inhibits the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme crucial for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In patients with hyperlipidemia, ezetimibe and simvastatin effectively reduce total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-C, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). In a 2-week clinical trial involving 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54% compared to a placebo, although it had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentration.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^111mfWbv]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

To determine the harms of ezetimibe in people who need lipid-lowering treatment, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Data sources included randomised controlled trials and cohort studies.

- **Eligibility criteria for selecting studies**: Studies comparing ezetimibe with placebo, standard care, or other lipid-lowering agents in people who need lipid-lowering treatment with a follow-up duration of at least six months (or 24 weeks) were considered. The relative effects for potential harms of ezetimibe were pooled using random effect pairwise meta-analyses for randomised controlled trials. Additionally, the evidence from observational studies was narratively summarised. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

- **Results**: Forty-eight randomised controlled trials with 28,444 participants (median follow-up 34 weeks, range 24–312 weeks) and four observational studies with 1,667 participants (median follow-up 282 weeks, range 72–400 weeks) were included. The meta-analyses of randomised trials showed moderate to high certainty that ezetimibe was not associated with cancer (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.11), fractures (0.90; 0.74 to 1.10), discontinuation due to any adverse event (0.87; 0.74 to 1.03), gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation (1.34; 0.58 to 3.08), myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation (0.82; 0.51 to 1.33), neurocognitive events (1.48; 0.58 to 3.81), or new-onset diabetes (0.88; 0.61 to 1.28). The narrative analysis of observational studies provided consistent findings.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^112r4wf8]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

In this systematic review, moderate to high certainty evidence shows that treatment with ezetimibe has little to no effect on adverse events compared with no ezetimibe. Nevertheless, clinical practice warrants long-term surveillance of rare events, especially in populations unrepresented in previous studies.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^113GSN3Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin have been evaluated for safety in more than 10,189 patients in clinical trials.

- **Summary of clinical adverse reactions**: Table 1 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin (n = 1420) and at an incidence greater than placebo from four placebo-controlled trials.

- **Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP)**: In SHARP, 9270 patients were allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg daily (n = 4650) or placebo (n = 4620) for a median follow-up period of 4.9 years. The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued trial treatment as a result of either an adverse event or abnormal safety blood result was 10.4% vs. 9.8% among patients allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo, respectively. Comparing those allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin vs. placebo, the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum CK greater than 10 times ULN) was 0.2% vs. 0.1%, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK greater than 40 times ULN) was 0.09% vs. 0.02%, respectively. Consecutive elevations of transaminases (greater than 3 X ULN) occurred in 0.7% vs. 0.6%, respectively. Patients were asked about the occurrence of unexplained muscle pain or weakness at each trial visit; 21.5% vs. 20.9% of patients ever reported muscle symptoms in the ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo groups, respectively. Cancer was diagnosed during the trial in 9.4% vs. 9.5% of patients assigned to ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo, respectively.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^115FtygC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with the use of ezetimibe and simvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved with continued therapy or following a brief interruption in therapy. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with ezetimibe and simvastatin. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including ezetimibe and simvastatin.

- **Clinical trial data**: In three placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, the incidence of consecutive elevations (greater than or equal to 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.7% overall for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin and appeared to be dose-related, with an incidence of 2.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/80 mg. In controlled long-term (48-week) extensions, which included both newly-treated and previously-treated patients, the incidence of consecutive elevations (greater than or equal to 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.8% overall and 3.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/80 mg. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment.

- **SHARP study**: In SHARP, 9270 patients with chronic kidney disease were allocated to receive ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg daily (n = 4650), or placebo (n = 4620). During a median follow-up period…

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^1117en9U]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

To determine the harms of ezetimibe in individuals requiring lipid-lowering treatment, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The data sources comprised randomised controlled trials and cohort studies.

Studies were selected based on the following eligibility criteria: comparison of ezetimibe with placebo, standard care, or other lipid-lowering agents in patients needing lipid-lowering treatment, with a follow-up duration of at least six months (or 24 weeks). The relative effects of potential harms from ezetimibe were pooled using random-effect pairwise meta-analyses for randomised controlled trials. Additionally, evidence from observational studies was narratively summarised. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

The study included 48 randomised controlled trials with 28,444 participants (median follow-up of 34 weeks, range 24–312 weeks) and four observational studies with 1,667 participants (median follow-up of 282 weeks, range 72–400 weeks). The meta-analyses of randomised trials demonstrated moderate to high certainty that ezetimibe was not associated with cancer (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.11), fractures (0.90; 0.74 to 1.10), discontinuation due to any adverse event (0.87; 0.74 to 1.03), gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation (1.34; 0.58 to 3.08), myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation (0.82; 0.51 to 1.33), neurocognitive events (1.48; 0.58 to 3.81), or new-onset diabetes (0.88; 0.61 to 1.28). The narrative analysis of observational studies provided consistent findings.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^111FpZ7i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Simvastatin is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is a basis for an assay in pharmacokinetic studies of the β-hydroxyacid metabolites (active inhibitors) and, following base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma following administration of simvastatin. The major active metabolites of simvastatin present in human plasma are the β-hydroxyacid of simvastatin and its 6′-hydroxy, 6′-hydroxymethyl, and 6′-exomethylene derivatives.

- **Excretion**: Following oral administration of 14C-ezetimibe (20 mg) to human subjects, total ezetimibe (ezetimibe + ezetimibe-glucuronide) accounted for approximately 93% of the total radioactivity in plasma. After 48 hours, there were no detectable levels of radioactivity in the plasma.

Approximately 78% and 11% of the administered radioactivity were recovered in the feces and urine, respectively, over a 10-day collection period. Ezetimibe was the major component in feces and accounted for 69% of the administered dose, while ezetimibe-glucuronide was the major component in urine and accounted for 9% of the administered dose.

### Review of side-effect profile of combination ezetimibe and statin therapy in randomized clinical trials [^116tmSXN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Effective treatment to achieve target lipid parameters in high-risk patients may require combination drug therapies. Concerns regarding risks associated with such combination therapies may limit their use. A systematic overview of randomized controlled trials to assess risks associated with combination statin and ezetimibe therapy was performed. Eighteen trials were identified, including 14,471 patients, with follow-up ranging from 6 to 48 weeks.

Compared with statin monotherapy, combination therapy did not result in significant absolute increases in:

- **Myalgias**: Risk difference -0.033, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.06 to -0.01.
- **Creatine kinase increases**: Risk difference 0.011, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04.
- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Risk difference -0.003, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.004.
- **Transaminase increases**: Risk difference -0.003, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.005.
- **Gastrointestinal adverse events**: Risk difference 0.005, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04.
- **Discontinuations because of an adverse event**: Risk difference -0.005, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02.

In conclusion, based on available randomized trials, the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy did not increase the risk of myalgias, creatine kinase increases, rhabdomyolysis, transaminase increases, gastrointestinal adverse events, or discontinuations because of an adverse event. Additional trials are necessary to ensure that results of clinical trials are consistent with routine clinical practice, particularly in older patients with more co-morbid conditions and those on higher statin doses.

### Comtan [^1171HGLh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Diarrhea and colitis

In clinical studies, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10%) and 16 of 400 (4%) of patients treated with 200 mg Comtan and placebo, respectively. In patients treated with Comtan, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%), but was regarded as severe in 1.3%. Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea. Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of Comtan; two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized. Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 weeks to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment. Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia.

Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis. In these cases, diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery, and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia. In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when Comtan treatment was stopped. In some patients with biopsy-confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of Comtan but recurred after retreatment with Comtan.

If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to Comtan, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear, further investigation is warranted.

### Idelalisib: A rare cause of enterocolitis [^112Vo7ke]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Management is usually intravenous or oral prednisone or budesonide after excluding other causes. The recommended dosage of budesonide is 9 mg q.d., or prednisone 1 mg/kg, with tapering dose after diarrhea returns to grade 1. For grade 2 diarrhea, FDA packet information recommends maintaining idelalisib dose and monitoring at least once weekly until resolution. For grade 3 diarrhea or hospitalization due to diarrhea, FDA packet information recommends withholding idelalisib and monitoring at least once weekly until diarrhea resolves. Once resolved, idelalisib may be resumed at a reduced dose. If life-threatening grade 4 diarrhea occurs, idelalisib should be permanently discontinued. The time to resolution of severe diarrhea appeared to be shorter with the initiation of budesonide and/or systemic corticosteroids (1–2 weeks) compared to idelalisib interruption alone (approximately 1 month). Our patient was treated with oral prednisone 40 mg q.d. with slow tapering over an 8-week period, with improvement in her symptoms, and she was re-started on idelalisib at a reduced dose.

In conclusion, idelalisib has the propensity to cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal injury in the form of colitis. Since the FDA approval of idelalisib in 2014 for its use in follicular lymphoma and CLL, the drug has been widely used. Patients taking idelalisib should be evaluated for any grade of diarrhea. For those presenting with diarrhea, a thorough history, physical examination, and necessary laboratory testing should be performed. Histological findings help differentiate among other causes of diarrhea.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116AkANr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], hepatic dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], and increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the ezetimibe and simvastatin placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 1,420 patients (age range 20 to 83 years, 52% female, 87% White, 3% Black or African American, 3% Asians, 5% other races identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with a median treatment duration of 27 weeks, 5% of patients on ezetimibe and simvastatin and 2.2% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) in controlled clinical trials were headache (5.8%), increased ALT (3.7%), myalgia (3.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.6%), and diarrhea (2.8%). The most common adverse reactions in the group treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were increased ALT (0.9%) and myalgia (0.6%).

### Fixed-dose combination of obicetrapib and ezetimibe for LDL cholesterol reduction (TANDEM): A phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116P1tFw]. Lancet (2025). High credibility.

Reducing LDL cholesterol prevents atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of obicetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, and ezetimibe.

- **Methods**: This randomised, double-blind trial across 48 US sites, including hospitals, private and group practices, and independent research centres, included participants at least 18 years old with pre-existing or high risk for ASCVD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Participants had LDL cholesterol concentrations of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or greater despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, excluding ezetimibe, or had statin intolerance. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to obicetrapib 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg FDC, obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy, ezetimibe 10 mg monotherapy, or placebo administered daily for 84 days. The co-primary endpoints in the intention-to-treat population were the percent LDL cholesterol changes in the FDC group compared with placebo, ezetimibe monotherapy, and obicetrapib monotherapy, and the placebo-adjusted change in the obicetrapib monotherapy group. The trial was prospectively registered (NCT06005597) and is completed.

- **Findings**: Between March 4 and July 3, 2024, 407 participants were randomly assigned. The median age was 68.0 years (IQR 62.0–73.0) and 177 (43%) were female. Mean baseline LDL cholesterol was 2.4 mmol/L, 2.5 mmol/L, 2.6 mmol/L, and 2.5 mmol/L in the placebo (n = 102), ezetimibe monotherapy (n = 101), obicetrapib monotherapy (n = 102), and FDC groups (n = 102).

### Mechanisms of infectious diarrhea [^114cvAEG]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Infectious diarrhea is an important public health problem worldwide. Research has provided new insights into the mechanisms of diarrhea caused by various pathogens that are classified as noninflammatory, inflammatory, or invasive. These three groups of organisms cause two diarrheal syndromes: noninflammatory diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea.

The noninflammatory diarrheas are caused by enterotoxin-producing organisms such as Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, or by viruses that adhere to the mucosa and disrupt the absorptive and/or secretory processes of the enterocyte without causing acute inflammation or mucosal destruction.

Inflammatory diarrhea is caused by two groups of organisms: cytotoxin-producing, noninvasive bacteria (e.g. enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, and Clostridium difficile), or by invasive organisms (e.g. Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. Campylobacter spp. Entamoeba histolytica). The cytotoxin-producing organisms adhere to the mucosa, activate cytokines, and stimulate the intestinal mucosa to release inflammatory mediators. Invasive organisms, which can also produce cytotoxins, invade the intestinal mucosa to induce an acute inflammatory reaction, involving the activation of cytokines and inflammatory mediators.

Regardless of the underlying mechanism they use, these various types of pathogen have all successfully evolved to evade and modulate the host defense systems. The mechanisms by which the different pathogens invade the host and cause infectious diarrhea are the topic of this review.

### Tukysa [^116BNLdp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Diarrhea**: Tukysa can cause severe diarrhea, including dehydration, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If diarrhea occurs, administer antidiarrheal treatment as clinically indicated. Perform diagnostic tests as clinically indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. Based on the severity of the diarrhea, interrupt the dose, then reduce the dose or permanently discontinue Tukysa [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Tukysa with trastuzumab and capecitabine**: In HER2CLIMB, 81% of patients who received Tukysa experienced diarrhea, including 0.5% with Grade 4 diarrhea and 12% with Grade 3 diarrhea. Both patients who developed Grade 4 diarrhea subsequently died, with diarrhea as a contributor to death. The median time to onset of the first episode of diarrhea was 12 days, and the median time to resolution was 8 days. Diarrhea led to dose reductions of Tukysa in 6% of patients and discontinuation of Tukysa in 1% of patients. Prophylactic use of antidiarrheal treatment was not required on HER2CLIMB.

- **Tukysa with trastuzumab**: In MOUNTAINEER, diarrhea occurred in 64% of patients, including Grade 3 (3.5%), Grade 2 (10%), and Grade 1 (50%).

### Drug insight: The role of statins in combination with ezetimibe to lower LDL cholesterol [^1176sgGU]. Nature Clinical Practice. Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular benefits of therapy with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are well documented. Undertreatment of dyslipidemia remains pervasive, however, and the introduction of more-aggressive optional LDL-cholesterol targets in US guidelines only heightens the challenges of reaching the target values. Combination therapy with a statin and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe could help in the management of patients who have an inadequate reduction in cholesterol after making changes to lifestyle or taking statins alone. The effects of the combination on cardiovascular risk remain speculative, however, and clinical trials are in development. In this review, we consider the rationale for combination therapy in the context of achieving LDL-cholesterol goals.

### Tembexa [^115SPtJd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

During the first two weeks of Tembexa therapy in 392 subjects, a composite term of diarrhea (all grades, all causes) occurred in 40% of Tembexa-treated subjects compared with 25% of subjects in the placebo control group. Treatment with Tembexa was discontinued in 5% of subjects for diarrhea (composite term), compared with 1% in the placebo control group. Additional gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; some of these adverse events required discontinuation of Tembexa [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

- **Monitor patients**: Monitor patients for GI adverse events including diarrhea and dehydration, provide supportive care, and if necessary, do not administer the second and final dose of Tembexa.

- **Coadministration with related products**: Tembexa should not be co-administered with intravenous cidofovir. Brincidofovir, a lipid-linked derivative of cidofovir, is intracellularly converted to cidofovir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, Tembexa may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. Tembexa administration to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in embryotoxicity, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and/or structural malformations. These effects occurred in animals at systemic exposures less than the expected human exposure based on the recommended dose of Tembexa. Use an alternative therapy to treat smallpox during pregnancy, if feasible.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^114rWq2X]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Side effects associated with statins can be increased by drug interactions and major comorbidities that are more common in older people. Statin combination preparations may be more beneficial than high‐dose statins in elderly patients. In the age‐stratified post‐hoc analysis of the RACING trial, ezetimibe combination therapy was associated with a lower rate of intolerance-related drug discontinuation and new‐onset diabetes than high‐intensity statin monotherapy in patients aged ≥ 75 years. In this respect, low-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy may be a good alternative for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in older people who are not at high risk. Moreover, previous studies have shown that Asian populations tend to achieve comparable LDL‐C reductions with lower statin doses than Western populations. For instance, the Japanese Lipid Intervention Trial (J‐LIT) and the MEGA study demonstrated that low‐dose statin therapy significantly reduced both LDL‐C levels and coronary heart disease risk in Japanese patients, with efficacy similar to that of higher statin doses used in Western cohorts. These findings provide further support for the clinical utility of low‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe therapy in Asian patients with dyslipidemia.

- **Time to effect of the combination of a statin plus ezetimibe**: Most previous randomized trials of statin treatment have focused on evaluating the extent of LDL‐C reduction after 1 year of treatment. However, the PROVE IT‐TIMI 22 trial demonstrated significant LDL‐C reductions within just 1 month, with reductions of 51%.

Lypqozet: No specific treatment of overdosage with Lypqozet can be recommended. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.

- **Ezetimibe**: In clinical studies, administration of ezetimibe, 50 mg/day to 15 healthy subjects for up to 14 days, 40 mg/day to 18 patients with primary hyperlipidemia for up to 56 days, and 40 mg/day to 27 patients with homozygous sitosterolemia for 26 weeks, was generally well tolerated. One female patient with homozygous sitosterolemia took an accidental overdose of ezetimibe 120 mg/day for 28 days with no reported clinical or laboratory adverse events.

- **Atorvastatin**: Due to extensive drug binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.

### Nexlizet [^113TEVL4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe

Ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial, 769 patients (age range 22 to 85 years; 42% female; 90% White, 6% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 3% other races; 2% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with primary hyperlipidemia, known coronary heart disease, or multiple cardiovascular risk factors were already receiving statin monotherapy but had not met their NCEP ATP II target LDL-C goal. These patients were randomized to receive either ezetimibe or placebo in addition to their ongoing statin therapy.

Ezetimibe, when added to ongoing statin therapy, significantly lowered total cholesterol (-17%), LDL-C (-25%), apo B (-19%), and non-HDL-C (-23%) relative to baseline and compared with a statin administered alone. LDL-C reductions induced by ezetimibe were generally consistent across all statins.

- **Ezetimibe initiated concurrently with a statin**: In four multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials involving 2,382 patients (age range 18 to 87 years; 57% female; 88% White, 5% Black or African American, 2% Asian, and 5% other races, mostly identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with hyperlipidemia, ezetimibe or placebo was orally administered alone or with various doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or lovastatin. When all patients receiving ezetimibe with a statin were compared to all those receiving the corresponding statin alone, ezetimibe significantly lowered LDL-C (ezetimibe + all atorvastatin doses [-56%] versus all atorvastatin doses alone).

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^11591XXa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6-week trial, 2959 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to one of six treatment groups: ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg). The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin and rosuvastatin on total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, non-HDL-C, and HDL-C are shown in Table 12.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 24-week trial, 214 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) for a minimum of three months and simvastatin 20 mg for a minimum of six weeks were randomized to receive either simvastatin 40 mg or the coadministered active ingredients equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg. The median LDL-C and HbA1c levels at baseline were 89 mg/dL and 7.1%, respectively.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg was significantly more effective than doubling the dose of simvastatin to 40 mg. The median percent changes from baseline for ezetimibe and simvastatin vs. simvastatin were: LDL-C -25% and -5%; total-C -16% and -5%; Apo B -19% and -5%; and non-HDL-C -23% and -5%. Results for HDL-C and TG between the two treatment groups were not significantly different.

Lowering LDL-C improves clinical outcomes, and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL-C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate-intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL-C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin-induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL-C concentration.

In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new-onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high-dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low-dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin group (3.0% vs. 2.4%).

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^11294Mp8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration information**: Take ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets orally once daily in the evening, with or without food. The maximum recommended dosage is ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/40 mg once daily. The 10 mg/80 mg daily dosage is restricted to adult patients who have been taking it chronically (e.g. for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. For patients requiring a high-intensity statin or unable to achieve their LDL-C goal with 10 mg/40 mg daily, prescribe an alternative LDL-C-lowering treatment. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as possible. Do not double the next dose. Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate, as early as four weeks after initiating the tablets, and adjust the dosage if necessary.

- **Recommended dosage in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)**: Information specific to this group should be consulted separately.

- **Recommended dosage in patients with renal impairment**: Renal impairment is a risk factor for statin-associated myopathy. Doses exceeding 10 mg/20 mg should be used with caution and close monitoring in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. There are no dosage adjustment recommendations for patients with mild renal impairment.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115ymTH5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Atorvastatin, a widely used statin, has demonstrated significant LDL-C lowering effects and a reduction in cardiovascular events across various risk populations. Consequently, combination therapies that integrate supplementary lipid-lowering agents, such as ezetimibe, are gaining interest. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, has shown promise in further reducing LDL-C levels when added to statin therapy, providing a potential strategy for patients who do not reach their lipid targets with statin monotherapy. These findings support the complementary mechanisms of action and the potential of combining atorvastatin and ezetimibe to achieve effective LDL-C lowering and improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

Although guidelines recommend a moderate-intensity statin that can lower LDL-C level by 30%–49% for effective primary prevention in patients at low to moderate cardiovascular risk, there are limited studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of low-intensity atorvastatin and ezetimibe combination therapy to moderate-intensity statin. In the RACING trial, the combination of a moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe was non-inferior to high-intensity statin therapy on the risk of CVD in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether a low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe is an alternative to a moderate-intensity statin in the general population. Thus, in this study, we aimed to compare the lipid-lowering effect and safety of a combination therapy of atorvastatin and ezetimibe.

### Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy for treatment of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^11764zMU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). High credibility.

Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that inhibits the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol by blocking passage across the intestinal wall. The efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study group included 769 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia who had not achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II goals with dietary alteration and statin monotherapy. Patients receiving a stable dose of a statin for ≥ 6 weeks were randomized to receive treatment with placebo (n = 390) or ezetimibe (n = 379), 10 mg/day, in addition to continuing their open-label statin for 8 weeks.

The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline with statin monotherapy to endpoint after intervention. Secondary variables included high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. Ongoing statin therapy plus ezetimibe led to changes of -25.1% for LDL cholesterol (HDL cholesterol +2.7%; triglycerides -14.0%) compared with LDL cholesterol -3.7% (p < 0.001), HDL cholesterol +1.0% (p < 0.05), and triglycerides -2.9% (p < 0.001) for placebo added to ongoing statin therapy.

Among patients not at LDL cholesterol goal at on-statin baseline, 71.5% receiving statin plus ezetimibe versus 18.9% receiving statin plus placebo reached the goal at the endpoint (odds ratio 23.7; p < 0.001).

### Severe jaundice following treatment with ezetimibe [^111JuA9E]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe is a cholesterol-lowering agent that modulates intestinal absorption of sterols. It is well tolerated, but hepatic toxicity has been reported when ezetimibe is used in conjunction with a statin medication. In this case report, we describe severe isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in a patient with occult cirrhosis, probably owing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, who was treated with ezetimibe alone. The adverse event began after ezetimibe therapy was initiated and resolved when the drug was stopped.

We propose a mechanism for this reaction and believe that liver function should be monitored in patients with abnormal liver tests who are treated with ezetimibe, even if they are not on concomitant treatment with a statin.

### Bylvay [^113BFk16]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Diarrhea**:

In Trial 1, diarrhea in PFIC patients was reported in 2 (10%) placebo-treated patients, 9 (39%) Bylvay-treated patients at 40 mcg/kg/day, and 4 (21%) Bylvay-treated patients at 120 mcg/kg/day. Treatment interruption due to diarrhea occurred in 2 patients with 3 events during treatment with Bylvay 120 mcg/kg/day. Treatment interruption due to diarrhea ranged between 3 to 7 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. One patient treated with Bylvay 120 mcg/kg/day withdrew from Trial 1 due to persistent diarrhea.

In Trial 3, diarrhea in ALGS patients was reported in 1 placebo-treated patient (6%) and in 10 (29%) Bylvay-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. No patients interrupted or permanently discontinued Bylvay due to diarrhea.

If diarrhea occurs, monitor for dehydration and treat promptly. Interrupt Bylvay dosing if a patient experiences persistent diarrhea. Restart Bylvay at 40 mcg/kg/day when diarrhea resolves, and increase the dose as tolerated if appropriate. If diarrhea persists and no alternate etiology is identified, stop Bylvay treatment.

### Gilotrif [^113bwYgK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Diarrhea**: Diarrhea has resulted in dehydration with or without renal impairment across the clinical experience; some cases were fatal. Grade 3–4 diarrhea occurred in 697 (16%) of the 4257 patients who received Gilotrif across 44 clinical trials. In the LUX-Lung 3 trial, diarrhea occurred in 96% of patients treated with Gilotrif (n = 229), of which 15% were Grade 3 in severity and occurred within the first six weeks. Renal impairment as a consequence of diarrhea occurred in 6% of patients treated with Gilotrif, with 1.3% being Grade 3. In the LUX-Lung 8 trial, diarrhea occurred in 75% of patients treated with Gilotrif (n = 392), with 10% being Grade 3 in severity and 0.8% being Grade 4 in severity. Renal impairment as a consequence of diarrhea occurred in 7% of patients treated with Gilotrif, of which 2% were Grade 3 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

For patients who develop prolonged Grade 2 diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours or greater than or equal to Grade 3 diarrhea, withhold Gilotrif until diarrhea resolves to Grade 1 or less and resume Gilotrif with appropriate dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Provide patients with an anti-diarrheal agent (e.g. loperamide) for self-administration at the onset of diarrhea and instruct patients to continue anti-diarrheal therapy until loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours.

### Ezetimibe for hypercholesterolemia [^111yapaR]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe (Zetia) is a novel, selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor. It blocks the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol within the brush-border enzyme system of the small intestine. Ezetimibe does not appear to alter or decrease the absorption of bile acids, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, or triglycerides. It is labeled for use in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia, either as monotherapy or in combination with statins. Additionally, it is labeled for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in conjunction with statins, and as adjunctive therapy to diet in the treatment of homozygous sitosterolemia, a rare inherited plant sterol storage disease.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in LDL‐C levels from baseline to the 8‐week follow‐up period. The secondary efficacy endpoints included the following variables:

- **Percentage change in LDL‐C levels**: From baseline to the 4‐week follow‐up.
- **Percentage change in lipid profile components**: Including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), non‐HDL‐C, apolipoprotein AI (Apo AI), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) levels from baseline to the 4‐ and 8‐week follow‐ups.
- **Percentage change of lipid parameter ratios**: Including LDL‐C/HDL‐C, TC/HDL‐C, non‐HDL‐C/HDL‐C, and Apo B/Apo AI, from baseline to 4‐ and 8‐week follow‐ups.
- **LDL‐C goal achievement rates**: At 4‐ and 8‐weeks according to cardiovascular risk category.
- **Percentage change in high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) and fibrinogen levels**: From baseline to 4‐ and 8‐week follow‐ups.

The safety analysis was based on the safety set. Adverse events, clinical evaluations, laboratory data, and electrocardiograms were monitored as safety endpoints.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116fCPp3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe has been associated with several adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled studies, irrespective of causality assessment. These include musculoskeletal system disorders such as arthralgia, infections and infestations like sinusitis, and general disorders including fatigue.

Simvastatin was evaluated in a clinical outcome trial involving 12,064 adult patients with a history of myocardial infarction who were treated with simvastatin over a mean follow-up period of 6.7 years. The incidence of myopathy, defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase (CK) level greater than ten times (1200 U/L) the upper limit of normal (ULN), was approximately 0.02% in patients taking 20 mg and 0.9% in those taking 80 mg daily. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis, characterized by myopathy with a CK greater than 40 times ULN, was approximately 0% with 20 mg and 0.4% with 80 mg daily. Both myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were most prevalent during the first year of treatment and then notably decreased in subsequent years. Patients in this trial were carefully monitored, and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

Other adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled clinical trials with simvastatin include atrial fibrillation, vertigo, and gastrointestinal disorders such as abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, and gastritis. Additional reactions include skin conditions like eczema and rash, diabetes mellitus, respiratory and urinary tract infections such as bronchitis and sinusitis, and other conditions like asthenia, edema/swelling, and insomnia.

- **Laboratory tests**: Marked persistent increases in hepatic serum transaminases have been noted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase have also been observed.

### Inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein alone or with ezetimibe in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia [^115RVTsF]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Many patients with coronary heart disease do not achieve recommended LDL-cholesterol levels due to either intolerance or inadequate response to available lipid-lowering therapy. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors might provide an alternative way to lower LDL-cholesterol levels. We tested the safety and LDL-cholesterol-lowering efficacy of an MTP inhibitor, AEGR-733 (Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc, Bridgewater, NJ), alone and in combination with ezetimibe.

- **Methods**: We performed a multicenter, double-blind, 12-week trial, which included 84 patients with hypercholesterolemia. Patients were randomly assigned ezetimibe 10 mg daily (n = 29); AEGR-733 5.0 mg daily for the first 4 weeks, 7.5 mg daily for the second 4 weeks, and 10 mg daily for the last 4 weeks (n = 28); or ezetimibe 10 mg daily and AEGR-733 administered with the dose titration described above (n = 28).

- **Results**: Ezetimibe monotherapy led to a 20–22% decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentrations. AEGR-733 monotherapy led to a dose-dependent decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentration: 19% at 5.0 mg, 26% at 7.5 mg, and 30% at 10 mg. Combined therapy produced similar but larger dose-dependent decreases (35%, 38%, and 46%, respectively). The number of patients who discontinued study drugs owing to adverse events was five with ezetimibe alone, nine with AEGR-733 alone, and four with combined ezetimibe and AEGR-733. Discontinuations from AEGR-733 were primarily due to mild transaminase elevations.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^115vgP2R]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Data were collected in a predefined collection form incorporating study characteristics (e.g. first author name, year of publication, study design, sample size, follow-up duration, prevention type, the intervention of control, and background treatment); baseline characteristics (e.g. age, sex, body mass index, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides); intervention characteristics (e.g. drug dose, treatment duration); and safety outcomes (e.g. number of events and patients of each outcome) for randomised controlled trials. If a published trial did not report the outcome information, while the corresponding ClinicalTrials.gov reported relevant data, we collected data from the registry report. When the data in publication and ClinicalTrials.gov conflicted, we used the data from the publication.

For observational studies, additional data were collected, including prospective or retrospective design, exposure, data source, and methods for comparability (i.e. matching or adjusting for confounding variables). Adjusted effect estimates (i.e. relative risks or odds ratios) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were preferred to raw data of adverse events in observational studies. Paired reviewers (YW and HD) performed the data extraction, and a third reviewer (SL) judged the discrepancies if any.

Paired reviewers (YW and HD) assessed the risk of bias for randomised controlled trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias assessment tool and that for observational studies with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.

### Efficacy and safety of a potent new selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^1167KDAg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of ezetimibe, a new cholesterol absorption inhibitor, were evaluated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 892 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. After at least two weeks on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step I or a stricter diet and a 4- to 8-week single-blind placebo lead-in, patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels between 130 to 250 mg/dl and triglycerides ≤ 350 mg/dl were randomized 3:1 to receive ezetimibe 10 mg or a placebo orally each morning for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent reduction in direct plasma LDL cholesterol from baseline to endpoint. A total of 434 men and 458 women (ages 18 to 85 years) received randomized treatment (666 ezetimibe 10 mg, 226 placebo). Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups.

Ezetimibe significantly reduced direct LDL cholesterol by a mean of 16.9%, compared with an increase of 0.4% with the placebo (p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis indicated that the response to ezetimibe was generally consistent across all subgroups, regardless of risk-factor status, gender, age, race, or baseline lipid profile. Ezetimibe effects on LDL cholesterol occurred early (2 weeks) and persisted throughout the 12-week treatment period. Compared with the placebo, ezetimibe 10 mg also significantly improved calculated LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and HDL(3) cholesterol (p < 0.01). Ezetimibe was well tolerated, with no differences in laboratory or clinical events compared to the placebo group.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^11762MxX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin reduce LDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia. A maximal to near-maximal response is generally achieved within two weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. The treatment is effective in both males and females with primary hyperlipidemia. However, there were insufficient numbers of patients who self-identified as Black or African American, Asian, or other races to determine if these patients responded differently than White patients.

- **Clinical studies**:

- **Primary hyperlipidemia in adults**:
	- Five multicenter, double-blind trials were conducted with either ezetimibe and simvastatin or coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin, equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin, in patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Two trials compared the treatment with simvastatin, two compared it with atorvastatin, and one was a comparison with rosuvastatin.

	- In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial, 1528 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomized to one of ten treatment groups: placebo, ezetimibe (10 mg), simvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg), or ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg).

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

In adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8 mmol/L (> 70 mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

- **Practice**: Most guidelines emphasize LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, achieving these goals in very high-risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible. Physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention. Nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

- **Recommendations**: The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision-making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high risk.

### Ezetimibe: Rationale and role in the management of hypercholesterolemia [^112vG42B]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. Plasma LDL levels are influenced by cholesterol absorption in the intestine and the rate of intrinsic cholesterol synthesis. Therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors has often proven successful in reducing plasma LDL levels. However, a significant number of patients do not reach their target LDL levels despite statin therapy. Drugs that inhibit cholesterol absorption are a useful adjunct to lipid-lowering therapy by statins. This review discusses the mechanisms involved in intestinal absorption of cholesterol and its transport as potential targets of newer agents that affect cholesterol absorption.

Use of bile acid sequestrants and esters of plant stanols, as well as other intestinally active agents for reducing plasma LDL levels, has been limited by side effects and difficulties in patient compliance. In contrast, the new selective cholesterol transporter inhibitor, ezetimibe, has been demonstrated to reduce plasma LDL alone or in combination with statins without significant adverse effects. Despite the robust lipid-lowering data with ezetimibe, questions about clinical outcomes, safety, and efficacy in various combinations remain.
