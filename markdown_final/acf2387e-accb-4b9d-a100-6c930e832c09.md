# Hyperlipidemia (HLD)

-Continue Atorvastatin
-Lipid Panel came back with:
	- CHOLESTEROL 143 mg/dL
	- TRIGL2 268 H mg/dL
	- HDL 44 mg/dL
	- LDL DIRECT 69 mg/dL

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to add more medication on managing a statin-treated patient with LDL-C 69 mg/dL and triglycerides 268 mg/dL, including risk stratification, LDL-C target confirmation, triglyceride-specific interventions, the role of icosapent ethyl, what not to add, HDL considerations, secondary causes, and follow-up monitoring timelines.

> Let me first interpret the lipid panel carefully: total cholesterol 143 mg/dL, LDL-C (direct) 69 mg/dL, HDL-C 44 mg/dL, and triglycerides 268 mg/dL, which means LDL-C is at or below usual high-risk targets while triglycerides are clearly elevated above 150 mg/dL, so the primary abnormality is hypertriglyceridemia on background of well-controlled LDL-C [^114maNHF] [^114G5pke].

> Hold on, I should verify the risk category because it drives management choices; the path branches if the patient has established ASCVD or has diabetes with additional risk factors versus a primary prevention setting without these, so I need to check history and diabetes status before committing to therapy additions [^112KRRTu] [^115JUt2M].

> Next, I will apply LDL-C target logic; for very high-risk patients, an LDL-C threshold of < 70 mg/dL is the usual benchmark, and for high risk, < 100 mg/dL, so an on-treatment LDL-C of 69 mg/dL already meets the most stringent thresholds, and I should not add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor here because guideline-triggering thresholds are not met, and I almost recommended ezetimibe reflexively, but wait, I need to correct that impulse given the LDL-C is already below 70 mg/dL [^112KRRTu] [^114maNHF] [^112SYNSK].

> Wait, let me verify a secondary target since triglycerides are elevated; I should compute non–HDL-C as total cholesterol minus HDL-C: 143 minus 44 equals 99 mg/dL, and for patients where non–HDL-C is used as a secondary target in the setting of high triglycerides, the non–HDL-C goal is typically 30 mg/dL above the corresponding LDL-C goal, meaning < 100 mg/dL when the LDL-C goal is < 70 mg/dL, so this value of 99 mg/dL also meets that target, which supports not escalating LDL-directed therapy [^113UoKbU] [^113FS4Vt].

> I need to ensure first-line measures for triglycerides are optimized; structured lifestyle therapy is foundational with 5–10% weight reduction, reduction in refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and 150 minutes per week of moderate activity, plus optimization of glycemic control if diabetic since hyperglycemia worsens triglycerides, and I should confirm these elements are in place before adding medications [^114G5pke].

> Now, I will examine pharmacologic options specifically for persistent triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL in a statin-treated patient; if the patient has ASCVD or diabetes with additional risk factors and LDL-C is controlled, adding icosapent ethyl 2 g twice daily is the preferred, outcomes-proven strategy to reduce cardiovascular events, and let me verify both the dosing and eligibility criteria align with ADA and endocrine recommendations before I proceed [^115JUt2M] [^115JUt2M].

> But wait, what if this is pure primary prevention without ASCVD or diabetes; evidence for event reduction is weaker in that group, so I should defer adding triglyceride-lowering drugs initially, intensify lifestyle measures, and recheck a fasting lipid panel in roughly 8–12 weeks to confirm persistence before reconsidering therapy based on overall risk after shared decision-making [^112KRRTu] [^1113X6JS].

> Let me consider alternatives if icosapent ethyl is not available or contraindicated; fenofibrate can be considered for persistent hypertriglyceridemia in select patients, but outcome data for ASCVD reduction are less robust and statin–fibrate combinations require caution, whereas niacin is not recommended for the purpose of raising HDL-C or for ASCVD event reduction given lack of outcome benefit and adverse effects, so I should avoid niacin for this indication [^116i9kih].

> I should confirm that targeting HDL-C pharmacologically is not indicated; trials increasing HDL-C have not consistently translated into reduced cardiovascular events, so HDL-C of 44 mg/dL should be addressed by lifestyle (exercise, weight management, smoking cessation), not by adding HDL-raising drugs [^116i9kih].

> Next, I should review secondary causes and sampling conditions; I need to check adherence to the current atorvastatin regimen, quantify alcohol intake, assess glycemic control, screen for hypothyroidism or other endocrine drivers, review medications that raise triglycerides, and verify whether the triglyceride measurement was fasting, recognizing that a repeat fasting profile is most critical when nonfasting triglycerides are ≥ 400 mg/dL but still useful for clinical confirmation here [^114VQKbQ] [^115eZYdk] [^113Vt8xA].

> I will now examine monitoring and safety; after any therapy change or significant lifestyle intensification, I should remeasure fasting lipids in 4–12 weeks to assess response and adherence, then at least annually thereafter, and I should check ALT and related liver tests if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity and CK if severe muscle symptoms arise on statin therapy, while reinforcing adherence at each interval [^1113X6JS] [^112KRRTu] [^116qP4pM].

> Putting this together, my final plan is as follows: continue the current atorvastatin since LDL-C and non–HDL-C are at goal, intensify lifestyle therapy targeting triglycerides, rule out secondary causes and confirm adherence, and if the patient has ASCVD or diabetes with additional risk factors and triglycerides persist at 135–499 mg/dL on repeat testing, add icosapent ethyl 2 g twice daily and reassess lipids in 4–12 weeks; if neither ASCVD nor diabetes is present, I will hold pharmacologic addition initially, recheck a fasting lipid panel in about 8–12 weeks, and revisit therapy based on persistent triglyceride elevation and global risk after shared decision-making, ensuring I do not add ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or niacin in this LDL-controlled, HDL-borderline context [^115JUt2M] [^112KRRTu] [^116i9kih].

---

No, **do not add more medications** at this time. The patient is on atorvastatin with **LDL-C at goal** and **triglycerides < 500 mg/dL** [^114G5pke]. Current guidelines recommend intensifying lifestyle measures and optimizing glycemic control first [^115JUt2M]; add icosapent ethyl only if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite these steps and the patient has ASCVD or is at high cardiovascular risk [^115JUt2M]. Recheck a **fasting lipid panel** in **4–12 weeks** [^112KRRTu] after lifestyle changes [^1113X6JS]; consider pharmacologic therapy only if triglycerides are persistently ≥ 500 mg/dL or if ASCVD risk is high and triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL.

## Current lipid profile analysis

| **Lipid parameter** | **Current value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Total cholesterol | 143 mg/dL | < 200 mg/dL | Within normal limits |
| Triglycerides (TG) | 268 mg/dL | < 150 mg/dL | Elevated |
| HDL cholesterol | 44 mg/dL | - ≥ 40 mg/dL (men) <br/> - ≥ 50 mg/dL (women) | Borderline low |
| LDL cholesterol (direct) | 69 mg/dL | < 100 mg/dL | At goal |

---

LDL cholesterol is **at goal** (< 100 mg/dL), consistent with guideline targets for primary prevention and most secondary prevention scenarios [^1158JvLe]. Triglycerides are moderately elevated (200–499 mg/dL) but remain below the 500 mg/dL threshold where pharmacologic therapy is strongly indicated to prevent pancreatitis [^114G5pke]. HDL cholesterol is borderline low, and **pharmacologically raising HDL is not recommended** due to lack of cardiovascular benefit [^116i9kih].

## Guideline recommendations for triglyceride management

Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) [^115eLZFi] provide **clear recommendations** for **managing elevated triglycerides** in statin-treated patients:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: First-line therapy for triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL, including dietary changes, weight loss, increased physical activity, and glycemic control [^114G5pke] [^1158JvLe].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Consider icosapent ethyl (EPA) if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL [^115JUt2M] despite lifestyle therapy in patients with ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk [^113BgXDn].
- **Fibrates or niacin**: Not routinely recommended unless triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL due to limited cardiovascular benefit and potential adverse effects [^114G5pke].

---

## Clinical decision-making considerations

Before **adding medications**, several clinical factors should be considered:

- **Cardiovascular risk assessment**: Determine if the patient has established ASCVD or is at high cardiovascular risk, which would influence the decision to add icosapent ethyl [^115eLZFi].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Assess adherence to lifestyle modifications, including diet, exercise, weight management, and alcohol intake [^113iw9LH].
- **Secondary causes**: Evaluate for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, such as uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, or medication-induced dyslipidemia [^114VQKbQ].
- **Patient preferences and adherence**: Consider patient preferences, potential side effects, and adherence to current therapy [^115e6wUP].

---

## Recommended next steps

Given the current lipid profile and guideline recommendations, **intensify lifestyle modifications** [^114G5pke] through dietary changes (reduce saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and alcohol intake), weight management (aim for 5–10% weight loss if overweight or obese), regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week), and optimize glycemic control if diabetic or prediabetic. Re-evaluate with a **fasting lipid panel** in **4–12 weeks** [^112KRRTu] after implementing lifestyle changes to assess response [^1113X6JS]. Consider pharmacologic therapy if **triglycerides remain ≥ 500 mg/dL** (add fibrates or omega-3 fatty acids to prevent pancreatitis) [^114G5pke], or if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy and the patient has ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk (consider adding icosapent ethyl) [^115JUt2M] [^113BgXDn].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on the current lipid profile, the patient is at LDL cholesterol goal, and triglycerides are moderately elevated but below the threshold for immediate pharmacologic intervention [^114G5pke]. Current guidelines recommend intensifying lifestyle modifications and reassessing the lipid profile before adding medications. Therefore, **additional medications are not recommended at this time**. Re-evaluate after lifestyle changes, and consider pharmacologic therapy only if triglycerides remain elevated or if the patient is at high cardiovascular risk [^115JUt2M].

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines [^114Szuyn]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, five major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical endpoints have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C.

- **Major recommendations**: In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL. However, when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option — a reasonable clinical strategy based on available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given.

### Adult treatment panel II versus adult treatment panel III: What has changed and why [^112JXmdx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel [ATP] III) differs in several ways from the ATP II guidelines. Several principal advances include:

- **New risk levels**: Introducing updated risk levels for major lipid measures.
- **Emphasis on primary prevention**: Increased focus on preventive measures for those without existing cardiovascular disease.
- **Inclusion of high-risk groups**: Integration of high-risk groups in secondary prevention strategies.
- **Broader lifestyle program**: Expansion of lifestyle modifications as part of the treatment plan.
- **Focus on implementation and adherence**: Greater emphasis on the practical application and adherence to guidelines.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the major changes in ATP III and to highlight the benefits of the new guidelines in the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular disease prevention: The search for superior treatment [^1122Zdrb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

US lipid-lowering guidelines indicate that optimal plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are < 100 mg/dL, and targeting global risk assessment has significantly increased the number of individuals who are candidates for intensive plasma lipid-lowering therapy. There is accumulating evidence that reduction of plasma LDL-C concentrations to targets even lower than those currently recommended may provide additional benefit in coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention.

For example, the Heart Protection Study (HPS) found that statin treatment initiated at a baseline LDL-C plasma level of < 100 mg/dL in patients at high risk provided a relative benefit in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events that was similar to when it was initiated at higher LDL-C plasma levels. In addition, it is becoming clear that CHD risk and the need for intensive lipid-lowering treatment may be underestimated in some populations, including individuals with the metabolic syndrome.

In the overall primary prevention population, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurement has been shown to identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events who would not be considered at high risk on the basis of systems of risk assessment. The increasing focus on intensive plasma lipid lowering to reduce CHD risk has placed a premium on the development of therapies with improved ability to reduce plasma levels of LDL-C.

### Waiting for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel IV guidelines, and in the meantime, some challenges and recommendations [^114MAbhB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) has provided education and guidance for decades on the management of hypercholesterolemia. Its third report (ATP III) was published 10 years ago, with a white paper update in 2004. There is a need for the translation of more recent evidence into a revised guideline. To help address the significant challenges facing the ATP IV writing group, this statement aims to provide balanced recommendations that build on ATP III. The authors aim for simplicity to increase the likelihood of implementation in clinical practice.

- **Recommended changes**: To move from ATP III to ATP IV, the authors recommend the following: (1) assess risk more accurately, (2) simplify the starting algorithm, (3) prioritize statin therapy, (4) relax the follow-up interval for repeat lipid testing, (5) designate < 70 mg/dl as an "ideal" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target, (6) endorse targets beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (7) refine therapeutic target levels to the equivalent population percentile, (8) remove misleading descriptors such as "borderline high", and (9) make lifestyle messages simpler.

In conclusion, the solutions offered in this statement represent ways to translate the totality of published reports into enhanced hyperlipidemia guidelines to better combat the devastating impact of hyperlipidemia on cardiovascular health.

### The impact of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines on drug development [^113SqBJS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

In the newest guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy, together with more attention to other lipid and lipoprotein parameters, is recommended for a larger group of dyslipidemic patients than was covered under ATP I and ATP II. A discussion to evaluate how future drug development might be affected by these new guidelines took place at the 14th International Symposium on Drugs Affecting Lipid Metabolism (DALM) conference, held in New York in September 2001.

These discussions involved how to develop new lipid-lowering drugs in an era in which so much compelling evidence demonstrates the benefits of statins. Also covered were issues related to the development of drugs with triglyceride indications and whether the proportion of patients achieving NCEP guidelines should be included in the label of lipid-lowering drugs.

Additional topics discussed included:

- **The possibility of incorporating a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) indication for lipid-lowering drugs**: This includes examining how such an indication could contribute to broader treatment coverage.
- **The possibility of obtaining indications for lipid-lowering drugs specifically in patients with diabetes**: Exploring how targeted therapies could benefit this subgroup of patients.
- **The place of combination lipid-lowering drug therapy in drug development**: Evaluating the effectiveness and potential of using combination therapies to manage lipid levels.
- **Whether drugs could be approved to increase levels of HDL-C in patients with isolated low HDL-C**: Considering regulatory pathways and clinical outcomes associated with raising HDL-C levels in such patients.

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: A review [^1153MtUo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Both the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline on the management of blood cholesterol and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias recommend obtaining a lipid profile four weeks after admission for acute coronary syndromes (ACS). As LDL-C levels vary minimally after normal food intake, a non-fasting sample can be used.

- **American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline recommendations**: An overview of recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy applied to patients with ACS is provided. In brief, three agents with well-documented safety and efficacy can be prescribed: statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe. The appropriate timing of initiation and/or escalation of these agents depends on:
	1. Whether patients are already on maximally tolerated doses of statin and/or ezetimibe
	2. The LDL-C level at the time of ACS

	- The foundation of LDL-C-lowering therapy is the prompt initiation of high-intensity statin, followed by the addition of either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to hopefully blunt the short-term re-ischemic complication rate. Guidelines advocate adding ezetimibe first as this is a more cost-effective strategy, but also allow for the initiation of PSCK9 inhibitors without ezetimibe.

The rationale for considering the initiation of a PSCK9 inhibitor without first starting ezetimibe is highlighted by the fact that only 3% and 5% of patients were on ezetimibe in the large phase 3 randomized FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects) study.

### Achieving optimal lipid goals in patients with coronary artery disease [^112JCcNb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy recommend intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol for patients with coronary artery disease. Previous studies have found that many high-risk patients are not achieving their LDL cholesterol goals. Furthermore, many patients, despite being treated with lipid-lowering therapy, also have elevated triglycerides or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

To evaluate lipid goals in a "real world" clinical setting, the electronic medical records of 10,040 patients with coronary artery disease from a large cardiology subspecialty practice from September 2008 to September 2009 were reviewed. Overall, 79% of patients achieved an LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl, while only 35% achieved the more aggressive goal of < 70 mg/dl. Non-HDL cholesterol goals of < 130 and < 100 mg/dl were achieved in 79% and 44% of patients, respectively. Only 69% achieved normal triglyceride levels, and only 63% of men and 56% of women achieved normal levels of HDL cholesterol. Women and younger men were less likely to achieve their lipid goals.

In conclusion, most patients with coronary artery disease achieve the minimal LDL cholesterol goal of 100 mg/dl, but few achieve the more aggressive goals of < 70 mg/dl. Many high-risk patients have elevated levels of triglycerides or low levels of HDL cholesterol despite treatment. Combination lipid-lowering therapy is used infrequently in practice. There exists a significant opportunity for physicians to more aggressively treat lipids to achieve the levels recommended by clinical guidelines.

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines [^116LHhiW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, five major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical endpoints have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C.

- **Major recommendations for modifications**: The ATP III treatment algorithm suggests the following:
	- In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL.
	- When the risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, i.e. a reasonable clinical strategy, based on available clinical trial evidence.
	- This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL.
	- Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to further adapting the treatment strategy.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^117R2keY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

An analysis of a prespecified exploratory cardiovascular composite endpoint, which comprises a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities–defined cardiovascular basket of nonadjudicated terms, was conducted in the ORION‐10 and ORION‐11 trials. It reported a lower frequency of adverse events in the inclisiran group versus placebo. Although these preliminary observations are based on a low number of adverse events, they align with the general concept that lowering LDL‐C reduces the risk of future cardiovascular events. These data support the research in the phase 3 ORION‐4 and VICTORION‐2 PREVENT CV outcome trials.

The recent 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP) on the role of nonstatin therapies in ASCVD emphasizes the need to intensify lipid‐lowering therapy in patients with elevated LDL‐C in the secondary prevention setting. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies is recommended for patients who require additional LDL‐C lowering, with differing target thresholds based on the patient's level of risk. The role of inclisiran as a nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy is included in the ECDP, with recommendations considering both the LDL‐C–lowering efficacy of inclisiran and ongoing clinical trials to evaluate its ability to reduce cardiovascular events.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to lipoprotein(a), EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering obtaining lipoprotein(a) at least once in each adult person's lifetime. This is to identify patients with very high inherited lipoprotein(a) levels above 180 mg/dL (greater than 430 mmol/L) having a lifetime risk of ASCVD equivalent to the risk associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113qnKvN]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically with respect to screening for dyslipidemia, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a lipid profile at the time of diagnosis, during an initial medical evaluation, annually thereafter, or more frequently if indicated in adult patients with diabetes not taking statins or other lipid-lowering therapy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, particularly in monitoring adherence to treatment, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend assessing adherence to lifestyle changes and the effects of LDL-C-lowering medication. This involves measuring fasting lipids and appropriate safety indicators 4–12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment, and every 3–12 months thereafter, based on the need to assess adherence or safety.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

Lypqozet, which contains a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

- **Reduce lipid levels**: Reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

- **Address homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)**: Reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with HoFH, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments.

- **Limitations of use**: No incremental benefit of Lypqozet on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established. Lypqozet has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

### New features of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III lipid-lowering guidelines [^113UoKbU]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk contain several distinguishing features from the previous ATP guidelines. These new features include modifications in lipid/lipoprotein levels considered optimal, abnormal, or reflective of risk; increased focus on primary prevention through the use of Framingham risk scoring to define risk in persons with multiple lipid/nonlipid risk factors; and an increased focus on the association of the metabolic syndrome with CHD risk.

The introduction of the category of CHD risk equivalents — including persons with atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, or a 10-year CHD risk greater than 20% based on Framingham scoring — results in an increase over previous guidelines in the proportion of patients categorized as being at high risk, and therefore eligible for more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapy. The use of the new secondary therapeutic target of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol should improve the management of lipid risk factors in patients who have elevated triglyceride levels after LDL-C goals have been met. These new features of the NCEP ATP III guidelines should improve identification and treatment of patients with dyslipidemias associated with CHD risk.

### A new statin: A new standard [^117DWGra]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatments designed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in the setting of either primary or secondary prevention. The rationale for aggressive lowering of LDL-C, supported by large observational studies, is the concept that no threshold exists below which reductions fail to provide additional benefit.

The statins are widely considered first-line therapy for preventing CHD events because these agents yield the greatest reductions in LDL-C. However, many patients do not achieve target LDL-C levels with the currently available statins. Newer, more effective statins may permit the benefits of aggressive LDL-C reduction to be extended to larger numbers of patients. A novel, highly efficacious statin, rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca group of companies), is currently undergoing clinical investigation.

- **Dose-ranging studies**: In hypercholesterolemic patients, these studies have shown that rosuvastatin produces significant, dose-dependent decreases in LDL-C when compared with placebo. Reductions have ranged from 34% at a dose of 1 mg/day to 65% at 80 mg/day. This agent has been found to be well tolerated across the range of doses studied.

- **Phase III studies**: Indicate that rosuvastatin is more effective than atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of hypercholesterolemic patients, and more effective than atorvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^116KCWdq]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

- **Dyslipidemia/lipid management**: In most adult patients, fasting lipid profiles should be measured at least annually. Adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol > 50 mg/dL, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL) may require less frequent assessments if they possess no multiple CVD risk factors.

- **Screening**: In individuals without overt cardiovascular disease (CVD), the primary goal is to maintain LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). In those with overt CVD, a more stringent LDL cholesterol goal of less than 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) using a high dose of statin therapy is an option. If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets with maximal tolerated statin therapy, achieving a reduction in LDL cholesterol of approximately 30–40% from baseline is suggested as an alternative therapeutic goal. Triglycerides levels should remain below 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).

Evidence for the underuse of lipid-lowering therapies in clinical practice

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL-C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline-recommended LDL-C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of over 600,000 US patients with established ASCVD. During the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid-lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL-C goals. A retrospective cohort study of approximately 1.5 million patients with a history of at least one major ASCVD event reported that more than 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high-risk criteria had LDL-C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a two-year period, two-thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL-C levels > 70 mg/dL, and only 17% received appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: What are their effects on the lipid profile [^114ViDfq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Many medications widely prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influence, to varying degrees, selected components of the routine lipid profile (i.e. LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG levels) and potentially, the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While some effects may be significant, many medications are associated with relatively small changes in the lipid profile and are, therefore, unlikely to affect ASCVD risk by themselves. However, the cumulative effect in patients taking multiple medications may be significant and should not be overlooked.

The net effects of these medications on the lipid profile, in addition to effects on other factors related to cardiovascular (CV) health, should be anticipated, and their overall potential impact on ASCVD risk should be considered. Therefore, clinicians can help ensure optimal care and avoid putting patients at unnecessary risk by performing ongoing lipid-panel monitoring, taking into account potential effects of commonly prescribed medications. Ultimately, lifestyle recommendations and lipid-lowering agents are required to target atherogenic cholesterol and achieve the appropriate goals determined by the absolute risk for an individual, especially those with a relatively higher absolute risk, such as patients with diabetes.

### Association between change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality: Systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^116i9kih]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The lipid-modifying effects of various interventions are significant in addressing cardiovascular risks. The table below summarizes the baseline concentrations and changes in lipid subfractions for different classes of intervention.

The average weighted mean baseline low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration for all included participants was 140 mg/dl (SD 23; range 84–279) (3.62 mmol/l), and the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was 47 mg/dl (SD 7.4; range 32–62) (1.22 mmol/l). The weighted mean change in LDL cholesterol was −23 mg/dl (SD 19) (−0.59 mmol/l), whereas the weighted mean change in HDL cholesterol was 1.7 mg/dl (SD 3.1) (0.04 mmol/l).

Almost all classes of intervention reduced LDL cholesterol except for n-3 fatty acids and glitazones. HDL cholesterol was raised by most classes of intervention except for n-3 fatty acids, low-fat diets, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors, and probucol. Additionally, high-dose statin treatment (defined as 80 mg daily simvastatin or atorvastatin) slightly reduced HDL cholesterol compared with less intensive statin treatment (weighted mean change −0.23 mg/dl, SD 0.83), whereas statins overall raised it moderately (weighted mean change 1.6 mg/dl, SD 1.5).

### Lipid testing and statin dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^114vDKLP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statins for patients after myocardial infarction (MI) rather than treating to a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal, as the previous ATP III (Adult Treatment Panel third report) guidelines had advised.

- **Methods and results**: To evaluate the frequency of postdischarge lipid testing and high-intensity statin use among MI patients discharged on a statin during the ATP III guidelines era, we linked ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) Registry data to Medicare claims for 11,046 MI patients aged ≥ 65 years. These patients were discharged alive on a statin from 347 hospitals between 2007–2009. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the association between lipid testing and 1-year high-intensity statin use.

	- Only 21% of MI patients were discharged on a high-intensity statin. By 90 days after MI, 44% of patients discharged on a statin underwent lipid testing (43% on low- or moderate-intensity statins and 49% on high-intensity statins; P = 0.001). Follow-up lipid testing rates were 47% among patients with in-hospital low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dL and 47% among newly prescribed statin recipients. By 1 year, only 14% of patients were on high-intensity statins. Only 4% of patients discharged on low- or moderate-dose statin were uptitrated to high intensity. Postdischarge lipid testing was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of high-intensity statin use by 1 year (5.4% versus 2.9%, adjusted odds ratio: 1.92; 95% confidence interval).

### Use of lipid-lowering therapies over 2 years in GOULD, a registry of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the US [^114t9QPL]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Guidelines for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) recommend intensive statin therapy and adding nonstatin therapy if low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are 70 mg/dL or more. Compliance with guidelines is often low.

The objective of the study was to track LDL-C treatment patterns in the US over 2 years. GOULD is a prospective observational registry study involving multiple centers. Patients with ASCVD receiving any lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were eligible. Between December 2016 and July 2018, patients were enrolled in one of three cohorts: (1) those currently receiving proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) and, (2) those not receiving PCSK9i drugs with LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or more, or (3) with LDL-C levels of 70 to 99 mg/dL. Patients had medical record reviews and telephone interviews every six months. Analysis was done on data collected as of October 5, 2020.

The primary outcome was the change in LLT use over two years. Secondary outcomes included the number of LDL-C measurements, LDL-C levels, and responses to structured physician and patient questionnaires over two years.

A total of 5006 patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 67.8 [9.9] years; 1985 women [39.7%]; 4312 White individuals [86.1%]). At two years, 885 (17.1%) had LLT intensification. In the cohorts with LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or more and 70 to 99 mg/dL, LLT intensification occurred in 403 (22.4%) and 383 (14.4%), respectively; statins were intensified in 115 (6.4%) and 168 (6.3%).

### Frequency of obtaining National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III goals for all major serum lipoproteins after initiation of lipid altering therapy [^117DkTZj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Statin treatment targeting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction, but many statin users still face greatly elevated risks. Some experts advocate additional therapy that targets high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the size of the patient group that could benefit from HDL cholesterol or triglyceride therapy has not been reported.

Using observational data from a large health maintenance organization, 5,158 patients were identified who initiated dyslipidemia pharmacotherapy from July 2004 to June 2006, continued therapy for 1 year, and had full lipid panels within 6 months before and 9 to 15 months after therapy initiation. Therapy (primarily statins) reduced the proportion of patients not at LDL cholesterol goals from 77% to 22% and the proportion with high triglyceride levels from 34% to 20%. HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged (49% and 50% were less than normal levels before and after therapy, respectively) in the aggregate and in high-risk subgroups (patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and 10-year heart disease risk > 20%). After therapy, 29% of high-risk patients still had multiple lipid abnormalities.

In conclusion, dyslipidemia therapy substantially improved LDL cholesterol goal attainment in this cohort, but low HDL cholesterol levels were unaffected. About half the patients starting statins could be candidates for additional therapy targeting non-LDL cholesterol lipid fractions.

### Contemporary national patterns of eligibility and use of novel lipid-lowering therapies in the United States [^116nuuZD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In this nationally representative US study, fewer than half of individuals who had guideline indications for lipid lowering with statins were receiving these agents, with particular underuse among Black adults and younger adults aged 40 to 64 years. Furthermore, based on the lipid profiles of US adults and their existing therapies, 9.7 million, or 6.5% of those over 40 years of age, would merit consideration for PCSK9i. In addition, 11.6 million, or 7.8% of those in this age group, would benefit from reduced risk of cardiovascular adverse events with the initiation of IPE. However, a substantial proportion of individuals who may be candidates for PCSK9i and IPE are on suboptimal therapy with statins and/or ezetimibe. If optimally managed on these agents, 6.1 and 10.2 million US adults over 40 years of age are expected to be candidates for PCSK9i and IPE, respectively.

Our findings underscore the degree to which standard lipid-lowering therapies are underused but also highlight the potential population that would benefit from PCSK9i and IPE in the United States. Prior studies have demonstrated the suboptimal use of standard lipid-lowering therapies, including statins and ezetimibe, in individuals with ASCVD. Moreover, a recent study using the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) clinical registry demonstrated only modest lipid-lowering therapy intensification during a two-year period in patients with ASCVD, with particularly low rates of intensification in non-White individuals.

### Role of lipid and lipoprotein profiles in risk assessment and therapy [^115pKHZh]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remains the primary target for coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention according to the latest guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program, many individuals with CHD do not have substantially elevated LDL-C. Instead, they often exhibit derangements in other lipid fractions, most commonly low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In these guidelines, HDL-C plays a crucial role in risk stratification for primary prevention. It influences the need for and intensity of LDL-C treatment and, along with triglyceride levels, is defined as a risk factor for metabolic syndrome, serving as a secondary target of therapy. Triglyceride levels also determine which individuals should have non-HDL-C as a secondary target of therapy.

Risk assessment that considers the entire lipid profile is more effective at identifying high-risk individuals than evaluating LDL-C alone. Some epidemiological data suggest that measuring apolipoproteins, specifically apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 and apo A-I, instead of the cholesterol content in LDL or HDL, may enhance CHD risk assessment. Furthermore, in various observational and interventional studies, ratios of lipids and/or apolipoproteins have been found to be better predictors of CHD risk than any single lipid fraction.

Trials of lipid-modifying therapy suggest that targeting apolipoproteins and their ratios may offer improved therapeutic targets beyond LDL-C, though optimal values have yet to be established. Since lipid-modifying therapy affects multiple components of the lipid profile, the impact on all lipid parameters should be considered when selecting therapy.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: A clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

In adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels greater than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

- **Practice**: Most guidelines emphasize LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high-risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms, and potential treatment burdens.

- **Recommendations**: The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision-making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high risk.

### Application of new cholesterol guidelines to a population-based sample [^115F1cN3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The 2013 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) for the treatment of cholesterol expand the indications for statin therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods**: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2005 to 2010, we estimated the number and summarized the risk-factor profile of persons for whom statin therapy would be recommended (i.e. eligible persons) under the new ACC-AHA guidelines, as compared with the guidelines of the Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program. We extrapolated the results to a population of 115.4 million U.S. adults between the ages of 40 and 75 years.

- **Results**: As compared with the ATP-III guidelines, the new guidelines would increase the number of U.S. adults receiving or eligible for statin therapy from 43.2 million (37.5%) to 56.0 million (48.6%). Most of this increase in numbers (10.4 million of 12.8 million) would occur among adults without cardiovascular disease. Among adults between the ages of 60 and 75 years without cardiovascular disease who are not receiving statin therapy, the percentage who would be eligible for such therapy would increase from 30.4% to 87.4% among men and from 21.2% to 53.6% among women. This effect would be driven largely by an increased number of adults who would be classified solely on the basis of their 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. Those who would be newly eligible for statin therapy include more men than women and persons with a higher blood.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^115nv12S]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia/lipid management focuses on several key areas.

- **Screening**: In most adult patients, a fasting lipid profile should be measured at least annually. For adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl and triglycerides < 150 mg/dl), lipid assessments may be repeated every 2 years (E).

- **Treatment recommendations and goals**:
	- Lifestyle modification emphasizing the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake is crucial. An increase in n-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber, and plant stanols/sterols, along with weight loss (if indicated) and increased physical activity, should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes (A).
	- Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy for diabetic patients with overt CVD (A) and for those without CVD who are over the age of 40 years with one or more other CVD risk factors (A).
	- For lower risk patients without overt CVD and under the age of 40 years, statin therapy should be considered in addition to lifestyle therapy if LDL cholesterol remains above 100 mg/dl or in those with multiple CVD risk factors (E).
	- In individuals without overt CVD, the primary goal is an LDL cholesterol level of < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) (A).
	- In individuals with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), using a high dose of a statin, is an option (B).
	- If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of approximately 30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal (A).

Overall triglyceride levels should be maintained at < 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l).

### Advicor [^115CTEtr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). High credibility.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk-factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol, along with other non-pharmacologic measures, has been inadequate (see also Table 8 and the NCEP treatment guidelines1).

Advicor, which is a combination of niacin extended-release and lovastatin, is indicated for use when treatment with both Niaspan and lovastatin is appropriate. As described in their respective labeling, the components of Advicor are both indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Patients receiving treatment with Advicor should be on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet and should continue on this diet during treatment.

Niaspan (niacin extended-release) is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglyceride (TG) levels. It also aims to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (both heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia when the response to an appropriate diet has been inadequate.

In the context of secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia.

Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high levels of triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia).

The emergence of novel lipid-targeted therapies, such as PCSK9i (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors) and icosapent ethyl (IPE), has expanded therapeutic options to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The 2018 lipid management guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have recommended the use of adjunctive nonstatin agents such as PCSK9i for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with established or high-risk ASCVD. These recommendations, in addition to the updated statement recommending IPE use by the National Lipid Association, are based on evidence from large clinical trials that demonstrated improvement of cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients receiving PCSK9i and IPE as adjunct therapies to statins.

Despite approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and recommendation by clinical practice guidelines, the proportion of the US population that has compelling indications for these novel agents has largely remained unknown. This is a particularly important knowledge gap given the early evidence of limited uptake of PCSK9i in clinical practice and the emergence of IPE as an additional risk-lowering therapy in patients with elevated triglyceride levels. In the absence of high-quality data on the real-world use of these medications, an unbiased assessment of the eligibility and use of PCSK9i and IPE is necessary to inform strategies for.

### Opportunity for intervention to achieve American Heart Association guidelines for optimal lipid levels in high-risk women in a managed care setting [^113GwZCt]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) recently established evidence-based recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in women, including lipid management. This study evaluated optimal lipid-level attainment and treatment patterns based on these guidelines in high-risk women in a managed care setting.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a historical prospective cohort analysis of a 1.1-million-member integrated managed-care database. Eligible high-risk women were those with evidence of previous CVD or risk equivalent who had a full lipid panel available between October 1, 1999, and September 30, 2000; were naive to lipid therapy; and had a minimum of 12 months of health plan eligibility pre-index and post-index lipid panel. Optimal lipid levels were defined as LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) of 50 mg/dL, non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL, and 15% with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL.

- **Conclusions**: Among high-risk women, few attained the AHA's standards for all lipid fractions, and only one third received recommended drug therapy, highlighting significant opportunities to apply evidence-based guidelines.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: What are their effects on the lipid profile [^113cjnqf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

The effects of polypharmacy on the routine lipid profile reveal that many non-lipid-specific medications widely used in clinical practice have been associated with changes in the lipid profile. These changes were originally summarized in a table.

- **Abbreviations**: ACE refers to angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB to angiotensin receptor blocker; DMPA to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate; DPP-4 to dipeptidyl peptidase-4; GLP-1 to glucagon-like peptide-1; HDL-C to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HRT to hormone replacement therapy; LDL-C to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; NSAID to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PUFA to polyunsaturated fatty acid; QR to quick release; SGLT2 to sodium glucose co-transporter 2; SU to sulfonylurea; TG to triglyceride; and TZD to thiazolidinedione.

Variable effects can depend on the type of medication used. Symbols indicate the following: ↑ denotes a statistically significant increase; ↔ denotes no significant change; ↓ denotes a statistically significant decrease; and – denotes data not available.

To clarify, no studies have clearly demonstrated that raising the cholesterol content of HDL-C particles or lowering TG levels translates to a reduction in ASCVD risk. Moreover, clinical trials investigating the effects of lowering LDL-C levels have shown that to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in ASCVD risk, a threshold between-group difference in LDL-C levels, usually exceeding 25 mg/dL [0.65 mmol/L], is required in the typical 3- to 5-year studies. Therefore, it should be remembered that, despite significant clinical effects of some medications on the lipid profile, little is known about the clinical relevance.

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines [^1158JvLe]. Circulation (2004). High credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, five major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C.

- **Major recommendations for modifications to the ATP III treatment algorithm**: In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL; however, when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, i.e. a reasonable clinical strategy based on available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to…

### A review of the current status of the management of mixed dyslipidemia associated with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [^1119bsBi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with a statin as the primary lipid-modifying intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. However, even with high-dose statin therapy or the combination of statin plus ezetimibe, many patients remain at substantial risk of a cardiovascular event. Increasingly, there is recognition of the importance of treating all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemic profile associated with both conditions, specifically low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels, in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol. Both niacin (nicotinic acid) and fibrates are recommended as options for combination with a statin in this setting. Data from ongoing prospective outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these combinations.

### Lowering LDL cholesterol in adults: a prospective, community-based practice initiative [^113Sj2zd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of our study was to determine if a clinic-wide initiative with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) lowering interventions could be an effective health maintenance strategy. Patients with LDL levels above 100 mg/dL were provided with a lipid-lowering action plan and re-evaluated with a follow-up LDL (LDL(2)) in 3–4 months. An additional action plan was given to patients whose LDL(2) values remained elevated, and their values were retested in 3–4 months for a third LDL (LDL(3)). The primary endpoints were LDL(1) levels compared to post-intervention LDL measurements (LDL(2) or LDL(3)), with secondary endpoints of total cholesterol, total triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels over the 3 measurement periods.

Of the 514 patients who were given action plans, 443 returned for their follow-up lipid assessment. LDL levels in this group decreased from 140.7 ± 29.2 mg/dL (LDL(1)) to 110.9 ± 29.6 mg/dL (LDL(2)) (P < 0.05). Of these 443 patients, 167 individuals had LDL(2) levels that met National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (< 100 mg/dL), and 87 were now considered controlled by their primary care provider (LDL 100–130 mg/dL). However, 158 individuals had LDL(2) levels that were either not controlled or not meeting National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, specifically concerning the monitoring for adverse effects of statins, the 2019 guidelines by AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend obtaining creatine kinase (CK) levels in patients treated with statins who exhibit severe statin-associated muscle symptoms and objective muscle weakness. Additionally, it is advised to measure liver transaminases, total bilirubin (TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: Key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^116hypxj]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological therapies**:

	- **General comments**: For patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the European guideline recommends the addition of nonstatin agents to high-intensity maximal statin in a sequential approach (first ezetimibe, then PCSK9 inhibitors; both are class I recommendations) if the LDL-C is above the target of > 55 mg/L at each step. In contrast, the American guideline recommends the addition of ezetimibe (class I) to high-intensity statin if the addition of PCSK9 inhibitors is considered. This is not deemed mandatory, but instead considered reasonable if the LDL-C is above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (class IIa).

	- **American perspectives**: In secondary prevention of patients at very high risk, the use of ezetimibe is recommended if the LDL levels remain ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin (class IIa). However, the addition of ezetimibe is recommended to maximally tolerated statin therapy as the first step in lowering LDL-C (class I) if a combination with PCSK9 inhibitor as a third agent is being considered. The strategy of ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended because generic ezetimibe is available, simple to administer (oral, once daily), and has proven safety and tolerability with long-term data. Adherence to changes in lifestyle and effects of LDL-C-lowering medication should be assessed 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter for adherence and safety. If tolerated maximal LDL-C lowering therapy, the LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non-HDL-C is ≥ 100 mg/dL, the addition of other interventions may be considered.

### Impact of HCV cure with drug-acting antivirals in the use of concomitant medication and lipid profile: Follow-up data 2 years after the sustained virological response [^1176kPMP]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) frequently experience associated comorbidities and require concomitant medication. A sustained virological response (SVR12) is linked to increased cholesterol serum levels and peripheral vascular resistance. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of SVR12 on the use of concomitant medication and serum lipid profile.

- **Methods**: This prospective study included patients treated with direct-acting antivirals who achieved SVR12. Clinical data and concomitant drugs were analyzed at baseline and at least 1 year after SVR12. Differences from baseline to follow-up in concomitant medication were evaluated using the Stuart-Maxwell test and lipid profile by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Patients were categorized based on the increase or decrease in the number of drugs in each class according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.

- **Results**: Two hundred twenty-six patients with SVR12 were included, with 73.5% receiving concomitant drugs (49.6% with antihypertensive effect, 30.5% on antacids, 16.4% on anti-diabetic drugs, and 7.1% on lipid-lowering agents). One year after SVR12, total cholesterol serum levels increased from 161 to 179 mg/dl (P < 0.001), and following a median of 25.7 months, the use of lipid-lowering drugs increased from 7.8 to 11.5% (P = 0.009). Additionally, there was a trend towards increased use of antihypertensive drugs in older patients (P = 0.06), particularly those with cirrhosis. Anxiolytic use decreased from 13.7 to 10.6% after SVR12 (P = 0.035).

CHC cure is associated with a significant increase in cholesterol levels and changes in medication use patterns.

### A comparative analysis of current lipid treatment guidelines: Nothing stands still [^113p5GKP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review similarities and differences of five lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion.

However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^117JUPp4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cholesterol-containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, and lipid-lowering medications can reduce this risk. Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first-line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol, aimed at reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults, has markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL-C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in four groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL-C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus (DM) and LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10-year risk of ≥ 7.5%. The new pooled cohort risk estimator places significant emphasis on age; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well-controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

- **Intensity of statin therapy**: It is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit. A high-intensity statin lowers LDL-C by ≥ 50%.

### Comparative effects of lipid-lowering therapies [^117V12kk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic regulation of lipid metabolism in patients with dyslipidemia is unequivocally associated with significant reductions in the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of therapeutic drug classes have been developed to more precisely and intensively modulate lipid metabolism. Statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, and niacin exert their effects via different mechanisms and afford physicians the opportunity to beneficially impact multiple pathways in patients. When used alone or in combination, these drugs decrease the risk of the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease. There are strong clinical trial data to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies in the settings of both primary and secondary prevention.

- **Mechanisms of action**: This article discusses the mechanisms of action of antilipidemic medications.
- **Dosing regimens**: It reviews dosing regimens and the pharmacokinetic differences among drugs of the same class.
- **Risk for drug interactions**: It assesses risk for drug interactions.
- **Clinical trial evidence**: The article reviews the clinical trial evidence used to support the use of particular antilipidemic medications in specific physiologic settings.

The incidence of dyslipidemia is rising worldwide, which portends an ever-growing need for the aggressive and judicious use of different antilipidemic medications in patients at risk for all forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

### Update on lipid-lowering therapy and LDL-cholesterol targets [^112vdW7z]. Nature Clinical Practice. Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Serum cholesterol has long been recognized as an important risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. For more than 30 years, improved outcomes with lipid lowering have been demonstrated. As a result of these data, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) convened the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel I (NCEP ATP I). This panel and similar ones around the world have served to set the standards for lipid lowering in clinical practice.

Subsequent revisions of these standards (NCEP ATP II and III) have led to a greater focus being placed on LDL, with targets for lowering LDL levels based on patients' risk of subsequent coronary disease events. Since the publication of the NCEP ATP III guidelines, several large-scale clinical trials of cholesterol lowering have been conducted, the findings of which have the potential to impact clinical practice standards.

In this article, we focus on guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy, review the results and implications of important completed clinical trials, and consider the utility of additional targets for preventive therapy, such as C-reactive protein and HDL. We also consider the prospects for treatments in development and future goals.
