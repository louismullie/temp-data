## Question

cam impingement therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cam impingement therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and definitions to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for nonoperative versus surgical care. Next, I will examine predictors of response to conservative therapy and when surgery is favored. After that, I should review surgical outcomes, risks, and technical nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, staged recommendation and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, ensuring I continuously check claims against the best available evidence and correct myself if I overstate anything.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misframe the problem. Cam impingement refers to cam morphology, a bony prominence at the femoral head–neck junction that can cause premature contact and hip pain during motion; however, morphology alone is not disease, and the clinical syndrome (FAIS) requires symptoms, positive exam findings, and imaging evidence of impingement mechanics, so I need to ensure I'm discussing FAIS rather than silent cam morphology [^e4fe5eeb] [^4bdb6c5d].

> Next, I should review the hierarchy of evidence before drawing conclusions. High-quality randomized trials and contemporary systematic reviews show that both personalized hip therapy and arthroscopic surgery improve pain and function in FAIS, with surgery yielding a modest but clinically meaningful advantage over conservative care at 12 months; importantly, conservative therapy remains first-line and effective for many patients, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize surgical superiority across all scenarios [^d19aeebd] [^626129f8] [^cdb53c3c].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability of benefit. In the UK FASHIoN RCT, the adjusted mean difference in iHOT-33 at 12 months favored arthroscopy by 6.8 points, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 6.1 points; however, both groups improved substantially, and longer-term maintenance of benefit and cost-effectiveness remain under study, so I should not jump to conclusions about long-term superiority without data [^d19aeebd] [^9034f804].

> I will now examine nonoperative therapy components and expected response. Personalized hip therapy in FASHIoN was individualized, supervised, and progressive, emphasizing education, activity modification to avoid impingement positions, and targeted strengthening of core and hip musculature; APTA guidance supports multimodal, exercise-based care addressing mobility, flexibility, and strength deficits, with typical programs lasting 3–6 months, and about half of patients improve meaningfully in the short term, though severe cam morphology predicts poorer response [^9acee7b8] [^b3674227] [^d20db5cb].

> Hold on, I should verify predictors of nonoperative failure so I don't overpromise conservative care. Severe cam morphology, large alpha angles, and limited femoral anteversion are associated with reduced likelihood of improvement with therapy alone; in particular, alpha angle greater than 65° and femoral anteversion less than 16° predict insufficient ROM gains with pelvic-tilt strategies, suggesting that such patients may be better served by earlier surgical consultation rather than prolonged conservative care [^d20db5cb] [^9eca3fd4].

> Let me consider surgical indications and outcomes carefully. Surgery is reasonable after a structured, high-quality conservative program fails to provide durable relief, or when severe cam morphology and functional limitation coexist; arthroscopic osteochondroplasty with labral treatment improves pain and function and reduces reoperation risk compared with lavage alone in sham-controlled contexts, and mid-term athlete cohorts show sustained improvements with high return-to-sport rates, though patient selection and technique quality strongly influence outcomes [^f396f470] [^5b946bce] [^bbad7a57].

> I should double-check technical pitfalls because residual cam is a major cause of failure. Residual impingement after incomplete cam resection is the most common reason for revision, and expert consensus emphasizes dynamic intraoperative assessment and standardized radiographic evaluation to confirm adequate correction; complete cam resection and restoration of head–neck offset correlate with better outcomes, whereas underresection risks persistent symptoms and overresection risks iatrogenic instability [^6fea71c2] [^d79ca683] [^cb090251].

> But wait, what about prophylactic surgery for asymptomatic cam morphology? I need to ensure I don't conflate morphology with disease. Current evidence does not support prophylactic arthroscopy for asymptomatic cam lesions, given the high prevalence of silent cam morphology and the risks of overtreatment; counseling should normalize cam morphology as a common, often benign adaptation while vigilantly monitoring for symptom evolution [^af726a55] [^e4fe5eeb].

> Next, I should review imaging and diagnostic strategy to avoid misclassification. Plain radiographs remain first-line to screen for cam/pincer and osteoarthritis, with Dunn lateral and 90° Dunn views better for cam detection; MRI or MR arthrography characterizes chondrolabral injury and guides management, and 3D imaging or CT can assist surgical planning in complex cases; however, I should confirm that imaging findings align with symptoms before labeling FAIS [^7c1a043b] [^105c3e6f] [^4d411868].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged approach and sanity-check it against the evidence. First-line management should be clinician-led progressive exercise rehabilitation for at least 3–6 months, with education, load modification, and avoidance of impingement positions; if symptoms persist or severe cam morphology is present, discuss arthroscopic options, emphasizing that surgery offers a modest incremental benefit over high-quality conservative care and carries procedural risks; throughout, shared decision-making should incorporate patient goals, sport demands, and psychosocial factors [^b3674227] [^d19aeebd] [^4b48fd94].

> I should confirm key uncertainties so expectations remain realistic. We still need better prognostic tools to predict who will fail conservative care, standardized definitions of "best practice" physiotherapy, and longer-term comparative data on durability and osteoarthritis prevention; ongoing and future trials should prioritize subgroup analyses, imaging biomarkers, and patient-centered outcomes to refine selection and timing of interventions [^3d4e88bb] [^c33d306d] [^d087d6c0].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is balanced: cam morphology is common and often benign, FAIS is a clinical syndrome requiring symptoms and corroborative findings, conservative therapy is first-line and effective for many, and arthroscopic surgery provides a modest but meaningful advantage for selected patients after appropriate nonoperative care; careful patient selection, technique, and rehabilitation are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize revision risk [^e4fe5eeb] [^d19aeebd] [^f396f470].

Cam impingement therapy should start with **conservative care** [^f426ddba] (activity modification, NSAIDs, and a structured physical therapy program focused on hip and core strengthening, flexibility, and movement retraining) for at least 3–6 months [^bad1720e]. Most patients improve with this approach [^c29965a1], but those with severe cam morphology (alpha angle > 65°) [^ea28612b], limited femoral anteversion (< 16°) [^9eca3fd4], or persistent symptoms despite quality rehab are less likely to respond and may benefit from **arthroscopic surgery** [^d20db5cb]. Surgery (cam resection, labral repair/debridement) yields superior short-term outcomes to conservative care [^d19aeebd] [^626129f8] and reduces reoperation risk [^f396f470], but it carries risks such as infection, heterotopic ossification, and revision; thus, it is reserved for refractory cases or high-demand athletes [^ffdfd4f7]. Long-term, both strategies improve pain and function, but surgery may better restore joint mechanics and delay osteoarthritis in selected patients [^6e92ea1d].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **first-line approach** for cam impingement, emphasizing activity modification, pain control, and targeted physical therapy [^f426ddba].

---

### Activity modification and patient education

Activity modification focuses on **avoiding high-impact activities** and repetitive hip flexion/internal rotation (e.g. deep squats, lunges, prolonged sitting) to reduce impingement and symptom flare-ups [^6b7e4f9e]. Patient education explains the condition, sets expectations, and emphasizes adherence to therapy and load management [^7bca8c52].

---

### Pharmacologic management

NSAIDs are used for **short-term pain relief and inflammation control**, though evidence is limited and risks (GI bleeding) must be considered [^f426ddba].

---

### Physical therapy

Physical therapy is the cornerstone of conservative care, with programs typically lasting 3–6 months and emphasizing:

- **Hip muscle strengthening**: Focus on gluteus medius/maximus, iliopsoas, and deep hip rotators to improve joint stability and mechanics [^b3674227].

- **Core stabilization**: Emphasize abdominal and paraspinal muscles to enhance pelvic control and reduce impingement [^b3674227].

- **Flexibility and ROM**: Stretching and joint mobilization to restore hip mobility and reduce impingement [^a6f4c6cc].

- **Movement retraining**: Neuromuscular training to correct faulty movement patterns and reduce impingement risk [^f33fbf46].

---

### Outcomes and limitations

Approximately 50–70% of patients improve meaningfully with conservative care [^d20db5cb], but those with severe cam morphology (alpha angle > 65°) [^ea28612b], limited femoral anteversion (< 16°) [^9eca3fd4], or persistent symptoms despite quality rehab are less likely to respond and may require surgery [^d20db5cb].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **refractory cases** or patients with significant functional limitations despite optimized conservative care [^bbad7a57].

---

### Indications for surgery

- **Persistent symptoms**: Ongoing pain and functional impairment after ≥ 3–6 months of quality conservative care [^cdb53c3c].

- **Severe cam morphology**: Alpha angle > 65° or large cam volume, especially with limited femoral anteversion (< 16°) [^ea28612b] [^9eca3fd4].

- **High-demand athletes**: Individuals requiring rapid return to sport or with high functional demands [^ffdfd4f7].

---

### Surgical techniques

Arthroscopic surgery is the **standard approach**, including:

- **Cam resection (femoroplasty)**: Restoration of femoral head-neck offset to eliminate impingement [^6b7e4f9e].

- **Labral treatment**: Repair or debridement of labral tears to restore joint stability and function [^f396f470].

- **Cartilage procedures**: Debridement or microfracture for chondral lesions [^6b7e4f9e].

---

### Outcomes and complications

Surgery yields **superior short-term outcomes** to conservative care [^d19aeebd], with mean iHOT-33 improvements of 6–10 points at 12 months [^d19aeebd] and lower reoperation rates versus lavage alone [^f396f470]. Complications include infection, heterotopic ossification, neurovascular injury, and revision surgery (5–10%) [^bd5982a0].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

| **Outcome measure** | **Conservative management** | **Surgical management** |
|-|-|-|
| Short-term pain relief | Moderate (50–70% improve) | High (80–90% improve) |
| Functional improvement | Moderate | High |
| Return to sport | Variable; lower in severe cam | High; faster in athletes |
| Complications | Minimal | 5–10% |
| Long-term outcomes | Limited data | Improved joint mechanics; may delay OA |

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence

Long-term, both strategies improve pain and function, but surgery may better restore joint mechanics and delay osteoarthritis in selected patients [^6e92ea1d]. Recurrence is **uncommon** after adequate cam correction, though residual impingement or progressive osteoarthritis can occur [^6e92ea1d].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Age and activity level**: Younger, active patients may benefit more from surgery; older, sedentary patients may do well with conservative care [^c620ae5f].

- **Severity of cam morphology**: Larger alpha angles predict poorer response to conservative care and favor surgery [^d20db5cb].

- **Comorbidities**: Osteoarthritis or dysplasia may limit surgical success and shift toward conservative care [^c620ae5f].

---

## Current research and controversies

Controversies include the **lack of long-term head-to-head trials**, the role of prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic patients [^af726a55], and the need for standardized conservative protocols [^d087d6c0]. Emerging research focuses on patient selection, imaging biomarkers, and rehabilitation optimization [^3d4e88bb].

---

Cam impingement therapy should begin with **conservative care**, reserving surgery for refractory cases or high-demand patients. Both approaches improve symptoms, but surgery offers greater short-term gains and may better restore joint mechanics in selected patients.

Discussion

An international Delphi panel of expert clinicians, athletes, patients and their representatives, and researchers — representing the YAHiR Collaborative — agreed on set of research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip focusing on primary cam morphology and its natural history, reported here following REPRISE guidelines. They outlined seven research domains: (1) best practice physiotherapy, (2) rehabilitation progression and RTS, (3) exercise intervention and load management, (4) primary cam morphology aetiology and prognosis, (5) FAI syndrome aetiology and prognosis, (6) diagnostic criteria, and (7) screening. This consensus serves as a roadmap for researchers, policy-makers and funders to prioritise research dedicated to reducing the cost and burden of conditions affecting the young person's hip, including hip disease related to primary cam morphology.

In what follows, we discuss the Delphi panel's opinions on a prioritised research agenda and summarise how agreement and areas of tension and dissent might inform future work — a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on primary cam morphology and its natural history. This consensus builds on recent consensus statementsand a primary cam morphology concept analysisand consensus (Oxford consensus study, part 1).

Best practice physiotherapy is central to the treatment of hip-related pain in active adults, crucial to the understanding of effective treatment options for FAI syndrome, yet elusive and contested. The panel recommended research to (1) clarify what best practice physiotherapy is, (2) illuminate how it influences FAI syndrome prognosis and (3) reinvestigate its position as an effective treatment option compared with hip arthroscopy in patients with hip-related pain. First, practitioners and patients are confused by an elusive definition for best practice physiotherapy. A recent consensus on physiotherapist-led treatment for young to middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain recommended treatments that are exercise-based of at least 3 months duration and recommended further research to investigate optimal frequency, intensity, time, type, volume and progression of exercise therapy. Second, heterogeneous physiotherapist-led interventions might improve pain and function when compared with other non-surgical treatments or sham treatments in young and middle-aged adults with hip-related pain (including FAI syndrome); however, no high-quality trials exist to cement its superiority. Finally, the only three RCTs comparing hip arthroscopy with prescribed physiotherapywere compromised by out-of-date exercise therapy programmes. New trials should do better.

Discussing the feasibility of load management studies during growth, discussion groups stressed the importance of involving 'methodology experts' (eg, study design and training-load monitoring) and the target group in the development of any research. Load management studies on primary cam morphology development during growth may not be the right priority for new research. Patient buy-in is likely to be low — 'elite sports children may be unwilling to reduce participation in their preferred sport' and more attention needs to be given to context: 'optimal study designs may not be generalisable to suboptimal context'.

Warning 'not to focus on cam morphology as a problem', stakeholder groups mentioned seven critical elements of effective physiotherapy/rehabilitation (best practice physiotherapy) for patients with FAI syndrome: clinicians should (1) apply a 'holistic approach to rehabilitation' that uses the 'same language'; (2) deal with 'patient expectations, especially time: lifelong'; (3) address 'fear of movement'; (4) modify 'what the patient do'; (5) consider 'who the advocate for the athlete/patient should be'; (6) deliver 'treatment programmes' of 'at least 6 months in duration', and (7) develop treatment programmes with 'exercise interventions' as the 'foundation, with potential room for manual therapy'. Finally, the field 'needs individual participant data studies with subgroup analysis to inform this [best practice physiotherapy], as much of the therapy approaches that "work" has been mixed methods so likely needs to be teased out as to which factors offer the greatest benefit'.

Regarding preventative measures for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, WA-FAI 2016 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding which individuals with cam or pincer morphologies will develop FAIS syndrome. Recognize that preventive measures may have a role in high-risk populations, but it is rarely indicated to offer surgery to these individuals.

### Personalised hip therapy: development of a non-operative protocol to treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome in the FASHIoN randomised controlled trial [^9acee7b8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome is a motion-related clinical hip disorder with a triad of symptoms, clinical signs and imaging findings. It represents a symptomatic premature contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. Typically, the morphology of the hip exhibits shapes that predispose to impingement, often described with the terms cam and pincer morphology. The epidemiology of cam and pincer morphology is not well defined but may be present in 30% of the general population. Not all patients with cam and/or pincer morphology develop FAI syndrome, but the treatment of those who do is controversial. Over the past 10 years, increasing numbers of patients have been treated for FAI syndrome with shape changing surgery, most frequently through hip arthroscopy. Surgery has been shown to provide improvements in patient symptoms, although patient expectations are not always met.

It has been suggested that clinicians should be cautious in the use of surgery for FAI syndrome and that non-operative approaches should be considered. Patients with FAI syndrome have altered hip muscle strength, range of motion (ROM) and gait biomechanics, and these offer potential targets for treatment through physiotherapy. While many authors recognise the likely value of non-operative or conservative care, there is very little published guidance and evidence on how this care should be delivered.

Given the uncertainty and lack of evidence about treatment for FAI syndrome, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing hip arthroscopy and conservative care was proposed to guide future practice. In 2012, the UK National Institute of Health Research (UK NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (HTA) commissioned us to perform a feasibility and pilot study for an RCT to compare hip arthroscopy with 'best conservative care' for patients with FAI syndrome (FASHIoN HTA10/41/02). At the time, there was no established 'best conservative care', and we are not aware of any that has been published since. To design this trial, we needed to develop a suitable conservative care protocol.

The aim of this study was to develop an agreed conservative treatment protocol for patients with FAI syndrome that was deliverable within the UK National Health Service (NHS), was safe, and that could be used in the planned RCT.

Introduction

Primary cam morphology is highly prevalent in many athlete populations, causing debilitating hip osteoarthritis in some. Existing research is mired in confusion partly because stakeholders have not agreed on key primary cam morphology elements or a prioritised research agenda. We aimed to inform a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on primary cam morphology and its natural history by working towards agreement on a set of research priorities for conditions affecting the young person's hip.

Methods

An international expert panel — the Young Athlete's Hip Research (YAHiR) Collaborative — rated research priority statements through an online two-round Delphi exercise and met online to explore areas of tension and dissent. Panellists ranked the prioritised research statements according to the Essential National Health Research (ENHR) ranking strategy. Reporting of results followed REPRISE (REporting guideline for PRIority SEtting of health).

Results

A diverse Delphi panel (n = 65, Delphi rounds 1 and 2; three ENHR strategy surveys: n = 49; n = 44; n = 42) from 18 countries representing six stakeholder groups, prioritised and ranked 18 of 38 research priority statements. The prioritised statements outlined seven research domains: (1) best practice physiotherapy, (2) rehabilitation progression and return to sport, (3) exercise intervention and load management, (4) primary cam morphology prognosis and aetiology, (5) femoroacetabular impingement syndrome prognosis and aetiology, (6) diagnostic criteria, and (7) screening. The panel recommended areas of tension and dissent for the research community to focus on immediately.

Conclusion

While informing more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based research, this consensus is a roadmap for researchers, policy-makers and funders to implement research dedicated to reducing the cost and burden of hip disease related to primary cam morphology.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^3d4e88bb]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Delphi panel prioritised research on best practice physiotherapy, including (1) what it is (statement 68); (2) prognosis after best practice physiotherapy and/or arthroscopic hip surgery in patients with FAI syndrome (statement 67) (however, current methods to capture outcomes are 'controversial'), and (3) trials comparing best practice physiotherapy with arthroscopic hip surgery and sham surgery in patients with FAI syndrome (statement 66). Acknowledging the fact that 'we already have three trials', the panel commented on the 'need to establish what best practice physiotherapy is' before comparing it with other interventions. What best practice physiotherapy is, is also important for athlete-patients: 'my experience of physiotherapy as an elite athlete was very mixed — some good, some poor'.

An ex-elite athlete panel member contextualised the importance of studying 'best criteria for rehabilitation progression and Return to Sport (RTS) following management of hip-related pain', (statement 69): 'worries about RTS caused major anxiety for me' as 'sport was my living'.

The panel recognised the size and cost of RCTs to investigate how exercise intervention influences the development and prognosis of primary cam morphology (statements 57 and 58) and FAI syndrome in cohorts with variable loading demands (statement 65). To address these challenges, they emphasised 'pooling of resources/skills', and 'to start with one sport/cohort and do this well before extending outwards'. In addition, it is 'very hard to get people to change behaviour regarding sports activities'. Although prioritised, there are at least four challenges to plan and do 'cohort studies to investigate how exercise intervention influences the development and prognosis of primary cam morphology in cohorts with variable loading demands' (statement 57). First, to date, exercise interventions 'are ill-defined'. Second, cohort studies might not be the best study design 'to study the effects of interventions'. Third, 'variable-loading demands' may be 'difficult to determine' in some sports. Finally, it is necessary to 'consider load outside of the structured sporting environment'.

### Hip arthroscopy versus best conservative care for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (UK FASHIoN): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^d19aeebd]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is an important cause of hip pain in young adults. It can be treated by arthroscopic hip surgery, including reshaping the hip, or with physiotherapist-led conservative care. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of hip arthroscopy with best conservative care.

Methods

UK FASHIoN is a pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, done at 23 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. We enrolled patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome who presented at these hospitals. Eligible patients were at least 16 years old, had hip pain with radiographic features of cam or pincer morphology but no osteoarthritis, and were believed to be likely to benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients with bilateral femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were eligible; only the most symptomatic hip was randomly assigned to treatment and followed-up. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy (an individualised, supervised, and progressive physiotherapist-led programme of conservative care). Randomisation was stratified by impingement type and recruiting centre and was done by research staff at each hospital, using a central telephone randomisation service. Patients and treating clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but researchers who collected the outcome assessments and analysed the results were masked. The primary outcome was hip-related quality of life, as measured by the patient-reported International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) 12 months after randomisation, and analysed in all eligible participants who were allocated to treatment (the intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN64081839, and is closed to recruitment.

Findings

Between July 20, 2012, and July 15, 2016, we identified 648 eligible patients and recruited 348 participants: 171 participants were allocated to receive hip arthroscopy and 177 to receive personalised hip therapy. Three further patients were excluded from the trial after randomisation because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Follow-up at the primary outcome assessment was 92% (319 of 348 participants). At 12 months after randomisation, mean iHOT-33 scores had improved from 39·2 (SD 20·9) to 58·8 (27·2) for participants in the hip arthroscopy group, and from 35·6 (18·2) to 49·7 (25·5) in the personalised hip therapy group. In the primary analysis, the mean difference in iHOT-33 scores, adjusted for impingement type, sex, baseline iHOT-33 score, and centre, was 6·8 (95% CI 1·7–12·0) in favour of hip arthroscopy (p = 0·0093). This estimate of treatment effect exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (6·1 points). There were 147 patient-reported adverse events (in 100 [72%] of 138 patients) in the hip arthroscopy group) versus 102 events (in 88 [60%] of 146 patients) in the personalised hip therapy group, with muscle soreness being the most common of these (58 [42%] vs 69 [47%]). There were seven serious adverse events reported by participating hospitals. Five (83%) of six serious adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were related to treatment, and the one in the personalised hip therapy group was not. There were no treatment-related deaths, but one patient in the hip arthroscopy group developed a hip joint infection after surgery.

Interpretation

Hip arthroscopy and personalised hip therapy both improved hip-related quality of life for patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Hip arthroscopy led to a greater improvement than did personalised hip therapy, and this difference was clinically significant. Further follow-up will reveal whether the clinical benefits of hip arthroscopy are maintained and whether it is cost effective in the long term.

We drew our primary inferences from the intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of compliance, without imputation for missing data. We also did several additional analyses. We did a per-protocol analysis, comparing participants who actually received surgery and those who actually received personalised hip therapy. Additionally, we compared participants randomly allocated to hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy, who received an allocated treatment that was deemed to be of high fidelity. We did prespecified subgroup analyses for different impingement types (cam, pincer, and mixed) and for patients younger and older than 40 years. We added pairwise interaction terms between treatment group and both impingement type and age group to the mixed-effects model to test for important subgroup effects. In addition to the primary adjusted analysis, we also reported unadjusted differences between groups, and we assessed significance using t tests for normally distributed outcomes. We present treatment effect estimates from the adjusted mixed-effects model (primary analysis) with 95% CIs. All hypothesis testing was at the 5% level, with no adjustments for multiple testing. Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis of secondary outcomes followed the same modelling approach as for the primary outcome. All analyses were on a complete-case basis and where follow-up data were missing, the reasons for missing data were obtained and patterns were investigated to judge the plausibility of missingness assumptions. We did a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation techniques (imputation using chained equations) to assess the effect of missing data on the primary outcome. Finally, we did a post-hoc sensitivity analysis of the effect of variation in recovery time in the hip arthroscopy group. We compared post-intervention adverse events between groups using Fisher's exact test. We did all analyses using Stata (version 14).

### Femoroacetabular impingement in young athletes [^ffdfd4f7]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement is a structural mismatch between the femoral head and acetabulum that can lead to labral tear, cartilage damage, and early-onset osteoarthritis. The etiology is likely multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental risk factors, particularly engagement in high-impact lower extremity activities beginning at a young age. Diagnosis requires a triad of painful symptoms, positive clinical signs, and corroborative radiographic parameters. First-line treatment is typically conservative management with dedicated physical therapy focusing on core and hip strengthening. If conservative management is unsuccessful in providing durable symptomatic improvement, then surgery with conventional hip arthroscopy consisting of CAM/pincer resection, labral repair, and cartilage procedures as indicated can result in excellent patient reported outcomes and high rates of return to sport.

In the primary analysis, the mean difference in iHOT-33 scores, adjusted for impingement type, sex, baseline iHOT-33 score, and centre, was 6·8 (95% CI 1·7–12·0) in favour of hip arthroscopy (p = 0·0093). This estimate of treatment effect exceeded the minimum clinically important difference (6·1 points). There were 147 patient-reported adverse events (in 100 [72%] of 138 patients) in the hip arthroscopy group) versus 102 events (in 88 [60%] of 146 patients) in the personalised hip therapy group, with muscle soreness being the most common of these (58 [42%] vs 69 [47%]). There were seven serious adverse events reported by participating hospitals. Five (83%) of six serious adverse events in the hip arthroscopy group were related to treatment, and the one in the personalised hip therapy group was not. There were no treatment-related deaths, but one patient in the hip arthroscopy group developed a hip joint infection after surgery.

Interpretation

Hip arthroscopy and personalised hip therapy both improved hip-related quality of life for patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Hip arthroscopy led to a greater improvement than did personalised hip therapy, and this difference was clinically significant. Further follow-up will reveal whether the clinical benefits of hip arthroscopy are maintained and whether it is cost effective in the long term.

### Editorial commentary: hip arthroscopy benefits patients with Tönnis grade 0 or 1 hip arthritis and is not recommended for grade 3: optimal treatment of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome for grade 2 arthritis may Be determined by age and body mass index [^c620ae5f]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a possible cause of early osteoarthritis, and restoration of normal anatomy can potentially prevent future major cartilage damage. Symptomatic cam lesions can lead to debonding of articular cartilage, resulting in superolateral cartilage lesions in 93% of patients. Patients with pincer lesions often exhibit cartilage lesions in the anterior and superolateral glenoid rim. Whereas the efficacy of prophylactic surgery remains uncertain, surgical intervention appears to yield superior short-term clinical outcomes compared with conservative treatment. Yet, there is a relatively high prevalence of asymptomatic individuals in the general population with either cam (25%) or pincer (67%) deformities, so prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic patients cannot be recommended. Symptomatic FAIS patients with Tönnis grades 0 and 1 (minimal hip arthritis) benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients with higher grades of osteoarthritis may be unsuitable hip arthroscopy candidates and face a higher risk of conversion to hip replacement. The existing evidence regarding the treatment of patients with FAIS and Tönnis grade 2 or higher remains inconclusive. Generally, surgery tends to have favorable outcomes for younger patients with a normal body mass index, whereas nonsurgical alternatives should be explored in cases with severe joint space narrowing, Tönnis grade 3, and bilateral cartilage lesions.

### Editorial commentary: timely treatment of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome both treats ongoing hip symptoms and mitigates future cartilage damage and osteoarthritis [^1f64ce25]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) present with ongoing symptoms in a painful hip. Insightful patients or family members often express concern about similar pathology, and associated risk of arthritis, in their less or asymptomatic hip, and recent research shows that patients with increased alpha angles are associated with more advanced cartilage damage, particularly in males. The ultimate question, for surgeons and patients, is: Can we predict chondral pathology based on preoperative variables alone, and should we intervene prior to symptoms? Yet, FAIS is multifactorial, not simply anatomic, and cam-type FAI can have a high prevalence in asymptomatic hips in some populations. Thus, today, prophylactic hip preservation surgery cannot be generally recommended, but in the future, an individualized treatment algorithm may result in precise prediction of which patients might benefit from earliest intervention to help reduce the incidence of premature hip osteoarthritis. In the interim, when timely intervention is in the best interest of the patient, insurance denials that delay indicated surgery must not be tolerated. One of the most rewarding and unique aspects of managing FAIS is that we have the opportunity to both treat ongoing hip symptoms and mitigate future pathology, sometimes even in the contralateral hip.

### Hip arthroscopy versus best conservative care for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (UK FASHIoN): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^9d05c40a]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The fact that not all surgery or personalised hip therapy was deemed to be of a high fidelity is also a reflection of the real-world setting in which this trial was done. Some surgery was not satisfactory, and some participants allocated to personalised hip therapy did not engage with it or complete it: our fidelity assessment showed high-fidelity treatment in 87% of patients receiving hip arthroscopy and 70% of patients receiving personalised hip therapy. However, these proportions are comparable with other studies and reflect the pragmatism of our trial. We took great effort to minimise crossover in our trial, using techniques developed in our feasibility study. No participants allocated to receive hip arthroscopy received personalised hip therapy; 14 participants allocated to personalised hip therapy subsequently changed their mind and decided to have surgery within 12 months. We do not believe that these crossovers can account for the results of this trial; indeed, we would expect such crossovers to dilute and so reduce our estimate of the real underlying effect of hip arthroscopy.

Personalised hip therapy is believed to work by improving muscle control, strength around the hip, and movement patterns, leading to the avoidance of hip impingement. Surgery is thought to work by reshaping the bone to prevent impingement and by treating painful injuries to articular cartilage and labrum. In our trial, the observed effect of hip arthroscopy over conservative care might be attributable to the surgical procedure, the placebo effect of surgery (given the unblinded nature of this trial), post-surgical rehabilitation, or a combination of these factors. The results of our subgroup analysis of patients with only cam morphology are suggestive of an increased treatment effect of hip arthroscopy compared with other shapes. This finding would support the idea that the removal of a cam shape has a specific therapeutic effect. The low number of patients with pincer or mixed cam and pincer morphology in this study means we are less certain about the influence of reshaping the acetabular rim. Ultimately, we do not fully understand the mechanism of benefit from hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy. Future research should focus on investigating these mechanisms further, and which patients would benefit most from hip arthroscopy or personalised hip therapy.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^4b48fd94]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder groups commented on six additional factors that may influence RTS: (1) 'Athlete expectations: what has the athlete been told about their condition and their potential prognosis by a healthcare practitioner. Does the athlete expect or feel that X intervention is the "only way" to allow them to RTS? Are we honest with athletes about the potential that they may not return to their previous playing levels due to the current status of their injury/pain/hip? (2) Quality of intervention: we still do not have a "best practice" method/guide for hip interventions in cam morphology and FAI syndrome. The treatment that an athlete receives, surgical or non-surgical, may have a large influence on them returning to sport; (3) Stage of career: as indicated in an earlier comment — considering the stage of the athlete's career may influence RTS. Older athlete towards the end of their career may not "want to return to sport" to preserve long-term health and quality of life; (4) Sport type: individual versus team. Knowledge of an individual's sport may have a large influence on their RTS. Often team sport athletes may be able to gradually RTS or have their load managed. In individual sports this may not be possible and there may be more pressure to RTS when they are not necessarily ready; (5) Contract status: in professional athletes, an athlete's contract status or endorsements may influence their RTS timeframe; (6) Support structures: the support structures and expertise available may influence an athlete's RTS'.

British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This infographic illustrates the natural history of primary cam morphology (PCM) to inform the Oxford Consensus Study's seven prioritised research domains on conditions affecting the young person's hip. We share 16 key messages for athletes, patients, clinicians and researchers:

Among other possible risk factors (including genetics), playing a high-load sport like football (soccer) or ice hockey while growing (during adolescence) is the key risk factor for developing PCM.
Many young athletes have asymptomatic PCM. However, at present, no one knows how many; clinicians and researchers have 'measured' PCM in different ways (often using alpha angles on imaging).
PCM seems more common in males. Research on PCM in females is sparse; no studies have yet investigated how PCM develops in female athletes.
Clinicians and researchers cannot predict who will develop PCM. Therefore, coaches cannot, with confidence, manipulate training to reduce a young athlete's risk of developing PCM.
Most athletes who have PCM thrive; they compete with 'happy hips' and never develop symptoms.
Some athletes with PCM develop symptoms like hip-related pain. This is called 'femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome'. few athletes with FAI syndrome might develop hip osteoarthritis (OA) in the future.
Clinicians and researchers cannot yet predict the 'at risk' athletes with PCM who might develop hip disease such as FAI syndrome or hip OA. However, size matters; large alpha angles are associated with a greater risk of developing hip OA.
The word 'syndrome' has a negative connotation to many patients. Most athletes with FAI syndrome do well when treated with a combination of education and progressive exercise rehabilitation.
Clinicians, researchers and patient partners should prioritise research to determine what 'best practice physiotherapy' is by comparing different treatment options.
Other clinicians besides physiotherapists can lead exercise rehabilitation. When referring to non-surgical treatment for hip-related pain, the term 'clinician-led progressive exercise rehabilitation' is better than 'physiotherapy'.
Some patients with FAI syndrome might need surgery — it is a small proportion but clinicians and researchers cannot yet predict who.
Surgery can be hip arthroscopy to remove the bony prominence and/or repair damaged tissue like the hip's cartilage. On occasion older athletes with advanced hip OA might need their hips replaced (hip arthroplasty).
Return to sport (RTS) after treatment for hip-related pain is important, especially to career athletes. However, clinician-scientists cannot yet, with confidence, advise on the best time to RTS. Following hip surgery, some athletes return to compete at their previous sporting levels; others have compromised performance.
Should clinicians and/or researchers screen young athletes for PCM? Probably not, but we do not know for sure. Some asymptomatic athletes with PCM might benefit from early intervention like adapting training load or targeted muscle strength training.
In addition to the cost and possible X-ray exposure, screening can also cause psychological harm. This happens when athletes are labelled with, and might worry about, a 'condition' (PCM) that will never bother them.
Some athletes (and their parents) worry that knowledge about PCM might negatively influence coaching decisions and their sporting careers.

Once adequate consensus on the conservative care protocol was reached, the protocol was implemented within a multicentre internal pilot RCT comparing arthroscopic surgery versus conservative care (FASHIoN feasibility study ISRCTN09754699). Since the pilot RCT was designed to be internal to a full RCT, there was no interim analysis of outcomes; the outcomes will be reported as part of the full RCT.

All physiotherapists delivering the conservative care protocol were asked to complete a case report form (CRF) for each patient treated, which included details about the number, nature and duration of the patient contacts, the exercises prescribed and other treatments provided. Given that this was an internal pilot trial, all patients recruited were followed up for 1 year. Any adverse events (AEs) were collated from CRFs, hospital records and follow-up questionnaires. AEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the RCT.

Phase 2: consensus development conference

After treating patients in the internal pilot RCT, physiotherapists delivering the protocol were invited to a consensus development conference chaired by NF to share their experiences of delivering the protocol and make suggestions for further amendments prior to the full RCT.

### Arthroscopic hip surgery compared with physiotherapy and activity modification for the treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^626129f8]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a hip condition where adverse morphology predisposes to premature joint degeneration. This adverse morphology is classified as cam, pincer, or mixed. Cam morphology describes a loss of sphericity of the femoral head, pincer morphology describes an acetabulum with excessive coverage of the femoral head, and mixed morphology describes a combination of the two deformities (fig 1). These hip shapes can cause the femoral neck to impact against the acetabular rim during a functional range of movement, with resultant damage to the labrum (which is attached to the rim), delamination of the adjacent acetabular cartilage, and, over time, secondary osteoarthritis.

Fig 1
Anteroposterior radiographs showing (A) normal morphology, (B) cam morphology, and (C) pincer morphology. Dashes represent abnormal morphology that predisposes to femoroacetabular impingement, and which is excised with a burr during arthroscopic surgery to prevent impingement

The prevalence of FAI morphology is high and is observed in about one fifth of the general population. Less than 25% of those affected develop pain(FAI syndrome) or osteoarthritis, although up to 50% of all hip osteoarthritis might develop secondary to FAI. Identifying those at greatest risk of developing joint disease secondary to FAI remains a challenge.

Physiotherapy and activity modification represents the principal treatment for symptomatic FAI; however, arthroscopic surgery is increasingly adopted to reshape the hip and deal with the damage to the labrum and cartilage (fig 2). The primary treatment goal is to improve pain and function, but interventions that modify contact between the femoral neck and acetabular rim may subsequently reduce cartilage and joint damage, the risk of osteoarthritis, and need for future hip arthroplasty.

### Editorial commentary: physical therapy alone may not successfully treat patients with hip pain and large α angles or decreased femoral anteversion combined with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome [^0fa59953]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the relation between spinopelvic (lumbopelvic) tilt and femoracetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is complex, and determining the optimal patient parameters that lead to successful nonoperative management is vital. Physical therapy (PT) focusing on core and posterior chain strengthening is often successful. PT can change the posterior tilt of the pelvis by 5° to 10°, allowing increased range of motion (ROM) and decreased impingement of the hip. However, PT does not change cam anatomy. Thus, PT alone may not sufficiently increase ROM in patients with cam-type impingement and large α angles or limited femoral anteversion. Pelvic compensation may lead to successful nonoperative management of FAIS, but not in all patients. Large-cam, high-flexion athletes with chronic hip pain should try PT. Yet, while some patients with large cam lesions may improve without surgery if femoral version and/or pelvic tilt ROM can be increased, surgery should not be excessively delayed in patients with poor prognostic factors for nonoperative management.

### Editorial commentary: femoroplasty may not Be necessary in all patients with hip femoroacetabular impingement, but cam lesions should not Be ignored in patients with significant femoral head-neck offset [^ac5ff8eb]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Our knowledge of appropriate arthroscopic management of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) continues to evolve. However, few studies exist evaluating mid- to long-term surgical outcomes to guide optimal treatment. The recent focus has been on the importance of cam femoroplasty in addition to labral treatment; however, studies have shown that correction of the alpha angle to normal does not correlate with patient outcomes. Furthermore, in cases of mixed impingement, an optimal degree of acetabuloplasty as measured by the lateral center-edge angle has not been determined. Few studies have evaluated isolated pincer decompression with omission of cam treatment. In select patients with small or negligible cam lesions who do not have acetabular dysplasia, a small, isolated acetabular rim resection of 1 to 3 mm may provide adequate FAI decompression as well as reduce surgical time and complications. Nonetheless, individualized FAI treatment is necessary that includes a comprehensive 180° femoroplasty in patients with sizable cam lesions to prevent future labral and chondral damage. An intraoperative dynamic examination is important to determine sufficient resolution of FAI. Predictive modeling may play an increasingly important role to ensure appropriate bony resection and to optimize long-term patient outcomes.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^5f77e726]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Building a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based research ecosystem is essential, but it is also a deliberate, disruptive and daunting task. A diverse Delphi panel of 65 stakeholders representing six stakeholder groups agreed on the first ranked set of research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip, focusing on primary cam morphology and its natural history. Although the 18 research priorities identified signal possible gaps in the current evidence base, researchers, PPI partners and clinicians should spotlight these gaps through an evidence-based approach to future research. While informing more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based research, this consensus is a roadmap for researchers, policy-makers and funders to implement research dedicated to reducing the cost and burden of conditions affecting the young person's hip, including hip disease related to primary cam morphology.

Research priorities are based on this diverse international Delphi panel's opinion. Despite progress on diversity, equity and inclusion, including actively involving a PPI stakeholder group (also as coauthors), we acknowledge that more could be done. Another panel, more representative of communities that are not widely represented in the hip-and-groin research field (our Delphi panel only involved three participants from Africa, all from the same country), might have different opinions. Although all panel members completed the two Delphi rounds, panel attrition resulted in an ENHR ranking exercise panel dominated by physical therapists. This might have skewed ranking results towards research questions important to this stakeholder group.

Finally, many research statements included a method clause and referred to 'physiotherapy' as treatment. Panellists might have scored research topic/question-specific statements without referring to method (eg, RCT, cohort study) differently. We acknowledge our implicit bias that only physiotherapists could deliver 'physiotherapy' or 'personalised hip therapy'. This is not the experience for everyone. 'Clinician-led progressive exercise rehabilitation' might have been a better phrase than 'best practice physiotherapy'. Equally, 'physiotherapist-led treatment' might have been a better phrase to reflect contemporary physiotherapy practice. This is an important topic for further scrutiny with clinicians, researchers and patient partners.

Evidence-based research uses 'prior research in a systematic and transparent way to inform a new study so that it is answering questions that matter in a valid, efficient and accessible manner', minimising clinical health research that is unnecessary, irrelevant, unscientific, wasteful and unethical. However, Anjum et al (2020) appealed to the Evidence Based Medicine community to expand their notion of 'evidence'. First, as 'evidence is typically evidence of causation', evidence-based researchers 'need to tackle the problem of causation head on' to better understand 'what is meant by "evidence", what is the "best available evidence" and how to apply it in the context of medicine'. Second, researchers should appreciate that multiple methods are needed to establish causation — not only the statistical approaches of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews of trials. Third, researchers should use different types of evidence (eg, case studies and case reports) to inform 'causal evidence'. Last, researchers should use patient narratives and phenomenological approaches as tools to look beyond evidence such as symptoms and outcomes. Researchers should also specify their causal intent, when relevant, and use language consistent with that intent when reporting their studies. Consensus on a prioritised research agenda on conditions affecting the young person's hip, underpinned by an evidence-based approach to research, applying a more inclusive lens to the notion of 'evidence' (and knowledge coproduction), is a strong foundation for higher research value and less research waste. However, an important step is effective dissemination and implementation of the prioritised research agenda.

The YAHiR Collaborative values transparent and reproducible research, central to the aim of this study to inform a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on primary cam morphology and its natural history. We invite scrutiny and critique, foster equal opportunities and share study data as open access published manuscripts and supplementary files (Oxford consensus studies, parts 1 and 2) or documents associated with an Open Science Framework–registered study project. We invite readers to engage with the material, participate in the dissemination and collaborate to cocreate knowledge that matters. Open science aims to make scientific knowledge (in different languages) openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone. Our approach reinforces quality and integrity, collective benefit, equity and fairness, diversity and inclusiveness — the core values of open science.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 1-definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes [^965700ba]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Executive summary for clinicians and researchers

Primary cam morphology (PCM) is a mostly benign bony prominence that develops at the femoral head-neck junction of the hip and is highly prevalent in many athlete populations. In some athletes for whom it is not benign, the resulting symptoms and eventual hip osteoarthritis can be debilitating. The Oxford Consensus Study (part 1) equips clinicians and researchers in sport and exercise medicine, musculoskeletal rehabilitation and sports science fields to practice more precise communication, pursue better clinical decisions, and produce higher value research about PCM and its natural history. This study's focus on the definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome measures of PCM opens the door for clearer conversations about the morphology and its natural history with athletes, parents, coaches and patients; conversations that normalise what is happening with the athlete's hip — '… a bony bump in your hip that is a common and normal response to training — the vast majority of athletes never have problems. However, some athletes living with this morphology could develop symptoms (femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome), and potentially hip osteoarthritis in the long term'.
Applying this consensus, clinicians and researchers should prioritise conversations with athletes and patients that:

The Oxford Consensus Study mobilised an international and multidisciplinary community of clinicians, researchers, patient and public partners, research methodologists, journal editors and funders. This learning community — the Young Athlete's Hip Research (YAHiR) Collaborative — will continue to collaborate to:

Coproduce knowledge, prioritising minoritised populations and focusing on questions that matter to athletes and patients.
Develop open and easy-access resources for clinicians, researchers, athletes and patients.
Implement the Oxford consensus while addressing areas of tension and dissent through respectful scholarly discourse.
Measure its performance based on realistic and coagreed deliverables.

### Does removal of subchondral cortical bone provide sufficient resection depth for treatment of cam femoroacetabular impingement? [^6fea71c2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Residual impingement resulting from insufficient resection of bone during the index femoroplasty is the most-common reason for revision surgery in patients with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Development of surgical resection guidelines therefore could reduce the number of patients with persistent pain and reduced ROM after femoroplasty.

Questions/Purposes

We asked whether removal of subchondral cortical bone in the region of the lesion in patients with cam FAI could restore femoral anatomy to that of screened control subjects. To evaluate this, we analyzed shape models between: (1) native cam and screened control femurs to observe the location of the cam lesion and establish baseline shape differences between groups, and (2) cam femurs with simulated resections and screened control femurs to evaluate the sufficiency of subchondral cortical bone thickness to guide resection depth.

Methods

Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of the inner and outer cortical bone boundaries of the proximal femur were generated by segmenting CT images from 45 control subjects (29 males; 15 living subjects, 30 cadavers) with normal radiographic findings and 28 nonconsecutive patients (26 males) with a diagnosis of cam FAI based on radiographic measurements and clinical examinations. Correspondence particles were placed on each femur and statistical shape modeling (SSM) was used to create mean shapes for each cohort. The geometric difference between the mean shape of the patients with cam FAI and that of the screened controls was used to define a consistent region representing the cam lesion. Subchondral cortical bone in this region was removed from the 3-D reconstructions of each cam femur to create a simulated resection. SSM was repeated to determine if the resection produced femoral anatomy that better resembled that of control subjects. Correspondence particle locations were used to generate mean femur shapes and evaluate shape differences using principal component analysis.

Results

In the region of the cam lesion, the median distance between the mean native cam and control femurs was 1.8 mm (range, 1.0–2.7 mm). This difference was reduced to 0.2 mm (range, -0.2 to 0.9 mm) after resection, with some areas of overresection anteriorly and underresection superiorly. In the region of resection for each subject, the distance from each correspondence particle to the mean control shape was greater for the cam femurs than the screened control femurs (1.8 mm, [range, 1.1–2.9 mm] and 0.0 mm [range, -0.2–0.1 mm], respectively; p < 0.031). After resection, the distance was not different between the resected cam and control femurs (0.3 mm; range, -0.2–1.0; p > 0.473).

Conclusions

Removal of subchondral cortical bone in the region of resection reduced the deviation between the mean resected cam and control femurs to within a millimeter, which resulted in no difference in shape between patients with cam FAI and control subjects. Collectively, our results support the use of the subchondral cortical-cancellous bone margin as a visual intraoperative guide to limit resection depth in the correction of cam FAI.

Clinical Relevance

Use of the subchondral cortical-cancellous bone boundary may provide a method to guide the depth of resection during arthroscopic surgery, which can be observed intraoperatively without advanced tooling, or imaging.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^89541074]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The panel prioritised studies to determine best criteria for rehabilitation progression and RTS following management of hip-related pain. Such a study recently investigated RTS after criteria-based rehabilitation for acute adductor injuries.RTS is complex, sport-specific, multifactorial (depending, eg, on the intervention) and an exercise in risk management. The Delphi panel emphasised six considerations for rehabilitation and RTS studies, including (1) athlete expectations, (2) intervention quality, (3) career stage, (4) type of sport, (5) athlete contract status, and (6) athlete support structures.

The panel prioritised studies to investigate the role of exercise intervention (load management) on the development and prognosis of (1) FAI syndrome and (2) primary cam morphology. This should involve different demographic and load cohorts and include studies to develop and validate diagnostic and prognostic models for primary cam morphology in young athletes. While these studies should involve different sport, dance and physical activity cohorts, the panel highlighted the importance of prioritising prospective research in girls'/women's sport. To date, few prospective cohort studies investigated how [primary] cam morphology develops in athletes. However, none involved girls/women athletes, and only one involved a control group. Finally, load intervention studies involving maturing athletes are easier said than done; they 'may be unwilling to reduce participation in their preferred sport'.

Diagnostic criteria for cam and pincer morphology are contested. The results of a recent systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam or pincer morphology in individuals with suspected FAI syndrome were inconclusive due to high risk of bias and low statistical precision of included studies. There is to date no agreement on a radiographic definition of cam or pincer morphology. This Delphi panel agreed that an alpha angle threshold of ≥ 60 degrees to classify cam morphology (Oxford consensus study, part 1), recently proposed in a systematic reviewand another consensus, is appropriate; however, further research should verify this.

Screening for primary cam morphology is contentious. The panel acknowledged the risk of harm — overdiagnosis and overtreatment — of 'a normal finding', prevalent in many athletes. Screening might benefit 'a small percentage of those with primary cam morphology who go on to develop significant hip problems later in life', offering them 'preventative support at an earlier stage'. The WHO's Wilson-Junger criteria should inform whether screening is appropriate or not.

In the prespecified subgroup analyses, the between-group difference for iHOT-33 was 5·0 (95% CI −1·2 to 11·3) in participants younger than 40 years and 10·9 (1·7 to 20·1) in those older than 40 years (p interaction = 0·3023) in favour of hip arthroscopy; the difference was 8·3 (95% CI 2·5 to 14·2) in patients with cam morphology, 1·1 (–11·5 to 13·7) in those with mixed cam and pincer morphology, and 4·0 (–14·6 to 22·7) in those with pincer morphology (p interaction = 0·5672), in favour of hip arthroscopy.

Among patients who received their allocated intervention, there were 147 patient-reported adverse events (in 100 [73%] of 138 patients) in the hip arthroscopy group versus 102 (in 88 [60%]) of 146 patients in the personalised hip therapy group. The most frequently reported adverse event was muscle soreness, reported by 58 (42%) patients in the hip arthroscopy group and 69 (47%) patients in the personalised hip therapy group (table 3). At 12 months, seven serious adverse events had been reported by participating hospitals. Six of these were among the participants in the hip arthroscopy group: one patient was not discharged from the day surgery unit and required an overnight admission, one patient had scrotal haematoma requiring readmission, two patients had superficial wound infections that required oral antibiotics, one patient had a hip joint infection that required further surgery and ultimately a total hip replacement, and one patient had a fall that was unrelated to hip arthroscopy. One participant in the personalised hip therapy group developed biliary sepsis that was unrelated to treatment. There were no treatment-related deaths.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^46193a91]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the Delphi panel did not prioritise qualitative or mixed-methods studies to 'explore perspectives/preferences/attitudes/concerns/experiences of primary cam morphology and FAI syndrome stakeholders' (statements 61 and 74), mixed stakeholder groups highlighted the importance of 'understanding a patient's journey'. They emphasised the importance of involving stakeholders in coproduction — especially athletes, parents and coaches. Stakeholder discussions underscored the fertile ground for coproducing qualitative research, especially with minoritised populations, to address pertinent questions. Taking an evidence-based research approach, these studies should build on the results of systematic reviews and qualitative evidence synthesis relevant to the specific question.

How agreement on a prioritised research agenda advances research on primary cam morphology and its natural history?

Strong consensus on primary cam morphology's conceptual and operational definitions, taxonomy and terminology reported and discussed in a linked paper (Oxford consensus study, part 1) empowers researchers and their patient and public partners to do more rigorous research — research that is more credible, consistent, replicable, valid, and of higher quality. Combining rigorous research with consensus on a prioritised research agenda catalyses focused, high-quality research that is systematic in its inquiry, employs appropriate design and asks challenging questions that matters. This consensus informs future research priorities, illuminating challenging questions that are relevant to the minoritised, including athletes and athlete-patients. It also invites authentic collaboration, setting the scene for a more inclusive approach to research.

### Subacromial decompression versus diagnostic arthroscopy for shoulder impingement: a 5-year follow-up of a randomised, placebo surgery controlled clinical trial [^957a030a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

The results of this randomised, placebo surgery controlled trial show that ASD provided no clinically relevant medium to long-term benefit over diagnostic arthroscopy in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. The findings contest the current practice of performing subacromial decompression in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome and lend further support to existing guidelines that make a strong recommendation against surgery as a treatment for patients with subacromial pain. As the current evidence indicates that the impingement theory has become antiquated, we would also recommend to abandon the term shoulder impingement as it refers to this mechanical theory. The more generic term 'subacromial pain' should be preferred.

What are the findings?

Our FIMPACT trial is the only placebo surgery controlled trial to assess the long-term (5 years) outcome of arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) in patients with symptoms consistent with shoulder impingement syndrome.
ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy (placebo surgery) (as well as exercise therapy) resulted in significant improvements in pain and functional outcomes with no difference in the incidence of adverse events.
Patients assigned to ASD had no superior improvement over those assigned to diagnostic arthroscopy (or exercise therapy) at the 5 years follow-up.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

The findings contest the current practice of performing subacromial decompression in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome and lend further support to existing guidelines that make a strong recommendation against this surgery as a treatment for patients with subacromial pain.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^4d411868]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

24 It can be caused by a cam deformity, which is bony overgrowth of the femoral head and neck, a pincer deformity of the acetabulum, or both. Femoroacetabular impingement often has a gradual onset without a specific injury. Radiography is used to help diagnose femoroacetabular impingement, although the preferred radiographic views may vary. Standing anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis may be most helpful for diagnosing of the pincer deformity, 26 whereas Meyer lateral and 90-degree Dunn views may be best to visualize the cam deformity.
27. Labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement are often comorbid conditions in young active patients. Athletes are more likely to require surgical intervention for these conditions, especially those with both conditions.
9. Standing anteroposterior radiography of the pelvis is the radiologic test of choice and will show joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation.

However, presence of these findings does not always correlate with symptom severity. 7, 13, 29 Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injection of the hip joint may help differentiate an intra-articular cause of pain from other causes, and corticosteroid injection may be therapeutic for intra-articular pain.
30. If a patient with greater trochanteric pain syndrome does not improve with anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy, a gluteus medius tendon tear should be considered. MRI and musculoskeletal ultrasonography performed by an experienced sonographer are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosing a gluteus medius tendon tear. 15, 16, 21 Referral to an orthopedic hip specialist is often indicated for large partial or complete tears because surgery is typically associated with good outcomes in patients with this condition. 15, 16.

ISCHIOFEMORAL IMPINGEMENT Ischiofemoral impingement is impingement of the quadratus femoris muscle and nerve between the proximal femur at the level of the lesser trochanter and the ischial tuberosity. 19 Patients with ischiofemoral impingement have gradual onset of deep buttock pain that is worsened with activities requiring a long stride, such as running. The long-stride walking test is the most sensitive and specific test for this condition. 18, 19.

### Arthroscopic hip surgery compared with physiotherapy and activity modification for the treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^92da0d61]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

We used a multilevel mixed effects model to analyse secondary patient reported outcome measures, with repeated measures of the relevant patient reported outcome measures (collected at five and eight months) nested within participants. The models used data from participants with available baseline information and at least one follow-up assessment, adjusted for baseline patient reported outcome measure, sex, age, study site, and time from randomisation.

Predefined subgroup exploration was performed for several participant groups: osteoarthritis severity (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0 v 1), sex, age (continuous variable), baseline HOS ADL (continuous variable), and FAI type (pincer, cam, or mixed). Treatment effects by binary subgroup were illustrated with forest plots, showing point estimates, confidence intervals, and heterogeneity P values (estimates obtained from interaction models including only the relevant subgroup and randomised treatment as covariates). We explored the differential treatment effect for age and baseline HOS ADL (as continuous variables) by adding an interaction term for treatment×age and treatment×baseline HOS ADL into the primary analysis model. Linear and non-linear effects (squared and cubic terms) for age and baseline HOS ADL were explored.

For each follow-up time point we summarised descriptively the details on clinical examination, including range of movement and signs of impingement. Differences in range of movement between the treatment groups were obtained from linear regression models adjusted for baseline values. Differences between treatment groups were explored using χ² tests for signs of impingement.

Patient and public involvement

A feasibility study included patient questionnaires to determine outcomes they thought were most important, treatment preferences, acceptable study design, and anticipated recruitment numbers. The study design was based on these findings. A patient representative provided guidance throughout the study, including an evaluation of the burden of intervention and assessments. Study results will be disseminated through publication, presentation at scientific meetings, and at patient and public engagement events coordinated by our institution. The results will also be disseminated using social media platforms.

### Editorial commentary: complete cam resection results in best outcomes after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement [^cb090251]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

An aspherical hip can mechanically damage the joint and lead to chondrolabral injury, functional pain, and potentially arthritis. Hip arthroscopy to address femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and make the hip spherical, with treatment of concomitant labral pathology, can result in excellent outcomes in patients with this pathology. The goal is complete cam resection. Cam pathology comes in many shapes, locations, and sizes-from smaller, anterolaterally located lesions to larger, pistol group lesions that extend more superiorly and lateral. Surgically addressing the lateral cam lesion is more technically demanding, and such patients have greater chondolabral damage. Regardless, when the cam lesion is fully resected, we can expect to achieve good outcomes.

### What are the results of surgical treatment of hip dysplasia with concomitant cam deformity? [^c4518326]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a reliable procedure to correct the deficient acetabular coverage in hips with developmental dysplasia. It is unclear how the presence of additional femoral cam-type deformity might influence the clinical and radiographic treatment results of PAO.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Are there differences in clinical scores (WOMAC, EQ-5D) and examination findings (impingement sign) or radiographic measures of acetabular orientation and head sphericity after PAO for isolated acetabular dysplasia when compared with the combined pathology of dysplasia and additional femoral cam deformity? (2) Are these clinical and radiographic findings after combined surgical therapy for additional cam deformity influenced by different pathology-adjusted surgical techniques?

Methods

From July 2005 to December 2010, 86 patients (106 hips) underwent PAO for hip dysplasia. Surgical and outcome data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed in a comparative observational study. Indications for surgery were a lateral center-edge angle less than 25° and hip pain for at least 6 months. The contraindications for surgery were advanced radiographic osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3), incongruency of joint space, and patient age > 50 years. Depending on preoperative hip ROM, impingement test, and presence of a radiographically visible cam deformity, treatment allocation was performed: Group I: isolated PAO in patients without symptomatic asphericity, Group IIa: PAO with subsequent osteochondroplasty through arthrotomy for patients with symptomatic cam deformity and no labrochondral pathology, and Group IIb: arthroscopically assisted osteochondroplasty and additional labrochondral repair with subsequent PAO when patients had labrochondral lesions in addition to a symptomatic cam deformity. Clinical outcome (impingement test, EQ-5D, WOMAC) as well as radiographic parameters (lateral center-edge angle, crossover sign, alpha angle, osteoarthritis grade) were obtained after a mean followup of 63 ± 18 months (range, 31–102 months) and compared with the baseline data. Eleven patients (13%) were lost to followup. With the numbers available, our study had 80% power to detect a difference between Groups I and II of 10 points on the WOMAC scores.

Results

There was no difference in the increase of WOMAC scores in patients with PAO alone (Group I; preoperative score 74 ± 17 versus postoperative 91 ± 15, p = 0.033) when compared with PAO and concurrent osteochondroplasty (Groups II A and B preoperative 73 ± 19 versus postoperative 90 ± 13 p < 0.001). The mean postoperative alpha angles in Group II (38° ± 6°) improved when compared with preoperative values (56° ± 15°; p < 0.001) and were even lower than native offset alpha angles in Group I (47° ± 11°). Clinical scores as well as postoperative radiographic parameters were not different between patients with conventional osteochondroplasty alone (Group IIA) and patients with arthroscopically assisted cam resection and intraarticular labrochondral repair (Group IIB).

Conclusions

With the numbers available, we detected no differences in outcome scores and radiographic results between patients who had been treated with PAO alone and patients who underwent combined PAO and offset correction for cam deformity. Although arthroscopically assisted treatment of advanced labrochondral lesions together with osteochondroplasty is possible during PAO and the results were not different in this small study when compared with patients with PAO and osteochondroplasty alone, the type and extent of damage that would indicate additional cartilage surgery over cam resection alone remain unclear.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, therapeutic study.

### Clinical and radiographic criteria define "Acceptable" surgical correction of hip femoroacetabular impingement syndrome as well as postoperative complications: an international modified Delphi study [^d79ca683]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To develop recommendations for clinical and radiographic criteria to help define the "acceptable" surgical correction of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) and identify/define complications postoperatively.

Methods

A 3-phase modified Delphi study was conducted involving a case-based survey; a Likert/multiple choice-based survey concerning radiographic and physical examination characteristics to help define FAIS correction, as well as the prevalence and definition of potential postoperative complications; and 2 consensus meetings.

Results

Of the 75 experts invited, 54 completed the Phase I survey, 50 completed the Phase II survey (72% and 67% response rate), and 50 participated in the Phase III consensus meetings. For both typical and atypical (complex) cases, there was consensus that fluoroscopy with multiple views and dynamic hip assessment should be used intraoperatively (96% and 100%, respectively). For typical FAIS cases, the Expert Panel agreed that Dunn lateral and anteroposterior radiographs were the most important radiographs to evaluate the hip postoperatively (88%, consensus). When asked about evaluating the correction of cam impingement postoperatively, 87% voted that they use subjective evaluation of the "sphericity" of the femoral head. In the case of focal and global pincer-type FAIS, there was consensus that the reduction or elimination of the crossover sign (84%) and lateral center-edge angle (91%) were important to inform the extent of the FAIS correction. There was consensus for recommending further investigation at 6 months postoperatively if hip pain had increased/plateaued (92% agreed); that additional investigation and treatment should occur between 6 and 12 months (90% agreed); and that a reoperation may be recommended at 12 months or later following this investigation period (89% agreed).

Conclusions

This consensus project identified the importance of using fluoroscopy and dynamic hip assessment intraoperatively; Dunn lateral and anteroposterior view radiographs postoperatively; evaluating the "sphericity" of the femoral head for cam-type correction and the use of dynamic hip assessment; reducing/eliminating the crossover sign for focal pincer-type FAIS; evaluating the lateral center-edge angle for global pincer-type FAIS; and avoiding overcorrection of pincer-type FAIS. In cases in which postoperative hip pain increased/plateaued, further investigation and treatment is warranted between 6 and 12 months, and a reoperation may be recommended at a minimum of 12 months depending on the cause of the hip pain.

Clinical Relevance

Hip arthroscopy surgeons have yet to reach a firm agreement on what constitutes an "acceptable" or "good" surgery radiographically and how they can achieve desired clinical outcomes. Although this was a comprehensive effort, more study is needed to determine therapeutic thresholds that can be universally applied.

### Arthroscopic hip surgery compared with physiotherapy and activity modification for the treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^5aa436bb]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The exclusion of patients with dysplasia and osteoarthritis is a potential limitation of the study given these patients might also benefit from arthroscopic hip surgery. Our inclusion criteria, however, reflect current evidence based clinical practice. We anticipate that advances in imaging will improve our ability to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from intervention and optimise treatment strategies through enhanced diagnosis of osteoarthritis and dynamic assessment of hip morphology. In this study, during surgery, three patients were found to have more advanced osteoarthritis than expected and six patients did not have impingement within a functional range of movement despite the preoperative diagnosis of cam morphology. Planned osteochondroplasty was therefore not performed. Total hip replacement could have been more appropriate in the patients with osteoarthritis.

Psychological factors are likely to influence outcomes from FAI treatment, as has been shown for joint arthroplasty. Patient expectation was not found to influence treatment effect in this study, but further exploration into the effect of baseline depression and anxiety on outcomes may be of value, given that cohort studies have shown that they influence outcome. The most common reason for declining participation was preference for surgery. Four patients randomised to the physiotherapy programme underwent surgery before collection of the primary outcome measure. Our results might in part reflect a nocebo effect of physiotherapy and placebo effect of surgery. The placebo effect has been shown to be large in surgical trials of arthroscopic shoulder decompressionand arthroscopic meniscectomy. Our blinded clinical assessments offer reassurance of a differential treatment effect between groups. An ongoing trial comparing osteochondroplasty with arthroscopic lavage for FAI syndrome might offer further insight into the efficacy of surgical treatment.

### Optimal treatment of cam morphology may change the natural history of femoroacetabular impingement [^6e92ea1d]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is debate in the literature whether cam morphology is associated with increased risk for hip osteoarthritis. The capability of femoroplasty to alter the natural history of cam morphology is still in question.

Purpose

To (1) investigate the correlation between cam morphology and damage to the articular cartilage and (2) assess whether correction of the cam morphology affects survivorship of the joint, progression to arthroplasty, and functional patient-reported outcome scores.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected for patients presenting for hip arthroscopy between February 2008 and April 2017. Cases were divided into 3 groups: control group with an alpha angle < 50° pre- and postoperatively, treated group with an alpha angle > 55° preoperatively and < 50° postoperatively, and a group with an alpha angle > 55° pre- and postoperatively. All patients had minimum 2-year postoperative follow-up for the modified Harris Hip Score, the Non-arthritic Hip Score, and visual analog scale for pain. Conversion to total hip arthroplasty was recorded.

Results

A 1:1:1 match successfully yielded 98 hips for each group. Follow-up time was 50.77 ± 24.60 months (mean ± SD). The pre- and postoperative mean alpha angles were 45.2° ± 3.4° and 40.6° ± 4.3° in the control group, respectively; 66.2° ± 8.4° and 42.3° ± 5.9° in the treated group; and 68.5° ± 9.4° and 61.4° ± 7.6° in the alpha > 55° group. Intraoperatively, the alpha > 55° and treated groups had greater acetabular cartilage damage than the control group (P = 0.0245 and P = 0.0036, acetabular labrum articular disruption, respectively; P = 0.0347 and P = 0.0211, acetabular Outerbridge). The alpha > 55° group achieved the patient acceptable symptomatic state for the modified Harris Hip Score (58.2%) significantly less than the treated (75.5%; P = 0.0100) and control (73.5%; P = 0.0239) groups. Progression to arthroplasty was significantly higher in the alpha > 55° group (n = 17) when compared with the control (n = 8) and treated (n = 10) groups (P = 0.0034 and P = 0.0338, respectively).

Conclusion

Cam deformity was associated with higher-grade damage of the acetabular articular cartilage. An alpha angle > 55° after surgery was associated with lower native hip joint survivability and less successful functional outcomes when compared with that of treated cam deformity as well as no deformity. These data suggest that correcting the cam deformity may positively affect the natural history of these patients.

### Exercise therapy for the management of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: preliminary results of clinical responsiveness [^d20db5cb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the responsiveness to exercise therapy of patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS), and to investigate differences in hip function, strength, and morphology between responders versus nonresponders.

Methods

Patients with FAIS underwent 12 weeks of semi-standardized and progressive exercise therapy. A good therapy outcome (responders) versus a poor therapy outcome (nonresponders) was determined at week 18 with the Global Treatment Outcome questionnaire for hip pain. Hip function was evaluated using the Hip Outcome Score (HOS) activities of daily living (ADL) and Sport at baseline, and at weeks 6, 12, and 18. Hip muscle strength and dynamic pelvic control were evaluated using dynamometry and video analysis, respectively, at baseline, week 12, and week 18. Hip morphology was evaluated with imaging at baseline.

Results

Thirty-one patients (mean age 24 years) were included. Sixteen patients (52%) were responsive and 15 patients (48%) were not responsive to exercise therapy. Only responders improved HOS ADL and HOS Sport by 10 points (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 7, 14; P < 0.001) and by 20 points (95% CI 15, 25; P < 0.001), respectively, and hip abductor strength by 0.27 Nm/kg (95% CI 0.18, 0.36; P < 0.001). The prevalence of patients showing good dynamic pelvic control only increased in responders (44%; P = 0.029). The prevalence of severe cam morphology was higher in nonresponders than in responders (40% versus 6%; P = 0.037).

Conclusion

Half of patients with FAIS benefit from exercise therapy in the short term. Responsiveness to hip abductor strength and dynamic pelvic control improvements is associated with a good therapy outcome, whereas the presence of severe cam morphology is associated with a poor therapy outcome.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 1-definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes [^6318391e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Taxonomy: Delphi domain 3

The Delphi panel reached consensus in rounds 1 and 2 on three of four statements in the taxonomy domain. There is consensus that we should distinguish between primary and secondary cam morphology in clinical practice and in research (statements 32 and 33), and in research participants with FAI syndrome (statement 35). However, there was marginal non-consensus on the importance of distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology in patients (clinical practice) with FAI syndrome (statement 34).

Qualitative analysis of individual panellist feedback identified six themes (online supplemental files 5 and 6). First, although not agreed as critical by the panel, distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology in patients with FAI syndrome (statement 34) is important as 'secondary CAM morphology has a poorer prognosis and therefore should be distinguished to improve treatment planning'. Second, the taxonomy is important for diagnosis. Third, the taxonomy is important for treatment. Fourth, the taxonomy is important for prognosis. Fifth, distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology is age dependent and perhaps 'less relevant if someone is 30 years old'. Last, panellists commented on the challenge 'where a patient has a mix of both' primary and secondary cam morphology.

Dissent analysis (online supplemental file 7). Outlier analysis: Although strong consensus was achieved for statements 32, 33 and 35, few outliers (mainly orthopaedic surgeons and a physical therapist) were not convinced. After removing two outliers for statement 34, the Delphi panel reached consensus on the importance of distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology in patients with FAI syndrome (figure 3 and online supplemental files 5 and 7). Bipolarity analysis: There was no bimodal distribution in the overall scoring of taxonomy statements. Stakeholder group analysis: The average scores for taxonomy statement 32 were significantly different for PPI group compared with the: (1) orthopaedic surgeon stakeholder group (round 2); (2) physical therapist stakeholder group (rounds 1 and 2); (3) radiologist stakeholder group (rounds 1 and 2) and (4) researcher stakeholder group (round 2). PPI stakeholder group compared with the physical therapist stakeholder group scored statement 34 significantly different (rounds 1 and 2).

How this consensus informs research on PCM and its natural history

Having standard PCM conceptual and operational definitions, taxonomy and terminology, empowers researchers, including patient and public partners, to do more rigorous research — research that is more credible, consistent, replicable, and valid, and of a higher quality. Although the panel reached strong consensus on key elements, this consensus study illuminates challenges relevant to the minoritised, including athletes and patients. It invites authentic collaboration on a level playing field, setting the scene for a more inclusive approach to clinical decision-making and research.

Inclusive PCM research should address issues that matter to patients and improve their lives, 'access and represent' the patient's views and experiences, and treat them with respect. To date, research on PCM and its natural history, continue to minoritise important patient-athlete populations — women, children and parents, para-athletes, and athletes from the Global South. Patient partners are to a large extent absent from the research process. While emphasising the importance of meaningful inclusion of patients, giving them an active voice in research, Frankena et al emphasised partnerships that value each other's skills. This consensus study served the inclusive agreement-seeking agenda well — not only did the pragmatic online approach limit travel, it also invited the minoritised and marginalised into the room. PPI colleagues voiced their opinions on improving conceptual and operational elements of the morphology's definition, using more patient-friendly terminology, and applying a taxonomy that reflects their needs. This inclusive partnership strengthens evidence-based research.

Evidence-based research uses 'prior research in a systematic and transparent way to inform a new study so that it is answering questions that matter in a valid, efficient and accessible manner', minimising clinical health research that is unnecessary, irrelevant, unscientific, wasteful and unethical. While this consensus on the key elements of PCM will help researchers to produce research that is more 'searchable' in a systematic and transparent way, it is also a catalyst for a fresh look at evidence — a strong foundation for higher research value and less research waste.

Box 3
Interacting Group Process: mixed stakeholder group discussion summary — taxonomy domain

The general agreement was that it is important (and not necessarily difficult) to distinguish between primary and secondary cam morphology in clinical practice and in research: 'Where we can, we should make the differential diagnosis as it affects the prognosis and therefore the management of the problem'. A librarian panellist emphasised the benefit of 'consistent terminology' when reviewing the literature: 'using primary versus secondary allowed searching the literature more clear'. Although most panellists felt that 'history is key' to distinguish between primary and secondary cam morphology, others felt that 'obtaining a detailed history and discussion with patient is more important than a label of primary and secondary'.
It can be clinically challenging when a combination of primary and secondary cam morphology exists in the same patient as 'there are some cases where primary cam morphology exists prior to a secondary injury (eg, SCFE), and these cases can be a little more difficult to diagnose but are less commonly observed'.

### Personalised hip therapy: development of a non-operative protocol to treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome in the FASHIoN randomised controlled trial [^80b259fc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

We aimed to develop and undertake initial testing of a physiotherapist-led non-operative treatment protocol for patients with FAI syndrome that could be compared with arthroscopic surgery in a large pragmatic RCT. We combined results from a systematic review, two rounds of Delphi consensus, relevant literature and the experiences of physiotherapists treating patients with FAI syndrome within the internal pilot RCT, in order to develop the agreed treatment protocol, referred to as Personalised Hip Therapy. This PHT protocol provides guidance to clinicians and researchers in an area where evidence is limited.

Exercise is an effective treatment for many types of musculoskeletal pain.PHT has many similarities to other non-operative treatment regimens including the EULAR and OARSI guidelines on hip and knee osteoarthritis. These also recommend a comprehensive assessment, education, lifestyle modification and exercise-based programme. However, these guidelines were unable to make specific exercise recommendations for hip OA due to a lack of evidence, although a mixed regime (quadriceps strengthening, aerobic capacity and flexibility training) was recommended in knee osteoarthritis by EULAR.

### The case for cam surveillance: the arthroscopic detection of cam femoroacetabular impingement missed on preoperative imaging and its significance [^e872bf53]. Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Classification of femoroacetabular impingement is typically determined by preoperative imaging. Despite measurements such as the alpha angle and anterior offset ratio, cam dysmorphisms may be missed. We present 2 cases of femoroacetabular impingement classified as pincer subtypes where significant cam lesions were not detected until surgery. Arthroscopic cam surveillance includes the intentional visualization of the anterior and lateral proximal head-neck junctional region from the peripheral compartment performed with capsular retraction and/or partial capsulectomy. Static and dynamic cam surveillance of the proximal femur is recommended before the termination of surgery for hip chondrolabral dysfunction and has even greater significance in the arthroscopic management of these patients.

### Femoroacetabular impingement [^413ecace]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) of the hip is a well-recognized entity that can cause hip pain and limit range of motion. Although there are 2 types of FAI (cam and pincer), these 2 entities most commonly coexist. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging are commonly used to assess FAI, and play an integral role in diagnosis in conjunction with patient symptoms and clinical examination. Treatment of FAI is also evolving, with arthroscopic management becoming increasingly more popular. This review provides an overview of the proposed etiology, mechanisms, clinical history, imaging, and treatment of FAI.

Discussing long-term prognosis studies, groups agreed MRI trumps radiography and 'should be the investigation of choice where at all possible in adolescent populations'. The quality of imaging is better, it better quantifies cartilaginous progression in adolescents where 'the use of alpha-angle on X-ray can be misleading and therefore inaccurate', and, as it does not pose a (cumulative) radiation risk 'ethics committees are more likely to accept MRI based studies'. However, there are at least three issues with MRI: cost, availability (equipment and expert radiologists), and the burden of procedure (time, claustrophobia, etc). MRI is challenging in young adolescents 'due to difficulty remaining still, that is, movement artefact'.
The group agreed that further work is needed to develop and refine consensus on the specific and standardised imaging protocol: 'If X-rays are used then it has to be reinforced on the views that are valuable and this message should be repeated in order to support this becoming routine practice; not all facilities are skilled with specific radiograph images for example, Dunn'.
It is further important to consider dissemination of findings: 'Do athletes want to know the results? How, what, and when do we communicate imaging results to participants or parents? Do we consider positive/negative response by athletes/parents, and provide them with the 'opt in' opportunity not to be informed of their individual imaging results?' Group members raised four important points from the athlete/parent's perspective. First, parents 'were not comfortable' with cumulative radiation exposure associated with serial radiographs. Radiation exposure is an 'ethical dilemma in this area' with 'a need to be up front and transparent with information so parents are aware'. Second, sharing of imaging results is a 'hugely important area' and research teams should carefully consider the possibility that 'parents may pick up the information or interpret it differently than healthcare practitioners'. Third, research teams should consider 'an "opt-in" option for participants and parents where, except if there is an issue with an imaging finding, they will not be informed of the results'. Last, research teams should carefully consider how they communicate periodic imaging results and suggested a 'common approach to dissemination of results/imaging is needed'.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 1-definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes [^d3e657bf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 73 experts invited to participate in this study, 65 completed rounds 1 and 2 of the Delphi exercise. The Delphi panel from 18 countries represented 6 stakeholder groups — 26 were female (table 3). The Delphi panel scored 85 statements (12 definition, 19 terminology, 4 taxonomy, 12 imaging outcome and 38 research statements), and reached consensus on 43 of 85 statements in round 1, and 53 of 85 statements in round 2 (table 4 and online supplemental file 5). Online supplemental file 5 also lists the reasons for score boundary changes between rounds 1 and 2 for each statement; twelve statements did not reach stability (table 4). There were four marginally non-consensus statements after round 2 (figure 3).

Results of two survey rounds showing the level of agreement with primary cam morphology definition, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes statements

Here, we report the quantitative results, analysis of qualitative feedback and dissent analysis of the Delphi rounds for definition, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes statements. An online Interacting Group Process followed the Delphi exercise; six mixed stakeholder groups of 5–8 panellists (n = 43), discussed the Delphi exercise results on 22 September 2021. We summarise the discussions in boxes 1–4 and online supplemental file 8.

Box 1
Interacting Group Process: mixed stakeholder group discussion summary — definition domain

Mixed stakeholder groups agreed on the importance of primary cam morphology (PCM) as a concept. This taxonomy, differentiating between primary and secondary cam morphology (SCM), offers several advantages that offset its drawbacks — 'their origins are important to distinguish', and 'it has utility in research, prognosis and treatment'. In research the taxonomy is 'important for classification', while the prognosis is often worse for SCM. Treatment maybe distinctly different as most individuals with PCM will never present with any symptoms. The panel contended more work is needed to authentically engage a small group that is not yet convinced that PCM is an important concept.

### Revision surgery and progression to total hip arthroplasty after surgical correction of femoroacetabular impingement: a systematic review [^bd5982a0]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy

The present systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We followed the PICO protocol for the preliminary search:

P (problem): FAI
I (intervention): surgical correction
C (comparator): generalities, type of intervention, radiographic parameters, tests, scores
O (outcomes): revision rate and progression to THA

Literature Search

Two authors (F.M. A.B.) independently performed the literature search in October 2020, accessing the following databases with no time constraints: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The following keywords were used in combination: hip, FAI, femoroacetabular impingement, arthroscopy, mini-open, open, surgery, dislocation, treatment, therapy, cam, pincer, mixed, labral, acetabulum, femur, pelvis, pain, debridement, repair, reconstruction, THA, complications, pain. The resulting titles and eventually the abstracts were screened by the 2 authors. The full text of the articles of interest was accessed. The references were also screened. Disagreements between the authors were solved by a third senior author (M.B.).

Eligibility Criteria

All the articles concerning surgical correction for patients with FAI were accessed. To be eligible for inclusion, articles had to report the rate of revision and/or progression to THA at last follow-up. Any kind of surgical intervention that did not involve THA was considered revision surgery. According to the authors language capabilities, articles in English, Italian, French, German, and Spanish were considered. Articles of level 1 to 4 according to the Oxford Centre of Evidenced-Based Medicine were considered. Data from national registries were not considered. Reviews, letters, expert opinion, case reports, and editorials were not eligible. Animal, biomechanical, and cadaveric studies were also not considered. Articles regarding revision settings were not eligible. Studies with data based on combined treatments, as well as those focusing on rehabilitation protocols, were excluded. Studies including adjuvants or innovative surgical procedures were excluded. The studies were included regardless of the surgical exposure (arthroscopic, mini-open, open). Studies treating skeletally immature patients were included, as were those describing outcomes in patients who were obese. Studies with data on patients > 60 years old or with clear evidence of advanced hip degeneration (Tönnis grade III) were not included. Case series of < 10 patients were also excluded. Only studies reporting quantitative data under the outcomes of interest were analyzed.

### Best practices: hip femoroacetabular impingement [^7c1a043b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Imaging plays a critical role in the assessment of patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). With better understanding of the underlying pathomechanics and advances in joint-preserving surgery, there is an increasing need to define the most appropriate imaging workup. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance on best practices for imaging of patients with FAI in light of recent advances in corrective FAI surgery. CONCLUSION. Pelvic radiography with dedicated hip projections is the basis of the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected FAI to assess arthritic changes and acetabular coverage and to screen for cam deformities. Chondrolabral lesions should be evaluated with unenhanced MRI or MR arthrography. The protocol should include a large-FOV fluid-sensitive sequence to exclude conditions that can mimic or coexist with FAI, radial imaging to accurately determine the presence of a cam deformity, and imaging of the distal femoral condyles for measurement of femoral torsion. CT remains a valuable tool for planning of complex surgical corrections. Advanced imaging, such as 3D simulation, biochemical MRI, and MR arthrography with application of leg traction, has great potential to improve surgical decision-making. Further research is needed to assess the added clinical value of these techniques.

### The Warwick Agreement on Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome (FAI syndrome): an international consensus statement [^4bdb6c5d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on femoroacetabular impingement syndrome:

- **Definition**: FAIS is a motion-related clinical disorder of the hip with a triad of symptoms, clinical signs, and imaging findings. It represents symptomatic premature contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of FAIS involves abnormal contact between the femoral head and the acetabulum due to bony abnormalities. This can lead to shearing forces at the acetabular labrum and cartilage during physiological hip motion, potentially causing cartilage wear and eventual osteoarthritis.
- **Epidemiology**: The epidemiology of FAIS remains largely unknown. Imaging findings suggestive of the syndrome are also prevalent in asymptomatic individuals, with a higher prevalence observed in athletes.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include genetic predisposition, participation in certain sports, and developmental hip disorders, such as hip dysplasia or Perthes disease.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with FAIS often present with motion- or position-related pain in the hip or groin. Pain may also be felt in the back, buttock, or thigh. They may also describe clicking, catching, locking, stiffness, limited ROM (typically restricted internal rotation in flexion), or giving way. In addition to these symptoms, patients with FAIS may demonstrate altered gait mechanics and hip joint loading.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of FAIS can vary widely and is influenced by factors such as the type of FAIS (cam, pincer, or mixed), the extent of cartilage and labral damage, and the timing and type of intervention. Treatment often leads to symptom improvement, allowing patients to resume full activity, including sports. Without treatment, symptoms of FAIS typically worsen over time. Cam morphology is associated with the development of hip osteoarthritis.

### Nonoperative management of femoroacetabular impingement: a prospective study [^c29965a1]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The literature has given little attention to the nonoperative management of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome despite a rapidly expanding body of research on the topic.

Purpose

To perform a prospective study utilizing a nonoperative protocol on a consecutive series of patients presenting to our clinic with FAI syndrome.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

Between 2013 and 2016, patients meeting the following criteria were prospectively recruited in a nonoperative FAI study: no prior hip surgery, groin-based pain, a positive impingement test, and radiographic FAI syndrome. The protocol consisted of an initial trial of rest, physical therapy, and activity modification. Patients who remained symptomatic were then offered an image-guided intra-articular steroid injection. Patients with recurrent symptoms were then offered arthroscopic treatment. Outcome scores were collected at 12 and 24 months. Statistical analysis was performed to identify risk factors for the need for operative treatment and to determine patient outcomes based on FAI type and treatment.

Results

Ninety-three hips (n = 76 patients: mean age, 15.3 years; range, 10.4–21.4 years) were included in this study and followed for a mean ± SD 26.8 ± 8.3 months. Sixty-five hips (70%) were managed with physical therapy, rest, and activity modification alone. Eleven hips (12%) required a steroid injection but did not progress to surgery. Seventeen hips (18%) required arthroscopic management. All 3 groups saw similar improvements in modified Harris Hip Score (P = 0.961) and nonarthritic hip score (P = 0.975) with mean improvements of 20.3 ± 16.8 and 13.2 ± 15.5, respectively. Hips with cam impingement and combined cam-pincer impingement were 4.0 times more likely to meet the minimal clinically important difference in modified Harris Hip Score (P = 0.004) and 4.4 times more likely to receive surgical intervention (P = 0.05) than patients with pincer deformities alone. Participants in team sports were 3.0 times more likely than individual sport athletes to return to competitive activities (P = 0.045).

Conclusion

A majority (82%) of adolescent patients presenting with FAI syndrome can be managed nonoperatively, with significant improvements in outcome scores at a mean follow-up of 2 years.

Clinical Relevance

A nonoperative approach should be the first-line treatment for young active patients with symptomatic FAI syndrome.

### Can the alpha angle assessment of cam impingement predict acetabular cartilage delamination? [^ea28612b]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Substantial acetabular cartilage damage is commonly present in patients suffering from femoral acetabular impingement (FAI). A better understanding of which patient is at risk of developing substantial cartilage damage is critical for establishing appropriate treatment guidelines.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) Does the cam deformity severity in FAI as assessed by alpha angle predict acetabular cartilage delamination? And (2) what are the clinical and radiographic findings in patients with acetabular cartilage delamination?

Methods

One hundred sixty-seven patients (129 males, 38 females) with a mean age of 38 years (range, 17–59 years) underwent joint preservation surgery for cam-type FAI. All data were collected prospectively. We assessed center-edge angle and Tönnis grade on AP radiographs and alpha angle on specialized lateral radiographs. Acetabular cartilage damage was assessed intraoperatively using the classification of Beck et al., with Type 3 and greater qualifying as delamination.

Results

For all hips, mean alpha angle was 65.5° (range, 41°-90°), and mean center-edge angle was 33.3° (range, 21°-52.5°). Patients with an alpha angle of 65° or greater had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.00 (95% CI, 1.26–12.71) of having Type 3 or greater damage. Increased age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.07) and male sex (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.09–4.62) were associated with Type 3 or greater damage, while this was the opposite for acetabular coverage as assessed by center-edge angle (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99).

Conclusions

Patients with cam-type FAI and an alpha angle of 65° or more are at increased risk of substantial cartilage damage while increasing acetabular coverage appears to have a protective effect.

### Arthroscopic treatment of femoroacetabular impingement of the hip: a new technique to access the joint [^30254b03]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Femoroacetabular impingement has been established as an important cause of groin pain and limitation of range of motion in young, active patients and a possible cause for early osteoarthritis of the hip. Open surgery is a well-recognized approach for treatment and probably the standard for most surgeons, but recent reports regarding arthroscopic treatment procedures suggest comparable results. We present a technique that provides a way to securely penetrate the joint capsule and evaluate the clinical results of this technique in patients with femoroacetabular impingement. Between 2004 and 2007, we prospectively followed a cohort of 105 hips (88 patients; 60 males, 28 females) who underwent surgery for symptomatic cam or mixed femoroacetabular impingement. All patients were evaluated for the Nonarthritic Hip Score, clinical parameters, visual analog scale pain score, initial radiographic degenerative changes, and alpha angle. At a minimum followup of 1.3 years (average, 2.3 years; range, 1.3–4.1 years), all clinical outcome measures improved. The Nonarthritic Hip Score improved from 56.7 points (range, 15–92.5 points) to 84.6 points (range, 47.5–100 points). Nine patients (8.6%) underwent THA during followup. The outcome measures after arthroscopic therapy for femoroacetabular impingement seem comparable to those reported after open procedures.

### Biomechanics of cam femoroacetabular impingement: a systematic review [^bb35908d]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess how biomechanical gait parameters (kinematics, kinetics, and muscle force estimations) differ between patients with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and healthy controls, through a systematic search.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature from PubMed, Scopus, and Medline and EMBASE via OVID SP was undertaken from inception to April 2020 using PRISMA guidelines. Studies that described kinematics, kinetics, and/or estimated muscle forces in cam-type FAI were identified and reviewed.

Results

The search strategy identified 404 articles for evaluation. Removal of duplicates and screening of titles and abstracts resulted in full-text review of 37 articles, with 12 meeting inclusion criteria. The 12 studies reported biomechanical data on a total of 173 cam-FAI (151 cam-specific, 22 mixed-type) patients and 177 healthy age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls. Patients with cam FAI had reduced hip sagittal plane range of motion (mean difference -3.00° [-4.10, -1.90], P < .001), reduced hip peak extension angles (mean difference -2.05° [-3.58, -0.53], P = 0.008), reduced abduction angles in the terminal phase of stance, and reduced iliacus and psoas muscle force production in the terminal phase of stance compared to the control groups. Cam FAI cohorts walked at a slower speed compared with controls.

Conclusions

In conclusion, patients with cam-type FAI exhibit altered sagittal and frontal plane kinematics as well as altered muscle force production during level gait compared to controls. These findings will help guide future research into gait alterations in FAI and how such alterations may contribute to pathologic progression and furthermore, how such alterations can be modified for therapeutic benefit.

### The alpha angle [^ed31883c]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

What Is the Utility of the Alpha Angle?

Alpha angle measurements from skeletal samples since the fourth centurysuggest an exponential growth in the prevalence of FAI, attributed to increases in height, weight, and body mass index. One proposed etiology of cam lesions is developmental, being related to high levels of physical activity during skeletal development. The most common reason for revision hip arthroscopy is residual FAI, specifically residual cam-type FAI.

Lohan et al. found that using the alpha angle in a retrospective, blinded manner to evaluate patients with known treatment pathways offered no value in predicting the presence of cam lesions that would require surgical treatment. They proposed 2 other measurements, 1 of which (the anterior femoral distance) did perform better than the alpha angle, although none of the measurements performed well enough to be considered useful in routine clinical practice. This is likely because cam lesions are 3D deformities, and no single angle, or even combination of angles on planar imaging, can adequately capture the deformity.

In the practical, clinical setting, particularly when it comes to diagnosis and decision-making, the alpha angle value itself is likely less important than the presence or absence of a pathologic cam deformity. In this context, the presence or absence of a cam lesion, and the accurate determination of whether such a lesion is a source of the patient's symptoms, is the most important question to be answered. From an academic perspective, the wide variability in accuracy, reliability, and techniques used to measure the alpha angle limits its interpretability and our ability to compare results across different studies.

It is clear that if the alpha angle is to be measured, it should ideally be measured on 3D imaging or, at the very least, on multiple different radiographic views, with an understanding of which anatomic locations are best visualized on each view. Measurement methods should use a circle of best-fit method rather than a simple angle, and (semi)automated measurements hold the promise of improved accuracy and reliability in a time-efficient manner. Table III summarizes our recommendations with corresponding grades of recommendation.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 1-definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes [^eb732bd1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Terminology: Delphi domain 2

The Delphi panel reached consensus on 14 of 19 terminology statements in round 1 and 16 in round 2 — consensus on two statements to include ('consensus in/agree'), and consensus on 14 statements to exclude ('consensus out/disagree') certain terms. The panel agreed that 'cam morphology' is the preferred term to use for a bone/cartilage bump at any location around the femoral head-neck junction (statement 13), and 'FAI syndrome with cam morphology' (statement 26) for hip-related pain due to a bony bump at any location around the femoral head-neck junction. The Delphi panel agreed to avoid ('consensus out') terms 'lesion', 'deformity' and 'abnormality' (statements 14–22 and 27–31).

Three statements related to the terms proposed for hip-related pain due to a bony bump at any location around the femoral head-neck junction, did not reach consensus: 'cam-type impingement' (statement 23), 'cam FAI' (statement 24) and 'cam-type FAI' (statement 25).

Qualitative analysis identified four themes (online supplemental files 5 and 6). First, warning that 'abnormality is not a very optimistic term', panellists preferred the term 'morphology': 'We've agreed it is a "normal physiological response" and therefore shouldn't be called a lesion/ deformity with their connotations of abnormality'. Second, a panellist suggested replacing 'bump' with 'prominence' as 'not every cam morphology has a "bump". It might only be decreased offset and that certainly does not constitute a "bump"'. Third, although 'FAI syndrome' is the agreed term for hip-related pain due to a bony bump at any location around the femoral head-neck junction, one panellist warned that other causes for hip-related pain exist, and '(FAI syndrome) is one type of pathology' in the hip. Last, one panellist disagreed with the term 'any location', as 'an inferior bony bump may not lead to FAI'.

### Management options for femoroacetabular impingement: a systematic review of symptom and structural outcomes [^c45f0b68]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The optimal therapy for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence for surgical and non-surgical treatment of FAI on symptom and structural outcomes.

Design

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched electronically. Surgical and non-surgical management strategies were searched with "FAI". Studies which included comparison groups and reported symptom or structural outcomes were included (Levels I-III evidence). A risk of bias assessment was performed.

Results

Eighteen studies comparing management strategies for FAI were identified. Most studies had high risk of bias. No study compared surgical and non-surgical treatment. When surgical approaches were compared there was evidence of superior symptom outcomes with arthroscopy compared to open surgery and with labral preservation. There was some evidence that surgical interventions are effective in reducing alpha angle (improved hip shape), but no data on whether this affects long-term outcomes. There was some weak evidence that surgery is associated with structural progression of hip osteoarthritis (OA).

Conclusions

Although evidence supports improvement in symptoms after surgery in FAI, no studies have compared surgical and non-surgical treatment. Therefore no conclusion regarding the relative efficacy of one approach over the other can be made. Surgery improves alpha angle but whether this alters the risk of development or progression of hip OA is unknown. This review highlights the lack of evidence for use of surgery in FAI. Given that hip geometry may be modified by non-surgical factors, clarifying the role of non-surgical approaches vs surgery for the management of FAI is warranted.

### Surgical indications for arthroscopic management of femoroacetabular impingement [^aaf717db]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The clinical literature was systematically reviewed to determine the consistently reported indications for arthroscopic management of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).

Methods

Two databases (Medline and EMBASE) were screened for clinical studies involving the arthroscopic surgical management of FAI. A full-text review of eligible studies was conducted, and the references were searched. Articles published from 1980 until June 2011 were included, and the inclusion criteria were as follows: studies of human patients of all ages and genders with FAI, studies with a minimum of 6 months of patient follow-up, and studies reporting clinical outcome data. A quality assessment of the included articles was conducted.

Results

We included 20 articles in this review, involving a total of 1,368 patients. We identified a lack of consensus on clinical and radiographic indications for the arthroscopic management of FAI. The indications varied from a positive impingement sign (45%) and symptoms or pain for more than 6 months (35%) to a series of positive special tests (25%). Commonly reported radiographic indicators for arthroscopic FAI management included the following: results from a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging (60%), cam or pincer lesions evident on anteroposterior and/or lateral radiographs (50%), loss of sphericity of the femoral neck (30%), acetabular retroversion (30%), magnetic resonance arthrography (25%), reduction in head-neck offset (25%), an alpha angle greater than 50° (25%), and coxa profunda (25%).

Conclusions

We found that there was great inconsistency among the indications for arthroscopic management of FAI. Clinical and radiographic indices remain largely unvalidated. This review highlights the need for more consistent reporting of surgical indications for the arthroscopic management of FAI. Future research should explore what combination of clinical and radiographic indications should be best used to determine arthroscopic FAI management.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 1-definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes [^fbf9b71e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

An international Delphi panel of expert clinicians, athletes, patients and their representatives, and researchers — representing the YAHiR collaborative — agreed on four key PCM elements (definition, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome measures). In what follows, we discuss the Delphi panel's opinions on these key elements and summarise how agreement and areas of tension and dissent inform a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on PCM and its natural history.

Definitions: Delphi domain 1

The Delphi panel agreed on a comprehensive conceptual and operational definition for PCM (figure 4).

The conceptual definition equips all stakeholders, especially athletes and patients, with meaningful language to describe an abstract concept in their hip. It is a bony or cartilage prominence (or 'bump'), with shape (aspherical), size (most are small; some are large), location (anywhere around the head-neck junction of the hip but predominantly anterolateral) and ownership (it is more prevalent in male athletes compared with females and non-athletes, and more common in both hips). Ownership also implies 'lived with' — opening the door for conversations and qualitative research with athletes and patients on their experiences.

While celebrating consensus, tension and dissent spotlighted three areas for future research. First, although this morphology is more prevalent in male versus female athletes, very little research involves female athletes, and no research has been done in para-athlete cohorts — researchers must cast a much broader net to involve minoritised and marginalised groups. Second, although the vast majority of athletes with PCM will never develop symptoms or hip disease, some do. Yet, we cannot predict with confidence who these athletes are. While important to investigate the morphology's prognosis, we should take care not to medicalise a common, mostly benign morphology. The key messages are: (1) this largely benign morphology develops as a 'normal physiological response' to 'high-load' physical activity, and (2) childhood physical activity and sport are important. Third, we should investigate the tension between 'normal and abnormal' as it relates to the capital femoral growth plate's physiological response to load. Bone is a dynamic tissue; how mechanical loading influences the epiphysial growth plate is physiologically complex depending, for example, on the load type, and physical and physiological maturity. What might be a normal load for one athlete is abnormal or high-load for another.

### Total volume of cam deformity alone predicts outcome in arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement [^ba675cb3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Rates for arthroscopic surgery for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) are rising and there is growing concern related to the effectiveness and costs associated with this treatment. There is a general lack of consensus as to the criteria for surgical selection of patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patient outcome following arthroscopic surgery for FAI could be predicted based on the size and location of deformity. The specific questions were: (1) what is the morphology of FAI in terms of size and location of deformity in a cohort of patients selected for surgery? (2) Do morphological factors predict postoperative improvement in hip scores? (3) Do morphological factors predict preoperative hip scores? (4) Are there clusters of morphological factors which explain postsurgical improvement in hip scores?

Materials and Methods

Computer tomography (CT) surgical plans of 90 hips in 79 patients who had undergone primary hip arthroscopy for FAI were retrospectively reviewed. Four parameters for the femur and acetabulum were created: total depth of deformity, maximal depth, extent and the position of maximal deformity. This data were compared with prospectively acquired preoperative and postoperative patient outcome data using generalised linear models.

Results

The cohort comprised 33 males and 46 females aged 37.9 (18–61). The majority (74%) had mixed morphology, 23% isolated cam, and 3% isolated pincer. Overall, the bone depth was greatest and more extensive on the femur. Increased total additional cam deformity alone predicted poorer postoperative outcome (p = 0.045). None of the morphological factors were related to preoperative scores and there was no association between the meta-variables and postoperative outcome.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that a greater total volume of cam deformity led to poorer postoperative patient outcome scores at 1 year. This information provides the surgeon with more accurate patient-specific data for prediction of expected outcomes.

Level Of Evidence

Level III diagnostic.

### Editorial commentary: cam femoroacetabular impingement requires dynamic assessment of beta-angle (femoroacetabular excursion angle) and consideration of femoral and acetabular version: cam impingement in patients with acetabular or femoral retroversion may warrant greater osteoplasty [^e3da546c]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scans have been commonly used to evaluate femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and are well accepted forms of surgical planning. Assessing and addressing both the femoral and acetabular sides result in a combination of "one-sided" treatments that, in sum, net a successful treatment of FAI. However, combining one-sided approaches may not consider the dynamic interaction of the femoral head with the acetabulum. Elevated alpha angles alone can be indicative of a cam-type lesion without necessitating the presence of functional FAI. The presence of a cam-type lesion on lateral radiographs, as suggested by a positive alpha angle, does not necessitate a decrease in clearance between the femoral head and acetabular rim as measured by the beta angle. Assessment of the beta angle, or femoroacetabular excursion angle, has the potential to address dynamic nature of FAI more accurately by directly measuring the degree of clearance between the femoral head and acetabulum. In addition, a comprehensive assessment of physical examination findings, particularly range of motion, as well as a summation of acetabular and femoral version (as measured by the McKibbin Index), are required. Cam-type of FAI poses a larger challenge in the patient with acetabular or femoral retroversion, which may warrant greater and more localized osteoplasty, distally, during hip arthroscopy.

### Cam impingement of the hip: a risk factor for hip osteoarthritis [^4d8c0fef]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is characterized by abnormal contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. Two subtypes have been described: pincer impingement, caused by an overcovered acetabulum; and cam impingement, which occurs as a result of an aspherical femoral head (cam abnormality). A strong correlation exists between cam impingement and the subsequent development of hip osteoarthritis (OA). Major cam abnormalities confer a high risk of OA. However, the association between cam abnormalities and the pathology of OA has been difficult to compare between studies, as different methods have been used to define the abnormality. Cam abnormalities are acquired during skeletal growth and could be influenced by high impact sporting activities. Preventative treatments aiming to reduce the incidence of cam abnormalities and subsequent OA could, therefore, be developed. In this Perspective, we discuss the current understanding of FAI, focusing on cam abnormalities and their association with OA.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 1-definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes [^e4fe5eeb]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary cam morphology is a mostly benign bony prominence that develops at the femoral head-neck junction of the hip, but it is highly prevalent in many athlete populations. In the small proportion of athletes for whom it is not benign, the resulting hip osteoarthritis can be debilitating. Clinicians, athletes, patients and researchers do not yet agree on important primary cam morphology elements. We aimed to ascertain and improve the level of agreement on primary cam morphology definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome measures.

Methods

To collect and aggregate informed opinions, an expert panel — the Young Athlete's Hip Research Collaborative — rated primary cam morphology definition, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome statements through an online Delphi exercise followed by an online meeting to explore areas of tension and dissent. Reporting followed Conducting and REporting DElphi Studies.

Results

A diverse and inclusive Delphi panel (n = 65 for rounds 1 and 2, representing 18 countries; 6 stakeholder groups; 40% women) agreed on 35 of 47 statements in 4 domains, while surfacing areas of tension and dissent. This Delphi panel agreed on four key issues essential to moving research and clinical care forward around primary cam morphology. They agreed on: (1) definition, confirming its conceptual attributes (tissue type, size, location, shape and ownership); (2) terminology — use 'morphology' and not terms with a negative connotation like 'lesion', 'abnormality' or 'deformity'; (3) taxonomy, distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology, and (4) imaging outcomes, a continuous bone/cartilage alpha angle on radial femoral head-neck MRI for primary cam morphology aetiology research.

Conclusion

This consensus provides athletes, patients, clinicians and researchers with a strong foundation to guide more precise communication, better clinical decision-making and higher value research about primary cam morphology and its natural history.

### Surgeon willingness to participate in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement [^10d2497f]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define surgeon willingness to participate in large, multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to address common treatment decisions for the management of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and to define the feasibility of executing these RCTs.

Methods

Thirty case vignettes of consecutive, symptomatic FAI patients who underwent FAI corrective surgery by a single surgeon were provided to members of the Academic Network of Conservational Hip Outcomes Research (ANCHOR). Each surgeon (n = 10) completed a questionnaire in a blinded fashion to determine willingness to participate and enroll the patient in 6 different potential RCTs. The proportion of yes/no ratings were blindly assessed for all 6 RCTs. Differences were tested with χ(2)-tests, and odds ratios were calculated.

Results

Seventy-seven percent and 42% of surgeons were willing to enroll patients in a surgical versus nonoperative FAI RCT with 6-month and 12-month crossover arms, respectively. Only 25% and 53% of surgeons were willing to consider randomization of operative versus nonoperative treatment for femoral and acetabular sided osseous deformities, respectively. Regarding the capsulolabral complex, 63% and 78% were amenable to randomization of labral refixation versus debridement and capsular closure versus no closure, respectively. Statistically, surgeon ratings differed significantly (Pearson χ² = 246.302; P < .001).

Conclusions

Surgeons are willing to participate in surgical versus nonsurgical trials with a 6-month crossover endpoint, yet surgeons are reluctant to offer surgical treatment of FAI without correction of osseous deformity, particularly for cam-type pathomorphology. RCTs to address management of the capsulolabral structures may be more feasible and generalizable based on the willingness of hip preservation surgeons to enroll patients.

Clinical Relevance

The feasibility of completing RCTs for the management of FAI is limited even among high-volume hip preservation surgeons; however, surgeons are willing to participate.

Delphi panel

The concept of 'expert' is contested. We adapted and applied the 'closeness continuum' to purposively recruit 73 experts for this study (figure 2, table 1). The closeness continuum represents an inclusive expert population of individuals with subjective, mandated, and objective closeness to the topic of interest.

Delphi panel recruitment criteria

Patient and public involvement

We involved patient and public partners in the planning, delivery and dissemination of the Delphi study through the YAHiR Collaborative's patient and public involvement (PPI) group. The latter group was represented in the Delphi study steering committee. We supplied the PPI group with a glossary, mentored them on definition use and content (during online individual and PPI group meetings), and invited them to weigh in on each Delphi round. A panel information pack facilitated informed assessments. Members of the PPI group co-led and actively participated in the mixed stakeholder group discussions following the Delphi rounds.

Delphi software

We used DelphiManager, 'a web-based system designed to facilitate the building and management of Delphi surveys' for the Delphi Rounds and Microsoft Forms for the ENHR ranking exercise.

Statement preparation

We created an extensive list of statements and a conceptual framework of all the potential definitions, terminology, taxonomy and research imaging outcome measures focused on PCM and its natural history. The initial list of statements was based on our concept analysis of PCM, and informed by the early results of a qualitative study to explore stakeholder perspectives on factors contributing to high-quality research on how PCM develops, and the Lisbon Agreement on Femoroacetabular Imaging. Steering committee members independently reviewed the initial statements, followed by an iterative, asynchronous online process to review, discuss, modify and approve the final statements. We provided additional descriptive information ('Help Text') where appropriate and asked stakeholders, including the PPI group, to provide feedback on the draft Delphi survey. Stakeholders examined the survey's face validity and refined language, formatting and layout.

### Physical therapy may not Be successful for patients with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and may result in insufficient hip range of motion when femoral anteversion is less than 16 ° and α-angle is greater than 65 ° [^9eca3fd4]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify factors associated with insufficient range of motion (ROM) improvement after the posterior pelvic tilt change in cam-type femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.

Methods

Preoperative computed tomography images from 71 consecutive patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome treated with arthroscopic cam resection were evaluated. Using a dynamic computer simulation program, 3-dimensional models with a 10° posterior pelvic tilt from the supine functional pelvic plane (baseline) were created by computed tomography models. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those who experienced > 10° (effective group) and ≤ 10° (ineffective group) improvements in internal rotation at 90° flexion after a 10° posterior pelvic tilt. Demographic characteristics; preoperative range of internal rotation at 90° flexion; and radiographic parameters, including Tönnis grade, lateral center-edge angle, acetabular roof obliquity angle, central acetabular anteversion, cranial acetabular anteversion, femoral anteversion, and α angle, were compared in the 2 groups. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with insufficient ROM improvement following a 10° posterior pelvic tilt.

Results

The 71 patients included 58 men and 13 women, of mean age 41.4 ± 14.6 years. Posterior pelvic tilt was effective in 13 hips and ineffective in 58. Univariate analysis showed that preoperative range of internal rotation at 90°flexion, femoral anteversion, and α angle differed significantly in the 2 groups. Multivariable analysis showed that femoral anteversion < 16° (odds ratio 7.4; 95% confidence interval 1.6–35; P = 0.012) and α angle > 65° (odds ratio 6.7; 95% confidence interval 1.2–37; P = 0.027) were significant factors associated with insufficient ROM improvement after posterior pelvic tilt.

Conclusions

Physical therapy may not be successful for patients with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and may result in insufficient hip ROM when femoral anteversion is less than 16° and α-angle is greater than 65°.

Clinical Relevance

Patients with a prominent cam-type deformity and lower anterior femoral anteversion are at high risk of clinical failure following improvement in pelvic mobility by conservative treatment alone and are likely to benefit from surgery for cam deformity.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^80cb7b7e]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) — terminology, epidemiology, and diagnostic approach are defined as follows: The term FAI is used for morphological variation of the acetabulum and/or femoral head relevant to clinical care, whereas FAIS establishes a movement-related disorder with symptoms and clinical findings. Imaging findings of FAI are common in the general population, ranging from 9% to 25% in asymptomatic males and 2% to 10% in asymptomatic females; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of FAIS should occur in the presence of symptoms and positive clinical signs, in addition to imaging findings of morphological variation. Evidence suggests cam-type morphology results from alterations of the capital femoral epiphysis secondary to repetitive sports-related loading during adolescence, while pincer morphology is associated with global acetabular overcoverage patterns. Familial risk has been reported, with siblings of individuals with cam-type morphology having a 2.8 times increased risk and siblings of patients with pincer morphology having a relative risk (RR) of 2.0 for the same morphology; authors recommended caution in interpreting these findings due to unaccounted environmental factors. Observational and cross-sectional studies report cam morphology with related symptoms more commonly in younger, athletic males, with high prevalence in high-level impact sports, and females in a cohort of soccer athletes displayed smaller cam-type morphologies compared to males.

### Arthroscopic hip surgery compared with physiotherapy and activity modification for the treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^6b7e4f9e]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Interventions

Full details of the interventions are in the published protocol.

Physiotherapy and activity modification — as no standardised physiotherapy regimen has been agreed for FAI, we developed a goal based programme based on the consensus opinion of the study team and existing literature. To standardise treatment, participating physiotherapists received information on the study protocol and training sessions. The treating therapist recorded physiotherapy compliance and attainment of goals within the prescribed treatment themes. A specialist physiotherapist (band 6) or advanced physiotherapy practitioner (band 7/8) delivered the treatment (supplementary table S1). The programme was tailored to individual patient needs and desired level of function, with an emphasis on muscle strengthening to improve core stability and movement control. Participants were encouraged to avoid impingement positions (extremes of hip flexion, abduction, internal rotation). To reflect what is feasible in current NHS practice, we provided a maximum of eight sessions over a five month period.

Arthroscopic surgery — before trial recruitment began, participating surgeons met to ensure standardisation of technique for the study by consensus agreement. Femoral and acetabular bone seen to impinge intraoperatively were excised with a burr (osteochondroplasty) to eliminate impingement on dynamic hip flexion and internal rotation. Labral tears were repaired if possible, or otherwise debrided. Articular cartilage lesions were debrided to a stable base, and in areas of full thickness cartilage loss, microfracture of the subchondral bone was performed. Participants received postoperative physiotherapy, provided as routine care in the NHS, which focused on maintaining range of movement and a graduated return to activity.

Imaging outcomes: Delphi domain 4

Acknowledging that operationalising PCM remains challenging, the panel agreed to report a continuous alpha angle — the primary imaging outcome variable for aetiology and prognosis research (figure 4). In agreement with a recent systematic review, and the Lisbon Agreement, and mainly for clinical research, a 60° alpha angle cut-off value can be used to classify PCM. However, alpha angle should be reported as a specific number (continuous variable).

Although the panel agreed that serial MRI (radial imaging) is needed in studies to investigate how PCM develops during maturation, opinions on how often this should be done varied. Some experts suggested MRI every 3 months during the growth spurt, while others opined that every 6–24 months would suffice. MRI, however, is expensive and access to it limited. Not everyone agreed to use AP pelvis and lateral radiographs in long term prognosis studies of PCM or FAI syndrome; however, anything but radiographs will exclude the vast majority of minoritised populations with limited access to expensive three-dimensional imaging (MRI or CT scans) and expert radiologists.

Imaging findings could confuse and worry patients. Researchers should therefore consider how potentially sensitive imaging findings are communicated to athletes, patients and other stakeholders (eg, parents, coaches, club managers). A discussion paper on athlete data in professional sport by the Australian Academy of Sport describes some of the important aspects.

### Clinical trials in orthopaedics and the future direction of clinical investigations for femoroacetabular impingement [^8df34b0f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders that affect a diverse patient population. The natural history of the disease, the role of nonsurgical management, the indications for surgery, optimal surgical techniques, and the predictors of treatment outcomes need to be further defined. To date, clinical research reports have included primarily surgical case series. Future clinical investigations are needed to establish improved clinical evidence to guide patient care. Most urgent is the need to better understand the potential role of standardized nonsurgical treatment options for FAI and to define the predictors of surgical and nonsurgical outcomes. Future randomized controlled trials and large observational cohort studies targeted at these clinical research deficiencies will strengthen the evidence and improve informed decision making regarding the management of symptomatic FAI.

### Alpha angle correction in femoroacetabular impingement [^853ae537]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The predictive value of the alpha angle, currently the most validated magnetic resonance imaging parameter for CAM-impingement FAI, remains to be systematically evaluated in the orthopaedic literature. A systematic review was conducted to determine whether alpha angle correction influences clinical outcomes in patients with FAI.

Methods

We searched three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed) for English clinical studies published up to August 2012, reporting surgical correction of the alpha angle in patients with a primary diagnosis of FAI. Two independent assessors reviewed eligible studies. Where applicable, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to perform a quality assessment. Descriptive statistics are presented.

Results

Of the 1,103 studies initially retrieved, 14 fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Majority of studies (86%) were case-control designs, with no randomized controlled trials. Variability existed in the surgical techniques and modalities used to measure pre- and post-operative alpha angles. All 14 studies reported a mean measured post-operative restoration of a normal alpha angle (equal to or less than 55°). Failure due to inadequate osseous correction was cited in 3/14 included studies. Correction resulted in significant improvements in range of motion and patient Visual Analog Scales, non-arthritic hip scores, Harris Hip Scores and the short-form-12.

Conclusion

Based on this review, there is evidence supporting that precise surgical restoration of the alpha angle in CAM-type FAI to a minimum of less than 55° will lead to improved patient outcomes. The alpha angle is a good predictor of outcome and represents a simple, reproducible and inexpensive guide that can be used intra-operatively and post-operatively.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^f426ddba]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Clinical management — nonsurgical care and anti-inflammatory agents: Consensus recommendations support nonsurgical intervention including physical therapist management as an initial intervention for many patients with nonarthritic hip joint pain. Anti-inflammatory agents are often recommended for pain relief and inflammation; however, evidence to support this intervention in patients with nonarthritic hip pain is lacking. Both over-the-counter and prescribed anti-inflammatory agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors, may be prescribed as part of an intervention program, but this class of drugs is not without risk for serious adverse events, including greater risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. In individuals with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS), nonsurgical management is supported by consensus statements and evidence demonstrating clinical improvement with physical therapist management.

Stage 1: planning

Steering committee: The study steering committee included members of the YAHiR Collaborative and aimed for a robust Delphi method and ENHR ranking process. Interpreting 'diversity' as more than representation of certain demographic groups, the steering committee ensured a diverse (eg, sex/gender, country of residence, profession), informed (knowledgeable about primary cam morphology and its natural history) and representative of previously minoritised groups relevant to this research field (eg, participants from the Global South, patient and public representatives and women) international Delphi panel. By prioritising anonymity and access to adequate topic-specific resources, the online Delphi method and ENHR ranking strategy supported a more equitable and inclusive process (online supplemental file 4: steering committee terms of reference).

Delphi and ENHR ranking panel: We describe in a linked paper and online supplemental file 1, how the 'closeness continuum' was adapted and applied to purposively recruit a maximum variation sample of 73 experts for this study, based on the steering committee's judgement and knowledge of the context. With steering committee oversight, the lead author invited all potential participants. Participants were not reimbursed.

Definition of consensus

Sample size: The Delphi study steering committee oversampled to compensate for possible attrition over rounds (at a rate of 25% per round). As consensus is normally achieved in an average of three rounds, the steering committee aimed to recruit a starting sample of 50 to 100 panel members.

Patient and public involvement (PPI): We involved patient and public partners in the planning, delivery and dissemination phases of the Oxford consensus through the YAHiR Collaborative's PPI group. The latter group was represented in the Delphi study steering committee. We supplied all members of the PPI group with a glossary, mentored them on definition use and content (during individual and one PPI group online meetings) and invited them to weigh in on each Delphi round as well as in ENHR ranking surveys. They had access to the recordings of the Oxford-Aspetar-La Trobe Young Athlete's Hip Webinar Series, providing a good knowledge base including the current evidence, and issues, allowing an informed assessment. Members of the PPI group lead and actively participated in the mixed stakeholder group discussions following the Delphi rounds (stage 3 below).

### Cam decompression utilizing the stryker hip-check software platform… [^bcc459ae]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Accurate femoroplasty has been shown to be critical in achieving success following treatment of femoroacetabular impingement. Nearly 75% of cases undergoing revision hip arthroscopy do so due to residual femoroacetabular impingement. 1–3 Nearly 75% of cases undergoing revision hip arthroscopy do so due to residual FAI. Matsuda et al. coined the term "critical corner" to describe residual impingement not resected during routine anterolateral femoroplasty. A clinical exam will be performed postoperatively at each visit, consisting of hip range of motion with the patient in the supine position, impingement tests, and gait.

Radiographic measurements will be performed using the institutional PACS system as well as ImageJ for surface area calculations. The patients as well as the clinician performing postoperative radiographic calculations will be blinded to method of treatment. Study Procedures Pre-Operative A series of standard radiographs will be taken to understand the severity of the cam-type impingement. A clinical exam including but not limited to the following will be performed: gait hip range of motion with the patient in the supine position; anterior, posterior and lateral impingement tests; painful internal/external snapping test, FABER's test, Modified Resisted Internal rotation test, Ligamentum Teres test. The patients as well as the clinician performing postoperative radiographic calculations will be blinded to method of treatment.

A post-operative PROs and VAS Pain Score will be taken at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-operatively. Medication use will be documented in post-op recovery, at 2 weeks, 3months, and 12 months post-operatively. A clinical exam including range of motion assessment will be performed at 2-week, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^bad1720e]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic exercise for nonarthritic hip joint pain — clinicians may use therapeutic exercises and activities to address joint mobility, muscle flexibility, and muscle strength deficits identified during the physical examination, with limited evidence suggesting benefit within 6 to 8 weeks and consensus statements recommending therapeutic exercise up to a period of 6 to 8 months for patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS); strengthening exercises performed in weight-bearing positions should promote appropriate control of the hip and pelvic complex, although the specific effect of therapeutic exercise on clinical outcomes has not been fully established and therapeutic exercise is consistently described as a component of multimodal intervention protocols.

### Arthroscopic hip surgery compared with physiotherapy and activity modification for the treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^7f65edc2]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Median time to treatment post-randomisation was 44 days for the physiotherapy programme group and 86 days for the arthroscopic surgery group. Comparing operative and non-operative management is challenging given surgical care is usually delivered at a single time point, whereas physiotherapy takes place over weeks or months. The longer waiting times for surgery might influence results. However, this was a pragmatic trial and the care delivered accurately reflects current practice in NHS settings. We selected intention-to-treat analysis rather than post-intervention analysis as the primary outcome because although groups are balanced at the time of randomisation (a requirement for inferring a causal relation between intervention and outcome), this might not be true at any other time point. We also performed a post-intervention analysis (analysis D), which revealed a comparable treatment effect to the modified intention-to-treat analysis (table 3). Dropouts occurred in both treatment groups, and although the study remained adequately powered, baseline scores were slightly lower in the physiotherapy programme group (supplementary table S2). Nevertheless, our primary analysis adjusts for prognostic factors, and the treatment effect was robust to different assumptions about missing data (missing at random and missing not at random) in our sensitivity analysis (supplementary fig S2).

This trial does not capture patients with minimally symptomatic FAI, a condition that is typically diagnosed and treated in primary care. Instead it provides guidance for the treatment of patients who are referred to secondary or tertiary care with more severe or prolonged symptoms. Given the potential complications of surgery and observed clinical improvement with the physiotherapy programme, we currently recommend physiotherapy as first line treatment. If symptoms continue then the likelihood of symptom improvement with arthroscopic surgery should be considered.

Conclusions and policy implications

The results of this study suggest that patients with symptomatic FAI referred to secondary or tertiary care achieve a greater improvement in patient reported outcomes with arthroscopic surgery than with a programme of physiotherapy and activity modification. However, further research is required to identify patients most likely to benefit from intervention. The evaluation of treatment cost effectiveness and disease modifying potential with long term follow-up of this cohort will further guide treatment and commissioning decisions.

### Is prophylactic surgery for femoroacetabular impingement indicated? A systematic review [^af726a55]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is a systematic review to determine if prophylactic surgical intervention for asymptomatic patients with radiographic evidence of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is warranted to prevent early degenerative joint disease of the hip.

Methods

A systematic search was performed from 1965 to 2013 in PubMed and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria were prospective or retrospective studies comparing skeletally mature asymptomatic patients with radiographic evidence of FAI treated with prophylactic hip arthroscopic surgery versus nonoperative management. A total of 840 references were identified from the searches. After detailed eligibility screening, none of the references met the eligibility criteria.

Results

No trials were identified that met the criteria for inclusion in the review.

Conclusion

There is a lack of available evidence to support surgical intervention for the treatment of FAI in asymptomatic patients. This article attempts to address this dilemma by reviewing the available literature to answer several questions that would indirectly address the topic. First, what is the prevalence of FAI in the asymptomatic population? Second, what is the natural history of FAI if left untreated? Upon reviewing these issues, the authors' conclusion parallels that of the systematic review: Current evidence does not support prophylactic surgery for asymptomatic FAI in the vast majority of cases. However, limited evidence suggests that asymptomatic patients who have previously undergone total hip arthroplasty for FAI-induced osteoarthritis of the contralateral hip are at a significantly increased risk for early degenerative joint disease. Further research is needed to better clarify surgical indications.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^3ca96e2b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

We discussed strengths and limitations to the Delphi method in a linked paper (Oxford consensus study, part 1). We anticipated survey fatigue — not completing the survey or reluctance to participate when faced with extensive and complicated surveys — as a possible major limitation. The Delphi and ENHR ranking exercise surveys were long and potentially complicated. We introduced four measures to mitigate participant fatigue. First, we structured the Delphi survey in five domains. Second, we invested time to optimise statement wording and kept the statements and survey structure the same for both Delphi rounds. Third, we authentically engaged participants, including PPI group members, through a webinar series described above, and additional online information and discussion sessions. Last, we divided the 18 research statements for the ENHR ranking strategy between three surveys of five to seven statements per survey. All 65 participants completed the two Delphi rounds and more than 40 the three ENHR surveys. A major strength is the large, international panel representing six stakeholder groups, including a PPI group. Although some statements (and domains, eg, imaging outcomes) required technical knowledge, potentially limiting some panellists' ability to answer, we invested time to share relevant knowledge and allowed the option 'not able to score'. Acknowledging that a spectrum of expertise is key to inform a group's opinion, we applied the more inclusive 'closeness continuum' to expertise.

### Five-year outcomes after arthroscopic surgery for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome in elite athletes [^5b946bce]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a well-recognized cause of hip pain in the athletic population. In FAIS, an abnormal osseous morphology of the femoral head (cam) or acetabulum (pincer) generates pathological contact in the hip joint and can damage the labrum and cartilage. FAIS morphologies are observed in athletes presenting with hip pain, reduced range of motion (ROM) of the hip, and restrictions in sports participation. Athletes with high demands in terms of hip flexion, such as ice hockey and soccer players, run an increased risk of developing hip pain caused by cam and/or pincer deformities.

Arthroscopic treatment for FAIS has become increasingly common during the past decade and has yielded good clinical outcomes. The purpose of surgical intervention is to reduce pain and increase ROM by removing cam and pincer deformities, striving for impingement-free hip anatomy and improved hip function. The literature also suggests a low rate of complications and reoperations after arthroscopic treatment for FAIS. Although several studies have reported positive results in elite athletes treated with arthroscopic surgery, most use return to sports (RTS) or performance outcome. However, only a few studies have used patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to present the results, and the reports on the long- or midterm outcome in this patient category are limited. Nevertheless, arthroscopic treatment in athletes presenting with FAIS is increasing, and studies suggest that high-level athletes will improve their hip function and have a high rate of return to preinjury activity levels.,

Follow-up after hip surgery generally includes PROMs. Early PROMs, such as the modified Harris Hip Score, were developed for an elderly population with osteoarthritis and are therefore not suitable for younger, more active patients. Lately, PROMs validated for young and active patients have been established; they include the International Hip Outcome Tool short version (iHOT-12)and the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). These scores are recommended by the scientific community for evaluating FAIS in this patient population.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 5-year results after arthroscopic treatment for FAIS in elite athletes with PROMs validated for an active population. The primary hypothesis was that elite athletes experience improved outcomes 5 years after surgical treatment.

### Editorial commentary: cam lesion location and size in hip arthroscopy: which matters most? [^c01db749]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The femoral cam lesion, initially recognized as the "pistol grip" deformity in femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS), has long been a focal point in hip arthroscopy. While residual cam deformity is widely acknowledged as a major cause of revision surgery, emerging studies have questioned whether cam lesion location impacts surgical outcomes. This line of inquiry essentially revolves around three interconnected aspects: first, given the near-spherical morphology of the femoral head-neck junction, whether isolated superolateral, anterolateral, or anterior cam locations can exist-a fundamental question regarding the conceptual framework of cam location taxonomy; second, how the size and location of cam lesions influence the practical execution of femoroplasty, encompassing considerations of surgical technique and operative precision; and third, assuming standardized femoroplasty regardless of lesion size or location, whether the topographical location of the cam itself truly impacts surgical outcomes, exploring the intrinsic effect of cam location on clinical results. Notably, cam lesions seen on AP radiographs-often appearing as classic "pistol grip" deformities-tend to be larger, which may underlie their association with more severe labral-cartilage injury and poorer outcomes, pointing to size rather than location as the key prognostic factor. Our perspective emphasizes the need for intuitive methodologies to better define how cam volume and location interact to affect arthroscopic outcomes, ultimately guiding surgical strategy and individualized prognosis.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) refers to pathological contact between an abnormally shaped femoral head and acetabulum, which can result in early labral and chondral damage. It is an important cause of hip pain and restricted range of motion in young adults. Symptomatic FAI ultimately requiring surgery is more prevalent in high-level athletes than in individuals who participate in recreational sports activity. FAI is the most common cause of labral tears; osseous morphological changes associated with FAI have been found in up to 79% of patients with symptomatic tears. FAI predisposes patients to premature chondral wear and osteoarthritis.

Initial treatment of FAI is typically conservative in nature, and can include activity modification, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. If the pain causing limitation of activity persists, surgery can be considered. Hip preservation surgery aims to treat the structural lesions causing FAI, thereby relieving pain and improving function. Whilst it has been proven to improve symptoms, and some studies have shown promising results in the prevention of osteoarthritis, there is insufficient data to conclude whether it prevents the onset of early osteoarthritis. Hip preservation surgery can be arthroscopic or open, and may include acetabular rim resection, osteochondroplasty, and labral or cartilage debridement or repair techniques. Pre-existing advanced osteoarthritis is the strongest predictor of poor outcomes following FAI surgery, and thus the major relative contraindication to hip preservation surgery is severe chondral wear.

The most common anatomical osseous abnormalities predisposing to FAI include cam or pincer lesions; however, mixed cam and pincer impingement is more common than either one in isolation. Cam and pincer structural lesions are common, and are found in up to 25% of asymptomatic individuals. As such, a diagnosis of FAI should be made only in the correct clinical context. The most common presenting symptom is activity-related groin pain which is exacerbated by hip flexion and internal rotation. Patients often have a positive impingement test, where internal rotation and adduction with the hip in 90° of flexion reproduces the pain.

Multiple imaging modalities, including radiographs and computed tomography (CT), are used in the preoperative evaluation of FAI. Radiographs often serve as an initial screening tool to assess for pincer or cam lesions, hip dysplasia, or advanced osteoarthritis. In addition to findings on radiographs, CT with 3D reconstructions allows detailed assessment of osseous morphology in preoperative planning.

### Osteochondroplasty and labral repair for the treatment of young adults with femoroacetabular impingement: a randomized controlled trial [^f396f470]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a condition known to cause hip pain in young adults.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of the surgical correction of FAI via arthroscopic osteochondroplasty with or without labral repair compared with arthroscopic lavage of the hip joint with or without labral repair.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 220 male and female participants aged 18 to 50 years with nonarthritic FAI suitable for surgical treatment were recruited for the trial at 10 clinical centers in Canada, Finland, and Denmark between October 2012 and November 2017, of whom 214 were included in the final analysis. In the osteochondroplasty group, cam- and/or pincer-type lesions were resected using fluoroscopic guidance. In the lavage group, the joint was washed out with 3 L of normal saline. Surgeons were instructed to repair the labrum in both groups if it was mechanically unstable once probed, showing visible displacement or chondrolabral separation. The primary outcome was patient-reported pain (using the 100-point visual analog scale [VAS]) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included hip function (Hip Outcome Score [HOS] and International Hip Outcome Tool), physical and mental health (12-Item Short Form Health Survey), and health utility (EuroQol-5 Dimensions) at 12 months as well as any reoperations and other hip-related adverse events at 24 months.

Results

At 12 months, there was no difference in pain (VAS) between the groups (mean difference [MD], 0.11 [95% CI, -7.22 to 7.45]; P = 0.98). Also, 88.3% (189/214) of participants had a labral tear, of which 60.3% were repaired. For the secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences between treatment groups, with the exception of the HOS activities of daily living domain in which lavage showed significant improvement compared with osteochondroplasty (MD, -5.03 [95% CI, -10.40 to -0.03]; P = 0.049). By 24 months, there were significantly fewer reoperations reported in the osteochondroplasty group (8/105) than the lavage group (19/104) (odds ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.15–0.89]; P = 0.026). The primary reasons for a reoperation included hip pain (15/27; 55.6%) and a reinjury of the labrum (11/27; 40.7%).

Conclusion

Both the osteochondroplasty and the lavage groups with or without labral repair for FAI had significantly improved pain or function significantly at 1 year. By 2 years, the reoperation rate was significantly lower in the osteochondroplasty group.

### Hip pain in young adults: femoroacetabular impingement [^cc53cd70]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2007). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement is a more recently noticed cause of hip pain in young patients, and early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent development of osteoarthritis and/or delay the need for a more radical treatment option such as arthroplasty surgery. Two general types of femoroacetabular impingement have been described. In the cam impingement, the femoral deformity, usually a bump on the head-and-neck junction, impinges on the acetabular rim. The pincer type of impingement is caused by the deformity on the acetabular side, which may be a deep socket, or an acetabular overcoverage due to retroversion that creates an obstacle for flexion and internal rotation. This article attempts to examine the underlying pathogenesis and discusses diagnostic and treatment modalities.

Confidence in the quality of the evidence — GRADE-based certainty — "reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certainty in that evidence", uses ratings of "High", "Moderate", "Low", or "Very Low", and, per GRADE, "the lowest quality of evidence for any of the relevant critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation". Assessment elements include, "Is there high- or moderate-quality evidence that answers this question?" and "What is the overall certainty of this evidence?"

### Nonsurgical versus surgical management of femoroacetabular impingement: what does the current best evidence tell Us [^cdb53c3c]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Controversy exists as to the management of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). When nonsurgical management of symptomatic FAI fails, surgical management is generally indicated. However, many groups with a stake in patient care (particularly payors) have insisted on higher levels of evidence. Recently, there have been several Level I studies published, comparing physical therapy (PT) with hip arthroscopy in the management of symptomatic FAI. All of these studies have used outcomes tools developed and validated for patients with nonarthritic hip pain (the International Hip Outcome Tool). Most highest level evidence confirms that although patients with FAI do benefit from PT, patients who undergo surgical management for FAI with hip arthroscopy benefit more than those who undergo PT (mean difference in the International Hip Outcome Tool 6.8 [minimal clinically important difference 6.1], P = 0.0093). Future large prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effect on the outcomes when there is a delay in surgical management in symptomatic individuals, assess whether FAI surgery prevents or delays osteoarthritis, and determine the role of other advanced surgical techniques.
