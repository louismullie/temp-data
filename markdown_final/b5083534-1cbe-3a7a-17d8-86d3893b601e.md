## Question

Outpatient medicine treament for stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient medicine treatment for stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope, including what "outpatient" means across the stroke continuum. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for outpatient care models, especially for TIA and minor stroke. Next, I will examine core outpatient medical interventions: antithrombotic therapy, blood pressure control, lipid management, atrial fibrillation detection and anticoagulation, and lifestyle modification. After that, I need to review rehabilitation and mental health care in the outpatient setting. Finally, I should consider system-level quality improvement, disparities, and practical implementation, and close with a concise, evidence-based synthesis and safety caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't conflate inpatient acute care with outpatient secondary prevention and rehabilitation. Outpatient stroke care spans three phases: acute outpatient evaluation for TIA/minor stroke, subacute outpatient management after discharge, and chronic outpatient secondary prevention and rehabilitation, and the evidence base differs by phase, so I need to keep these distinct as I proceed.

> I will now examine the evidence for outpatient acute care of TIA and minor stroke, because this is where safety concerns are highest. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of early risk and whether urgent outpatient models mitigate it. The EXPRESS study showed that rapid outpatient initiation of secondary prevention reduced 90-day recurrent stroke from 10.3% to 2.1%, an 80% relative risk reduction, and this benefit persisted at 10 years, which is compelling even though the design was nonrandomized [^111NUmto] [^112cWiUz]. Hold on, I should also check comparative safety versus inpatient care. A large meta-analysis of 226,683 patients found no difference in early recurrent stroke risk between TIA clinics and inpatient care, whereas ED discharge without follow-up carried higher risk, supporting the safety of structured outpatient pathways when appropriately selected and rapidly implemented [^1157CCQX] [^113u3ur6]. I should double-check that these findings align with guideline direction; indeed, contemporary guidelines endorse multidisciplinary outpatient team-based approaches for secondary prevention and support risk-stratified outpatient care for TIA/minor stroke when systems are in place [^116X9WaL] [^113x8Uaf].

> Next, I should review antithrombotic therapy in the outpatient setting, and I need to ensure I'm precise about indications and durations. For noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole are appropriate options, with selection individualized to risk, tolerance, and cost; dual antiplatelet therapy is reserved for early secondary prevention in minor stroke or high-risk TIA and is generally limited to 21–30 days to balance bleeding risk, with some exceptions for intracranial atherosclerosis where extension to 90 days may be reasonable in selected patients [^113bmhte] [^115HotE9]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overgeneralizing DAPT; yes, the benefit is front-loaded and time-limited for most, and prolonged triple therapy is discouraged outside trials [^111E5Guz].

> I need to check blood pressure targets and timing, because this is often misunderstood. For neurologically stable outpatients with prior ischemic stroke or TIA, a universal office BP goal of less than 130/80 mmHg is recommended to reduce recurrent stroke and vascular events; there is insufficient evidence to push below normal ranges, and the optimal timing after an acute event remains uncertain, so outpatient titration should be individualized and sustained [^114VeeqR] [^112o8DL1]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup differs; the recommendation applies broadly, with attention to orthostasis, renal function, and patient preference during titration [^114VeeqR].

> Now, lipid management. I should confirm intensity and thresholds. High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for patients 75 years or younger with clinical ASCVD to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction, with moderate-intensity statins considered when high-intensity therapy is not tolerated or contraindicated; in patients over 75, continuation of high-intensity statins is reasonable if tolerated, after discussing risks, interactions, and frailty [^112tLLMa] [^116Eg5bQ]. Wait, I should verify that this aligns with secondary stroke prevention guidance; yes, the AHA/ASA stroke prevention guideline supports aggressive LDL-C lowering and statin therapy as a core outpatient intervention [^116X9WaL].

> I will now examine atrial fibrillation detection and anticoagulation, because this is a major outpatient opportunity. Prolonged rhythm monitoring detects occult atrial fibrillation in about 9% of patients with cryptogenic stroke, and when AF is found, oral anticoagulation is preferred over antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention; outpatient AF risk scores and shared decision-making are appropriate to guide therapy selection and monitoring [^115HotE9] [^116X9WaL]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to outpatient management; yes, detection and initiation commonly occur in the outpatient phase after discharge, and guideline-concordant anticoagulation reduces recurrent stroke risk [^115HotE9].

> Lifestyle modification and risk factor control are foundational in outpatient care, but I need to ensure I cite the right guidance. Multidisciplinary outpatient teams that actively adjust medications and counsel on diet, activity, smoking cessation, and adherence improve BP, lipids, and other vascular risk factors; cardiac rehabilitation–style programs after stroke/TIA show improvements in fitness and risk profiles, though evidence is still evolving and should be individualized [^116X9WaL] [^1154bAhX]. Let me verify that guidelines emphasize team-based care; yes, both AHA/ASA and VA/DoD endorse coordinated outpatient teams for secondary prevention and self-management support [^116X9WaL] [^115noPmo].

> Turning to rehabilitation, I should confirm that outpatient therapy improves function and reduces deterioration. Therapy-based outpatient rehabilitation services for community-dwelling stroke survivors reduce odds of deterioration in personal activities of daily living and modestly improve ADL performance, with an estimated number needed to treat of about 14 to prevent deterioration, supporting routine referral when deficits persist [^114yKdVB]. But wait, what if access is limited? Outpatient rehabilitation remains underutilized, with only about one-third of eligible survivors participating nationally, and disparities by race, education, and geography persist, so systems must address transportation, coverage, and scheduling barriers to realize benefits [^113xrX3c] [^116H8XXw]. I should also note that home-based and outpatient models can produce similar upper-extremity outcomes, enabling flexibility in delivery [^112mVECw].

> Mental health care is too often overlooked; I need to ensure depression screening and treatment are embedded. Poststroke depression is common and undertreated, with only about 16–18% of depressed survivors receiving outpatient treatment despite strong links to worse recovery and quality of life; guidelines recommend routine screening and treatment with psychotherapy, SSRIs, or SNRIs as indicated, ideally integrated into outpatient stroke care [^111TDiut] [^115noPmo]. Hold on, I should verify that this is a guideline-backed standard; yes, AHA/ASA and VA/DoD both call for systematic depression screening and treatment in follow-up care [^115noPmo].

> Next, I should review system-level quality improvement, because outpatient care quality varies widely. Voluntary hospital- or outpatient-based quality monitoring programs improve adherence to secondary prevention guidelines and can reduce recurrent events; decision support tools in primary care can improve diagnostic accuracy and prompt timely initiation of prevention therapies after TIA or minor stroke [^116X9WaL] [^116mJxHF]. I need to ensure I note that underuse of evidence-based therapies remains common in ambulatory settings, reinforcing the need for standardized protocols and feedback loops [^116X9WaL].

> I should double-check disparities and implementation barriers, since they directly affect outcomes. Older adults, women, Black and Hispanic patients, and those with lower socioeconomic status experience lower rates of outpatient rehabilitation and depression treatment, and rural residents face access constraints; telehealth and hybrid models can mitigate some barriers, but sustained policy and payment reforms are needed to close gaps [^113xrX3c] [^111TDiut] [^116z23Kx]. Let me verify that guidelines acknowledge these issues; yes, AHA/ASA policy statements emphasize equity-focused system changes to improve access and quality of outpatient stroke care [^1159BUtD].

> Bringing this together, I should confirm the practical outpatient algorithm. For TIA or minor stroke, rapid-access outpatient evaluation with MRI, vascular imaging, ECG, and risk stratification enables timely secondary prevention and safe discharge for appropriately selected patients, with early follow-up to close care gaps; for all stroke survivors, early post-discharge outpatient visits within 1–3 weeks, aggressive risk factor control to BP less than 130/80 mmHg, high-intensity statins when indicated, antithrombotic therapy tailored to mechanism, AF detection with prolonged monitoring, rehabilitation referral for persistent deficits, depression screening and treatment, and team-based adherence support constitute the core of evidence-based outpatient medicine for stroke [^116QephJ] [^114VeeqR] [^112tLLMa] [^115HotE9] [^114yKdVB] [^115noPmo] [^116X9WaL]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis aligns with major guidelines; yes, it reflects AHA/ASA secondary prevention and rehabilitation guidance and is consistent with VA/DoD rehabilitation algorithms and the EXPRESS/SANO programs' operational lessons [^116X9WaL] [^115noPmo] [^111NUmto] [^1132MqBw].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety caveats are explicit. Outpatient care for TIA/minor stroke is safe and effective only when delivered in structured, rapid-access clinics with clear protocols, reliable imaging, and close follow-up; ED discharge without arranged specialty follow-up is associated with higher recurrence and worse process measures, so patient selection and system reliability are non-negotiable [^1157CCQX] [^1139sjXk]. If I initially implied that outpatient care is universally equivalent to inpatient care, wait, that overstates the evidence; the correct conclusion is that structured outpatient pathways can achieve outcomes comparable to inpatient care for selected patients, whereas unstructured outpatient care or ED-only management fares worse, which is why guidelines still advise hospitalization for high-risk patients and emphasize system-level safeguards [^1157CCQX] [^116X9WaL].

Outpatient stroke care focuses on **secondary prevention** and **rehabilitation** to reduce recurrence and improve function. Core elements include **antiplatelet therapy** (aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin/dipyridamole) for non-cardioembolic stroke [^113bmhte], **high-intensity statins** for LDL-C lowering [^112tLLMa], and strict blood pressure control to < 130/80 mmHg [^114VeeqR]. Outpatient rehabilitation (PT, OT, speech) improves function and quality of life [^114yKdVB], and structured programs enhance adherence and outcomes [^1116U2iB]. Early follow-up within 1–3 weeks [^116QephJ] and multidisciplinary care are essential to close gaps in prevention and recovery [^116X9WaL].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Antiplatelet therapy

For non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, **antiplatelet therapy** is recommended [^112kBnsM] to reduce recurrence [^113bmhte]. Options include aspirin 50–325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, or aspirin 25 mg plus extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily [^113bmhte]. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is reserved for select high-risk scenarios (e.g. minor stroke or high-risk TIA) and is generally limited to 21–30 days to balance bleeding risk [^115HotE9].

---

### Anticoagulation

For cardioembolic stroke (e.g. atrial fibrillation), **oral anticoagulation** (warfarin or DOACs) is indicated to reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

### Lipid management

High-intensity statins (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) are recommended [^112tLLMa] to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL when tolerated [^notfound]. Moderate-intensity statins are alternatives if high-intensity therapy is not tolerated [^1168ZqDy].

---

### Blood pressure control

A target of **< 130/80 mmHg** is recommended for most patients with ischemic stroke or TIA to reduce recurrence and vascular events [^114VeeqR] [^112o8DL1]. Individualize regimens based on comorbidities, tolerance, and patient preference [^111PNa8b].

---

### Diabetes management

Optimize **glycemic control** with individualized HbA1c targets, typically < 7.0% for most nonpregnant adults, balancing hypoglycemia risk [^notfound].

---

## Rehabilitation therapies

Outpatient rehabilitation is integral to recovery and includes:

- **Physical therapy**: Improves mobility, strength, and balance [^notfound].
- **Occupational therapy**: Enhances daily living skills and independence [^notfound].
- **Speech-language pathology**: Addresses aphasia, dysarthria, and dysphagia [^notfound].
- **Multidisciplinary programs**: Structured, coordinated care improves adherence and outcomes [^1132MqBw].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle counseling is essential and includes:

- **Diet**: Emphasize Mediterranean or DASH patterns; limit sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars [^notfound].
- **Exercise**: Encourage ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus resistance training when feasible [^notfound].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended with behavioral support and pharmacotherapy [^notfound].
- **Alcohol moderation**: Limit to ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men) [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is critical to track risk factors, adherence, and recovery. Early outpatient visits within **1–3 weeks** post-discharge are recommended to address gaps and reduce readmissions [^116QephJ]. Multidisciplinary teams (neurology, primary care, nursing, pharmacy, rehabilitation) coordinate care and optimize outcomes [^116X9WaL].

---

## Patient education and support

Education on medication adherence, symptom recognition, and lifestyle change is essential; **structured education and self-management programs** improve outcomes [^113Zt8oy]. Support groups and counseling address psychosocial needs and enhance quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Barriers and challenges

Despite benefits, outpatient stroke care faces barriers, including limited access to rehabilitation, socioeconomic disparities, and adherence challenges. System-level interventions are needed to improve access and equity [^1159BUtD].

---

Outpatient stroke care centers on **secondary prevention** and **rehabilitation**, with evidence-based pharmacotherapy, lifestyle change, and coordinated follow-up to reduce recurrence and improve function.

Key Points

Question

Does the risk of subsequent stroke differ by care setting among patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 226 683 unique patients in 71 unique studies, patients cared for in a TIA clinic vs as inpatients had similar risks of subsequent stroke. Patients who were treated in emergency departments without further follow-up had a higher risk of subsequent stroke than those treated as inpatients or in TIA clinics.

Meaning

In this study, the risk of subsequent stroke among patients who received treatment in a TIA clinic was not higher than those who were hospitalized.

### Trends in outpatient treatment for depression in survivors of stroke in the United States, 2004–2017 [^111TDiut]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Depression is highly prevalent and persistent among survivors of stroke. It is unknown how treatment for depression among survivors of stroke has changed in the evolving context of stroke care and mental health care in the general US population, especially among vulnerable sociodemographic subgroups who bear higher risks for stroke and unfavorable poststroke outcomes and experience disparities in access to and quality of stroke and mental health care. The study examined temporal trends in outpatient treatment for depression among survivors of stroke in the United States between 2004 and 2017.

Methods

The study sample consisted of 10,243 adult survivors of stroke and 264,645 adults without stroke drawn from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey in the United States. Trends in outpatient treatment for depression and potential unmet needs in the stroke population, including variations across sociodemographic subgroups, were examined and compared with the nonstroke population.

Results

The rate of receipt of outpatient treatment for depression among survivors of stroke was 17.7% in 2004–2005 and 16.0% in 2016–2017 (adjusted odds ratio for period change [aOR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.71–1.15). Older, male, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic survivors of stroke were less likely to receive treatment for depression. Approximately two-thirds of survivors of stroke who screened positive for depression received no outpatient treatment during a calendar year. The sociodemographic disparities and treatment gap persisted during the study period, which differed from the nonstroke population. Among survivors of stroke who received any treatment for depression, there was a remarkable increase in use of psychotherapy (aOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.28–4.01), despite its less frequent use compared with pharmacotherapy.

Discussion

Although depression is common after stroke, the majority of survivors of stroke receive no treatment for depression. This gap has remained largely unchanged over past decades, with substantial sociodemographic differences. Efforts are needed to improve depression care for survivors of stroke and reduce disparities.

### Recent advances in management of transient ischaemic attacks and minor ischaemic strokes [^111LNK49]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The risk of recurrent stroke during the first few days after a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke is much higher than previously estimated. However, there is substantial variation worldwide in how patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke are investigated and treated in the acute phase: some health-care systems provide immediate emergency inpatient care and others provide non-emergency outpatient clinical assessment. This review considers what is known about the early prognosis after transient ischaemic attack and minor ischaemic stroke, what factors identify individuals at particularly high early risk of stroke, and what evidence there is that urgent preventive treatment is likely to be effective in reducing the early risk of stroke.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116e9uEZ]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Outpatient rehabilitation therapy requirements — certification and review cycle are that outpatient therapies require patients to travel to hospital-based or free-standing facilities, all outpatient OT, PT, and SLT services must be certified by a physician who establishes a planned set of therapy services, these therapies must be complex enough to be performed only by a qualified healthcare professional, and treatment plans need to be reviewed and recertified every 30 days.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology council on stroke [^112oByMv]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

It is evident that the events leading to a stroke develop over many years, even decades, before the patient is admitted acutely to a stroke care facility as the stroke risk factors silently build the cardiovascular pathology which will eventually cause the stroke. These cardiovascular risk factors are chronic conditions that persist in the stroke survivor, alter recovery, and increase the risk of recurrence. Moreover, the stroke patient is usually elderly and often has associated disabilities and comorbidities that complicate the successful re-integration into the community, and is one of the most complicated medical paths that a person may have to walk through (Figure 4). Stroke is one of the most typical examples of a medical condition which extends horizontally beyond and across the boundaries of the traditional medical specialties and is best served by integrated, collaborative, inclusive, interdisciplinary teamwork.

Figure 4
The Stroke Continuum. Patient care across the Stroke Continuum: from primordial prevention (maintenance of health) to primary prevention (control of stroke risk factors), acute stroke, secondary prevention and tertiary prevention (minimization of stroke impact). Depending on the stage of the Stroke Continuum in which the stroke patient is encountered, the stroke physician may have different roles and responsibilities. For example: stroke physicians who serve at the acute stroke care setting would preferentially have strong expertise in selecting and implementing interventional procedures, offering best supportive treatment to minimize acute complications, and guiding and evaluating the diagnostic workup to plan the most effective treatments to reduce recurrence risk — typically this would involve specialty physicians of internal medicine, neurology, cardiology, critical care, intensive care and others. stroke physicians who serve at the rehabilitation setting would preferentially have strong expertise in rehabilitation and in the management of chronic complications like dysphagia, malnutrition and related metabolic derangements — typically this would involve specialty physicians of physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, internal medicine and others. Stroke physicians who serve at the outpatient clinic and focus mainly on preventing first or recurrent strokes would preferentially have strong expertise in the management of stroke risk factors — typically this would involve specialty physicians of cardiology, neurology, internal medicine, general practitioners and others. Stroke physicians who are engaged with interventional procedures in the hyperacute and acute setting (or else, stroke interventionists) would preferentially have strong expertise in endovascular procedures like interventional neurology, neuroradiology/radiology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and cardiology. Across the Stroke Continuum, there is a need for multi-disciplinary collaboration and coordination of care, including the complex treatment of cardiovascular conditions with the overarching goal to improve recovery, prevent recurrence, and enhance survival and quality of life for the patient with stroke.

### Risk of subsequent stroke among patients receiving outpatient vs inpatient care for transient ischemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113WtYgn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In the sensitivity analyses in which only prospective cohorts recruited after 2000 were included (eFigures 4–7 and eTable 5 in the Supplement), we did not find significant differences in risk among patients treated in the TIA clinics and inpatients at 2 days (0.2% [95% CI, 0–1.0%] vs 0.3% [95% CI, 0–0.8%] among inpatients; P = 0.94, I² < 0.001) (eFigure 4 in the Supplement), 7 days (0.8% [95% CI, 0.2%-1.8%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.3%-1.3%] among inpatients; P = 0.81, I² < 0.001) (eFigure 5 in the Supplement), 30 days (1.3% [95% CI, 0.4%-2.5%] vs 1.3% [0.3%-2.7%] among inpatients; P > .99; I² < 0.001) (eFigure 6 in the Supplement), and 90 days (2.2% [95% CI, 1.5%-3.0%] vs 2.6% [95% CI, 1.9%-3.3%] among inpatients; P = 0.46; I² < 0.001) (eFigure 7 in the Supplement).

### Risk of subsequent stroke among patients receiving outpatient vs inpatient care for transient ischemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pz6FR]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In 15 cohorts (5636 patients; mean [SD] age, 65.7 [3.9] years; 2291 of 4513 [50.8%] men) acute care was delivered in TIA clinics (A. Mowla, MD, unpublished data, 2020). Among the inpatients (33 cohorts; 130 139 patients; mean [SD] age, 78.3 [4.0] years; 49 458 of 128 745 [38.4%] men), 21 cohorts (125 719 patients) received care in medical-surgical units (A. Mowla, MD, unpublished data, 2020), 5 cohorts (2487 patients) in stroke units, and 7 cohorts (1933 patients) in observation units. In 16 cohorts (3605 patients; mean [SD] age, 68.9 [3.9] years; 1596 of 3046 [52.4%] men), the acute care was offered at the ED (A. Mowla, MD, unpublished data, 2020). The setting of care was not fully described or the study included the patients who received treatment in various care settings and multiple centers in 37 cohorts (87 303 patients; mean [SD] age, 70.8 [3.8] years, 43 495 of 87 303 [49.8%] men). Eight studies, (and A. Mowla, MD, unpublished data, 2020) provided the outcome of the patients in both inpatient and TIA clinic cohorts. The risk of subsequent stroke was reported for 35 356 patients within 2 days, 36 134 patients within 7 days, 142 185 patients within 30 days, and 94 731 patients within 90 days.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116X9WaL]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Health systems–based interventions for secondary stroke prevention — recommendations include that in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), voluntary hospital-based or outpatient-focused quality monitoring and improvement programs are recommended to improve short-term and long-term adherence to nationally accepted, evidence-based guidelines for secondary stroke prevention. In patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, a multidisciplinary outpatient team-based approach (ie, care provision with active medication adjustment from advanced practice providers, nurses, or pharmacists) can be effective to control BP, lipids, and other vascular risk factors. In patients presenting to their primary care provider as the first contact after TIA or minor stroke, it is reasonable to use a decision support tool that improves diagnostic accuracy, stratifies patients in risk categories to support appropriate triage, and prompts the initiation of medications and counseling for lifestyle modification for secondary stroke prevention to reduce the 90-day risk of recurrent stroke or TIA.

Comparing the subsequent stroke risk estimates in the cohort of patients treated in the TIA clinics vs inpatient settings did not reveal a significant difference in any of the 4 evaluation intervals (eTable 5 in the Supplement). In comparison with patients referred to TIA clinics and hospitalized patients, those who received care in the ED had a significantly higher risk of subsequent stroke at 2 and 7 days (for inpatients) and 2, 7, and 90 days (for patients referred to TIA clinics) (eTable 5 in the Supplement).

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcome of 226 683 patients who experienced a transient ischemic stroke or minor stroke suggest the risk of subsequent stroke among patients who were evaluated in a TIA clinic was not higher than that among those hospitalized. Patients who were treated in EDs without further follow-up had a higher risk of subsequent stroke.

### Applying the evidence: do patients with stroke, coronary artery disease, or both achieve similar treatment goals? [^115wuCiK]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The importance of early and aggressive initiation of secondary prevention strategies for patients with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is emphasized by multiple guidelines. However, limited information is available on cardiovascular protection and stroke prevention in an outpatient setting from community-based populations. We sought to evaluate and compare differences in treatment patterns and the attainment of current guideline-recommended targets in unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with CAD, CVD, or both.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, cohort study was conducted from December 2001 to December 2004 among ambulatory patients in a primary care setting. The prospective Vascular Protection and Guidelines-Oriented Approach to Lipid-Lowering Registries recruited 4933 outpatients with established CAD, CVD, or both. All patients had a complete fasting lipid profile measured within 6 months before enrollment. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mm Hg (or < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L (< 97 mg/dL) according to the Canadian guidelines in place at that time (similar to the National Cholesterol Education Program's value of 100 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes include use of antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid-modifying therapies.

Results

Of the 4933 patients, 3817 (77%) had CAD only; 647 (13%) had CVD only; and 469 (10%) had both CAD and CVD. Mean ± SD age was 67 ± 10 years, and 3466 (71%) were male. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs were 130 ± 16 and 75 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively. Minor but significant differences were observed on baseline BP, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol measurements among the 3 groups. Overall, 83% of patients were taking a statin and 93% were receiving antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents). Compared with patients with CAD, those with CVD only were less likely to achieve the recommended BP (45.3% vs 57.3%, respectively; P < 0.001) and lipid (19.4% vs 30.5%, respectively; P < 0.001) targets. Among patients with CVD only, women were less likely to achieve the recommended BP and lipid targets compared with their male counterparts (for LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L, 18.7% vs 23.8%, respectively; P = 0.048). In multivariable analysis, patients with CVD alone were less likely to achieve treatment success (BP or lipid targets) after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and use of pharmacologic therapy.

Conclusions

Despite the proven benefits of available antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies, current management of hypertension and dyslipidemia continues to be suboptimal. A considerable proportion of patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended targets, and this apparent treatment gap was more pronounced among patients with CVD and women. Quality improvement strategies should target these patient subgroups.

### Trends in outpatient rehabilitation use for stroke survivors [^116wKARZ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke survivors with residual disabling deficits who are medically stable may be recommended for acute rehabilitation or outpatient therapy, depending partly on the severity of their deficits. Here we sought to determine if the location at which patients needing rehabilitation post-stroke has shifted from inpatient to an outpatient setting.

Methods

For analysis, we used our Institutional Review Board-approved Get With The Guidelines®-Stroke Database to study stroke survivors discharged to receive either inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation services between 2014 and 2019. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical factors associated with discharge type. Cochran-Armitage trend analysis was used to assess differences in rehabilitation services used over time.

Results

A total of 3293 patients were included. Trend analysis demonstrated a significant increase over time in the proportion of patients needing rehabilitation being discharged home with rehabilitation services (P < 0.0001). In addition, older age was associated with discharge to inpatient rehabilitation (OR = 1.018, 95%CI, 1.011–1.026), as was a higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR = 1.149, 95%CI, 1.130–1.168).

Conclusions

We found that home discharges increased, highlighting outpatient rehabilitation as an expanding healthcare resource for reducing stroke-associated disability in adults.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116QephJ]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Poststroke ambulatory follow-up — The first poststroke visit should occur soon after discharge from the acute care or rehabilitation hospital, in general, within 1 to 3 weeks. An early visit may reduce readmission and address inadvertent gaps in care that may exacerbate the high risk for stroke recurrence that marks the first 3 months after hospital discharge, yet the current average interval to first medical visit for patients discharged home after stroke is 27 days.

### Specialized outpatient clinic vs stroke unit for TIA and minor stroke: a cohort study [^115DW6Qu]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with minor stroke/TIA are at high risk of a recurrent ischemic event, but landmark studies show a dramatic effect of immediate hospital referral. It has long been known that patients in an organized inpatient stroke unit fare better than those in a general ward, and it is feasible and cost-effective to handle most minor strokes and TIAs in specialized acute outpatient clinics. However, we do not know how acute outpatient specialist care compares with in-hospital stroke unit care. It is debated how to most efficiently organize services for patients with minor stroke/TIA, and use of hospitalization seems widespread. Hospitalization confers theoretical benefits over urgent outpatient clinic referral including monitoring of the patients and rapid access to revascularization, but these benefits are offset by potential drawbacks of hospitalization together with potential overuse of hospital resources. The risk of a recurrent stroke remains the main concern of outpatient treatment and an innovative approach may be a hybrid that combines benefits from both strategies.

In 2012, an acute outpatient clinic for patients with suspected minor stroke/TIA opened at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, following centralization of acute stroke care services. In the clinic, a specialized neurovascular team performs a complete diagnostic workup and treatment the same day the patient is referred and assesses the risk of patients with stroke/TIA to identify those at high risk of a recurrent stroke and hence eligible for admission to a regular stroke ward.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114VeeqR]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Hypertension after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack — an office BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended for most patients to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and vascular events. Neurologically stable patients with cerebrovascular disease also benefit from a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend a lower limit of BP within the normal range for patients with prior stroke. These recommendations pertain to outpatient management of neurologically stable patients. In patients with no history of hypertension who experience a stroke or TIA and have an average office BP of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, antihypertensive medication treatment can be beneficial to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, ICH, and other vascular events. The PAR of stroke resulting from hypertension may be as high as 50% in some racial and ethnic groups.

### Management of transient ischemia attacks in the twenty-first century [^114Q1jLD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Patients who have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) represent a group that may appear well but are at high risk for stroke within 90 days. Management of patients who have a TIA requires an understanding of the short-term risk for stroke to guide acute management and the long-term benefits to medical and surgical therapies. The initial emergency department (ED) evaluation may be supplemented with simple TIA stroke risk scores to estimate short-term stroke risk. The addition of MRI provides yet more information regarding stroke risks, while identifying some specific causes of TIA. Extended testing may not be feasible in the ED, and to address this limitation, new outpatient strategies for patients who have a TIA have been developed, such as the use of an ED observation unit or an outpatient TIA clinic. Although controversy remains in some areas of acute TIA management because of the lack of evidence from controlled trials, evidence from large randomized trials have led to a better understanding of effective measures for the long-term prevention of stroke.

### Risk of subsequent stroke among patients receiving outpatient vs inpatient care for transient ischemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HefZK]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Studies have shown up to an 80% reduction in the risk of stroke after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) with early implementation of secondary stroke prevention strategies. Our studyexamining the trends in TIA outcome during the past 5 decades indicated that the risk of subsequent stroke has remained unchanged since 1999.

Despite the need for an urgent investigation of the etiology and initiation of preventive measures for patients with TIA, there is no consensus on the care pathway protocol. The evaluation and hospitalization rates after TIA vary widely among practitioners, hospitals, and regions. Several TIA care pathway models have been proposed mainly to reduce the hospital length of stay and admission costs and to improve outcomes. Several studies have indicated that the outpatient management of TIA among selected patients can be safe and cost-effective. Nevertheless, in many instances outpatient care for selected patients with TIA is avoided.

There is no comprehensive study comparing the outcome of patients with TIA who received care in different settings. The goal of the current meta-analysis was to estimate and compare the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke among patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke (mIS) who received care at rapid access TIA or neurology clinics, inpatient units, emergency departments (EDs), and unspecified or multiple settings within 4 evaluation intervals (2, 7, 30, and 90 days).

### Quality of hospital and outpatient care after stroke or transient ischemic attack: insights from a stroke survey in the Netherlands [^112y9bo2]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Limited data are available on management of outpatients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and on clinicians' reasons for withholding procedures recommended by guidelines. We assessed to what extent guidelines are appropriately applied after ischemic stroke or TIA, in admitted patients as well as outpatients.

Methods

A survey was conducted in 11 centers in the Netherlands, which prospectively enrolled 579 admitted patients and 393 outpatients. Data were collected by trained research assistants. Duplicate assessment in 10% of patients showed good agreement with neurologists (median kappa = 0.86). Treating neurologists were asked to provide arguments for withholding recommended procedures in eligible patients.

Results

Recommended acute procedures were provided in the majority of admitted patients, but less often in outpatients: brain imaging (98% and 93%, respectively), 12-lead ECG (96% and 81%), laboratory tests (97% and 86%), aspirin within 48 hours (90% and 68% of eligible patients). Secondary preventive measures were not always taken in both eligible inpatients and eligible outpatients: carotid endarterectomy (provided in 31% and 30% of patients), antiplatelet agents (93% and 90%), oral anticoagulants (60% and 48%), antihypertensive agents (57% and 44%), and cholesterol-lowering therapy (71% and 52%). Reasons for withholding recommended procedures were plausible for almost all admitted patients, but were unclear in the majority of outpatients.

Conclusions

Compared with other national stroke surveys, we found high-quality acute care in admitted ischemic stroke patients, whereas secondary prevention was comparably poor. Although the majority of our centers have rapid-access TIA clinics, there is still substantial potential to improve quality of stroke care in outpatients.

### Risk of subsequent stroke among patients receiving outpatient vs inpatient care for transient ischemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157CCQX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) often indicates a high risk of subsequent cerebral ischemic events. Timely preventive measures improve the outcome.

Objective

To estimate and compare the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke among patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke (mIS) by care setting.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Trip Medical Database, CINAHL, and all Evidence-Based Medicine review series were searched from the inception of each database until October 1, 2020.

Study Selection

Studies evaluating the occurrence of ischemic stroke after TIA or mIS were included. Cohorts without data on evaluation time for reporting subsequent stroke, with retrospective diagnosis of the index event after stroke occurrence, and with a report of outcomes that were not limited to patients with TIA or mIS were excluded. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and provided the list of candidate studies for full-text review; discrepancies and disagreements in all steps of the review were addressed by input from a third reviewer.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The study was prepared and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses, Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews, and Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research guidelines. The Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool was used for critical appraisal of cohorts, and funnel plots, Begg-Mazumdar rank correlation, Kendall τ², and the Egger bias test were used for evaluating the publication bias. All meta-analyses were conducted under random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Risk of subsequent ischemic stroke among patients with TIA or mIS who received care at rapid-access TIA or neurology clinics, inpatient units, emergency departments (EDs), and unspecified or multiple settings within 4 evaluation intervals (ie, 2, 7, 30, and 90 days).

Results

The analysis included 226 683 patients from 71 articles recruited between 1981 and 2018; 5636 patients received care at TIA clinics (mean [SD] age, 65.7 [3.9] years; 2291 of 4513 [50.8%] men), 130 139 as inpatients (mean [SD] age, 78.3 [4.0] years; 49 458 of 128 745 [38.4%] men), 3605 at EDs (mean [SD] age, 68.9 [3.9] years; 1596 of 3046 [52.4%] men), and 87 303 patients received care in an unspecified setting (mean [SD] age, 70.8 [3.8] years, 43 495 of 87 303 [49.8%] men). Among the patients who were treated at a TIA clinic, the risk of subsequent stroke following a TIA or mIS was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-1.2%) within 2 days, 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-2.0%) within 7 days, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.4%-2.6%) within 30 days, and 2.1% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.8%) within 90 days. Among the patients who were treated as inpatients, the risk of subsequent stroke was to 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.1%) within 2 days, 1.2% (95% CI, 0.4%-2.2%) within 7 days, 1.6% (95% CI, 0.6%-3.1%) within 30 days, and 2.8% (95% CI, 2.1%-3.5%) within 90 days. The risk of stroke among patients treated at TIA clinics was not significantly different from those hospitalized. Compared with the inpatient cohort, TIA clinic patients were younger and had had lower ABCD2 (age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of TIA, diabetes) scores (inpatients with ABCD2 score > 3, 1101 of 1806 [61.0%]; TIA clinic patients with ABCD2 score > 3, 1933 of 3703 [52.2%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the risk of subsequent stroke among patients who were evaluated in a TIA clinic was not higher than those hospitalized. Patients who received treatment in EDs without further follow-up had a higher risk of subsequent stroke. These findings suggest that TIA clinics can be an effective component of the TIA care component pathway.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^116GfELx]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation — epidemiology, burden, and timing in Veterans and active duty: Approximately 30% (1 out of 3) of ischemic strokes are cryptogenic and 40% of ischemic strokes in young adults are cryptogenic. Each year, around 6,000 Veterans are admitted to VA facilities because of stroke with approximately 60,000 stroke-related outpatient visits, and the VA allocates more than $250 million annually for management. Veterans with a history of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) face an elevated risk of stroke compared with their counterparts without a history of TBI. Functional outcomes assume a paramount role within the active duty military demographic and highlight the critical need for effective rehabilitative treatment. Acute medical or surgical stroke management interventions help reduce the severity of disability, decrease the risk of further complications, and lessen potentially lifelong deficits, and rehabilitative efforts commensurate with the degree of injury and status of the patient should start as soon as they are clinically feasible.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115HotE9]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Establish the foundation for care at the first poststroke visit — Carotid imaging, when indicated, is usually deferred until after discharge; approximately 10% of ischemic stroke events are related to carotid stenosis, and prolonged (eg, ≥ 30 days) rhythm monitoring will detect occult atrial fibrillation in ≈9% of patients. Because some cause-specific treatments are time sensitive, carotid revascularization, if indicated, should be performed within 2 weeks for most patients, and primary care clinicians should examine whether any part of the evaluation of cause was deferred to the outpatient setting. Dual antiplatelet therapy is initiated in the hospital and can reduce early recurrence by 25% but should be discontinued for many patients after 21 to 30 days to reduce bleeding risk; based on nonrandomized evidence, patients with stroke related to 70% to 99% intracranial stenosis may benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy extended up to 90 days, and patients are eligible for dual antiplatelet therapy if they have had a minor acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack within the prior 12 to 24 hours and are not candidates for thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, endarterectomy, or anticoagulation.

### Physicians' preferences and expectations in stroke rehabilitation – results of a case-based questionnaire survey [^115K5yPa]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Analysis of medical decisions in the differential allocation of stroke rehabilitation programmes.

Method

Medical specialists routinely involved in the treatment and rehabilitation of stroke patients from acute hospitals, rehabilitation centres, and the Medical Services of the Workers' Pension Funds of Sachsen-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern were included in a systematic survey, in which they had to give their opinions on the individually optimal rehabilitation setting and therapies and probable outcome on the basis of case vignettes. These specialists are crucial for decision-making in rehabilitation resource allocation.

Results

Both allocation and prognosis did not depend only on patient but also on physician characteristics. Neurologists tended to prefer outpatient rehabilitation and expected a greater effect of rehabilitation upon ADL-function than specialists from other professions. Preferred rehabilitation setting did not influence the physicians' subjective prognosis. For patients who qualified both for in- and outpatient rehabilitation, the two settings, therapeutic potentials were considered to be equivalent.

Conclusions

Differences in setting and treatment preferences between experts concerning optimal treatment cannot be resolved on the basis of available evidence. Further data are required that allow to decide which type of rehabilitation is best suited for a given patient.

### Risk of subsequent stroke among patients receiving outpatient vs inpatient care for transient ischemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139sjXk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Comparing the risk of subsequent stroke at 2, 7, 30, and 90 days after a TIA or mIS suggested that offering rapid management at TIA clinics is not inferior to inpatient care models. Among the identified cohort, patients who received care at TIA clinics were younger, had a higher rate of carotid stenosis, but a lower ABCD 2 score.

Our results also suggest an increased risk of subsequent stroke in patients who were treated and discharged from ED without assigned follow-up care. Previous studies have reported that patients with TIA who were discharged from ED were less likely to receive guideline-concordant care and underwent fewer timely brain and carotid imaging, monitoring for arrhythmia, and administration of preventive medications such as antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering agents. The risk of recurrence can be stratified by the clinical scales (such as ABCD 2) and risk factor profiles; however, many practitioners, especially in community hospitals, rely on a one-size-fits-all approach.

However, there is growing evidence that suggests TIA clinics can be considered an alternative to hospitalization. Despite the very different structures of risk stratification and patient selection, referral patterns, and diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in these TIA clinic models, the risk of cerebral ischemia in patients treated at a TIA clinic did not exceed those treated in an inpatient setting.,

Many practice guidelines also endorse outpatient TIA management and recommend hospitalization of high-risk patients. The American Heart/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelinerecommends an urgent evaluation and hospitalization of TIA patients if they present within 72 hours and have an ABCD 2 score of 3 or greater. The Australian National Stroke Foundation includes a set of high-risk indicators beside the ABCD 2 scoring into the triaging criteria. This guideline recommends urgent and comprehensive management of TIA by use of a local TIA pathway covering primary care, emergency, and stroke specialist teams within locally available resources. The United Kingdom national guidelineand Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendationsconsider the time elapsed from symptoms onset and risk of early recurrence. The United Kingdom guideline recognizes outpatient clinics to provide care for TIA patients. The Canadian guideline also states that while high-risk patients should be seen within 24 hours, providing care for other patients can be slightly delayed based on their risk scoring.

### Changes in inpatient and outpatient stroke admissions during COVID-19: a difference-in-differences analysis based on claims data from 242 acute care hospitals in Japan [^1161ogaT]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

From the early phases of the COVID‐19 pandemic, there has been a relatively high prevalence of stroke events, mainly among patients with severe COVID‐19 but also among mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. However, many previous studies have reported a decrease in the number of stroke hospitalisations worldwide during the pandemic, regardless of COVID-19 with or without complications. This is thought to be due to patients with a mild stroke avoiding medical facilities for fear of COVID-19 infection, limitations on hospital admissions due to the burden of COVID-19 care or public lifestyle changes such as staying home and performing preventive measures against infectious diseases. However, stroke symptoms are life-threatening for patients, and whether they completely avoided medical care is questionable. Thus, some patients with a stroke who could not be admitted as inpatients might have been only seen in outpatient settings.

Most previous studies on the number of patients with a stroke during the COVID-19 period have focused on inpatient cases. While regional differences exist, it has been shown that the number of inpatient stroke cases has decreased. However, less is known about changes in stroke treatment outpatient settings. Moreover, many previous studies have focused solely on ischaemic stroke or examined overall stroke numbers, that is, combined ischaemic stroke with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Since each disease has different pathophysiology, they should be studied separately. Additionally, many of the methods used in previous studies were based on simple pre-post COVID comparisons, which did not take into account background temporal trends.

Therefore, this study sought to examine the change in the number of stroke patient admissions in both inpatient and outpatient settings during COVID-19, using a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis approach based on data from 242 acute care hospitals in Japan. Besides admissions, we examined the in-hospital mortality rate, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge, rates of thrombolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) implementation and length of hospital stay.

### Specialized outpatient clinic vs stroke unit for TIA and minor stroke: a cohort study [^111r4k9i]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, the investigated acute outpatient clinic setup for minor stroke and TIA was a hybrid model where specialized neurovascular clinicians diagnosed and assessed the risk of recurrent vascular events to support triage for subsequent admission to the stroke ward. The model was beneficial in terms of reduced length of hospital stay, higher quality of stroke care, and reduced 30-day readmission rates compared to historic and contemporary controls. The triage appears safe with a low rate of recurrent vascular events within the first week after returning home. The study was limited by the nonrandomized design as differences among the study cohorts could affect the comparisons.

### Effect of urgent treatment of transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke on early recurrent stroke (EXPRESS study): a prospective population-based sequential comparison [^111NUmto]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

The risk of recurrent stroke is up to 10% in the week after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. Modelling studies suggest that urgent use of existing preventive treatments could reduce the risk by 80–90%, but in the absence of evidence many health-care systems make little provision. Our aim was to determine the effect of more rapid treatment after TIA and minor stroke in patients who are not admitted direct to hospital.

Methods

We did a prospective before (phase 1: April 1, 2002, to Sept 30, 2004) versus after (phase 2: Oct 1, 2004, to March 31, 2007) study of the effect on process of care and outcome of more urgent assessment and immediate treatment in clinic, rather than subsequent initiation in primary care, in all patients with TIA or minor stroke not admitted direct to hospital. The study was nested within a rigorous population-based incidence study of all TIA and stroke (Oxford Vascular Study; OXVASC), such that case ascertainment, investigation, and follow-up were complete and identical in both periods. The primary outcome was the risk of stroke within 90 days of first seeking medical attention, with independent blinded (to study period) audit of all events.

Findings

Of the 1278 patients in OXVASC who presented with TIA or stroke (634 in phase 1 and 644 in phase 2), 607 were referred or presented direct to hospital, 620 were referred for outpatient assessment, and 51 were not referred to secondary care. 95% (n = 591) of all outpatient referrals were to the study clinic. Baseline characteristics and delays in seeking medical attention were similar in both periods, but median delay to assessment in the study clinic fell from 3 (IQR 2–5) days in phase 1 to less than 1 (0–3) day in phase 2 (p < 0.0001), and median delay to first prescription of treatment fell from 20 (8–53) days to 1 (0–3) day (p < 0.0001). The 90-day risk of recurrent stroke in the patients referred to the study clinic was 10.3% (32/310 patients) in phase 1 and 2.1% (6/281 patients) in phase 2 (adjusted hazard ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.08–0.49; p = 0.0001); there was no significant change in risk in patients treated elsewhere. The reduction in risk was independent of age and sex, and early treatment did not increase the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage or other bleeding.

Interpretation

Early initiation of existing treatments after TIA or minor stroke was associated with an 80% reduction in the risk of early recurrent stroke. Further follow-up is required to determine long-term outcome, but these results have immediate implications for service provision and public education about TIA and minor stroke.

### Treatment of acute ischemic stroke [^117E6hPN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of adult disability. The direct and indirect costs of stroke care exceed $51 billion annually. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first treatment for acute ischemic stroke, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Later that year, the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (a branch of the National Institutes of Health) convened a consensus conference on the Rapid Identification and Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke, setting goals for stroke care in the United States. Since then, it has become imperative that emergency physicians understand the pathophysiology of stroke, the basis and rationale for treatment, and the therapeutic approaches. This article reviews the state of the art of acute stroke treatment, its foundation, as well as its future.

### Nonpharmacological treatments for hospitalized patients with stroke: a nuanced approach to prescribing early activity [^117QC7xM]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke remains a leading cause of adult disability. To date, hyperacute revascularization procedures reach 5–10% of stroke patients even in high resource health systems. There is a limited time window for brain repair after stroke, and therefore, the activities such as prescribed exercise in the earliest period will likely have long-term significant consequences. Clinicians who provide care for hospitalized stroke patients make treatment decisions specific to activity often without guidelines to direct these prescriptions. This requires a balanced understanding of the available evidence for early post-stroke exercise and physiological principles after stroke that drive the safety of prescribed exercise. Here, we provide a summary of these relevant concepts, identify gaps, and recommend an approach to prescribing safe and meaningful activity for all patients with stroke. The population of thrombectomy-eligible stroke patients can be used as the exemplar for conceptualization.

### Rehabilitation therapy services for stroke patients living at home: systematic review of randomised trials [^114yKdVB]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Stroke-unit care can be valuable for stroke patients in hospital, but effectiveness of outpatient care is less certain. We aimed to assess the effects of therapy-based rehabilitation services targeted at stroke patients resident in the community within 1 year of stroke onset or discharge from hospital.

Methods

We did a systematic review of randomised trials of outpatient services, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and multidisciplinary teams. We used Cochrane collaboration methodology.

Findings

We identified a heterogeneous group of 14 trials (1617 patients). Therapy-based rehabilitation services for stroke patients living at home reduced the odds of deteriorating in personal activities of daily living (odds ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.57–0.92], p = 0.009) and increased ability of patients to do personal activities of daily living (standardised mean difference 0.14 [95% CI 0.02–0.25], p = 0.02). For every 100 stroke patients resident in the community receiving therapy-based rehabilitation services, seven (95% CI 2–11) would not deteriorate.

Interpretation

Therapy-based rehabilitation services targeted at selected patients resident in the community after stroke improve ability to undertake personal activities of daily living and reduce risk of deterioration in ability. These findings should be considered in future service planning.

The management of the acute ischemic stroke patient spans the time course from the emergency evaluation and treatment period through to the eventual discharge planning phase of stroke care. In this article we evaluate the literature and describe what have become standard treatments in the care of the stroke patient. We will review the literature that supports the use of a dedicated stroke unit for routine stroke care which has demonstrated reduced rates of morbidity and mortality. Also reviewed is the use of glycemic control in the initial setting along with data supporting the use of prophylactic treatments options in order to aide in the prevention of life threatening medical complications. In addition, lifesaving treatments will be discussed in light of new literature demonstrating reduced mortality in large hemispheric stroke patients undergoing surgical decompressive surgery. Both medical and surgical treatment options are discussed and compared.

### Specialized outpatient clinic vs stroke unit for TIA and minor stroke: a cohort study [^113skwpR]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

We were not able to calculate a reliable rate of recurrent stroke in the hospitalized patients of the study cohort or in the reference cohorts as new events in the early phase are not registered in the DSR and we did not perform a 7-day follow-up.

The significantly higher fulfillment of process performance measures in patients with minor stroke and TIA from the outpatient clinic cohort within a defined time frame was surprising. Although the exact driver of this remains unknown, we speculate that it may stem from the standardized setup with rapid asses to MRI, ultrasound, and specialist evaluation.

Considering all of the patients with a final diagnosis of stroke and TIA from the entire stroke center at Aarhus University Hospital, approximately 16% of the patients with stroke and 34% of the patients with TIA went to the outpatient clinic in the study period (based on reported patients in 2014 to DSR), but we were unable to investigate whether, according to the local instruction, more patients were eligible for the outpatient clinic. However, this is likely to have reduced costs per patient as shorter acute hospital stays for patients with stroke reduce hospital costs overall, and the outpatient setup is probably also more cost effective. Furthermore, the reduction in the rate of readmissions is likely to contribute further to cost reduction. Nevertheless, to make final conclusions on the financial implications, a formal economic evaluation is needed.

Centralization of stroke services resulting in shorter hospital stays is associated with high levels of patient and relative satisfaction and we speculate that this outpatient setup similarly led to increased satisfaction among patients and relatives.

All patients with suspected acute minor stroke and TIA were referred directly to the outpatient clinic for diagnostic workup from emergency medical services and general practitioners. A considerable number were given a non-neurovascular diagnosis (≈53%). A high rate of minor stroke and TIA misdiagnosis (≈60%) has been documented in nonspecialized settings. The result of this is that patients forgo the benefits of timely evaluation and early treatment initiation or are treated unnecessarily. Direct referral saves many people from the debilitating effects of misdiagnosis.

An MRI scan of the brain was standard in the diagnostic workup and could have contributed to the high rate of non-neurovascular diagnoses, as MRI is more sensitive to acute smaller ischemic lesions than a CT scanand helpful in rejecting a stroke/TIA suspicion.

### Feasibility, safety and cost of outpatient management of acute minor ischaemic stroke: a population-based study [^113bHCmN]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Outpatient management safely and effectively prevents early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack (TIA), but this approach may not be safe in patients with acute minor stroke.

Objective

To study outcomes of clinic and hospital-referred patients with TIA or minor stroke (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score ≤ 3) in a prospective, population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study).

Results

Of 845 patients with TIA/stroke, 587 (69%) were referred directly to outpatient clinics and 258 (31%) directly to inpatient services. Of the 250 clinic-referred minor strokes (mean age 72.7 years), 237 (95%) were investigated, treated and discharged on the same day, of whom 16 (6.8%) were subsequently admitted to hospital within 30 days for recurrent stroke (n = 6), sepsis (n = 3), falls (n = 3), bleeding (n = 2), angina (n = 1) and nursing care (n = 1). The 150 patients (mean age 74.8 years) with minor stroke referred directly to hospital (median length-of-stay 9 days) had a similar 30-day readmission rate (9/150; 6.3%; p = 0.83) after initial discharge and a similar 30-day risk of recurrent stroke (9/237 in clinic patients vs 8/150, OR = 0.70, 0.27–1.80, p = 0.61). Rates of prescription of secondary prevention medication after initial clinic/hospital discharge were higher in clinic-referred than in hospital-referred patients for antiplatelets/anticoagulants (p < 0.05) and lipid-lowering agents (p < 0.001) and were maintained at 1-year follow-up. The mean (SD) secondary care cost was £8323 (13 133) for hospital-referred minor stroke versus £743 (1794) for clinic-referred cases.

Conclusion

Outpatient management of clinic-referred minor stroke is feasible and may be as safe as inpatient care. Rates of early hospital admission and recurrent stroke were low and uptake and maintenance of secondary prevention was high.

Although estimates of stroke outpatient rehab referral might be high, participation in stroke outpatient rehab remains suboptimal. Barriers to participation in stroke outpatient rehab are evident (,–), but focused attention on system-level interventions that ensure participation is needed, especially among populations with lower levels of participation. Interventions that might improve outpatient rehab participation include increasing coverage for outpatient rehab services by health insurers, reducing copayments, extending rehab clinic hours to improve access availability, and implementing standardized assessments by health care professionals to guide appropriate referrals to outpatient rehab at hospital discharge. Stroke survivors should be educated about stroke outpatient rehab opportunities possibly available in their community that reduce barriers related to transportation and time (e.g. telehealth, mobileHealth, and home-based care) (,–).

Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States. Approximately 800,000 American adults experience a stroke each year. Currently, approximately 6 million stroke survivors live in the United States. Participation in stroke rehabilitation (rehab), which occurs in diverse settings (i.e. in-hospital, postacute care, and outpatient settings), has been determined to reduce stroke recurrence and improve functional outcomes and quality of life. Despite longstanding national guidelines recommending stroke rehab, it remains underutilized, especially in the outpatient setting. Professional associations and evidence-based guidelines support the increasing stroke rehab use in health systems and are promoted by the public health community. An analysis of 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data revealed that 30.7% of stroke survivors reported participation in outpatient rehab for stroke after hospital discharge in 21 states and the District of Columbia (DC). To update these estimates, 2013 and 2015 BRFSS data were analyzed to assess outpatient rehab use among adult stroke survivors. Overall, outpatient rehab use was 31.2% (20 states and DC) in 2013 and 35.5% (four states) in 2015. Disparities were evident by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and level of education.

It highlights variability in inpatient versus outpatient assessments and timing of treatment initiation and states that, compared with outpatient polysomnography (PSG), "home sleep apnea test (HSAT) after acute stroke may be able to reduce time to testing, increase diagnosis and treatment rates and in those offered CPAP, result in greater improvements in sleepiness and recovery outcomes". Certainty was "low due to risk of bias and imprecision", cost for an in-hospital evaluation and management pathway "was judged to vary", and "The intervention was deemed feasible to implement".

### Specialized outpatient clinic vs stroke unit for TIA and minor stroke: a cohort study [^11412sg2]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This prospective cohort study of patients seen in an outpatient clinic for acute minor stroke and TIA using subsequent admission of high-risk patients shows that these patients have a shorter hospital stay, lower rate of readmissions at 30 days, and higher quality of care than patients in matched historic and contemporary cohorts without a similar outpatient service.

Substantially reducing the length of hospital stay may have the untoward consequence of increasing the overall readmission rate, which is a frequently used measure of quality and safety, of care, although there is some controversy as to how readmissions should be interpreted. However, we also observed a lower rate of risk-adjusted readmissions within the first 30 days among patients with stroke in the outpatient clinic cohort. This may be due to overall higher quality of care as evidenced by a decline in the rate of recurrent vascular events and other potential complications. Another driver of this reduction could be the lesser risk of a hospital-acquired infection. Furthermore, almost half of the patients with stroke in the outpatient clinic cohort (without an inpatient course) were offered a 7-day follow-up by telephone, which was not standard in hospitalized stroke cohorts, and this initiative may have prevented readmissions but also limits direct comparisons. Readmission rates among these outpatients (with or without 7-day follow-up) were low and similar, indicating that the effect on the results may have been inconsiderable.

Another potential concern with the shorter length of stay is recurrent neurovascular events at home, the risk of which is highest during the first days. To minimize this problem, we aimed to identify and hospitalize patients at high risk of recurrent episodes and hence extended their length of hospital stay. To qualify the clinical decision to do so, we developed a risk assessment tool using the ABCD2 score combined with imagingand other essential risk factors for recurrent episodes. The ABCD2 score and the later addition of vessel status and brain imaging were originally used to select patients in need of rapid referral to a neurovascular specialist, but here we used the tool to qualify the decision of need for hospitalization. This approach seemed acceptable and safe as the overall rate of recurrent vascular episodes in patients who were treated in the outpatient clinic without admission was low (0.9%), only 0.6% of low-risk patients, and the recurrence rates were lower than previously reported.

If rehabilitation is not needed, discharge patient from rehabilitation and arrange for primary care, neurology, and specialty care follow-up, as needed. After discharge, reassess with "Are functional impairments identified after discharge?" and, if no, "Continue primary care management".

### Outpatient practice patterns after stroke hospitalization among neurologists [^116ynABK]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Care after stroke hospitalization can provide several opportunities to optimize vascular risk reduction. However, not much is known about poststroke practice patterns among neurologists. Such knowledge may help direct specific efforts to improve the impact of practicing neurologists on clinical outcomes after stroke.

Methods

A survey soliciting information on processes of care in the outpatient setting after recent hospitalization for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack was mailed to a random sample of 833 US and Canadian neurologist-members of the American Academy of Neurology.

Results

A total of 475 (57%) responses were received. Practice demographics of survey responders and nonresponders were largely similar. Fourteen percent of respondents identified themselves as vascular neurologists. Overall, respondents reported frequently checking for medication adherence and counseling patients on lifestyle modification. However, neurologists reported screening more frequently for diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia than actually treating these conditions (all P < 0.0001) Vascular neurologists were more likely than general neurologists to screen for hypertension (97% versus 86%, P = 0.016), dyslipidemia (94% versus 68%, P < 0.001), diabetes (89% versus 62%, P < 0.001), and sleep apnea (94% versus 79%, P = 0.007) as well as to treat hypertension (71% versus 45%, P < 0.001), dyslipidemia (82% versus 50%, P < 0.001), diabetes (45% versus 21%, P < 0.001), and current smoking (77% versus 59%, P = 0.005). Neurologists with mostly government-insured and uninsured patients were significantly more likely to engage in vascular risk reduction treatment than neurologists with mostly commercially insured patients.

Conclusions

Self-reported rates of screening and treatment of major vascular risk factors by most neurologists after stroke hospitalization are substantial but not universal. Bridging knowledge gaps or adopting a systematic management approach in coordination with primary care physicians could help optimize poststroke care.

### Treatment and intervention for stroke… [^113SwQnN]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

How is stroke treated. On the way to the hospital Calling 9-1-1 for an ambulance means that medical staff can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. The key to stroke treatment and recovery is getting to the hospital quickly. Stroke patients who are taken to the hospital in an ambulance may get diagnosed and treated more quickly than people who do not arrive in an ambulance. This is because emergency treatment starts on the way to the hospital. The emergency workers may take you to a specialized stroke center to ensure that you receive the quickest possible diagnosis and treatment. Treating ischemic stroke If you get to the hospital within 3 hours of the first symptoms of an ischemic stroke, you may get a type of medicine called a thrombolytic to break up blood clots. Tissue plasminogen activator is a thrombolytic.

tPA improves the chances of recovering from a stroke. Studies show that patients with ischemic strokes who receive tPA are more likely to recover fully or have less disability than patients who do not receive the drug. Patients treated with tPA are also less likely to need long-term care in a nursing home. Recognizing the signs and symptoms and seeking immediate medical attention is essential to prevent stroke related disability or death. Doctors may also treat ischemic stroke with other medicines, such as blood thinners, as well as surgery to remove the clot. Treating hemorrhagic stroke Other medicines, surgery, or procedures may be needed to stop the bleeding from hemorrhagic stroke and save brain tissue. For example: Endovascular procedures. Endovascular procedures, which can help repair a weak spot or break in a blood vessel, may be used to treat certain hemorrhagic strokes. Learn more about the procedure. Surgical treatment.

Hemorrhagic strokes may be treated with surgery. If the bleeding is caused by a ruptured aneurysm, a metal clip may be put in place to stop the blood loss. What to expect after a stroke If you have had a stroke, you can make great progress in regaining your independence. However, some problems may continue:

Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Challenges of TIA Outpatient Care

Differentiation between vascular and nonvascular causes of TIA-like presentations is challenging, especially for nonneurologists. Our previous studyand others, indicate that the percentage of TIA misdiagnosis can be as high as 60% in EDs and primary care offices. Approximately half of the patients with clinical presentations of cerebral ischemia have the final diagnosis of a TIA mimic, and many of them may present with a high ABCD 2 score. A meta-analysis found that 20% of patients with an ABCD 2 score of less than 4 had atrial fibrillation or more than 50% had carotid stenosis. One step toward the timely and efficient management of TIA is reducing diagnostic errors by providing education and using advanced diagnostic and management-assistive tools by leveraging electronic health records and advanced predictive tools. Moreover, providing timely outpatient care to TIA patients is challenging. It is critically important to understand the potential delays through the clinical care pathways from symptom onset to a specialist.

Value of TIA Clinic

Although several studies have found TIA clinics could substantially reduce the cost of care, evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of TIA clinics remains limited in the literature. Beyond clinical management, the benefits of TIA clinics could also include a more accurate diagnosis for patients with suspected TIA compared with inpatient and ED settings, fast-track access to specialists, and appropriate patient education and follow-up, which could depend on the infrastructure and resources of the existing health service system.

### Addressing the operational challenges for outpatient stroke rehabilitation [^113jEKUf]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The traditional model of rehabilitation services includes clear requirements for provision of services in the acute inpatient rehabilitation setting. However, there are fewer guidelines on the frequency and duration of rehabilitation services beyond the acute setting. Recent research has suggested that neurorehabilitation interventions that are provided frequently enough upon discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation to facilitate repeated practice and feedback improve long-term stroke outcomes. However, it is challenging to provide high-frequency outpatient rehabilitation, as the logistics of scheduling and insurance limitations often do not allow it. The Sheikh Khalifa Stroke Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine innovated a new model to provide the appropriate frequency of therapy for stroke rehabilitation in the outpatient setting. This article describes the restructured operational infrastructure for outpatient stroke rehabilitation to facilitate high-frequency transdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation in the real world, including the development of the outpatient postacute therapy programs and the identification of appropriate patients for each program, the development of scheduling matrices and treating teams to deliver the postacute therapy programs, the implementation of transdisciplinary neurorehabilitation, and the steps taken to empower patients to engage in rehabilitation at home and address barriers to accessing the programs. We assessed the effect of the operational restructuring on schedule utilization, no-show rates, and cancellation rates in the 3 mos before and after implementation of the program and show that it increased schedule utilization and reduced no-show rates and cancellation rates, suggesting that it may increase compliance with rehabilitation. It is possible to create the infrastructure needed to bridge the continuum of care for poststroke recovery and rehabilitation.

### Results of an outpatient transient ischemic attack evaluation: a 90-day follow-up study [^111KG26E]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is common and precedes 15% of strokes. TIA should be managed as a time-sensitive illness to prevent a subsequent stroke. However, management of TIA is heterogeneous, with little consensus about its optimal assessment.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the outcome of patients with TIA evaluated in the Emergency Department (ED) and managed as outpatients within a 90-day period after discharge.

Methods

All patients with symptoms of TIA admitted to the ED were eligible for inclusion. Patients were evaluated by an Emergency Physician who followed a decision algorithm used in the selection of patients for discharge. The main outcome variable was the occurrence of stroke during the 90 days after discharge from the ED.

Results

During a 1-year period, a total of 118 patients were evaluated for TIA in the ED, representing 1.4% of ED medical admissions: 56 (47.5%) were hospitalized and 62 (52.5%) were discharged and enrolled in the outpatient TIA management. Two (3.2%) of the discharged patients could not be contacted for follow-up. Among the patients managed as outpatients, one (1.7%) presented with an ischemic stroke and 3 (5%) experienced a subsequent TIA within a period of 90 days after discharge from the ED. The rate of stroke predicted from the ABCD2 score was 9.7% at 90 days.

Conclusion

The results of our study suggest that outpatient management of TIA, as described in our institution's guidelines, may be a safe and effective strategy, but further confirmatory studies should be performed.

### Long-term impact of urgent secondary prevention after transient ischemic attack and minor stroke: ten-year follow-up of the EXPRESS study [^112cWiUz]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatments exist to prevent recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke. – These interventions could reduce the short-term risk of recurrent stroke by as much as 90%. For interventions to be most effective, however, TIA and minor stroke have to be diagnosed and treated urgently, given the high risk of recurrent stroke during the first 7 days after the event. –

In the past, in countries such as the United Kingdom, where the vast majority of TIA and minor stroke were first assessed in primary care, patients faced delays of ≈20 days between event onset and treatment prescription. The EXPRESS study (Early Use of Existing Preventive Strategies for Stroke) showed that by reducing the delays between event onset and treatment prescription to 1 day, through the set-up of urgent outpatient TIA clinics, the 90-day risk of recurrent stroke was reduced from 10.3% to 2.1% (ie, a reduction of 80%, P = 0.0001). In addition, EXPRESS showed that these urgent clinics significantly reduced hospital care costs associated with vascular events and disability at 6 months postindex event. Similar outcomes were also achieved in the SOS-TIA study (A Transient Ischemic Attack Clinic With Round-the-Clock Access). Although these studies were nonrandomized they have been widely regarded in clinical guidelines as providing high-quality evidence of benefit of acute assessment, and the substantial reductions in early risk of recurrent stroke have since been confirmed in randomized trials of acute antiplatelet treatment. Additionally, outpatient management of minor stroke and TIA has also been implemented outside of Europe.

### The structured ambulatory post-stroke care program for outpatient aftercare in patients with ischaemic stroke in Germany (SANO): an open-label, cluster-randomised controlled trial [^1132MqBw]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Patients with ischaemic stroke are at risk of recurrent stroke. In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of a structured ambulatory post-stroke care programme versus usual care on recurrent vascular events and death and control of cardiovascular risk factors.

Methods

We did a prospective, open-label, cluster-randomised controlled trial (SANO) at stroke centres in regions of Germany. A cluster was defined as a region in which acute stroke care is provided by a participating stroke centre. Patients were eligible for participation if they were aged 18 years or older, had no severe disabilities before the index stroke (modified Rankin scale 0–1), had at least one modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, and presented within 14 days of symptom onset of their first ischaemic stroke. The participating regions were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention and control group (usual care) by the statistician using block randomisation (block sizes of six), stratified by rural and urban regions. In intervention regions, a cross-sectoral multidisciplinary network was established to provide a 1-year organisational and patient-centred intervention. Due to the type of intervention, masking of participants and study physicians was not possible. Endpoint adjudication was performed by an independent endpoint adjudication committee who were masked to cluster allocation. The primary endpoint was a composite of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause death within 12 months after baseline assessment, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all patients who did not withdraw consent and completed the primary endpoint assessment at 12 months. This study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00015322.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2019 and Dec 22, 2020, 36 clusters were assessed for eligibility, of which 30 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 15 clusters) or control group (n = 15 clusters). No clusters dropped out of the study. 1203 (86%) of 1396 enrolled patients in the intervention group and 1283 (92%) of 1395 enrolled patients in the control group were included in the mITT population. The primary endpoint was confirmed in 64 (5.3%) of 1203 patients in the intervention group and 80 (6.2%) of 1283 patients in the control group (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.80 [95% CI 0.49–1.30]; adjusted OR [aOR] 0.95 [95% CI 0.54–1.67]). All-cause deaths occurred in 31 (2.4%) of 1203 patients in the intervention group and 12 (1.0%) of 1283 patients in the control group. The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the intervention group (266 [23.1%] of 1151) than the control group (106 [9.2%] of 1152). Falls (134 [11.4%] of 1203 patients in the intervention group; 39 [3.3%] of 1152 patients in the control group), hypertensive crisis (55 [4.7%]; 34 [2.8%]), and diagnosis of depression (51 [4.3%]; 13 [1.1%]) were the most frequent adverse events in both groups. No differences were identified in the rate of readmission to hospital between groups.

Interpretation

No differences were identified between patients with ischaemic stroke in the intervention group and control group with regard to the incidence of vascular events 1 year after baseline assessment, despite positive effects with regard to the control of some cardiovascular risk factors. Longer-term effects and other potentially favourable effects on stroke-related sequelae and quality of life require further evaluation.

### The stroke transitional care intervention for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity: a multisite pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^115KLMzj]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Current Canadian best practice guidelines for managing care transitions following stroke are largely built upon evidence from observational or qualitative studies, or expert consensus. Moreover, most studies providing this evidence have focused on hospital-based initiatives, with few examining the role of outpatient or community-based stroke rehabilitation teams. Where possible and appropriate, evidence from 'gold standard' randomized controlled trials should be sought to strengthen the evidence base for community-based stroke rehabilitation interventions targeting older adults with stroke and multimorbidity. The Transitional Care Stroke Intervention (TCSI) trial offers such an opportunity. The TCSI trial was designed to test whether a virtual, 6-month intervention in addition to usual care could improve health outcomes and patient experience and reduce health and social service costs in older adults with stroke and multimorbidity (≥ 2 chronic conditions) who return home, compared with usual care. The feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the TCSI were previously established in a study conducted with a hospital-based outpatient stroke rehabilitation program. This trial contributes to our understanding of the effectiveness of virtual delivery of stroke rehabilitation services on a range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), for an intervention that aims to improve self-management to enable people with stroke to manage the many care transitions they experience following discharge from the hospital. Moreover, the trial targets older adults with multimorbidity, who are among the most vulnerable and medically complex stroke patient subgroups.

### Risk of subsequent stroke among patients receiving outpatient vs inpatient care for transient ischemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116btwLE]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

In this study, we attempted to systematically review the available literature on TIA care models. However, our study has several limitations. We did not consider the details of diagnostic and therapeutic measures in each care setting, variability in the definition of TIA or minor stroke, and the health care system and referral rules in each country in the meta-analyses. Although data were sparse in terms of patients with ABCD 2 scores of less than 4, we observed that patients with lower ABCD 2 scores were more likely to be referred to outpatient clinics, and hospitals considered different thresholds of cerebral ischemia severity for discharging the patients. Although we were able to calculate the rate of TIA overdiagnosis in TIA clinic and inpatient settings, we did not have enough detailed information to calculate the outcome among patients who had the final diagnosis of TIA or mIS. Nevertheless, the rates of overdiagnosis were similar between inpatient and TIA clinic cohorts. In addition, we observed a discrepancy in the size of patient cohorts under each setting of care, which can explain some of the residual confounding. These assumptions may affect the conclusion regarding the safety of TA clinics compared with other care settings. However, they may propose a practical algorithm for the triage of patients with TIA and safely offer outpatient care for those at a lower risk. We were not able to further clarify and subcategorize patients in unspecified settings. However, by including the cohorts from national or multicentric registries (unspecified settings), we highlighted the variability of outcomes among patients treated in the absence of defined care protocols.

### Use of outpatient rehabilitation among adult stroke survivors… [^113xrX3c]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Each year, approximately 800, 000 U. S. persons experience a stroke; outpatient stroke rehabilitation use among survivors helps improve outcomes and might reduce stroke recurrences. What is added by this report. In 2013, 31. 2% of stroke survivors reported participation in outpatient stroke rehabilitation in 20 states and the District of Columbia. Reported use varied by demographic characteristics and by state. Among the four states reporting rehabilitation use for both 2013 and 2015, use increased significantly but remained suboptimal. Despite longstanding national guidelines recommending stroke rehab, it remains underutilized, especially in the outpatient setting. Professional associations and evidence-based guidelines support the increasing stroke rehab use in health systems and are promoted by the public health community.

An analysis of 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data revealed that 30. 7% of stroke survivors reported participation in outpatient rehab for stroke after hospital discharge in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Discussion Overall, approximately one third of stroke survivors reported participating in stroke outpatient rehab. Although outpatient rehab use increased significantly in the four states that collected data in both 2013 and 2015, it remained suboptimal, highlighting missed opportunities to reach stroke survivors. Stroke recovery can be a long and complex process, involving multiple domains of therapy and occurs in inpatient rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and outpatient rehabilitation facilities.

Benefits of stroke outpatient rehab have been determined to improve patient functional status, survival, cardiovascular risk profiles, and quality of life and reduce risks for recurrent strokes and psychological or stress disorders. Generally, stroke outpatient rehab participation is underutilized, which this study found to be true for all subgroups and states included in the analysis. No subgroup had outpatient rehab use rates > 40%, and no state had use rates > 50%. Although the overall prevalence of outpatient rehab use was low, disparities in use were evident. Although estimates of stroke outpatient rehab referral might be high, participation in stroke outpatient rehab remains suboptimal. Barriers to participation in stroke outpatient rehab are evident (.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^117Wx1oY]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke in a single document. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 guidelines and subsequent updates.

Methods

Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. The members of the writing group unanimously approved all recommendations except when relations with industry precluded members voting. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 4 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2015 Class of Recommendations and Levels of Evidence and the new American Heart Association guidelines format.

Results

These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings.

Conclusions

These guidelines are based on the best evidence currently available. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

### Secondary ischemic stroke prevention [^117TzAuj]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

The health burden of ischemic stroke is high and will continue to increase with an aging population. Recurrent ischemic stroke is increasingly recognized as a major public health concern with potentially debilitating sequelae. Thus, it is imperative to develop and implement effective strategies for stroke prevention. When considering secondary ischemic stroke prevention, it is important to consider the mechanism of the first stroke and the related vascular risk factors. Secondary ischemic stroke prevention typically includes multiple medical and, potentially, surgical treatments, but with the shared goal of reducing the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. Providers, health care systems, and insurers also need to consider the availability of treatments, their cost and patient burden, methods for improving adherence, and interventions that target lifestyle risk factors such as diet or activity. In this article, we discuss aspects from the 2021 AHA Guideline on Secondary Stroke Prevention as well as highlight additional information relevant to best practices for reducing recurrent stroke risk.

### Determining the factors influencing the selection of post-acute care models by patients and their families: a qualitative content analysis [^1137Y4ne]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world, accounting for approximately 6.2 million deaths worldwide each year, and it is also the leading cause of long-term disability in adults. Studies have shown that one-third of haemorrhagic stroke patients had functional dependence or died within three months after the stroke episode. For surviving stroke patients, functional disability is a crucial issue. Following acute treatment and stabilisation of vital signs, follow-up rehabilitation therapy is the key to restoring the lost functions.

The concept of post-acute care (PAC) refers to follow-up care for discharged patients, which means that even after receiving acute hospital treatment, patients still require complete health care services to recover their original body functions. The aim of PAC is to minimise patients' physical disability to enable them to return to community life smoothly. In order to cope with an ageing population and resolve the potential burden on the health care system, family, and social care providers due to the possibility of an increasing number of patients suffering from disabilities after acute treatment, in Taiwan, the National Health Insurance Administration not only reimburses post-acute inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation as well as home care, but also has implemented the Integrated Post-Acute Care Plan for stoke to improve the quality of post-acute care since 2014. The plan assigned active integrated care for stroke patients during the golden rehabilitation period after discharge from acute care hospitalisation, including inpatient rehabilitation and home rehabilitation, based on the patients' disability level and the assessment results of the PAC team in order to improve the quality of medical services and the efficiency of the use of medical resources through the reform of the payment system. Therefore, in Taiwan, the PAC models include inpatient rehabilitation hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health, and outpatient rehabilitation.

### Comparison of outcomes of patients with inpatient or outpatient onset ischemic stroke [^114zbhtU]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Reperfusion times for ischemic stroke occurring in the outpatient setting have improved significantly in recent years. However, quality improvement efforts have largely ignored ischemic stroke occurring in patients hospitalized for unrelated indications.

Methods

We performed a cohort study involving patients with ischemic stroke (with inpatient or outpatient onset) from 2009 to 2013 who were registered in the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database. A propensity score-adjusted regression analysis was used to assess the association of location of onset and outcomes. Mixed effects methods were employed to control for clustering at the hospital level.

Results

Of the 176571 ischemic strokes, 160157 (90.7%) occurred outside of a hospital and 16414 (9.3%) occurred in patients hospitalized for unrelated indications. Using a logistic regression model with propensity score adjustment, we demonstrated that inpatient stroke onset was associated with increased inpatient mortality (OR 3.09; 95% CI 2.81 to 3.38), rate of discharge to rehabilitation (OR 2.57; 95% CI 2.37 to 2.79), and length of stay (LOS) (β = 11.58; 95% CI 10.73 to 12.42). In addition, it was associated with lower odds (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.77) of undergoing stroke-related interventions (mechanical thrombectomy and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator) compared with outpatient stroke onset.

Conclusions

Using a comprehensive all-payer cohort of patients with ischemic stroke in New York State, we identified an association of inpatient stroke onset with fewer stroke-related interventions and increased mortality, rate of discharge to rehabilitation, and LOS.

### New evidence for stroke prevention: clinical applications [^115A85v9]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most developed nations. There is a significant body of evidence supporting strategies that target primary and secondary stroke prevention. This evidence cannot be broadly applied to all patients, and each patient's situation and values must be considered with regard to shared evidence-based decision making. Several models can be used to apply evidence to individual patients, including formal clinical decision analysis, decision aids, or simpler tools such as the likelihood of being helped vs harmed. Various programmatic models of providing patient care in stroke prevention may also be useful; these include specialized clinics or disease-management programs, anticoagulation management services, and self-testing and management of anticoagulation by patients.

### Outpatient rehabilitation among stroke survivors – 21 States and the district of columbia, 2005 [^1134jZEg]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of severe and long-term disability in the United States. Approximately 700,000 persons in the United States have a new or recurrent stroke each year; among those who survive, only 10% recover completely, and many of the remaining survivors need rehabilitation because of resulting impairments. Long-term disability not only affects functional status and social roles among stroke survivors but also results in substantial costs; the combined direct and indirect costs of stroke are projected to be $62.7 billion in the United States in 2007. Although studies have established that timely and intensive rehabilitation can substantially improve patients' functional outcomes and quality of life after an acute stroke, few studies have provided population-based estimates of the prevalence of acute stroke rehabilitation. To examine the prevalence of outpatient stroke rehabilitation among selected populations, CDC assessed data from the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey on stroke survivors in 21 states and the District of Columbia (DC). This report summarizes the results of that assessment, which indicated that 30.7% of the stroke survivors received outpatient rehabilitation and a higher prevalence of outpatient stroke rehabilitation was reported among men, non-Hispanic blacks, unemployed or retired adults, and persons living in the center city of a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) than in comparison groups. The findings indicated that the prevalence of stroke survivors who were receiving outpatient stroke rehabilitation services was lower than would be expected if clinical practice guideline recommendations for all stroke patients had been followed. Increasing the number of stroke survivors who receive needed outpatient rehabilitation might lead to better functional status and quality of life in this population.

Organization of poststroke rehabilitation care — It is recommended that stroke patients who are candidates for postacute rehabilitation receive organized, coordinated, interprofessional care. It is recommended that stroke survivors who qualify for and have access to IRF care receive treatment in an IRF in preference to a SNF. Organized community-based and coordinated interprofessional rehabilitation care is recommended in the outpatient or home-based settings. ESD services may be reasonable for people with mild to moderate disability.

### Substantial underestimation of the need for outpatient services for TIA and minor stroke [^113YvEhE]. Age and Ageing (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure the number of all transient ischaemic attack (TIAs) and minor strokes managed as outpatients, and hence, the need for 'TIA clinics' in comparison to current estimates of 20,000 TIAs annually in England, based on previous rates of incident-definite events.

Subjects

All individuals with confirmed or suspected TIA or stroke between 2002 and 2005 in a population-based study of 91,105 individuals in Oxfordshire, UK.

Outcome Measures

Numbers, rates, and risks of recurrent stroke for incident-definite TIA, any probable or definite TIA, stroke, and all referrals of suspected TIA and stroke, stratified according to inpatient versus outpatient management.

Results

Of 1,174 confirmed or suspected events ascertained, 729 (62.1%) were managed as outpatients and 445 (37.9%) as inpatients. Among 757 probable or definite events, 432 (57%) were managed as outpatients. Incident-definite TIAs accounted for only 18% of all referrals to outpatient services. Annual rates per 1,000 population were 2.98 (2.77–3.2) for all referrals to outpatient services and 1.88 (1.71–2.06) for inpatient admissions. Of 73 recurrent strokes within 90 days of initial TIA or stroke, 48 (65.8%) occurred in the outpatient population. Applying these rates to the population of England yields approximately 150,000 new referrals annually to TIA clinics with about 10,000 early recurrent strokes.

Conclusion

More patients with TIA or stroke are managed as outpatients than inpatients in the UK, and this group has the majority of possibly preventable early recurrent strokes. Current projections of need for TIA clinics in England substantially underestimate the overall requirement for outpatient services.

### Disparities in postacute rehabilitation care for stroke: an analysis of the state inpatient databases [^1177ynff]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious, long-term disability with direct and indirect costs in the US estimated at $73.7 billion for 2010. Each year, approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke, with incident and mortality rates higher in older adults, Blacks, and Hispanics. Older adults, women, Blacks, and Hispanic stroke survivors also suffer greater morbidity and disability. - In addition, research suggests that females, minorities, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) make smaller gains during post-acute rehabilitation care (PARC) and/or in recovery post-stroke.-

A growing body of literature is exploring how demographic and geographic disparities in stroke-related health may be related to demographic and geographic disparities in stroke care. Several studies have documented lower use of thrombolytic treatments for acute stroke - and of preventive measures - in minorities, females, and individuals living in rural areas. Less is known about disparities in rehabilitation care following stroke, an intervention that has a large evidence base for effectiveness. - While current guidelines recommend that stroke rehabilitation begin in the acute care setting,- most of the rehabilitation occurs in post-acute care settings (i.e. skilled nursing facility (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), home health (HH), and/or outpatient settings).

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111E5Guz]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to do not use triple antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole) for secondary stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) antithrombotic treatment — agent selection: For early secondary prevention in patients with noncardioembolic AIS, the selection of an antiplatelet agent should be individualized on the basis of patient risk factor profiles, cost, tolerance, relative known efficacy of the agents, and other clinical characteristics.

### Analyzing pain patterns in stroke survivors in outpatient clinics: a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study [^115KW67W]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Many stroke survivors experience more than one type of pain, as did 36% of the subjects in this study. This further complicates stroke-related pain assessment and treatment, as not all assessment tools validly measure all types of pain, and not all treatments are equally efficacious across all pain types. For many stroke survivors, pain assessment is lacking altogether. Stroke survivors present with complex medical needs, and the lack of guidelines supporting uniform pain assessment among providers further confounds clinical practices. Thus, comparing outcomes across providers, facilities, and health systems is difficult, if not impossible. As pain is a multidimensional construct with components of intensity and interference with other quality-of-life constructs such as mood, sleep, relationships, and function, as well as variability in symptom reporting (such as burning, numbness, pinprick, tingling), instruments such as the Brief Pain Inventory that capture pain intensity, variations in how the sensation of pain is expressed, and the biopsychosocial constructs of pain would aid in pain assessmentand targeting appropriate treatment, such as neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain treatment recommendations from the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Furthermore, as is probably true for stroke survivors, the pain experience is most likely different for those with neurologic impairment than those without, impeding the use of commonly employed subjective measures such as the numeric pain rating scale.
