## Question

Management of Raynaud's phenomenon in SSc patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing Raynaud's phenomenon in systemic sclerosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why SSc-associated RP differs from primary RP. Then, I should verify the overarching management principles and the role of non-pharmacologic measures. Next, I will examine first-line pharmacotherapy, followed by second-line and rescue options, and finally consider procedural interventions and special scenarios like digital ulcers and pediatric disease. I will also integrate patient preference data and monitoring needs to ensure the plan is practical and evidence-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation, because treatment choices hinge on it. SSc-associated RP reflects both functional vasospasm and structural microvascular injury with endothelial dysfunction, intimal proliferation, and luminal narrowing, which explains why attacks are more severe, prolonged, and prone to ischemic complications than in primary RP; this structural component is why purely vasodilatory strategies often yield only modest benefit and why early, aggressive management of ischemia is warranted [^112Dwhob] [^111rqzyC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about drugs before establishing principles. I need to ensure the plan emphasizes education and risk-factor modification as the foundation, because cold avoidance, smoking cessation, and meticulous rewarming strategies reduce attack frequency and severity; EULAR 2024 explicitly recommends advising avoidance of cold exposure, and BSR 2024 highlights smoking cessation and self-management as central pillars, with non-pharmacologic consensus recommendations reinforcing education and stepped care approaches [^116X25XZ] [^117SEYbv] [^11353sfY].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacotherapy. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: both EULAR 2023 and BSR 2024 converge on dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, typically nifedipine, as first-line; the Cochrane review shows CCBs reduce attack frequency and severity, though effects are modest and adverse effects like headache, flushing, dizziness, and edema are common, so I should start low and titrate slowly to improve tolerability [^115fh6pi] [^117DT4e4] [^113ipp9x] [^1127mzMo].

> I will now examine second-line options for inadequate response or intolerance. PDE5 inhibitors are the next most consistently supported class; the Cochrane review indicates small but meaningful reductions in attack frequency and duration, with improved patient global assessment, though tolerability can limit use, and network meta-analysis places PDE5 inhibitors among the most effective options in secondary RP; BSR positions PDE5 inhibitors as second-line, and EULAR supports their consideration, so sildenafil or tadalafil are reasonable choices, with attention to hypotension and headache risks [^114L3nAH] [^1114HovB] [^113NP9CY] [^113NP9CY].

> But wait, what if attacks are severe or there is critical ischemia or digital ulceration. I should confirm that intravenous iloprost is the rescue therapy in these scenarios; EULAR recommends IV iloprost for severe SSc-RP after oral therapy failure, and BSR supports IV prostanoids as rescue, with observational and randomized data showing reductions in attack burden and promotion of ulcer healing; practical protocols often use 0.5–2 ng/kg/min over several hours in cycles, balancing efficacy with infusion-related flushing and headache [^1163kYAt] [^117TrKDU] [^114vpSgw] [^116YEKng].

> Let me consider adjunctive and alternative agents, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. SSRIs such as fluoxetine have low-certainty benefit and may be considered when vasodilators are contraindicated or poorly tolerated; endothelin receptor antagonists like bosentan do not improve RP attacks per se but reduce the number of new digital ulcers and can be layered in patients with recurrent ulceration; antiplatelet therapy and statins have biologic rationale and are reasonable in refractory cases despite limited direct RP evidence, particularly when there is macro- or microvascular thrombotic risk or dyslipidemia; I need to ensure I frame these as conditional options with shared decision-making [^115jaaVD] [^113xsDTV] [^113LCAdf] [^117TrKDU].

> I should confirm procedural options for refractory disease or when systemic therapy is contraindicated. Digital or palmar sympathectomy, with or without botulinum toxin injection, can reduce severity and frequency of attacks and aid ulcer healing in carefully selected patients; BSR and contemporary reviews support considering these in severe or refractory cases, particularly with low blood pressure limiting vasodilators, but I need to counsel that evidence quality is limited and patient selection is key [^117Gf9U7] [^116oQ8Gw] [^115Dbdt5].

> Now, I need to ensure I address digital ulcer management explicitly, because RP and DU are tightly linked. Severe vasculopathy with new necrosis or critical ischemia warrants urgent assessment, ideally within 48 hours; first-line for DU healing and secondary prevention is a PDE5 inhibitor, with bosentan as a second-line option to reduce new ulcers; IV iloprost can promote healing in severe cases; local debridement, antiplatelet therapy when necrosis is present, and access to specialized wound care are core elements; I should also remember that outcome assessment in RP/DU is evolving, so standardized tools and multidisciplinary care improve longitudinal management [^117TrKDU] [^111rQdjG] [^1155KssA].

> Let me reconsider pediatric considerations briefly. Although high-quality pediatric RCTs are sparse, international pediatric consensus supports similar principles with attention to dosing and safety data; sildenafil has pediatric dosing and safety information, whereas tadalafil does not, so I should tailor choices accordingly and coordinate with pediatric rheumatology for longitudinal care and transitions [^1155KssA].

> Next, I should review patient preferences and shared decision-making, because adherence and satisfaction hinge on aligning choices with patient goals. Survey data show patients prioritize function, pain, and ulcer prevention, are concerned about side effects, and often prefer non-pharmacologic strategies; this means I need to start low, go slow, discuss expected benefits realistically, and integrate education and self-management into every visit to sustain engagement [^116ZLfxX] [^117SEYbv].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up, and I should confirm that we standardize assessments. Annual multidisciplinary review with attention to RP severity, DU presence, cardiopulmonary status, and laboratory surveillance is recommended; consensus statements endorse structured annual assessments, and emerging tools for RP/DU outcomes should be incorporated when available to track response and guide escalation [^117UKWv6] [^1169AgeL] [^112Qz3v6].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. Start with education and cold avoidance, smoking cessation, and rewarming strategies; if symptoms persist, initiate a dihydropyridine CCB such as nifedipine and titrate to effect while monitoring for hypotension and edema; if inadequate after an adequate trial, add a PDE5 inhibitor; for severe attacks or critical ischemia, use IV iloprost in cycles; for refractory cases or intolerance, consider SSRIs, antiplatelet therapy, statins, or procedural sympathectomy/botulinum toxin; throughout, layer DU-directed strategies when indicated and reassess regularly using standardized tools and shared decision-making to maintain alignment with patient goals and evolving evidence [^115fh6pi] [^117DT4e4] [^1163kYAt] [^114L3nAH] [^117TrKDU].

---

The cornerstone of Raynaud's management in systemic sclerosis is **calcium channel blockers as first-line** [^115fh6pi] therapy, with **PDE5 inhibitors as second-line** [^113NP9CY] for refractory cases [^117TrKDU]. Intravenous iloprost is reserved for **severe or digital ulcer disease** [^1163kYAt] [^113ANsHi], and endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g. bosentan) are used to prevent recurrent digital ulcers [^113xsDTV] [^117TrKDU]. Non-pharmacologic measures include **cold avoidance, smoking cessation, and patient education** [^116X25XZ] [^117SEYbv] [^11353sfY]. For refractory cases, consider digital sympathectomy or botulinum toxin injections [^117Gf9U7] [^115Dbdt5]. Regular monitoring for digital ulcers, infection, and ischemia is essential, and **multidisciplinary care is recommended** for optimal outcomes [^1172CLvf] [^117UKWv6].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological interventions are foundational and should be initiated in all patients [^117SEYbv]:

- **Cold avoidance**: Avoid cold exposure and use protective clothing [^116X25XZ] [^117SEYbv].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended due to vasoconstrictive effects [^117SEYbv].
- **Patient education**: Teach self-management and symptom recognition [^11353sfY] [^1146ZHVV].
- **Stress management**: Address emotional triggers [^116oQ8Gw].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line therapy

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) — particularly dihydropyridines such as nifedipine — are first-line [^115fh6pi] and reduce attack frequency and severity [^113ipp9x] [^1114HovB].

---

### Second-line therapy

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i) — sildenafil or tadalafil — are recommended when CCBs are inadequate or not tolerated [^117TrKDU] [^111rQdjG] [^113NP9CY].

---

### Advanced therapies

- **Intravenous iloprost**: For severe RP or digital ulcers, especially after oral therapy failure [^1163kYAt] [^113ANsHi] [^117Xb93M].
- **Endothelin receptor antagonists**: Bosentan reduces new digital ulcers in patients with multiple ulcers despite CCBs/PDE5i/iloprost [^113xsDTV] [^117TrKDU].
- **Antiplatelet agents**: Aspirin or clopidogrel for refractory RP or digital ischemia [^113LCAdf] [^117TrKDU].

---

## Interventional procedures

For refractory cases, **digital sympathectomy** (with or without botulinum toxin) is considered when systemic vasodilators are poorly tolerated or ineffective [^117Gf9U7] [^117TrKDU].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular assessment is essential to detect complications and guide therapy:

- **Digital ulcers**: Monitor for development, healing, and infection [^117TrKDU].
- **Ischemia**: Watch for critical ischemia or gangrene [^117TrKDU].
- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Use validated tools to assess severity and impact [^114N4Ccp].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **multidisciplinary approach** involving rheumatologists, vascular specialists, pain specialists, and occupational therapists is recommended for comprehensive care [^1172CLvf] [^1125n3B1].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **oral prostacyclin analogs** (e.g. selexipag) and novel vasodilators, though evidence remains limited [^111MLdgM] [^112i1pbo].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Calcium channel blockers | First-line | High |
| PDE5 inhibitors | Second-line | High |
| Intravenous iloprost | Severe RP/digital ulcers | High |
| Bosentan | Recurrent digital ulcers | High |
| Digital sympathectomy | Refractory RP | Moderate |
| Non-pharmacological measures | All patients | High |

---

Effective management of Raynaud's in systemic sclerosis requires a **stepwise approach**, starting with non-pharmacological measures and escalating to pharmacological and interventional therapies as needed. Regular monitoring and multidisciplinary care are essential to optimize outcomes and quality of life [^117SEYbv] [^111D1mV2].

RP is the most common manifestation of SSc and a major cause of disease-related morbidity. This review provides a detailed appraisal of the patient experience of SSc-RP and potential implications for disease classification, patient-reported outcome instrument development and SSc-RP clinical trial design. The review explores the clinical features of SSc-RP, the severity and burden of SSc-RP symptoms and the impact of SSc-RP on function, work and social participation, body image dissatisfaction and health-related quality of life in SSc. Where management of SSc-RP is concerned, the review focuses on the 'patient experience' of interventions for SSc-RP, examining geographic variation in clinical practice and potential barriers to the adoption of treatment recommendations concerning best-practice management of SSc-RP. Knowledge gaps are highlighted that could form the focus of future research. A more thorough understanding of the patient experience could support the development of novel reported outcome instruments for assessing SSc-RP.

Global management of systemic sclerosis

Overarching principles of management of all people with SSc

Systemic sclerosis is heterogeneous and can be classified as outlined above into subsets based upon the extent of skin involvement. The major subsets are diffuse and limited cutaneous SSc. Symptomatic management is required in all cases together with investigation and treatment of specific complications. It is an important principle that any of the organ-based complications may develop in all subsets including overlap SSc and SSc sine scleroderma. The principles of management are outlined in Fig. 1. Diffuse cutaneous SSc is a particularly important subgroup as these cases should be assessed comprehensively and urgently due to the risk of early severe or progressive organ-based complications and because cases should be managed in collaboration with an expert SSc centre. Cases of limited cutaneous SSc often develop major organ-based complications that should be managed as outlined in the third topic of this guideline.

Figure 1.
Overarching principles for management of systemic sclerosis

This guideline considers all age groups that may develop SSc including juvenile onset disease (jSSc) defined as < 18 years at onset of the first non-Raynaud manifestation. These cases will be managed by paediatric rheumatologist multidisciplinary teams along with organ-based specialist paediatricians. Transitional care into adult services and long-term management of adults with juvenile onset SSc are also considered. An overarching goal is to comment on where adult recommendations may be applied to those with juvenile onset SSc at all life stages. Progression of disease, particularly as defined by subset, is less well studied in juvenile SSc but does show differences compared with adult-onset disease.

### Evidence and consensus-based recommendations for non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue, hand function loss, Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis [^1118kSvv]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

HPR recommendations not only could support HPRs in SSc treatment, but also could provide clinicians with guidance on timely referrals and access to adequate care for patients with SSc, fatigue, hand function loss and RP/DU. To address this need, this study aimed to develop HPR recommendations for the management and treatment of fatigue, hand function loss and RP/DU in patients with SSc. A multidisciplinary task force has been assembled to develop these recommendations based on evidence and consensus. These recommendations are targeted at all HPRs in the field of non-pharmacological SSc care and are potentially relevant to key stakeholders, namely SSc patients, as well as their patient organizations, rheumatologists and other (medical) care providers.

### Practical management of Raynaud's phenomenon-a primer for practicing physicians [^116oQ8Gw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common vasospastic condition that results in digital hypoperfusion in response to cold and/or emotional stress and is associated with significant pain and disability. The aim of our review is to provide a practical approach for clinicians to inform assessment and management of patients with RP.

Recent Findings

Autoantibodies and nailfold capillaroscopy are key investigations to stratify the risk of progression to systemic sclerosis (SSc) in patients RP, which was recently confirmed in the multicenter, very early diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (VEDOSS) project. Research has explored the complex lived-patient experience of RP including digital vasculopathy in SSc and has highlighted the need for outcome measure development to facilitate research in the field. Pharmacological treatment strategies vary significantly internationally and there is continued interest in developing surgical approaches.

Summary

We provide a practical and up-to-date approach to inform the assessment and management of patients with RP including guidance on drug initiation and escalation. Calcium channel blockers are first-line treatment and can be initiated by primary care physicians. We also highlight second-line drug therapies used for refractory RP and the potential role for surgical intervention.

### Systemic sclerosis: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^1119SQyy]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an orphan disease characterised by autoimmunity, fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, and vasculopathy. SSc may be associated with high morbidity and mortality. In this narrative review we summarise the results of a systematic literature research, which was performed as part of the European Reference Network on Rare and Complex Connective Tissue and Musculoskeletal Diseases project, aimed at evaluating existing clinical practice guidelines or recommendations. Only in the domains 'Vascular & Ulcers' (ie, non-pharmacological approach to digital ulcer), 'PAH' (ie, screening and treatment), 'Treatment' and 'Juveniles' (ie, evaluation of juveniles with Raynaud's phenomenon) evidence-based and consensus-based guidelines could be included. Hence there is a preponderance of unmet needs in SSc referring to the diagnosis and (non-)pharmacological treatment of several SSc-specific complications. Patients with SSc experience significant uncertainty concerning SSc-related taxonomy, management (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and education. Day-to-day impact of the disease (loss of self-esteem, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and occupational, nutritional and relational problems) is underestimated and needs evaluation.

### Raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis [^112Dwhob]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Raynaud phenomenon is a symptom complex caused by impaired digital perfusion and can occur as a primary phenomenon or secondary to a wide range of underlying causes. Raynaud phenomenon occurs in virtually all patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is often the earliest clinical manifestation to occur. Careful assessment is required in patients with Raynaud phenomenon to avoid missing secondary causes such as SSc. Digital ulcers are a painful and disabling visible manifestation of digital vascular injury in patients with SSc. Progress has been made in the classification and assessment of digital ulcers and in understanding ulcer pathogenesis, and there are a wide range of treatments available to both prevent and heal digital ulcers, some of which are also used in Raynaud phenomenon management. In this Review, the assessment of patients with Raynaud phenomenon is discussed, including 'red flags' that are suggestive of SSc. The pathogenesis, classification and assessment of SSc-associated digital ulcers are also covered, alongside an overview of management approaches for SSc-associated Raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcers. Finally, unmet needs are discussed and the concept of a unified vascular phenotype in which therapies that affect the vasculature to support disease modification strategies is introduced.

### Current management strategies for systemic sclerosis [^111aUgyN]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis remains a challenging disease despite progress that has taken place in the management of organ-based complications. Overall management strategies need to take into account the features of the disease that are common to almost all patients such as skin involvement, gastro-oesophageal manifestations and secondary Raynaud's, as well as identify less frequent but critical manifestations that impact on survival including heart, lung, renal and more severe GI involvement. Treatments can be considered to be disease-modifying or symptomatic. In addition, it is important to address more generic problems such as the emotional, psychological and economic impact of a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease. This article reviews general approaches to disease assessment and management and relates this to subset and stage of the condition.

### Re-thinking strategies for a pharmaceutical approach to pain-related to connective tissue related Raynaud's phenomenon in the United States [^1136nK99]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies for Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) treatment in the United States (U.S.). Clinical trials have been challenged by study design. Important advances in RP patient reported outcome measures and mechanistic quantification allows RP-related pain characterization. The rationale for this narrative review is current RP treatment guidelines that focus on vasodilation.

Methods

The question of why there are limitations to RP treatment in the US is addressed through a comprehensive search strategy of published RP-treatment guidelines up until September 1, 2025. Search databases included Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Scopus for index terms, "Raynaud's phenomenon treatment guidelines". If a society guideline was updated, only the most recent was included. Eligibility, data extraction, risk of bias and quality assessment were subject to review by two independent reviewers with a third reviewer resolving discrepancies. US specific considerations of published guidelines are reviewed.

Results

There were 118 published articles that were identified by the search terms 'Raynaud's phenomenon treatment guidelines', and 27 abstracts were reviewed. There were 4 articles that were published as RP treatment recommendations or guidelines, which were reviewed for full content. Pain management for RP is not included in guideline-based care.

Conclusion

There are advances in outcome measures for quantifying pain now available for RP clinical trials. Large U.S. based registries for systemic sclerosis (SSc) utilizing patient reported outcomes can allow serial data collection on RP and RP-related digital lesions to provide real-world data on medication efficacy for pain relief.

### Evidence and consensus-based recommendations for non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue, hand function loss, Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis [^112P5vCD]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this project are the broad participation of patient representatives and professionals and its systematic approach that is based on the standardized operating procedures to combine practice and evidence-based knowledge of EULAR. Therefore, the resulting recommendations can be used for all stakeholders: support HPRs in the treatment of SSc patients, guidance for rheumatologists, and other medical or non-medical care providers on timely referrals, and thus better access to information regarding HPR treatment for SSc patients and their patient organizations. Another strength is the division of recommendations into a stepped care approach including patient education, single or multiple HPR treatments and a multidisciplinary approach. Both the consensus meeting and literature suggested that different disease manifestations require different treatment approaches. All patients diagnosed with SSc need patient education regarding clinical manifestations and possible disease consequences to manage SSc. Moreover, patients with single, non-lethal disease consequences can often receive help through specific, individualized treatments. However, when patients report limitations that cause restrictions in multiple areas of activities of daily living, multidisciplinary treatment with appropriate specialists should be considered.

A possible limitation in this study is that we used a pragmatic literature research approach to answer research questions, and that we refrained from statistical pooling of data of findings of individual RCTs due to the heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures. As, a consequence, we did not provide information about the magnitude of effects (and thus the clinical relevance of findings). Draft recommendations formulated by the task force in the face-to-face meeting were the main factors deciding whether recommendations were approved. However, in disease settings in which evidence is limited by a small patient sample and the rapid development of the disease, this approach can help to inform the content of HPR interventions and can also be used in the development and/or optimization of research studies and national postgraduate educational offerings. By performing a thorough literature search on systematic reviews and recently published RCTs we got insight into the (lack of) evidence basis of each individual recommendation. To ensure the high quality of statements, all articles found were assessed for their quality, risk of bias and subsequently the level of evidence. Another potential study limitation might be that, while the literature used originates from the international field of expertise, the expertise of experts involved is probably mainly based on the Dutch health care system. As those roles may vary per country, local adaptations may be needed if the recommendations stated in this study are used in other countries.

### Therapeutic and diagnostic outcomes of a standardised, comprehensive care pathway for patients with systemic sclerosis [^1141AiLk]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

In addition, a range of SSc-specific manifestations, including, for example, Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) atrophy, joint contractures and digital ulcers, result in specific limitations in everyday life, for which additional counselling and non-pharmacological interventions can be relevant. Although evidence for efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions is limited, potential importance of psychosocial and rehabilitation interventions for a chronic disease are clear.

To improve healthcare for patients with SSc treated in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), we aimed to develop a care pathway combining comprehensive medical assessment of organ complications with multidisciplinary care specifically targeting SSc-related manifestations.

The execution of a care pathway combining a wide range of diagnostic procedures with multidisciplinary team care in a patient-friendly manner is an organisational challenge. Patients were found to prefer a yearly standardised, multidisciplinary assessment in a day-care setting rather than multiple visits to various outpatient clinics. In line with this preference, a yearly, 2-day standardised diagnostic and multidisciplinary care pathway was developed. It is meant to serve both patients from the university hospital as well as those referred by rheumatologists in non-academic hospitals in the region. The execution of this complex diagnostic and multidisciplinary care pathway in one centre is in line with international management guidelines, which advocate referral of patients with SSc to a specialised centre.

Regarding the therapeutic management resulting from the diagnostic care pathway, the 2009 EULAR guidelines on treatment of SSc, listing evidence and consensus-based pharmacological treatments for various manifestations of SSc, constitute a firm base. However, no clear definitions on required severity of manifestations of SSc with regard to start of treatments are available, which is due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the disease. In the absence of such definitions, all management decisions in the context of the above mentioned care pathway were taken at a multidisciplinary team conference, based on the individual patient characteristics, and all available scientific and clinical knowledge among the team members.

The aim of the current report is to determine the outcomes of this standardised, comprehensive, care pathway in terms of medical and paramedical interventions, and initiation of immunosuppressive treatment.

### Factors influencing patient decision-making concerning treatment escalation in Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis [^116ZLfxX]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore patient priorities and ranking of factors influencing patient decision-making concerning treatment escalation in the management of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc).

Methods

Patients with SSc were invited to participate in an online survey disseminated through patient-led organizations and social media platforms.

Results

Responses from 747 individuals with self-reported SSc-RP were evaluable with broad international representation. The mean ± SD age (54.7 ± 12.1 years), clinical phenotype, and disease subsets distribution (limited cutaneous SSc [402 of 747, 53.8%], diffuse cutaneous SSc [260 of 747, 34.8%], and overlap disease [85 of 747, 11.4%]) were consistent with expected demographic information. Around one-half (56.3%) of patients reported that their SSc-RP symptoms were adequately controlled. The 5 highest ranked factors (of 13) that would prompt treatment escalation for SSc-RP were as follows: 1) inability to use the fingers properly; 2) emergence of new digital ulcer on ≥ 1 fingers; 3) worsening pain or discomfort from RP; 4) more severe attacks; and 5) if it may help with internal problems. Despite symptoms not being adequately controlled, 47.1% were concerned about potential treatment side effects and were more likely to accept mild (~20–40%) versus severe (2%) side effects. Patients were open to different management strategies for uncontrolled RP that included adding new treatment in combination with existing treatment (52.8%), drug substitution (40.9%), increasing the current dose (28.8%), or focusing on nonpharmacologic approaches (29.7%).

Conclusion

We have identified the relative importance of different factors influencing patient preferences for treatment decision-making regarding SSc-RP. Side-effect profiles influence acceptability of drug treatments, and many patients report a preference for nonpharmacologic management of SSc-RP.

### Efficacy and safety of selexipag in adults with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study [^112i1pbo]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is experienced by > 90% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), often as the first symptom of the disease 1, 2, 3. RP is part of the spectrum of vasculopathy associated with SSc, which also includes digital ulceration and critical digital ischemia 2. It is an important clinical manifestation of the disease, as it is thought that vasculopathy may play a key role in the early pathogenesis of SSc 4. RP occurs due to episodic, reversible vasospasm of the small arteries and arterioles, usually in the fingers and toes, and is mainly triggered by cold or emotional stress 5, 6. In addition, RP secondary to SSc is linked with structural changes of the vasculature, resulting in blood vessel narrowing and impairment of blood flow 5. Because RP is burdensome, improvements in RP have been linked to better quality of life 7, 8.

Management of RP is challenging and requires a multifaceted approach, including risk factor avoidance and targeted drug therapy 2, such as calcium‐channel blockers 9 and, more recently, at least in patients with severe SSc‐related RP, phosphodiesterase V inhibitors 10, 11, 12. Angiotensin receptor blockers are sometimes recommended, but there is little evidence to support their efficacy 13. Intravenous prostanoids, particularly iloprost infusions, are recommended for patients with severe RP when treatment with other agents has failed 2, 9. Although intravenous iloprost has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing severity, frequency, and duration of RP attacks in patients with SSc 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, intravenous administration is burdensome. Currently, there is limited evidence for the benefit of oral prostacyclin analogs in patients with RP 8. Therefore, there is a need to identify oral therapies that act on the prostacyclin receptor for the management of RP secondary to SSc.

Selexipag is an oral, selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonist that has recently been approved for the long‐term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults with World Health Organization functional class II/III symptoms 19, 20. The present study aimed to determine the effect of selexipag on the frequency of RP attacks in patients with RP secondary to SSc.

Phase 3: Development of draft recommendations with level of evidence

Based on the collected task force meeting statements, draft recommendations were developed by both convenors (J. St.+E.E.). To determine the level of evidence for the draft recommendations, a literature search was performed. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for key systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after SRs that investigated the effectiveness of interventions targeting adults with SSc between January 1985 and September 2020. If no SRs or RCTs were available, international clinical practice guidelines or recommendations were consulted. According to the agreed method to answer research questions:

the literature search for 'fatigue' was expanded to include interventions for SLE and RA;
the literature search for 'joint protection' (hand function loss) was expanded to also include interventions for RA and OA;
the literature search for 'RP' was expanded to include interventions for primary RP; and
because of the lack of evidence, 13 medical specialists were consulted about non-pharmacological advises regarding DU.

For every research question, the found publications were screened by J. St. and E.E. for eligibility through reading the title and abstract. Potentially relevant articles were identified, and full text articles were evaluated independently by both convenors (J. St. and E.E.) and discussed until an agreement was achieved. Methodological quality and risk of bias in individual studies were assessed according to study level using the adapted second version of A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2), and the Joanne Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for RCTs was used to assess RCTs. Discrepancies in assessments between both convenors were discussed until consensus was reached. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine levels of evidence were used to assign levels of evidence for each individual draft recommendation.

Phase 4: Determining the level of agreement regarding definitive recommendations

In the fourth and final phase, the level of agreement regarding each draft recommendation was determined by the task force and the 13 involved medical specialists using an individual anonymous voting procedure. A numeric rating scale from 1, which indicates total disagreement, to 10, which indicates total agreement, was used. The mean. median, and range of the level of agreement for each recommendation were calculated. A recommendation was approved when ≥ 70% of the expert group indicated a score of ≥ 7 on the numeric rating scale.

### Evidence and consensus-based recommendations for non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue, hand function loss, Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis [^116acD7v]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The 34 recommendations stated in this study provide guidance on the non-pharmacological management of three of the most frequently described symptoms of SSc. The proposed recommendations can inform the content of non-pharmacological interventions in the Netherlands and can also be used in the development and optimization of national and international postgraduate educational offerings. More research, particularly regarding assistive technology, the adaptation of the patients' (work) environment to restore energy, and self-management strategies to support meaningful daily activities, is needed to enhance the autonomy and independence of patients with SSc.

### Management of Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ischemic lesions in scleroderma [^112AqK4d]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is a challenging problem in patients who have scleroderma. It causes a great deal of morbidity with recurrent painful attacks and frequent digital ischemic lesions. The strategy to treat the vascular disease must consider treatment for the vasospasm and the intrinsic vascular disease with intimal proliferation and vessel occlusion. Vasodilator therapy remains the main method to treat Raynaud's phenomenon, but new understanding of the pathobiology of scleroderma vascular disease is providing novel treatment options. We need more investigations into these vasoactive drugs before routine use can be recommended. Critical ischemia can cause deep tissue injury and digital loss. An aggressive approach to reversing an ischemic crisis is essential for preventing these severe events.

Early diagnosis, classification and stratification of risk

Early accurate diagnosis is important so that treatment can be given, education provided and risk of complications assessed. There is evidence that detection and diagnosis of SSc is often delayed. This may reflect the non-specific nature of many of the early symptoms [Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), reflux oesophagitis, fatigue, arthralgia, peripheral oedema and carpal tunnel syndrome], the rarity of SSc compared with other causes of these symptoms and unavailability of more specialized assessment tools such as SSc-specific autoantibody testing and microvascular diagnostic testing (capillaroscopy). Thus, on average there is a delay of > 10 years from onset of RP and over 12 months from non-Raynaud symptom onset to diagnosis. The working group considered that delays in diagnosis should be minimized, and patient organization initiatives can help. Although not the most frequent disease subset, diffuse cutaneous SSc is a particularly important diagnosis because of the early risk of severe internal organ complications and need for specialist referral and initiation of disease-modifying treatment with immunosuppression. Risk markers for poor outcome include diffuse skin involvement, elevated acute phase markers and presence of certain SSc-associated antinuclear antibodies. In addition, there are emerging new approaches to classification of SSc that may permit more precise or stratified approaches to investigation and treatment that will underpin individualized management.

### Management of systemic sclerosis-related skin disease: a review of existing and experimental therapeutic approaches [^113BaHZP]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The skin is the most common organ system involved in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Nearly all patients experience cutaneous symptoms, including sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, telangiectasias, and calcinosis. In addition to posing functional challenges, cutaneous symptoms are often a major cause of pain, psychological distress, and body image dissatisfaction. The present article reviews the main features of SSc-related cutaneous manifestations and highlights an evidence-based treatment approach for treating each manifestation. This article also describes novel treatment approaches and opportunities for further research in managing this important clinical dimension of SSc.

Abstract

Objective

SSc is a complex CTD affecting mental and physical health. Fatigue, hand function loss, and RP are the most prevalent disease-specific symptoms of systemic sclerosis. This study aimed to develop consensus and evidence-based recommendations for non-pharmacological treatment of these symptoms.

Methods

A multidisciplinary task force was installed comprising 20 Dutch experts. After agreeing on the method for formulating the recommendations, clinically relevant questions about patient education and treatments were inventoried. During a face-to-face task force meeting, draft recommendations were generated through a systematically structured discussion, following the nominal group technique. To support the recommendations, an extensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and six other databases until September 2020, and 20 key systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and published recommendations were selected. Moreover, 13 Dutch medical specialists were consulted on non-pharmacological advice regarding RP and digital ulcers. For each recommendation, the level of evidence and the level of agreement was determined.

Results

Forty-one evidence and consensus-based recommendations were developed, and 34, concerning treatments and patient education of fatigue, hand function loss, and RP/digital ulcers-related problems, were approved by the task force.

Conclusions

These 34 recommendations provide guidance on non-pharmacological treatment of three of the most frequently described symptoms in patients with systemic sclerosis. The proposed recommendations can guide referrals to health professionals, inform the content of non-pharmacological interventions, and can be used in the development of national and international postgraduate educational offerings.

### Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers: advances in evaluation and management [^112Qz3v6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to give an update on advances in evaluation and management of systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulceration, focusing on reports from the last 18 months. The increasing recognition of the huge impact of Raynaud's phenomenon and of digital ulceration on the everyday lives of patients with SSc has sparked enthusiasm internationally to develop better outcome measures and better treatments, and so a review is timely.

Recent Findings

There have been recent advances in the development of patient reported outcome instruments [e.g. the Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis-Digital Ulcers (HDISS-DU) instrument] and also in noninvasive imaging techniques, including thermography and laser Doppler methods. Improved outcome measures will facilitate future clinical trials, both early phase proof-of-concept and later phase trials. New insights have been gained into mechanisms of action and methods of administration of 'conventional' therapies, for example phosphodiesterase inhibitors and intravenous prostanoids. New treatment approaches are being investigated, including topical and procedural therapies.

Summary

Clinicians can look forward to seeing these advances translating into clinical benefit over the next 5 years. To help ensure this, they should strive whenever possible to recruit patients with SSc-related digital vasculopathy into observational studies and clinical trials.

CLINICAL CARE PATHWAY USING AN EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS AND AUTOANTIBODY TESTING

There are potential applications for autoantibody detection in the care of SSc patients based on evidence that autoantibodies in SSc are predictors of disease development, useful for diagnosis and definition of disease endotypes, prognosis, and indicators of potential therapeutic targets. A clinical care pathway is a structured and standardized strategy of care (usually multidisciplinary in nature) for a defined population incorporating evidence-based guidelines into practice using an algorithm or protocol to guide care. A proposed outline of a clinical care plan for evaluation and management of SSc with a particular focus on early diagnosis of SSc and the implementation of autoantibody testing is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Clinical care pathway using an early diagnosis of SSc and autoantibody testing. ACR-EULAR, American College of Rheumatology-European League Against Rheumatism; CT, computed tomography; PFT, pulmonary function test; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; RP, Raynaud's phenomenon; SSc, systemic sclerosis. Adapted from.

When considering a clinical care pathway for SSc, it is important to begin intervening at the earliest phases of disease. As mentioned previously, there are several definitions of early SSc and both the 'early SSc' and VEDOSS criteria include the detection of SSc autoantibodies. Even for UCTD and patients with capillarscopic changes, the presence of autoantibodies is an important indicator for faster progression to established SSc. Hence, the presence of SSc autoantibodies early in the disease course may identify patients who require closer follow-up, thus preventing a delay in diagnosis and hence better outcomes. Early SSc patients should be assessed for organ involvement. Detecting antibodies associated with SSc-related organ manifestations early in the disease course can guide directed investigations and monitoring for end-organ involvement in a cost-effective manner. The early phase of SSc is also a window of therapeutic opportunity for altering disease progression and also initiating treatment prior to irreversible damage. In the future, there may be interventions directed against functional autoantibodies and treatment may therefore be personalized to their autoantibody profile.

Raynaud phenomenon (RP) and associated digital ischemia can be among the most vexing clinical problems for patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Understanding the treatment approach to RP and associated ischemia and how to prevent digital ulcers is important for clinicians caring for these patients. This article reviews the management of RP and digital ischemic ulcers. The magnitude of the problem and pathophysiology of RP are first discussed, with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding of the disease process. Options for the practical pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for RP and digital ischemic ulcers are detailed.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^117SEYbv]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is the most common disease-specific manifestation of SSc. Virtually all people with SSc will experience cold sensitivity and exhibit other features of digital vascular compromise.

Self-management in the form of cold avoidance and effective measures to promote re-warming forms the mainstay of management. Most people with SSc can predict the occurrence of RP symptoms based on relevant environmental and/or contextual factors. Many people with SSc become adept at managing their symptoms, although this can be at the expense of social participation or rely on the support of others. Smoking is associated with worse digital vascular outcomes and support should be made available to achieve smoking cessation, including nicotine replacement therapy.

Pharmacological intervention should be considered for RP symptoms inadequately controlled through self-management. Registry analyses have identified wide variation in prescribing practices for SSc and indicate clinicians are not fully exploiting the range of therapeutic options available to them. Many pharmacological interventions have been assessed in RP and a recent network meta-analysis suggests the efficacy of treatments for SSc-RP are modest at best. Potential side effects common to all treatments designed to promote vasodilation include headaches (which often regress with repeated dosing) and hypotensive symptoms. Low resting blood pressure may influence the choice of treatment. It is prudent to commence a low dose of any vasoactive treatment for RP and increase gradually depending on tolerability and efficacy. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are generally considered the first line. Selective phosphodiesterase (PDE5i) inhibitors are increasingly being positioned as a second-line treatment for SSc-RP, and their use has been supported by the falling cost of generic non-proprietary brands. Such treatments may exert benefits on other aspects of SSc. Registry evidence has suggested treatments for RP such as CCBs may reduce the likelihood of developing PAH and left ventricular dysfunction in SSc.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon [^114L3nAH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasodilatory phenomenon characterised by digital pallor, cyanosis, and pain of the extremities. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon has no underlying disease associated with it, while secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis causes fibrosis and commonly affects the skin and internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidney, and heart. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are a class of drugs that increases blood flow to the extremities and may be beneficial in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of PDE5i compared to placebo for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trial registries up to June 2022. We did not apply any language restrictions. We searched the bibliographies of retrieved articles and contacted key experts in the field for additional and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PDE5i to placebo in people with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review included nine RCTs which ranged in duration from four to eight weeks and included a total of 411 participants. The majority had Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis. Tadalafil was assessed in four studies, sildenafil in three studies, vardenafil in one study, and a new PDE5 inhibitor known as "PF-00489791" in one study. Three studies were parallel design and six studies were cross-over. The frequency of attacks per week was 24 with placebo and PDE5i reduced the frequency of attacks by an average of three attacks per week (mean difference (MD) -3.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.15 to -1.00; 8 studies; low-certainty evidence). The duration of attacks per day was 55 minutes with placebo and PDE5i reduced the duration of attacks by an average of five minutes (MD -5.31, 95% CI -8.90 to -1.71; 8 studies; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence from one study with eight participants showed severity of Raynaud's attacks (assessed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale with lower scores indicating less severity) was 20% lower with a PDE5i (3.7 with placebo compared to 1.6 with treatment; MD -2.1, 95% CI -2.7 to 1.4; very low-certainty evidence). Pain and patient global assessment were assessed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale with lower scores indicating improvement. Low-certainty evidence showed that the use of PDE5i may result in little to no difference compared to placebo in reducing the average pain of Raynaud's attacks (3 to 2.9; MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.57; 4 studies). Global scores were 36% lower with the use of a PDE5i compared to placebo (9.2 to 5.6; MD -3.59, 95% CI -4.45 to -2.73; 1 study, 24 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of withdrawals during treatment with PDE5i ranged from 2% to 20% compared with 2% to 4% in the placebo group in five studies. Four studies reported no withdrawals due to adverse events. Seven studies reported no serious adverse events. The rate of serious adverse events reported in two studies ranFged from 2% during treatment to 4% with placebo. The majority of the studies were judged as low or unclear risk of bias for selection, performance, and detection bias. Almost half were judged at high risk of attrition bias and unclear risk for selective reporting bias. We downgraded frequency of attacks, duration of attacks, pain intensity, and patient global assessment for small sample sizes and concerns about inconsistency and graded each as low certainty of evidence. We downgraded severity of attacks to very low certainty due to serious concerns about imprecision and publication bias. We downgraded withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events to moderate certainty of evidence due to a low number of reported events.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, PDE5i may reduce the frequency of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon by a small amount per week, result in a small reduction in the duration of attack, improve patients' global assessment of their disease, and result in little to no difference in pain. PDE5i probably result in little or no difference in serious adverse events but slightly increase the likelihood of withdrawing from treatment due to an adverse event.

### Contemporary management of Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ischaemic complications [^111d8Lr5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review gives an update of the current management of Raynaud's phenomenon and its ischaemic complications (digital ulceration and critical ischaemia) and discusses possible further developments in the next 5–10 years. New approaches to therapy are being driven by increased understanding of pathophysiology and by increased international networking of clinicians and scientists, facilitating clinical trials.

Recent Findings

Key points include phosphodiesterase inhibitors most likely confer benefit, although clinical trials have given somewhat conflicting results, and have been short-term; a new topical, easy-to-use glyceryl trinitrate preparation has been shown to improve Raynaud's Condition Score; the endothelin-1 receptor antagonist bosentan has now been shown to reduce the number of new systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related digital ulcers in two multinational clinical trials; and although statin therapy is likely to confer benefit in SSc-related Raynaud's phenomenon, further research is required to confirm this.

Summary

New therapeutic approaches in patients who do not respond to more traditionally used vasodilators include phosphodiesterase inhibitors and (for those with recurrent SSc-related digital ulcers) endothelin-1 receptor antagonism. Several other potential new therapies are being researched. Optimal management of digital ulceration is multidisciplinary including tissue viability and (sometimes) surgical input.

### Systemic sclerosis in adults. part II: management and therapeutics [^111D1mV2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is complex, evolving, and requires a multidisciplinary approach. At diagnosis and throughout the disease course, clinical assessment and monitoring of skin involvement is vital using the modified Rodnan Skin Score, patient-reported outcomes, and new global composite scores (such as the Combined Response Index for Systemic Sclerosis, which also considers lung function). Immunomodulation is the mainstay of skin fibrosis treatment, with mycophenolate mofetil considered first line. Meanwhile vasculopathy-related manifestations (Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers) and calcinosis, require general measures combined with specific pharmacologic (calcium-channel blockers, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and prostanoids), nonpharmacologic (digital sympathectomy and botulinum toxin injections), and often multifaceted, management approaches. Patients should be screened at the time of diagnosis specifically for systemic manifestations and then regularly thereafter, with appropriate treatment. Numerous targeted therapeutic options for SSc, including skin fibrosis, are emerging and include B-cell depletion, anti-interleukin 6, Janus kinase, and transforming growth factor β inhibition. This second article in the continuing medical education series discusses these key aspects of SSc assessment and treatment, with particular focus on skin involvement. It is vital that dermatologists play a key role in the multidisciplinary approach to SSc management.

### Evidence and consensus-based recommendations for non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue, hand function loss, Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis [^1118U6Ga]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The EULAR recommendations for patient education for people with inflammatory arthritis considered patient education as an integral part of standard care. In this study, contrary to some existing recommendations, content for specific SSc-related patient education has been developed, and corresponding recommendations can contribute to the knowledge base related to multidisciplinary care and inform the content of self-management programs that focus on treating SSc and its consequences. Existing self-management programs for people with rheumatic diseases primarily aim at increasing knowledge, adhering to treatment, improving physical functioning and ensuring a healthy lifestyle. The approaches used were found to be mainly didactic and were mostly instructional, counselling and practical exercises. A deeper understanding of factors that influence self-management may improve self-management outcomes among patients with SSc and may inform treatment options tailored to meet individuals' needs and improve health outcomes and consequently the HRQoL of SSc patients.

Similar to the updated 2017 EULAR recommendations for treating systemic sclerosis, we used supportive evidence extrapolated from studies involving patients with other (rheumatic) conditions, including SLE, RA/OA and primary RP for developing these recommendations. This particularly applies to recommendations focussing on fatigue treatment. This could be seen as a limitation of our study. On the other hand, it is likely that in SSc, non-specific factors contribute to fatigue. Non-specific psycho-social aspects include coping skills, depression, lifestyle considerations, such as physical activity, diet or smoking, and also other contributors, such as comorbid conditions, simultaneous pain or sleep disorders. These non-disease-specific factors are also described in other chronic rheumatologic conditions, such as RA and SLE. Therefore, we assumed that apparently effective non-pharmacological interventions in such diseases should also be considered for SSc patients. For example, behavioural techniques, such as energy conservation and activity stimulation, have shown benefits in several chronic conditions. Moreover, low-impact aerobic exercises that gradually increase in intensity, duration and frequency may be effective for reducing fatigue as such exercises have demonstrated beneficial effects on RA, SLE and initial positive results in patients with SSc. The possibility of conducting adequately powered, high-quality RCTs involving only patients with SSc is limited due to the rarity and clinical heterogeneity of SSc. As SSc-specific evidence on non-pharmacological interventions is limited, in our opinion the way we developed these recommendations is a valid, second-best and efficient method.

### Diagnosis and management of scleroderma peripheral vascular disease [^113X3vdv]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The manifestations of peripheral vascular disease in patients who have systemic sclerosis (SSc) range from episodic Raynaud's phenomenon to irreversible tissue injury with ulceration and gangrene. Structural and functional changes may occur in the microvessels, digital arteries, and sometimes more proximal vessels. This article discusses the assessment of patients who have Raynaud's phenomenon in whom an underlying scleroderma-spectrum disorder is suspected and patients who have SSc with critical digital ischemia/ulceration. Different imaging techniques, including capillaroscopy and angiography, complement the history and examination, and developments in vascular imaging should facilitate future studies of pathogenesis and treatment response. New vasoactive treatments are currently being researched and older treatments revisited; therefore new approaches to therapy will likely be developed over the next 5 to 10 years.

Regarding medical management for Raynaud's phenomenon, more specifically with respect to CCBs, ESVM 2017 guidelines recommend to use slow-release nifedipine and increase dose gradually to minimize vasodilatory side effects. Encourage patients to tolerate minor side effects for 2–3 weeks, as they may subside with time.

Digital vasculopathy

Digital vasculopathy leads to Raynaud's and digital ischaemia with development of complications of severe vasculopathy including gangrene, ulceration and infection of superficial and deep tissues. Management of Raynaud's is central to the symptomatic treatment of SSc. Since 2015 there have been several studies exploring new treatments, but these have not led to new approved therapies. The challenge of outcome assessment in RP is recognized and new outcome measures are currently being validated. Digital ulceration almost always reflects vasculopathy even when there are other contributory factors such as calcinosis or trauma. Treatment in adults is supported by clinical trial evidence including two robust trials showing significant benefit for the non-selective endothelin antagonist bosentan in reducing the number of new DU in adults with SSc. Digital ulcers and severe ischaemia require urgent prioritized management and establishment of 'hot clinics' analogous to those for giant cell arteritis may be considered. Benefit from the selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE5i) tadalafil is considered by experts to be similar to sildenafil and may be considered as an alternative in those who are having difficulty with sildenafil. Experts agree that PDE5i and bosentan may be used in combination in severe cases, especially those being considered for intravenous prostanoids. Despite a lack of paediatric-specific trials, in children and adolescents similar approaches are used and are recommended by international paediatric consensus. However, it is important to consider the availability of paediatric dosing and safety data for specific therapies, e.g. currently available for sildenafil but not for tadalafil.

### Setting the international standard for longitudinal follow-up of patients with systemic sclerosis: a Delphi-based expert consensus on core clinical features [^117UKWv6]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a severe, progressive multiorgan disease but to date, there are no established standardised international guidelines for follow-up of patients with SSc. The goal of this project was to develop an expert consensus for annual systematic investigations in patients with SSc to enhance their standard-of-care.

Material and Methods

The Delphi method was applied. All SSc experts from the European Scleroderma Trials and Research group network and the Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium were invited to participate. All experts were asked to answer questionnaires in five Delphi steps to determine the domains of interest and tools for each domain for an annual systematic assessment of patients with SSc. Each item was rated on a scale between 0% and 100% (not and very important), and parameters rated > 80% by more than 75% of the experts were regarded as acceptable.

Results

In total, 157 experts worldwide participated with 71.3% experts seeing > 50patients with SSc annually. In the first round, 23 domains and 204 tools were suggested. After five Delphi steps, experts agreed on 10 domains including (1) Raynaud's phenomenon; (2) Digital ulcers; (3) Skin and mucosa; (4) Lung; (5); Heart; (6) GI domain, (7) Renal; (8) Musculoskeletal; (9) Laboratory and (10) Treatment. Overall, 55 tools were identified including clinical assessments, laboratory measurements and imaging or functional investigations.

Conclusion

Through five Delphi steps with world leading experts, a consensus was established on strongly suggested tools for a minimum annual systemic assessment of organ involvement in SSc. This work should enhance the standardisation and homogenisation of the practices.

Digital ulcer disease in SSc

What is the best management for digital ulceration in SSc?

Guideline recommendation for digital ulcers in SSc:

Severe digital vasculopathy with new tissue necrosis or critical ischaemia is an emergency requiring urgent clinical assessment (preferably within 48 hours) (1C, 95%).
Sildenafil (or tadalafil) is recommended as first-line agent in DU healing and secondary prevention and bosentan as second-line treatment in line with NHS England policy 210302P [1911] (1C, 99%).
Intravenous prostanoids may be considered to promote DU healing (1C, 98%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy in DU disease (particularly if local necrosis) (2C, 94%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) may be considered in those intolerant to systemic vasodilator meds and recurrent DU at a single site (2C, 95%).
Debridement of DU may promote healing (2C, 93%).
There should be access to SSc/CTD specialist wound care services to prevent and treat skin ulcers (1C, 98%).

What is the best management for Raynaud's phenomenon?

Guideline recommendation for RP in SSc:

Although therapeutic benefits appear modest, calcium channel blockers and other vasodilators should be considered in management of SSc-RP (1B, 100%).
Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i such as sildenafil, tadalafil) and intravenous prostanoids are effective as second-line agents for refractory SSc-RP (1B, 99%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) and statins in refractory SSc-RP given strong therapeutic rationale despite limited evidence (2C, 93%).
For rescue therapy in severe SSc-RP IV, prostanoids may be considered (1C, 99%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) which may be considered in severe and/or refractory cases of SSc-RP, particularly if systemic vasodilator therapies are poorly tolerated, e.g. low basal BP (2C, 93%).

### Systemic sclerosis / scleroderma: a treatable multisystem disease [^1125n3B1]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (systemic scleroderma) is a chronic connective tissue disease of unknown etiology that causes widespread microvascular damage and excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and internal organs. Raynaud phenomenon and scleroderma (hardening of the skin) are hallmarks of the disease. The typical patient is a young or middle-age woman with a history of Raynaud phenomenon who presents with skin induration and internal organ dysfunction. Clinical evaluation and laboratory testing, along with pulmonary function testing, Doppler echocardiography, and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, establish the diagnosis and detect visceral involvement. Patients with systemic sclerosis can be classified into two distinct clinical subsets with different patterns of skin and internal organ involvement, autoantibody production, and survival. Prognosis is determined by the degree of internal organ involvement. Although no disease-modifying therapy has been proven effective, complications of systemic sclerosis are treatable, and interventions for organ-specific manifestations have improved substantially. Medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-II receptor blockers for Raynaud phenomenon, appropriate treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease) and lifestyle modifications can help prevent complications, such as digital ulcers and Barrett esophagus. Endothelin-1 receptor blockers and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors improve pulmonary arterial hypertension. The risk of renal damage from scleroderma renal crisis can be lessened by early detection, prompt initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, and avoidance of high-dose corticosteroids. Optimal patient care includes an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to promptly and effectively recognize, evaluate, and manage complications and limit end-organ dysfunction.

### Calcium channel blockers for primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon [^113ipp9x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasospastic disease characterized by digital pallor, cyanosis, and extremity pain. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is not associated with underlying disease, but secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and mixed connective tissue disease. Calcium channel blockers promote vasodilation and are commonly used when drug treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon is required.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) versus placebo for treatment of individuals with Raynaud's phenomenon with respect to Raynaud's type (primary vs secondary) and type and dose of CCBs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (May 19, 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to May 19, 2017), Embase (1947 to May 19, 2017), clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Portal. We applied no language restrictions. We also searched bibliographies of retrieved articles and contacted key experts for additional and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing calcium channel blockers versus placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and risk of bias and extracted trial data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

This review contains 38 RCTs (33 cross-over RCTs) with an average duration of 7.4 weeks and 982 participants; however, not all trials reported all outcomes of interest. Nine of the identified trials studied patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon (N = 365), five studied patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (N = 63), and the rest examined a mixture of patients with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (N = 554). The most frequently encountered risk of bias types were incomplete outcome data and poor reporting of randomization and allocation methods. When researchers considered both primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency) from 23 trials with 528 participants indicates that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of attacks. CCBs reduced the average number of attacks per week by six (weighted mean difference (WMD) -6.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.60 to - 5.67; I² = 98%) compared with 13.7 attacks per week with placebo. When review authors excluded Kahan 1985C, a trial showing a very large reduction in the frequency of attacks, data showed that CCBs reduced attack frequency by 2.93 per week (95% CI -3.44 to -2.43; I² = 77%). Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and inconsistency) from six trials with 69 participants suggests that the average duration of attacks did not differ in a statistically significant or clinically meaningful way between CCBs and placebo (WMD -1.67 minutes, 95% CI -3.29 to 0); this is equivalent to a -9% difference (95% CI -18% to 0%). Moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for inconsistency) based on 16 trials and 415 participants showed that CCBs reduced attack severity by 0.62 cm (95% CI -0.72 to - 0.51) on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (lower scores indicate less severity); this was equivalent to absolute and relative percent reductions of 6% (95% CI -11% to -8%) and 9% (95% CI -11% to -8%), respectively, which may not be clinically meaningful. Improvement in Raynaud's pain (low-quality evidence; downgraded for imprecision and inconsistency) and in disability as measured by a patient global assessment (moderate-quality evidence; downgraded for imprecision) favored CCBs (pain: WMD -1.47 cm, 95% CI -2.21 to -0.74; patient global: WMD -0.37 cm, 95% CI -0.73 to 0, when assessed on a 0 to 10 cm visual analogue scale, with lower scores indicating less pain and less disability). However, these effect estimates were likely underpowered, as they were based on limited numbers of participants, respectively, 62 and 92. For pain assessment, absolute and relative percent improvements were 15% (95% -22% to -7%) and 47% (95% CI -71% to -24%), respectively. For patient global assessment, absolute and relative percent improvements were 4% (95% CI -7% to 0%) and 9% (95% CI -19% to 0%), respectively. Subgroup analyses by Raynaud's type, CCB class, and CCB dose suggest that dihydropyridine CCBs in higher doses may be more effective for primary Raynaud's than for secondary Raynaud's, and CCBs likely have a greater effect in primary than in secondary Raynaud's. However, differences were small and were not found for all outcomes. Dihydropyridine CCBs were studied as they are the subgroup of CCBs that are not cardioselective and are traditionally used in RP treatment whereas other CCBs such as verapamil are not routinely used and diltiazem is not used as first line subtype of CCBs. Most trial data pertained to nifedipine. Withdrawals from studies due to adverse effects were inconclusive owing to a wide CI (risk ratio [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.33) from two parallel studies with 63 participants (low-quality evidence downgraded owing to imprecision and a high attrition rate); absolute and relative percent differences in withdrawals were 6% (95% CI -14% to 26%) and 30% (95% CI -49% to 233%), respectively. In cross-over trials, although a meta-analysis was not performed, withdrawals were more common with CCBs than with placebo. The most common side effects were headache, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, and ankle edema. However, in all trials, no serious adverse events (death or hospitalization) were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Randomized controlled trials with evidence of low to moderate quality showed that CCBs (especially the dihydropyridine class) may be useful in reducing the frequency, duration, severity of attacks, pain and disability associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. Higher doses may be more effective than lower doses and these CCBs may be more effective in primary RP. Although there were more withdrawals due to adverse events in the treatment groups, no serious adverse events were reported.

### New horizons in systemic sclerosis treatment: advances and emerging therapies in 2025 [^113EgGQf]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology and literature search

This manuscript was developed as a narrative review with the objective of providing a comprehensive and clinically relevant synthesis of current organ-based management strategies and emerging therapeutic approaches in SSc. To inform the review, a targeted literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the proceedings of major international rheumatology congresses (EULAR, ACR) up to April 2025. Search terms included combinations of: "systemic sclerosis", "scleroderma", "interstitial lung disease", "pulmonary arterial hypertension", "Raynaud's phenomenon", "digital ulcers", "renal crisis", "gastrointestinal involvement", "skin fibrosis", "emerging therapies", "clinical trials" and "precision medicine".

Priority was given to phase II–III clinical trials, recent international guidelines (including the 2023 EULAR recommendations), and ongoing trials investigating novel therapeutic targets in SSc. Foundational or landmark studies published prior to this time frame were also included where they remain essential to guiding current clinical practice. Additional references were identified through citation chaining and based on the authors' expertise in SSc clinical care and research.

Emerging therapies and novel therapies in SSc

Current treatment approaches largely focus on managing individual organ manifestations — targeting inflammation, fibrosis and vascular dysfunction — rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. Despite advances in immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies, the absence of truly disease-modifying treatments capable of altering the disease trajectory highlights a critical gap in care. Table 1 represents emerging and novel therapies in SSc.

Table 1
Emerging therapies in SSc

Given the pivotal role of B cells in SSc, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T19) therapy — a groundbreaking treatment originally developed for haematological malignancies — has emerged as a potential game-changer for autoimmune diseases, including SSc. CAR-T19 therapy selectively targets and depletes CD19+B cells, offering a more profound and potentially long-lasting immunomodulatory effect compared with conventional B-cell depletion therapies like RTX.

Digital vasculopathy

Digital vasculopathy leads to Raynaud's and digital ischaemia with development of complications of severe vasculopathy including gangrene, ulceration, and infection of superficial and deep tissues. In children, similar approaches used to adults but consider availability of jSSc dosing and pharmacokinetic data.

What is the best management for digital ulceration in SSc?

Recommendation for digital ulcers (DU) in SSc:

Severe digital vasculopathy with new tissue necrosis or critical ischaemia is an emergency requiring urgent clinical assessment (preferably within 48 h) (1C, 95%).
Sildenafil (or tadalafil) is recommended as first line agent in DU healing and secondary prevention and bosentan as second-line treatment in line with NHS England policy 210302P [1911] (1C, 99%).
I.v. prostanoids may be considered to promote DU healing (1C, 98%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy in DU disease (particularly if local necrosis) (2C, 94%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) may be considered in those intolerant to systemic vasodilator meds and recurrent DU at a single site (2C, 95%).
Debridement of DU may promote healing (2C, 93%).
There should be access to SSc/CTD specialist wound care services to prevent and treat skin ulcers (1C, 98%).

What is the best management for RP?

Guideline recommendation for RP in SSc:

Although therapeutic benefits appear modest, calcium channel blockers and other vasodilators should be considered in management of SSc-RP (1B, 100%).
PDE5i (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil) and i.v. prostanoids are effective as second-line agent for refractory SSc-RP (1B, 99%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) and statins in refractory SSc-RP given strong therapeutic rationale despite limited evidence (2C, 93%).
For rescue therapy in severe SSc-RP, i.v. prostanoids may be considered (1C, 99%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) which may be considered in severe and/or refractory cases of SSc-RP — particularly if systemic vasodilator therapies poorly tolerated, e.g. low basal blood pressure (2C, 93%).

### Two faces of the same coin: Raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis [^1138aPVf]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by wide-spread fibrosis, activation of immune system with production of autoantibodies and extensive vascular damage. Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and digital ulcers (DU) represent two faces of the same coin in SSc vasculopathy. RP, the earliest manifestation of the vascular involvement, is due to an excessive vasospasm of digital arteries, precapillary arterioles and cutaneous arteriovenous shunts, usually in response to cold exposure or other stimuli. DU are a severe complication of microvessel involvement and also of the persistent vasospasm of RP. Thus, the management of RP and DU requires a multimodal approach using a combination of pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical treatments. Currently, the treatment of these complications represents a great challenge for all physicians.

### New horizons in systemic sclerosis treatment: advances and emerging therapies in 2025 [^117DGahy]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, multisystem autoimmune disease characterised by vasculopathy, immune dysregulation, and progressive fibrosis, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. While recent EULAR recommendations have updated the standard of care for SSc, the field is rapidly evolving with novel therapeutic strategies and precision medicine approaches. Traditional immunosuppressive therapies-including mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide and rituximab-remain essential for controlling skin and lung involvement while autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers a proven disease-modifying option for selected high-risk patients. Tocilizumab and nintedanib have established roles in lung preservation in SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), early combination therapy with endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, complemented by newer agents such as selexipag and riociguat, has improved survival and quality of life. Advances in gastrointestinal, renal and musculoskeletal management continue to evolve, with promising roles for intravenous immunoglobulin and novel prokinetics. Crucially, emerging therapies-including CD19-targeted CAR-T cells, bispecific antibodies and agents targeting interferon pathways, BAFF, melanocortin, FcRn and PDE4B-reflect a shift towards personalised and biomarker-driven approaches. These innovations offer the potential to alter disease trajectory and support early, targeted intervention in SSc. This review provides an up-to-date synthesis of both current organ-based treatment strategies in major organ domains-skin, ILD, PAH, scleroderma renal crisis, raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal involvement-and emerging therapies in SSc, with an emphasis on disease-modifying approaches and future directions in personalised care.

### Vasoactive therapies in systemic sclerosis [^114WoBt3]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

In systemic sclerosis (SSc), vasculopathy is a central mechanism and is a major initial event in the process of sclerosis and causing different complications such as Raynaud's phenomenon, ulcer(s) or pulmonary hypertension, the latter being life threatening. Therefore, vasoactive therapies are important when taking care of patients with SSc. However, as treatment has been difficult, numerous therapeutic modalities have been suggested. Until now, the interpretation of most studies is limited due to the heterogeneity of patient groups, the low number of patients, the short duration of the treatments and, possibly, further pathogenic mechanisms such as autoimmunity. Several drugs are now available with effects on vasculopathy and, furthermore, on specific pathogenic mechanisms in SSc. Prostacyclins, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have potential effects on fibrosis, inflammation and endothelial cells, suggesting a disease-modifying capacity in systemic sclerosis. This review summarizes evidence-based therapy recommendations.

Early diagnosis of SSc

The cardinal aspects of early diagnosis must incorporate history, examination and investigation. There are substantial implications for making a diagnosis of SSc and important considerations when the diagnosis is confidently excluded. There will be people where a risk of future development of SSc is identified. Making an early diagnosis includes the following:

History: Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) provides a window of opportunity for early diagnosis although in early dcSSc where sometimes Raynaud's onset is contemporaneous with, or even after, onset of non-Raynaud's manifestations of SSc.
Examination: Puffy fingers.
Investigation: Includes ANA, nailfold capillaroscopy, SSc-specific autoantibodies.

Over the past few years, the concept of very early diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (VEDOSS) has emerged. This is important because emerging data suggest that significant complications of the disease may already be developing at this stage. It is notable that cases with all the 'red flag' VEDOSS features of RP, puffy fingers, ANA, SSc-specific antibody, abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy would already fulfil 2013 EULAR/ACR Classification criteria for SSc but those with incomplete features have a high probability of progression to SSc.

Nailfold capillaroscopy is central to diagnosis, although a recent survey suggested 41% of UK rheumatologists do not access capillaroscopy on site and 27% do not use capillaroscopy at all.

Early onset features of SSc in children are much less defined and might be influenced by distinct features of jSSc such as greater frequency of overlap manifestations and different ANA profiles form adult-onset SSc. Expertise in paediatric nailfold capillaroscopy is limited with a UK survey showing 14% of paediatric rheumatologists did not undertake capillaroscopy. Additionally, normative values for children are not yet established. Assessment of nailfold capillaries is central to early diagnosis and differentiating primary from secondary RP and may be undertaken using a dermatoscope, or low-cost USB microscope if more sophisticated capillaroscopy is not available.

In considering early diagnosis, cases of SSc that present with organ-based complications without pre-existing diagnosis of SSc are important. These are seen in PH, ILD and gastroenterology clinics as well as in acute medicine and nephrology for cases of scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), where up to 20% may not have a pre-existing diagnosis. Classification criteria for SRC are being developed that will also assist with earlier diagnosis of SSc in these cases.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Raynaud phenomenon [^1137SoAP]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

The past 10 years have seen the publication of results from several multicentre clinical trials in primary and systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related Raynaud phenomenon. The publication of these studies has occurred as a result of new insights into the pathogenesis of Raynaud phenomenon, which are directing new treatment approaches, and increased international collaboration between clinicians and scientists. Although the pathogenesis of Raynaud phenomenon is complex, abnormalities of the blood vessel wall, of neural control mechanisms and of intravascular (circulating) factors are known to interact and contribute. Key players relevant in drug development include nitric oxide, endothelin-1, alpha adrenergic receptor activation, abnormal signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle, oxidative stress and platelet activation. The main advances in diagnosis have been a clearer understanding of autoantibodies and of abnormal nailfold capillary patterns as independent predictors of SSc, and widespread use and increased availability of capillaroscopy. The ultimate aim is to translate the advances made in the pathophysiology and early diagnosis into development of treatments to prevent and reverse digital vascular dysfunction and injury. This Review provides an update of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Raynaud phenomenon. Current and future treatment approaches are discussed, and some key unanswered questions are highlighted.

### Current status of outcome measure development for clinical trials in systemic sclerosis. report from OMERACT 6 [^114N4Ccp]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is a complex, multisystem disease that results in severe morbidity, disability, and life-threatening complications. The wide range of biological systems clinically involved, and the large spectrum of disease activity and damage that occurs in this disease have limited clinical investigation of SSc, especially therapeutic trials. The OMERACT 6 Workshop on Systemic Sclerosis was conceived as a starting point for the process of assessing the current state of the science in outcome assessment in SSc and then setting a realistic research agenda and priorities for future work in this area This article reviews the current status of assessment tools for research in SSc within the main fundamental domains of illness in SSc, including problems related to skin, pulmonary, cardiac, peripheral vascular (Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulceration), renal, and musculoskeletal systems as well as health-related quality of life and physical functioning. The current level of validation of outcome measures in SSc is assessed according to the guidelines set forth by prior OMERACT meetings.

### Setting the international standard for longitudinal follow-up of patients with systemic sclerosis: a Delphi-based expert consensus on core clinical features [^1169AgeL]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a severe multiorgan disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and impaired quality of life. Lung and heart involvement are currently the major causes of disease-related deaths in SSc, while scleroderma renal crisis was the predominant cause of death in previous decades. Skin, gastrointestinal (GI) and musculoskeletal involvement, digital ulcers (DU) and Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) have shown to be associated with high morbidity, reduced quality of life and lower social functioning.SSc can be progressive and many of the disease features including ILD and GI dysfunction can aggravate over time. In 2013, new classification criteria for SSc were launched and they have been shown to be a major step forward in identifying patients with SSc particularly at early stages compared with previous criteria. Although early classification has been improved, there are no standardised international guidelines for the follow-up of patients with SSc. One exception is the 2015 European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) guideline recommending annual echocardiography (echo) in all patients with SSc to determine the risk of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recent studies indicate that echo screening has resulted in earlier PH diagnosis, with earlier onset of specific therapies and increased survival. It is therefore conceivable that a standardised follow-up of other disease features than PAH could have beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with SSc, improve quality of care and impact quality of life. The follow-up of patients with SSc may also vary between academic centres and non-academic centres; therefore, a unified, standardised annual systemic assessment of organ involvement in SSc should exist to guarantee all patients with SSc an adequate standard of care regardless of location and centre.

The European Scleroderma Trials and Research group (EUSTAR) has been founded in Europe to foster the study of SSc with the aim of achieving equality of assessment and care of patients with SSc according to evidence-based principles throughout the world. Their work has enhanced the awareness of SSc worldwide substantially leading, among other things, to an increased number of clinical trials. With new treatment options for SSc in pipeline, the interest in developing valid methods for a standardised follow-up of patients has increased to diagnose disease progression at an early stage and to be able to start treatment in a timely matter.

The aim of the present study was to establish an expert consensus regarding the annual systemic assessment of organ involvement in SSc and to develop easily applicable tools that may ensure an adequate standard of care for all patients with SSc and enhance the standardisation and homogenisation of the practices worldwide.

### Current drug therapy for scleroderma and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: evidence-based review [^112fqd5Q]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

(1) Scleroderma and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon are frequently associated with increased morbidity for which no specific standardised treatment guidelines exist. (2) Current therapies for scleroderma target the immune system, with the goal of reducing inflammation and secondary tissue injury and fibrosis. Therapy targeting underlying vascular disease is designed to improve the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon and to reduce ischemic injury to involved organs. (3) Few controlled trials of therapy used for scleroderma are completed, and current treatments are largely based on organ-specific therapy and uncontrolled case series suggesting disease modification. (4) Recent randomised, controlled trials in scleroderma demonstrate promising results in the treatment of interstitial lung disease with cyclophosphamide, and vascular disease of the lungs and digits with endothelin receptor antagonists, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil and prostacyclins, while trials with methotrexate show only modest benefit in controlling scleroderma-associated skin disease. (5) Prostacyclins are a therapeutic option in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Modest benefits have also been shown with alpha1-antagonists and calcium channel blockers, while the effect of ACE inhibitors has been variable. Some data suggest some benefits to the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil, the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine and the angiotensin receptor inhibitor losartan.

### Progression of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon to systemic sclerosis: a five-year analysis of the European scleroderma trial and research group multicentre, longitudinal registry study for very early diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (VEDOSS) [^114Ryatw]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Preliminary criteria for the very early diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (VEDOSS) have been previously proposed to identify signs and symptoms in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Patients with all signs or symptoms of the VEDOSS criteria already fulfil the 2013 American College of Rheumatology-European League Against Rheumatism (ACR-EULAR) classification criteria for systemic sclerosis. However, prospective data for the evolution to fulfilling these criteria do not exist. We therefore aimed to determine the clinical value of the VEDOSS criteria to identify patients with Raynaud's phenomenon who progress to systemic sclerosis within 5 years.

Methods

The VEDOSS project was a multicentre, longitudinal registry study done in 42 European Scleroderma Trial and Research group centres located in 20 countries in Europe, North America, and South America. Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon were eligible for enrolment. Those who had fulfilled the 1980 ACR or the 2013 ACR-EULAR classification criteria for systemic sclerosis, as well as of any other ACR or EULAR classification criteria for other definite connective tissue diseases at enrolment were excluded. Data were recorded each year during follow-up visits and included the four VEDOSS criteria (ie, positivity for antinuclear antibodies [ANAs], puffy fingers, systemic sclerosis-specific autoantibodies, and abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy). The primary endpoint was the fulfilment of the 2013 ACR-EULAR classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (ie, progression from enrolment to follow-up). Proportion of progressors and VEDOSS criteria interaction were reported descriptively. Predictors of progression of the distinct VEDOSS criteria interactions were determined based on the point prevalence at 5 years. To investigate the intermediate course of progression of the distinct VEDOSS criteria and their combinations, Kaplan-Meier analysis was done.

Results

Between March 1, 2010, and Oct 4, 2018, we enrolled 1150 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon in the VEDOSS database. 764 (66.4%) of 1150 patients met the VEDOSS criteria for study inclusion. Of the 764 patients, 553 (72.4%) had at least one available follow-up visit and the median duration of follow-up was 3.6 years (IQR 1.7–5.8). The mean age was 45.9 years (SD 15.0), 507 (91.7%) of 553 participants were female, and the median time since the onset of Raynaud's phenomenon was 4.0 years (IQR 1.7–10.0). At baseline, 401 (73.7%) of 544 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon had detectable ANA, with 208 (39.5%) of 527 patients positive for systemic sclerosis-specific autoantibodies. Nailfold capillaroscopy abnormalities were present in 182 (36.0%) of 505 patients and puffy fingers were detected in 96 (17.8%) of 540 at baseline. 1885 follow-up visits were recorded. 254 (45.9%) of 553 patients completed the study with progression or a 5-year follow-up; of whom, 133 reached the primary endpoint, resulting in an overall progression rate of 52.4%. The absence of ANA at baseline was the factor most strongly associated with a lack of progression within 5 years, with only four (10.8%) of 37 ANA-negative patients progressing. Conversely, positivity at baseline for systemic sclerosis-specific autoantibodies and puffy fingers was the combination having the highest risk of progression (16 [94.1%] of 17).

Interpretation

Our results from the VEDOSS project offers a useful tool for a stratified risk approach to patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. The absence of ANA is a strong protective factor that identifies patients with very low risk of developing systemic sclerosis whereas the presence of one or two VEDOSS criteria in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon confers a progressively higher risk for systemic sclerosis over time. This stratification tool can be used both for clinical management and to inform early interventional trials.

### Agreement with guidelines from a large database for management of systemic sclerosis: results from the Canadian scleroderma research group [^116CpDxJ]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We determined congruence with published guidelines from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/EULAR Scleroderma Trials and Research group, for systemic sclerosis (SSc) investigations and treatment practices within the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group (CSRG).

Methods

Investigations and medication use for SSc complications were obtained from records of patients with SSc in the CSRG to determine adherence to guidelines for patients enrolled before and after the guidelines were published.

Results

The CSRG database of 1253 patients had 992 patients with SSc enrolled before publication of the guidelines and 261 after. For pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatment, there were no differences in use before and after the guidelines, yet annual echocardiograms for PAH screening were done in 95% of patients enrolled before the guidelines and in only 86% of those enrolled after (p < 0.0001), and fewer followup echocardiograms were done 1 year later in the latter group (88% vs 59%). No differences were found for the frequency of PAH-specific treatment; 60% had ever used calcium channel blockers for Raynaud's phenomenon, with no differences in the groups before and after the guidelines. But the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (which does not have guidelines) was increased in the after-guidelines group. Proton pump inhibitors were used in > 80% with gastroesophageal reflux disease before and after the guidelines. One-quarter with gastrointestinal symptoms were taking prokinetic drugs. For those with past SSc renal crisis, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was not different before and after the guidelines. For early diffuse SSc < 2 years, ever-use of methotrexate was similar (one-quarter of each group); and for symptomatic interstitial lung disease, 19% had ever used cyclophosphamide before the guidelines and 9% after (p = nonsignificant). CSRG practices were generally comparable to recently published guidelines; however, use of iloprost and bosentan was low for digital ulcers because these drugs are not approved for use in Canada.

Conclusion

There did not seem to be an increase in adherence to recommendations once the guidelines were published. For many guidelines, 25% to 40% of patients who would qualify received the recommended treatment.

### Systemic sclerosis: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^112SVNEH]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Vascular and ulcers

Six references were included in the domain 'Vascular & Ulcers'.

First, the North American Working Group regarding the classification of digital ulcers (DUs) in SSc developed a consensus for the classification of DUs, which after training of rheumatologists with SSc expertise could be used with fair reliability to classify DUs and to measure ulcer area.

Second, Fujimoto et al described, on behalf of the Wound/Burn Guidelines Committee of the Japanese Dermatological Association, recommendations for the management of skin ulcers associated with CTD/vasculitis. In this way, an algorithm for SSc-related ulcers was proposed, as well as a reply to frequently asked questions in the care of SSc-related ulcers. Third, Hughes et al published, on behalf of the UKSSG, a best practice consensus recommendation for digital vasculopathy intended as a reference tool to inform management. In this way algorithms for the management of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), DUs and critical digital ischaemia in patients with SSc have been proposed.

Fourth, in the recommendations by expert groups of Pistorius et al, on behalf of the French Society of Vascular Medicine and the French Society for Microcirculation, clinical guidelines (more specifically clinical examination, nailfold capillaroscopy and antinuclear antibodies) as a work-up of patients with RP were defined. Besides this, a consensus-based recommendation was recently developed to diagnose RP and primary RP. Unfortunately, high evidence level guidelines based on the combination of a representative committee, systematic review and synthesis of evidence are lacking on the topic of primary versus secondary RP.

Interestingly, points to consider for clinical trials in SSc-associated RP have also been suggested by Cutolo et al.

Gastrointestinal

Three references were included concerning 'GI' recommendations.

Alantar et al described, on behalf of a French multidisciplinary working group, recommendations for the care of oral involvement (prevention of oral and dental complications, as well as SSc-tailored dental treatment) in patients with SSc.

Baron et al published, on behalf of the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group, recommendations for the screening and management of malnutrition and GI-related manifestations. Lastly, Hansi et al proposed, on behalf of the UKSSG, symptom-based algorithms as a useful tool and point of reference concerning gastro-oesophageal symptoms, abdominal pain and distention, weight loss and nutritional issues, diarrhoea, incontinence and constipation.

### Worldwide expert agreement on updated recommendations for the treatment of systemic sclerosis [^113f1Zea]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate agreement of the updated European League Against Rheumatism and European Scleroderma Trials and Research group (EUSTAR) recommendations for treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc) among international experts. In addition, to determine factors that might influence agreement.

Methods

Level of agreement (10-point scale: 0 = not at all, 10 = completely agree) and local drug availability (yes/no) were assessed using an online survey. The Web link to the survey was shared with 481 unique e-mail addresses and SSc networks (Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium, Australian Scleroderma Interest Group, International Systemic Sclerosis Inception Cohort). Level of agreement was compared between subgroups stratified for participant characteristics.

Results

In total, 263 experts participated, of whom n = 209 (79%) completed each single item. The majority were rheumatologists (n = 200, 76%) working in Europe (n = 185; 71%); 59% (n = 156) were EUSTAR members; and 57% (n = 151) had > 10 years of clinical experience. Overall level of agreement was high (mean 8.0, SD 2.5). The 3 highest mean agreements included (1) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for scleroderma renal crisis (9.2, SD 2.1); (2) blood pressure control in SSc-patients treated with corticosteroids (9.0, SD 2.2); (3) proton pump inhibitors to prevent reflux complications (9.0, SD 2.2). The 3 lowest mean agreements included (1) fluoxetine for Raynaud phenomenon (RP; 4.6, SD 2.8); (2) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe SSc (7.1, SD 2.9); (3) phosphodiesterase inhibitors 5 for RP (7.3, SD 2.7). Agreement differed between Europe and non-Europe for the use of iloprost, bosentan, methotrexate, HSCT, and cyclophosphamide. Treatment availability could partially explain differential agreement for iloprost, bosentan, and HSCT.

Conclusion

In general, worldwide expert agreement on updated recommendations for treatment of SSc is high, supporting their value. Differences in agreement are partially explained by geographical area and treatment availability.

### 2013 classification criteria for systemic sclerosis: an American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^115of3xV]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ACR/EULAR classification criteria for systemic sclerosis" for systemic sclerosis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for systemic sclerosis is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with systemic sclerosis, a chronic connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The criteria are based on a scoring system that takes into account various clinical features and laboratory findings associated with the disease.

The primary components of the criteria include skin thickening, fingertip lesions, telangiectasia, abnormal nailfold capillaries, pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, and the presence of systemic sclerosis-related autoantibodies. Each of these components is assigned a specific score based on its presence or absence, and the severity or extent of the manifestation.

Skin thickening is a key component, with the highest score assigned to skin thickening of the fingers of both hands extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints. The presence of alternative scleroderma-like disorder diagnoses causing skin thickening is also considered, with a high score assigned if such disorders are not present. Fingertip lesions, such as digital tip ulcers or fingertip pitting scars, are also included in the criteria. The presence of telangiectasia, abnormal nailfold capillaries, pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease, and Raynaud's phenomenon are each assigned a score. The presence of systemic sclerosis-related autoantibodies, including anti-centromere, anti-Scl-70, and/or anti-RNA polymerase III, is also considered.

The total score is calculated by summing the scores for each component. A score of 59 or higher indicates that the diagnostic criteria for systemic sclerosis are met. This scoring system allows for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, facilitating accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of systemic sclerosis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for systemic sclerosis calculator is a tool designed to evaluate various clinical and serological features related to systemic sclerosis, providing a numerical score that helps in determining if diagnostic criteria are met.

The calculator processes eight key inputs:

- **Entry criteria**: Options include skin thickening of the fingers or the absence of alternative diagnoses. Both options automatically contribute 25 points due to their foundational nature in the assessment.
- **Skin thickening**: The degree and location of skin thickening add points: 9 points for thickening on both hands extending beyond the metacarpophalangeal joints, 4 points for sclerodactyly limited to between joints, 2 points for puffy fingers, and 0 if none.
- **Fingertip lesions**: Presence of digital tip ulcers contributes 2 points, whereas fingertip pitting scars add 3 points. No lesions result in 0 points.
- **Telangiectasia**: If present, adds 2 points to the total score; if absent, it contributes 0 points.
- **Abnormal nailfold capillaries**: This condition, if present, adds another 2 points. If absent, it contributes no points.
- **Pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease**: This feature provides an additional 3 points if present, with 0 points if absent.
- **Raynaud's phenomenon**: The presence of this phenomenon also contributes 2 points, with no extra points if absent.
- **Systemic sclerosis-related autoantibodies**: Presence of specific autoantibodies yields 3 additional points; an absence results in 0 points.

Each input is assigned a score as per predefined scales, contributing to a comprehensive total score. The total score informs the interpretation:

| **Total score** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 59 | Diagnostic criteria are met |
| < 59 | Diagnostic criteria are not met |

In essence, this calculator sums these individual features' scores to provide a total that guides the diagnostic process, with 59 being the threshold above which the systemic sclerosis diagnostic criteria are deemed to be met.

Methods used to formulate recommendations

A draft document was then circulated to the full GWG for review. Each suggested recommendation in the final document was evaluated by all members and subjected to a vote relating to strength of agreement on, e.g. a scale of 1 [no agreement] to 100% [complete agreement]. The working group members then scored each recommendation on the same scale, and the mean was calculated to generate a strength of agreement (SoA) score. The wording of each recommendation was revised until all members were satisfied that they would score at least 80%.

In addition, and in accordance with the BSR protocol accompanying each recommendation in parenthesis is a statement reflecting the strength of recommendation and quality of supporting evidence.

### State-of-the-art evidence in the treatment of systemic sclerosis [^117MWgCz]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune connective tissue disease with multi-organ involvement, fibrosis and vasculopathy. Treatment in SSc, including early diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) and the use of organ-specific therapies, has improved, as evident from randomized clinical trials. Treatments for early dcSSc include immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, rituximab and tocilizumab. Patients with rapidly progressive early dcSSc might be eligible for autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which can improve survival. Morbidity from interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension is improving with the use of proven therapies. Mycophenolate mofetil has surpassed cyclophosphamide as the initial treatment for SSc-interstitial lung disease. Nintedanib and possibly perfinidone can be considered in SSc pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is frequently treated with initial combination therapy (for example, with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists) and, if necessary, the addition of a prostacyclin analogue. Raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcers are treated with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (especially nifedipine), then phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors or intravenous iloprost. Bosentan can reduce the development of new digital ulcers. Trial data for other manifestations are mostly lacking. Research is needed to develop targeted and highly effective treatments, best practices for organ-specific screening and early intervention, and sensitive outcome measurements.

### Treatment algorithms for systemic sclerosis according to experts [^111ShXMn]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

There is a lack of agreement regarding treatment for many aspects of systemic sclerosis (SSc). We undertook this study to generate SSc treatment algorithms endorsed by a high percentage of SSc experts.

Methods

Experts from the Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium and the Canadian Scleroderma Research group (n = 170) were asked whether they agreed with SSc algorithms from 2012. Two consensus rounds refined agreement; 62, 54, and 48 experts (36%, 32%, and 28%, respectively) completed the first, second, and third surveys, respectively.

Results

For treatment of scleroderma renal crisis, 81% of experts agreed (first-, second-, and third-line treatments were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, then adding calcium-channel blockers [CCBs], then adding angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], respectively). For pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), 81% of experts agreed (for mild PAH, treatments were phosphodiesterase 5 [PDE5] inhibitors, then endothelin receptor antagonists plus PDE5 inhibitors, then prostanoids, respectively; for severe PAH, prostanoids were first-line treatment). For mild Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), 79% of experts agreed (treatments were CCBs, then adding PDE5 inhibitors, then ARBs or switching to another CCB, respectively; after the third line of treatment, mild RP was deemed severe). For severe RP, the first- through fourth-line treatments were CCBs, then adding PDE5 inhibitors or prostanoids, then adding PDE5 inhibitors (if not added as second-line treatment) or prostanoids (if not added as second-line treatment), then switching to another CCB, respectively. For active treatment of digital ulcers, 66% of experts agreed (first- and second-line treatments were CCBs and PDE5 inhibitors, respectively). For interstitial lung disease, 69% of experts agreed (for induction therapy, treatments were mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], intravenous cyclophosphamide [IV CYC], and rituximab, respectively; for maintenance, first-line treatment was MMF). For skin involvement, 71% of experts agreed (for a modified Rodnan skin thickness score [MRSS] of 24, first- and second-line treatments were methotrexate [MTX] and MMF, respectively; for an MRSS of 32, first- through fourth-line treatments were MMF, MTX, IV CYC, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, respectively). For inflammatory arthritis, 79% of experts agreed (first- through fourth-line treatments were MTX, low-dose glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, and rituximab or tocilizumab, respectively). Algorithms for cardiac and gastrointestinal involvement had ≥ 75% agreement.

Conclusion

Total agreement for SSc algorithms was considerable. These algorithms may guide treatment.

### New horizons in systemic sclerosis treatment: advances and emerging therapies in 2025 [^116Zu4gc]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, multisystem autoimmune disease characterised by vasculopathy, immune dysregulation, and progressive fibrosis, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. While recent EULAR recommendations have updated the standard of care for SSc, the field is rapidly evolving with novel therapeutic strategies and precision medicine approaches.

Traditional immunosuppressive therapies — including mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide and rituximab — remain essential for controlling skin and lung involvement while autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers a proven disease-modifying option for selected high-risk patients. Tocilizumab and nintedanib have established roles in lung preservation in SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), early combination therapy with endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, complemented by newer agents such as selexipag and riociguat, has improved survival and quality of life. Advances in gastrointestinal, renal and musculoskeletal management continue to evolve, with promising roles for intravenous immunoglobulin and novel prokinetics.

Crucially, emerging therapies — including CD19-targeted CAR-T cells, bispecific antibodies and agents targeting interferon pathways, BAFF, melanocortin, FcRn and PDE4B — reflect a shift towards personalised and biomarker-driven approaches. These innovations offer the potential to alter disease trajectory and support early, targeted intervention in SSc.

This review provides an up-to-date synthesis of both current organ-based treatment strategies in major organ domains — skin, ILD, PAH, scleroderma renal crisis, raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal involvement — and emerging therapies in SSc, with an emphasis on disease-modifying approaches and future directions in personalised care.

### Efficacy and safety of selexipag in adults with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study [^113dLzhY]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Patient selection. Eligible patients were age ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of SSc according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2013 classification criteria (total score of ≥ 9, including a score of 3 for the RP item) 21. Patients were required to have had ≥ 7 RP attacks on ≥ 5 different days during the baseline week and ≥ 80% eDiary compliance during the run‐in period. We excluded patients with a history of other conditions that can affect RP evaluation (for example, surgery [cervicothoracic sympathectomy, recent amputation, debridement] or recent treatment with botulinum toxin). Patients who received prostacyclin or prostacyclin analogs within 3 months of the screening visit were not eligible. Patients were permitted to take calcium‐channel blockers, nitrates or nitric oxide donors, endothelin receptor antagonists, alpha‐blockers, antithrombotic agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, beta‐blockers, clonidine, systemic corticosteroids, and fluoxetine during the study, provided that the dose had been stable in the month prior to screening and remained stable during the treatment period. Complete inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at.

Study outcome measures. The primary efficacy end point was the weekly average number of RP attacks during the maintenance period. Other prespecified efficacy end points included number and proportion of patients with weekly average number of RP attacks in categories of improved (change from baseline week of at least –15%), stable (change from baseline week of between –15% and 15%), and worsened (change from baseline week of > 15%) during the maintenance period; change from baseline week to week 8 in the weekly average RP attack duration following randomization; change from baseline week to each postbaseline week in the weekly average Raynaud's Condition Score (RCS) 22 following randomization; number of new digital ulcers and number of baseline digital ulcers completely healed at week 8, and changes from baseline to week 8 in quality of life, as measured by the overall Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire 23, the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ DI) 24, and the hand components of the HAQ DI. Safety end points included treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs) and laboratory assessments.

Guideline structure

I. Early diagnosis, classification and stratification of risk

What is the best approach to early diagnosis and classification?

Recommendation for diagnosis and classification of SSc:

Clinical diagnosis of SSc should be guided by validated classification criteria (1A, 96%).
Skin subset and SSc associated autoantibody subset should be used to stratify for risk of specific organ-based complications (1B, 97%).
Assessment of nailfold microcirculation (capillaroscopy) should be performed as part of initial SSc assessment and when a diagnosis of SSc is suspected (2C, 96%).

### Iloprost treatment in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis and the quality of life: a new therapeutic protocol [^114vpSgw]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical efficacy and the effects on the quality of life of iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue, used according to a new protocol in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis.

Methods

In this randomized study, we treated 30 patients with iloprost, given by intravenous infusion, at progressively increasing doses (from 0.5 to 2 ng/kg/min) over a period of 6 h each day for 10 days in two consecutive weeks, with repeated cycles at regular intervals of 3 months for 18 months. The results were compared with those obtained in 30 other patients who received the same drug but with different dosing schemes.

Results

The total average daily duration of the attacks, the average duration of a single attack and the average daily frequency of the attacks were reduced significantly in all treatment groups, but the comparison between the groups demonstrated significant differences between patients treated with the new protocol and the others at later times (12 and 18 months). The effects on the quality of life in the group treated with the new protocol, evaluated with the Short Form-36, demonstrated a marked improvement regarding both the scale relating to the physical aspect of the illness and, especially, the scale relating to the mental aspect.

Conclusions

In patients with systemic sclerosis, cyclic intravenous iloprost infusion is efficacious in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon. The protocol that we used, compared with others, not only has favourable clinical effects but also leads to a marked improvement in the quality of life.

### Lower limb ulcer and Raynaud's phenomenon [^115Dbdt5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Beta blockers may be used in the treatment of RP – Incorrect. Beta block ers (especially nonselective beta blockers) should be avoided, as they may promote RP attacks.
B. Calcium channel blockers constitute the first-line drug treatment of RP – Correct. Calcium channel blockers are recommended if lifestyle modification alone is insufficient. These drugs influence the number and severity of RP attacks. Long-acting calcium channel blockers may be preferred in order to reduce vasodilatory adverse effects.
C. Fluoxetine could be an alternative to calcium channel blockers in cases of intolerance – Correct. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of depression. Furthermore, it also showed benefit on frequency and severity of RP attacks in comparison to nifedipine in an open-label cross-over study.
D. Botulinum toxin A could be used in the management of RP – Correct. Botulinum toxin A is a protein produced by Clostridium botulinum that inhibits acetylcholine release in the motor plate and parasympathetic system. Locally injected into the digit or the palmar skin, it may reduce severity of RP attacks.
E. Iloprost could be proposed as a second-line treatment after failure of calcium channel blockers – Correct. Iloprost is an analog of prostacyclin and may be used as a second-line treatment of RP, as it reduces the frequency and severity of the RP attacks. Iloprost is originally used in the treatment of digital ulcers in SSc.

### Efficacy and safety of selexipag in adults with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study [^111xtDQ6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between all randomized patients (Table 1) and the per‐protocol set (see Supplementary Table 2). The treatment arms were generally similar, although more patients in the placebo group had a history of digital ulcers (71.1%) compared with the selexipag group (44.4%). Baseline use of calcium‐channel blockers in the per‐protocol set was greater in placebo‐treated patients (71.9%) compared with selexipag‐treated patients (33.3%) (see Supplementary Table 2).

Of all randomized patients, 71.1% (27 of 38) in the placebo group had an individualized maintenance dose corresponding to 1,600 μg twice daily, while 83.3% (30 of 36) of patients receiving selexipag had an individualized maintenance dose of ≤ 800 μg twice daily (median 600 [interquartile range 200–800]) (see Supplementary Table 3). The median duration of exposure to study drug for all randomized patients in the double‐blind period was 55.5 days (interquartile range 54.0–57.0 days) in the placebo group and 55.5 days (interquartile range 50.5–56.0 days) in the selexipag group.

### Low versus high-dose iloprost therapy over 21 days in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis: a randomized, open, single-center study [^116YEKng]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared the efficacy of different dosages of longterm iloprost treatment on Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), ulcer healing, skin thickening, and progression of internal organ sclerosis in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).

Methods

Fifty patients with SSc were randomized 1:1 for the maximally tolerated dose up to 2 ng/kg body weight per minute or low-dose (0.5 ng/kg bw per min) intravenous iloprost administration, applied for 6 hours daily over 21 days. Effects on RP, ulcer healing, skin thickness, esophageal function, and lung involvement assessed by forced vital capacity (FVC) and DLCO were measured, as well as side effects.

Results

Both regimens yielded 70% reduction of digital ulcers, 40% reduction in frequency of RP, and 30% reduction in duration of RP. One year after therapy, the modified Rodnan skin score appeared to be unchanged. FVC and DLCO-SB were stable in 87% and 74% of the patients, respectively. The effect of iloprost on skin thickness and lung function was sustained in a subgroup of patients receiving several courses of iloprost. As assessed by a patient questionnaire, 12% of all patients did not respond to iloprost therapy, but 78% experienced a longlasting effect. Mild side effects were common in both groups, but did not lead to discontinuation of therapy.

Conclusion

Low-dose iloprost was shown to be equally effective as high-dose iloprost in longterm treatment and was very effective in therapy of digital ulcers. Registered in www. ClinicalTrials.gov (registration no. NCT00622687).

### Raynaud syndrome [^112V1anL]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Raynaud syndrome (RS) was first described by the French physician Maurice Raynaud in 1862 with the characteristic tricolor change featuring pallor (ischemic phase), cyanosis (deoxygenation phase), and erythema (reperfusion phase) induced by cold or stress. Although the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is unclear, alterations in activity of the peripheral adrenoceptor have been implicated, specifically an enhanced smooth muscle contraction due to overexpression or hyperactivity of postsynaptic alpha 2 receptors. There are 2 ways that RS can appear clinically; isolated, formerly referred as Raynaud disease or now primary RS and in association with other conditions, usually connective tissue disorders (eg, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis), frequently called Raynaud phenomenon or secondary RS. The estimated prevalence in the general population is 3%-5%, with a higher prevalence in women than in men. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, based on patient descriptions of skin changes. Upper extremity pulse-volume recording is used to rule out proximal arterial obstruction. The differentiation between a vasospastic vs and obstructive mechanism is made using digital pressures and photoplethysmography, where an obstructive mechanism has decreased pressures and blunted waveforms. Cold challenge testing, such as ice water immersion with temperature recovery, is highly sensitive but lack specificity. Serologic screening (antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor) is advocated to rule out associated connective tissue disorders. Most patients with RS can be managed conservatively, with avoidance of cold exposure or hand warming. For those in whom conservative management is inadequate, a number of pharmacologic and surgical therapies have been used. Owing to lack of complete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, targeted therapy has not been possible; rather, therapy has been focused on the use of general vasodilation strategies. In this review, the diagnosis, natural history, and current medical and invasive therapy are summarized.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of treatments for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1114HovB]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Several pharmacological treatments are available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, but there is uncertainty regarding the best options. We aimed to assess and compare the benefits and harms of treatments available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Method

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological treatments. We searched for systematic reviews published in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to Jan 31, 2017, and for RCTs published from inception to Sept 24, 2019 in MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included double-blind RCTs (parallel or crossover) that compared two or more pharmacological treatments or placebo in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Individual patient data were obtained for one unpublished RCT. Three researchers independently screened the texts and extracted the data. Efficacy outcomes included severity (on a ten-point scale), daily frequency, and mean duration of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks. We also examined tolerability and acceptability. Pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses were used to synthesise data. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017057518).

Findings

We included 58 RCTs in the analysis, comprising 3867 patients (3540 [91.5%] with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon) and 15 classes of drugs. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors were more effective than placebo for frequency (mean difference -0.36 [95% credibility interval -0.69 to -0.04]), severity (-0.34 [-0.66 to -0.03]), and duration (-3.42 [-6.62 to -0.29]) of attacks (low to moderate level of evidence). Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to placebo for frequency (-0.35 [-0.67 to -0.02]) and severity (-0.84 [-1.25 to -0.45]) of attacks (low level of evidence). For severity of attacks, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (-1.54 [-2.68 to -0.41]; very low level of evidence) and oral prostacyclin receptor agonists (-0.48 [-0.80 to -0.16]; low level of evidence) were superior to placebo. No other drug classes were significantly superior to placebo with regard to efficacy outcomes. Compared with placebo, tolerability was lower for PDE5 inhibitors (incidence rate ratio for serious adverse events or early study exit due to adverse events 3.30 [95% CrI 1.49 to 7.55]) and CCBs (3.13 [1.33 to 7.04]). For all outcomes, global heterogeneity and between-study variance ranged from low (I² = 0% and τ² = 0.0 for attack severity and duration) to moderate (I² = 41% and τ² = 0.2 for tolerability). The overall risk of bias was judged to be low in 22 (38%), high in ten (17%), and unclear in 26 (45%) RCTs.

Interpretation

PDE5 inhibitors and CCBs are the most effective pharmacological options, albeit with moderate efficacy and a low level of evidence. Current evidence does not support the use of any other drug in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Pathophysiology and clinical consequences of Raynaud's phenomenon related to systemic sclerosis [^111rqzyC]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

According to the so-called vascular hypothesis, Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is one initial event in the pathophysiological cascade leading to sclerosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc). It is characterized by recurrent, reversible spasms of small arterioles and digital arteries, usually triggered by cold and emotional stress. Clinical signs of RP are a sudden pallor of single digits of fingers followed by reactive hyperaemia and in severe cases also by cyanosis. Besides imbalances between vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory processes, structural alterations of the involved vessels are fundamental to secondary RP in SSc. The latter is the reason why secondary RP in SSc, in contrast to primary RP, often leads to ischaemia and re-perfusion injuries. New insights into the pathophysiology of RP feature a special role for alpha2c-adrenoreceptors, Rho-kinase signalling pathways and soluble mediators. They have resulted in promising therapeutic options, including antagonism of endothelin receptors, inhibition of phosphodiesterases or selective blockade of alpha2c-adrenoreceptors. They should also have a positive impact on the course of SSc in general.

### Efficacy and safety of selexipag in adults with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study [^111MLdgM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of selexipag, an oral, selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonist, on the frequency of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).

Methods

Patients with SSc-related RP were randomized 1:1 to placebo (n = 38) or selexipag (n = 36) in individualized doses (maximum of 1,600 μg twice daily) during a 3-week titration period. The primary end point was the weekly average number of RP attacks during the study maintenance period, analyzed using a Bayesian approach with a negative binomial model adjusted for baseline number of RP attacks. Other outcome measures included Raynaud's Condition Score (RCS), RP attack duration, and treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs).

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. For 83.3% of patients, the individualized maintenance dosage of selexipag was ≤ 800 μg twice daily. No significant difference was observed between placebo and selexipag in weekly average number of electronic diary (eDiary)-recorded RP attacks during the maintenance period (14.2 attacks during the maintenance period and 21.5 attacks during the baseline week in the placebo group [n = 32] versus 18.0 attacks during the maintenance period and 22.4 attacks during the baseline week in the selexipag group [n = 27]; adjusted mean treatment difference of 3.4 in favor of placebo). No significant treatment effect was observed on RCS or RP attack duration. In the double-blind period, 86.8% of placebo-treated patients and 100% of selexipag-treated patients reported ≥ 1 AE; 55.3% and 91.7%, respectively, reported ≥ 1 prostacyclin-associated AE.

Conclusion

Treatment with selexipag did not reduce the number of RP attacks compared with placebo. The safety profile of selexipag was similar to that previously reported. This study provides important information about the feasibility of eDiary reporting of RP attacks in clinical trials.

Statistical analysis. Efficacy end points were analyzed on the per‐protocol set, which included all patients who had ≥ 7 RP attacks on ≥ 5 days during the baseline week, did not receive forbidden concomitant medication from the start of the run‐in period until end of treatment, did not prematurely discontinue treatment before day 30, and completed ≥ 70% of the eDiary RP assessments during the maintenance period. The primary efficacy end point was analyzed using a negative binomial model adjusted for the baseline number of RP attacks to assess the following joint proof‐of‐concept criteria in a Bayesian framework: statistical significance was achieved if there was a high probability (≥ 0.95) that the difference in the mean weekly average number of RP attacks (selexipag minus placebo) was < 0 during the maintenance period (i.e. the probability of a difference of < 0 was ≥ 0.95); clinical significance was achieved if the probability of a difference of < –4 was ≥ 0.5. Missing data were minimized by using the per‐protocol set for the primary analysis. Weekly rates of RP attacks were standardized based on each patient's follow‐up time in the maintenance period, to account for different follow‐up times and/or missing days of RP attacks.

Power and sample size were determined using simulations based on the assumed total number of RP attacks at baseline and during the maintenance period. With 25 patients per arm qualifying for the per‐protocol set, the operating characteristics of the Bayesian approach were a true‐positive probability of > 85% to fulfill both proof‐of‐concept criteria if the true difference between the means of the weekly average number of RP attacks during the maintenance period was at least 5.25, and a false‐positive probability of < 1% to fulfill both proof‐of‐concept criteria if the true difference between the means was 0, assuming at least a 30% reduction from the baseline week with ≥ 17.5 RP attacks. Based on this, it was determined to randomize 35 patients per treatment arm. A prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary efficacy variable was conducted based on the presence/absence of digital ulcers at baseline, number of RP attacks during the baseline week (≤ 17, > 17), smoking status at screening (smoker, nonsmoker/former smoker), and use/no use of calcium‐channel blockers at baseline.

Forest plot of summary statistics of weekly attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon from posterior distribution of negative binomial Bayesian model (subgroup analyses; per‐protocol set). n p = number of patients receiving placebo; n a = number of patients receiving active treatment; P † = probability that the difference between the treatment means (selexipag minus placebo) for weekly average number ofattacks in the maintenance period is < 0; 90% = 90% confidence interval; = digital ulcer; s = calcium‐channel blockers.

Other end points. The weekly average number of RP attacks during the maintenance period improved in 81.3% of placebo‐treated patients and in 63.0% of selexipag‐treated patients; it remained stable in 12.5% and 22.2% of patients, respectively, and worsened in 6.3% and 14.8% of patients, respectively. During the baseline week, the average RP attack duration was 21.5 minutes in the placebo group and 24.2 minutes in the selexipag group; the mean ± SD change in weekly average RP attack duration at week 8 was 4.6 ± 26.5 minutes in the placebo group and 2.7 ± 17.0 minutes in the selexipag group (n = 19 for both groups). The mean RCS at baseline was 3.3 in placebo‐treated patients (n = 30) and 4.0 in selexipag‐treated patients (n = 25). No difference was observed between placebo and selexipag in changes from baseline in RCS at any time during the study (data not shown).

Classification of Disease: Who to Fit Where

Raynaud's Phenomenon and the Concept of "Early SSc"

The clinical spectrum and prognosis of SSc are highly heterogeneous, but strikingly in at least 95% of the cases, the onset of disease is preceded -sometimes by years -by the occurrence of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). RP reflects an impaired balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation in response to different stimuli -mainly cold or emotional stress -and it is characterized by episodic color changes of the extremities (predominantly the digits) turning white (ischemia), blue (cyanosis), and red (reperfusion). RP is common also in the general population and is most often harmless (primary, PRP), but in a small percentage of cases, RP is the alarm bell for an underlying disease. In several autoimmune conditions, RP is a presenting sign or a complication of a long-lasting disease, including SLE, RA, Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) or other connective tissue diseases in general. However, it is SSc that accounts for most of the cases of the so-called secondary RP whose occurrence in a previously healthy individual should always raise the suspicion of a developing sclerodermatous condition. This, of course, naturally leads to a key question: is it possible to identify the source of RP and early identify the presence of an underlying pathological conditions? Several lines of evidence indicate that in PRP, vascular abnormalities are mostly functional, while in secondary RP, especially in SSc-related RP, structural endothelial alterations can be observed. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) has slowly emerged as a necessary tool to visually highlight microvascular alterations and the endothelial derangement which characterize SSc. The NVC patterns of SSc-related microangiopathy are now well characterized and formalized from a qualitative and quantitative point of view.

### Outcomes in primary Raynaud phenomenon… [^116HxasQ]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Criteria given the highest weighting were exclusion of a preexisting disease at entry, detailed description of patients at follow-up whose disease evolved during the period of observation, the use of classification criteria for diagnosing secondary disease, and examination of patients at entry and follow-up. A maximum score of 100 was possible with this scale. For each analysis, transition rates of patients were compared from the "top" half and the "bottom" half of the scale. Raynaud phenomenon had been present in these patients for a mean of 8. 3 years before study entry. The average length of study follow-up was 4. 0 years, for a total of 2531 patient-years of follow-up. The total duration of Raynaud phenomenon was 12. 3 years, or 7844 patient-years of Raynaud phenomenon. During follow-up, 12.

6% of patients developed a secondary disorder, 80 of which were connective-tissue diseases. Two thirds of these were systemic sclerosis. When adjusted for length of follow-up, transitions were infrequent, occurring at a mean rate of 3. 2 per 100 patient-years of observation. The mean time to develop a secondary disorder from onset of Raynaud phenomenon in 29 patients was 10. 4 years, and the mean time to develop a secondary disorder calculated from entry into studies in 27 patients was
2. 8 years. Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates that, in a clinical practice, the rate and frequency with which secondary disorders classifiable as connective-tissue diseases develop in patients with primary Raynaud phenomenon is low.

The best predictors of transition are features seen on physical examination, especially abnormalities of the nailfold capillary bed. In addition to symptomatic treatment of these patients' Raynaud phenomenon, careful serial physical examinations, reassurance, and watchful waiting may be the most effective strategy to care for these patients.
