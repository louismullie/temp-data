## Question

What would cause a TSH of greater than 19,000 and a normal t4

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the possible causes and appropriate evaluation of a TSH greater than 19,000 mIU/L with a normal free T4. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this extreme TSH value is physiologically plausible or likely represents an assay artifact. Then, I should verify the clinical context and timing of the sample. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis for discordant TSH and free T4, prioritizing assay interference and rare entities. After that, I need to outline a practical, stepwise diagnostic workup, including repeat testing, heterophile antibody assessment, and consideration of macro-TSH. Finally, I will consider management implications while emphasizing that treatment decisions should not be based on a single, grossly discordant result until interference is excluded.

> Let me first confirm the magnitude and plausibility of this result. A TSH of greater than 19,000 mIU/L is approximately 4,000 times the upper limit of typical reference intervals, which is physiologically implausible for primary hypothyroidism and should immediately raise suspicion for analytical interference rather than true endocrine disease; I should double-check the units and the assay platform before proceeding further [^112dCfaU] [^112jhSYv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the clinical context. Was the patient symptomatic or on thyroid hormone therapy, and was this a single isolated result. The USPSTF and related guidance emphasize that TSH is highly variable and that diagnosis should never be made on a single abnormal value; repeating TSH with free T4 (and total T3 if indicated) on a fresh sample is essential to confirm persistence and to exclude preanalytical error or transient fluctuations [^114bqgrE] [^116XK1nC].

> Next, I should review the differential for markedly elevated TSH with normal free T4. Let me think about this carefully: subclinical hypothyroidism typically shows TSH between about 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, and even values above 10 mIU/L are uncommon in this context. A TSH in the tens of thousands is incompatible with subclinical hypothyroidism, so I should prioritize assay interference, followed by rare entities like macro-TSH, heterophile antibodies, and exceedingly unlikely central mechanisms or resistance syndromes [^111trvZ4] [^112jhSYv].

> I will now examine assay interference as the leading explanation. Macro-TSH (TSH bound to immunoglobulin) and heterophile antibodies can cause spuriously high TSH on certain immunoassay platforms. Prevalence estimates vary, but both are well-documented and can produce markedly elevated TSH with discordant normal thyroid hormones, and the pattern is method-dependent, so switching platforms or using heterophile-blocking reagents can clarify the issue [^112dCfaU] [^112jhSYv].

> Wait, let me verify the next diagnostic steps. I should repeat TSH and free T4 on a different platform, preferably with a different assay architecture, and request heterophile antibody assessment or send the sample to a reference laboratory for interference studies. Serial dilutions that fail linearity and discordance between clinical phenotype and biochemistry further support interference, and this structured approach prevents misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment [^112jhSYv] [^114fiaqB].

> But what if interference is excluded and the result is real. I need to ensure I consider rare entities: macro-TSH remains the most plausible, whereas a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma would typically present with elevated free T4 and T3 rather than isolated TSH elevation; resistance to thyroid hormone beta generally shows elevated free T4 and T3 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH; and central hypothyroidism presents with low or inappropriately normal TSH and low free T4, so none of these fit a TSH of 19,000 with normal free T4, making them highly unlikely here [^115N9GwJ] [^111t4S1w] [^115pVsK9].

> Let me reconsider the possibility of extreme primary hypothyroidism. Even in severe untreated primary hypothyroidism, TSH values in the hundreds have been reported, but values approaching 19,000 mIU/L are not described in clinical series, and such patients are invariably hypothyroxinemic; thus, a normal free T4 alongside a TSH of 19,000 is not consistent with primary thyroid failure and should prompt immediate verification for interference before any therapeutic decision [^113mkwj1] [^112jhSYv].

> Next, I should review immediate management. I need to ensure no treatment is initiated based on this single, grossly discordant result. Instead, I should document the discrepancy, repeat testing on an alternate platform with attention to preanalytical variables, and, if interference is confirmed, explain to the patient that no thyroid disease is present and avoid unnecessary levothyroxine, which could cause harm if given inappropriately. If interference is excluded and a rare true etiology is identified, management would follow disease-specific pathways, but that scenario is unlikely here [^112jhSYv] [^114bqgrE].

> In summary, I should confirm that the most likely explanation for a TSH greater than 19,000 mIU/L with normal free T4 is analytical interference, particularly macro-TSH or heterophile antibodies. The immediate next step is to repeat TSH and free T4 on a different assay platform and pursue interference testing, while withholding treatment until persistence and authenticity are verified, given the implausibility of such an extreme TSH in the setting of normal thyroid hormone levels [^112jhSYv] [^112dCfaU] [^114bqgrE].

A TSH > 19,000 mIU/L with normal T4 is most often due to **assay interference** (macro-TSH, heterophilic antibodies, or biotin) [^112dCfaU] or **laboratory error** [^notfound]. If confirmed, rare causes include **TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma** (with elevated free T4/T3) [^115N9GwJ] or **thyroid hormone resistance** (with elevated free T4/T3) [^11385f4o]. True primary hypothyroidism with TSH this high and normal T4 is physiologically implausible; **confirm with repeat TSH, free T4/T3, and interference testing** before acting [^114fiaqB].

---

## Physiological and pathological mechanisms

### Assay interference

- **Macro-TSH**: Autoimmune complexes of TSH with immunoglobulins cause falsely high TSH by slowing clearance and altering assay detection; prevalence ~0.6–1.6% [^112dCfaU].

- **Heterophilic antibodies**: Cross-reactive antibodies in immunoassays can cause falsely elevated TSH; prevalence ~0.4% [^112dCfaU].

- **Biotin interference**: High-dose biotin (> 5 mg/day) can cause falsely high TSH in some assays [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory error

Preanalytical or analytical errors — such as **sample mislabeling, contamination, or instrument malfunction** — can produce spurious results [^114tE5SG].

---

### Rare endocrine disorders

- **TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma)**: Rare tumors secreting TSH; typically present with elevated free T4/T3 and inappropriately normal/elevated TSH [^115N9GwJ].

- **Thyroid hormone resistance (RTH)**: Genetic receptor defects causing elevated free T4/T3 with inappropriately normal/elevated TSH [^11385f4o].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Confirmatory testing

Repeat TSH and free T4/T3 on a **different platform** or with **heterophile-blocking reagents** to exclude interference [^114fiaqB]. If interference is suspected, **send samples to a reference laboratory** for specialized assays [^112jhSYv].

---

### Clinical evaluation

Assess for symptoms/signs of **hypo- or hyperthyroidism** and review medications (especially biotin) and supplements [^114fiaqB]. Obtain **pituitary MRI** if TSHoma or RTH is suspected after confirming true biochemical elevation of free T4/T3 [^115N9GwJ].

---

### Management strategies

If **interference is confirmed**, no treatment is needed; reassure and document [^notfound]. If a **true endocrine disorder is confirmed**, manage according to the specific diagnosis (e.g. surgery/medical therapy for TSHoma, beta-blockers for RTH) [^notfound].

### Central hypothyroidism [^115iMQ6P]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare cause of hypothyroidism due to an insufficient stimulation of an otherwise normal thyroid gland and it is caused by either pituitary (secondary hypothyroidism) or hypothalamic (tertiary hypothyroidism) defects. The diagnosis of CH is usually suggested by the finding of lowered thyroid hormone concentrations, associated with inappropriately low/ normal TSH levels. Restoration and maintenance of euthyroidism represent the therapeutic goals in all forms of CH. On these basis, the vast majority of patients with CH is treated with standard levo-thyroxine (L-T4) therapy which is tailored according to FT4 circulating levels that should be maintained in the normal range.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) — lipids and cardiovascular risk: Across included studies, 82% defined SCH as normal T4 with TSH 5–10 mIU/L and 18% as normal T4 with TSH 10 to 20 mIU/L; SCH cohorts generally show lipid abnormalities, with higher total cholesterol and LDL-C reported even when TSH < 10 mIU/L, though some studies find elevations only when TSH > 10 mIU/L. Lipid levels decrease after levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, with an Endocrine Society meta-analysis showing reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG after LT4 while lipids did not change in untreated SCH. Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data indicate increased CV events at TSH > 10 mIU/L; overall stroke risk was not increased for adults with SCH (TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L) but was significantly higher in those younger than 65 years, and across TSH 4.5 to 6.9, 7.0 to 9.9, and 10–19.9 mIU/L, fatal stroke rose with higher TSH without a significant trend. An individual participant meta-analysis (11 studies; 55 287 adults, including 3450 with SCH) found increased CVD risk with TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L but not at lower TSH; CHD mortality was increased for TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L and 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L, reaching statistical significance only in the higher TSH group.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

Pregnancy — management of maternal hypothyroidism and positive thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) patients: When a woman with hypothyroidism becomes pregnant, the dosage of L-thyroxine should be increased as soon as possible to ensure that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is < 2.5 mU/L and that serum total thyroxine (T4) is in the normal reference range for pregnancy; in TPOAb-positive pregnancies, serum TSH should be measured as soon as possible and if ≥ 2.5 mU/L, treatment should be initiated. Serum TSH and total T4 measurements should be monitored every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and at least once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. Total T4 increases predictably in pregnancy, with the reference range ~1.5 fold that of the nonpregnant range; the upper limit of normal for the first trimester is generally < 2.5 mIU/L with respective upper normal values for the second and third trimesters approximately 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/L. Serum TSH levels decline in the first trimester and rise after 10–12 weeks gestation.

Hypothyroidism in pregnancy — definition, prevalence, and reference limits: Primary overt maternal hypothyroidism is generally defined as the presence of an elevated TSH and a decreased serum FT4 concentration during gestation, with both concentrations outside the trimester-specific reference ranges; at least 2%–3% of healthy, pregnant women of childbearing age have an elevated TSH, and thyroid autoantibodies can be detected in approximately 30%–60% of pregnant women with an elevated TSH concentration. In the 2011 ATA guidelines, the upper reference limit for TSH was set at 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester and 3.0 mU/L in the second and third trimesters based on six pregnancy studies comprising approximately 5500 subjects, while subsequent larger cohorts combine data from over 60,000 subjects and demonstrate substantial population differences in the TSH upper reference limit; differences may be partly attributable to iodine status and TSH assays and are influenced by BMI, geography, and ethnicity, making it difficult to precisely define a universal TSH cutoff above which LT4 therapy should be initiated for all pregnant women.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating treatment based on individual factors in patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L, particularly if patients have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, positive anti-TPO antibodies, or evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

Hypothyroidism in adults — adrenal insufficiency precautions in central hypothyroidism emphasize that those with adrenal insufficiency, either primary or central, or at risk for it, should be treated with clinically appropriate doses of hydrocortisone until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out; elevated TSH with normal T4 can occur and, when due to adrenal insufficiency, elevated TSH levels fall with glucocorticoid therapy alone.

Evaluation of elevated TSH on levothyroxine — Variable adherence or nonadherence to LT4 therapy should be considered, and some patients with high TSH values while being prescribed LT4 were shown to be able to absorb LT4 normally and were thought to have poor adherence. Absorption testing can be conducted by administering a specific oral dose of LT4 under supervised conditions, measuring T4 concentrations at specific time points thereafter, and comparing the observed and predicted Cmax and AUC; doses of LT4, of 600 μg to 2 mg have been employed in absorption testing. One survey of patients prescribed LT4 found a self-reported nonadherence rate of 22%. Since LT4 is generally a lifelong medication, it is important for patients to identify a medication schedule that facilitates adherence; given the long half-life of LT4, patients can safely be advised to make up any omitted doses, and a weekly pill box may be helpful for identifying omitted doses. If a combination of a high TSH and a normal or high T4 concentration is documented by laboratory testing, this pattern could be consistent with the syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance, a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, a macro-TSH phenomenon, or recent resumption of LT4 therapy.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115izZ2e]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PVhnp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^117E4w72]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnostic and natural history features include an initial thyrotoxic phase in about 50% of patients due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone; the serum TSH level is suppressed and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially compared to the total T3 level; radioiodine uptake is low; and inflammatory markers are commonly elevated with mild anemia and elevated WBC count, while up to 25% have low antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3–6 weeks, about 30% subsequently enter a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months, most patients become euthyroid within 12 months although 5%–15% have persistent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rates of 1%–4% have been reported.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115N9GwJ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

TSH-secreting adenoma versus thyroid hormone resistance — distinction is important because test results are similar but management differs; TSH-secreting adenomas are more likely to have concurrent alpha-subunit elevation, a blunted TSH response to TRH (when available), elevated sex-hormone-binding globulin and resting energy expenditure, clinical thyrotoxicosis, and an anatomic abnormality on pituitary MRI.

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

Hypothyroidism in adults — adherence, absorption, and alternative dosing note that patients on high doses of L-thyroxine (> 200 μg/d) with persistently or frequently elevated TSH may be noncompliant or have absorption problems; although daily dosing is ideal, missed doses should be made up when recognized, even on the same or subsequent days; in significant compliance problems, weekly dosing with L-thyroxine results in similar clinical safety, outcomes, and acceptable TSH values; absorption is diminished by meals and competing medications.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1138vdXP]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

### Cardiovascular risk and subclinical hypothyroidism: focus on lipids and new emerging risk factors. what is the evidence? [^1169UNQ1]. Thyroid (2007). Low credibility.

Controversy remains as to the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), defined as an increased serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Substantial evidence indicates altered cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in SCH when serum TSH is above 10 mU/L. Observed abnormalities include elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C); the altered TC/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios suggest a potential accelerated risk for CVD. The influence of SCH on lipids is directly proportional to the degree of TSH elevation and becomes more significant with the progression from SCH to overt disease, thereby accelerating any propensity to atherosclerosis. Although many clinicians may tend to ignore SCH with TSH levels < 10, it is apparent that an enhanced CV risk could apply to these individuals, perhaps compounded by insulin resistance and amplified by the copresence of other risk factors such as endothelial dysfunction and elevated C-reactive protein.

### Pitfalls in the use of thyrotropin concentration as a first-line thyroid-function test [^112f3zup]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Measurement of thyrotropin concentration alone as a first-line thyroid-function test fails to indicate hypopituitarism in a number of patients. Using a combination of thyrotropin and thyroxine assays, we analysed 56,000 tests for a population of 471,000 over 12 months. 15 patients with clinically unsuspected hypopituitarism were detected, indicating that the occurrence of hypopituitarism might be underestimated.

Regarding medical management for congenital hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine, treatment goals, AAP 2023 guidelines recommend to maintain serum TSH in the age-specific reference range after initial normalization. Maintain serum fT4 levels in the upper half of the age-specific reference range unless achieving a serum fT4 level in this range would result in a TSH level less than the reference range.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155cNLx]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

fT4 is not the active thyroid hormone at the cellular nuclear level. The strong relationships of parameters, especially AF (risk increased up to 9 × across the normal reference range (30)), with levels of fT4 indicate that the active intracellular triiodothyronine generated by thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases appears to be, at least in the heart, proportional to circulating fT4. Any discrepancy, indicating local regulation of thyroid effect, may be more prominent in more severe pathophysiological circumstances, and therefore more relevant in the circumstances of multisystem entities such as frailty, death, and metabolic disturbance.

Our results do not imply that no information can be gleaned from the presence of an abnormal TSH level. In the presence of normal thyroid hormone levels, such TSH levels indicate that the thyroid gland physiology is abnormal. However, for the function of other tissues and organs, the TSH level required to maintain a given level of thyroid hormones appears generally not to be relevant.

It remains possible too that additional analyses might find that TSH levels are providing an additional signal to fT4 levels, in some populations for some conditions. It has been suggested that TSH itself may have physiological effects apart from the stimulation of thyroid hormone levels, and such effects rather than via the reflection of thyroid status might explain such a TSH signal. Empirically, thus far, the evidence suggests that any of these TSH effects are small.

The association of thyroid hormone and particularly fT4 levels, rather than TSH levels, with clinical features has been noted by many authors, covering many individual parameters. In particular, the meta-analysis regarding AF noted the association with fT4 but not with TSH. Authors also previously found evidence of associations of clinical parameters with fT4 in the absence of an association with subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently diagnosed. One of these studies also showed associations with TSH.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels.

Thyroid hormone status discordance between pituitary and peripheral tissues — There are specific instances in which there appears to be discordance between the thyroid status of the pituitary gland, as reflected by serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and the status of other tissues indicated by biomarkers, and the clinical significance is not known. Mechanistic data indicate tissues can have variable tissue-specific thyroid status and that normalization of TSH does not ensure uniform triiodothyronine (T3) levels across tissues; animal and in vitro/rodent studies show primary changes in type 2 or type 3 deiodinase (D2 or D3) within a tissue can alter thyroid status without affecting circulating T3, thyroxine (T4), or TSH, with reports of relatively T3-deficient tissues despite the same plasma T3 and T4 and sometimes normal serum TSH; human studies have not been reported.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^113TYi4r]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis background and etiologies — In general, thyrotoxicosis can occur if (i) the thyroid is inappropriately stimulated by trophic factors; (ii) there is constitutive activation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion leading to autonomous release of excess thyroid hormone; (iii) thyroid stores of preformed hormone are passively released in excessive amounts owing to autoimmune, infectious, chemical, or mechanical insult; or (iv) there is exposure to extra-thyroidal sources of thyroid hormone, which may be either endogenous (struma ovarii, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer) or exogenous (factitious thyrotoxicosis). Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with values within the normal reference range for both triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) estimates and is most often caused by release of excess thyroid hormone by the gland. GD is an autoimmune disorder in which thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production. The natural history of nodular thyroid disease includes growth of established nodules, new nodule formation, and development of autonomy over time, and in TAs autonomous hormone production can be caused by somatic activating mutations of genes regulating thyroid hormone synthesis; germline mutations in the gene encoding the TSH receptor can cause sporadic or familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism.

### Standardization of free thyroxine and harmonization of thyrotropin measurements: a request for input from endocrinologists and other physicians [^1153v7mV]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

For fT4, the variability is substantial. Standardization will change results significantly — perhaps as much as 80% at the upper limit of the normal range — for some assays. For TSH, the alterations introduced by harmonization will be milder (approximately 20%). The Committee, comprising laboratory professionals and manufacturers, has received a positive response for this approach from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), albeit with the caveat to investigate the risks associated with changes in the numerical results for some of the assays.

To this end, we are reaching out to stakeholders to seek views on the benefits and risks arising from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization.

1.000000000000000e+00 Benefits: We wish to learn about the benefits that you think would be achieved if all fT4 and TSH assays gave comparable results on patient samples.
2.000000000000000e+00 Risks: We wish to learn about the risks to patient safety and clinical outcomes that you think may arise as a consequence of a change in the numerical results for patients with thyroid disorders who are being followed, despite appropriate adjustments of the reference intervals. Particular attention should be paid to the question of whether standardization for uncomplicated hypo- and hyperthyroidism may detract from assay differences for important clinical populations (nonthyroidal illness, and elderly and pregnant individuals).
3.000000000000000e+00 Implementation: We wish to hear your views on how clinical laboratories can minimize the identified risks from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization, and about the role that you could play for the patients you treat.

Conclusions — practice implications and laboratory–clinician interface: over the past five decades, testing for TSH and thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) has greatly improved in selectivity and sensitivity. Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement, and there is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. Laboratories often receive requests missing clinical and pharmacological information; the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interpretations and should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. Standardization, quality, performance, and harmonization of assays (TSH, T4, T3) need to be maintained and improved to enable exchange, application, and interpretation of test results within clinical standards.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115tWPPB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (eg, abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (eg, resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered. We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

### When to begin treatment in patients with elevated TSH… [^114Ch9kj]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: I read with interest your article, "Treatment of Hypothyroidism. " 1 I found the article informative, but I do have one disagreement. Dr. Hueston's discussion of "subclinical hypothyroidism" suggests that patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels between 6 and 10 may not progress to overt hypothyroidism and do not necessarily need to be treated. The author recommends an "individualized" approach and gives several parameters to aid in decision-making. One important factor is missing from this discussion: the lipid panel. Patients with "mild thyroid failure" usually have dyslipidemia, which may be improved with thyroid hormone replacement. Indeed, mild hypothyroidism is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. I had the benefit of serving on two expert panels on this illness.

However, lead investigators have convinced me that all patients with an elevated TSH level should be treated unless a contraindication is present. Improvement in several health parameters are often observed in patients who receive treatment, including improved well-being, improved lipid panel, and modest weight loss. These patients are often overweight and lose weight much easier when their TSH is normal. In summary, I consider patients with an elevated TSH level as having hypothyroidism, and patients with normal free thyroxine level as having mild thyroid failure, which is a real condition. Why should physicians wait to treat these patients until they, if ever, progress to worse disease. Early treatment is beneficial, especially considering the lipid profile that results from an elevated TSH level. Letters to the Editor in reply: I appreciate Dr. Scherger's comments regarding my article.

1 on hypothyroidism in AFP. The issue of small elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone with normal thyroxine levels is still controversial. While it is recognized that hypothyroidism is clearly associated with elevations in cholesterol, 2 there are no population-based data showing that persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO-T may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO-T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO-T [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose.

Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of EUTHYROX therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of EUTHYROX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)])].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Hypothyroidism as a cause of hyponatremia: fact or fiction? [^1131qVDe]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To illustrate that severe primary hypothyroidism alone may not be enough to cause hyponatremia in the otherwise healthy ambulatory patient.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted using an academic health center enterprise-wide electronic health record to identify 10 patients with primary hypothyroidism and same-day serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), sodium, creatinine, and calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Same-day free triiodothyronine or free thyroxine was also recorded if tested. Patients were included in our case series if they met the following inclusion criteria: TSH level > 100 μU/mL and same-day sodium and creatinine levels. All laboratory tests were collected on an outpatient basis.

Results

The 10 subjects (2 men and 8 women) were ages 19 to 97 years (median, 51.5 years). Median TSH was 193 μU/mL (range, 104.2 to 515.6 μU/mL; normal, 0.40 to 5.50 μU/mL) with median sodium of 138 mmol/L (range, 136 to 142 mmol/L; normal, 135 to 146 mmol/L). The lowest sodium was 136 mmol/L with concurrent TSH of 469.7 μU/mL, free triiodothyronine of 1.0 pg/mL (normal, 1.8 to 4.6 pg/mL), and free thyroxine of 0.2 ng/dL (normal, 0.7 to 1.8 ng/dL). Median GFR was 67.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range, 44 to 114 mL/min/1.73 m2; normal, 90 to 120 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Conclusion

In our small series of patients with extreme TSH elevations, none had a serum sodium level below normal (< 135 mmol/L), even in the presence of a reduced GFR. Hyponatremia can be a common occurrence in hospitalized and/or chronically ill patients; however, in an otherwise relatively healthy ambulatory patient, hypothyroidism, even when severely undertreated, may be a less clinically relevant cause of hyponatremia.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1142XYF3]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) interpretation pitfalls include acute illness; pregnancy; central hypothyroidism from nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas; effects of subcutaneous octreotide and oral bexarotene; anorexia nervosa; heterophile or interfering antibodies; and adrenal insufficiency. In acute illness, TSH may be suppressed with levels below 0.1 mIU/L and testing in hospitalized patients "should be only performed if there is a strong clinical suspicion for thyroid dysfunction". During pregnancy, TSH typically falls in the first trimester, but infrequently to below 0.1 mIU/L, and returns to normal in the second trimester. In central hypothyroidism due to nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, mildly elevated TSH is described, generally not above 6 or 7 mIU/L, due to bioinactive isoforms. Drug and condition effects are specified: subcutaneous octreotide does not cause persistent central hypothyroidism, oral bexarotene almost always does, anorexia nervosa may show low TSH with low free T4, heterophile or interfering antibodies may cause falsely elevated TSH values, and adrenal insufficiency may be associated with TSH elevations reversed with glucocorticoid replacement.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^1131GDkM]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and TSH-mediated hyperthyroidism — diagnostic considerations are as follows: In the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance, a normal serum TSH makes hyperthyroidism unlikely, and "euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia" denotes elevated total serum T4 (often total T3) without hyperthyroidism due to thyroid hormone–binding protein disorders including elevations in TBG or transthyretin, abnormal albumin with high-capacity T4 binding (familial hyperthyroxinemic dysalbuminemia), abnormal TTR, and rarely immunoglobulins binding T4 or T3; TBG excess may be hereditary X‑linked or acquired with pregnancy, estrogen administration, hepatitis, acute intermittent porphyria, or drugs (5‑fluorouracil, perphenazine, some narcotics), and other causes include drugs that inhibit T4→T3 conversion (amiodarone or high‑dose propranolol), acute psychosis, extreme high altitude, amphetamine abuse; spurious free T4 elevations may occur with heparin therapy; when free thyroid hormone concentrations are elevated with normal or elevated TSH, further evaluation is necessary and, after excluding euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, TSH‑mediated hyperthyroidism should be considered, with a pituitary lesion on MRI and disproportionately high alpha‑subunit supporting a TSH‑producing pituitary adenoma, while family history and positive genetic testing for T3 receptor mutations support thyroid hormone resistance; heterophilic antibodies can cause spuriously high TSH values.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^112VJzEn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is quite common in older persons. In one study, 1 thyrotropin-stimulating hormone levels greater than 10 μU per mL were found in 7 percent of women and 3 percent of men who were 60 to 89 years of age, living active lives in the community. Recommendations about thyroid screening, however, have been inconsistent. Currently, no organizations recommend routine universal screening. For example, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. 4) or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. 4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed.

The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Clinical manifestations, if present, may be explained by assuming that a T 4 level of 6 or 7 μg per dL, although not outside the normal range of 4. 5 to
12. 5 μg per dL, may represent a significant fall from an original level of 9 or 10 μg per dL and, thus, is low for this particular patient. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased.

Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^112dCfaU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Causes of Spuriously Abnormal TSH

Macro-TSH

Macro-TSH, an autoimmune, TSH–Ig complex of larger molecular size than TSH itself, is detected to varying extents by different TSH immunoassays, accounting for its variable (0.6–1.6%) estimated prevalence. Due to its high molecular mass, the half-life of circulating macro-TSH is prolonged; however, as this species is also restricted to the intravascular compartment, it is thought to be biologically inactive.

Heterophile Anti-TSH Antibodies

As two-site immunometric assays are used almost universally to detect circulating TSH in clinical practice, they are susceptible to heterophile antibody interference (reported prevalence 0.4%), which typically causes falsely high, or (less commonly) falsely low TSH measurements, depending on whether the antibodies are crosslinking or blocking. In practice, determining whether a spuriously raised TSH is due to interference from a crosslinking heterophile antibody or a macro TSH–Ig complex can be difficult, although once such assay interference is detected, the need to make this distinction is less clinically relevant.

Rare Amino Acid Change (Arg75Gly) in TSHβ Subunit

A single nucleotide change in TSHB, encodes a variant TSHβ subunit polypeptide containing an amino acid change (Arg75Gly) that does not alter TSH function, but prevents recognition of TSH by monoclonal antibodies used in some immunoassays. The Arg75Gly TSHβ variant is particularly prevalent (1%) in South Asian populations, with heterozygotes and homozygotes exhibiting falsely low or even suppressed TSH measurements in some assay platforms (eg, Siemens ADVIA Centaur, IMMULITE 2000), sometimes resulting in misdiagnosis of hyperthyroidism, with other methods (eg, Roche Elecsys, Abbott ARCHITECT, or Beckman Coulter DxI) recording normal TSH.

Paraprotein-Associated TSH Assay Interference

Rare cases of falsely subnormal (Abbott AxSYM assay) or raised (Beckman-Coulter DxC 880i assay) TSH measurements due to interference from circulating IgG paraproteins have been recorded, with interference resolving upon disappearance of the monoclonal gammopathy.

Recommendation 97 — diagnosis of TSH-secreting pituitary tumor should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum TSH level associated with elevated free T4 estimates and T3 concentrations, usually associated with a pituitary tumor on MRI and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with thyroid hormone resistance in a thyrotoxic patient (1/+00).

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112pWQ61]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Thyroid, unspecified (thyroid) [^114MXfMR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

Pregnant mothers provide little or no thyroid hormone to the fetus. The incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is relatively high (1:4,000) and the hypothyroid fetus would not derive any benefit from the small amounts of hormone crossing the placental barrier. Routine determinations of serum T4 and/or TSH is strongly advised in neonates in view of the deleterious effects of thyroid deficiency on growth and development.

Treatment should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis, and maintained for life, unless transient hypothyroidism is suspected; in which case, therapy may be interrupted for 2 to 8 weeks after the age of 3 years to reassess the condition. Cessation of therapy is justified in patients who have maintained a normal TSH during those 2 to 8 weeks.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

### Is an isolated TSH elevation in chronic nonthyroidal illness "subclinical hypothyroidism"? [^111brCgr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Elevated TSH with normal T4 frequently occurs with chronic kidney, liver, and heart diseases. Whether isolated TSH elevations represent mild thyroid gland failure has not been established.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed was searched for longitudinal studies in chronic heart, liver, or kidney disease documenting persistent isolated TSH elevations or progression to overt hypothyroidism.

Evidence Synthesis

Four articles met inclusion criteria. In 16 end-stage renal failure patients, four had isolated TSH elevations. All normalized within 14 months. In 452 systolic heart failure patients, 20 had isolated TSH elevations, five of 20 were persistent, and none progressed to overt hypothyroidism within 6 months. In 207 untreated chronic hepatitis C patients, 12 had isolated TSH elevations and four had increased TSH with reduced free T4; all were female, and 14 had positive antithyroid antibodies. After 1 year, two of 12 developed "clinical hypothyroidism". In 72 chronic hepatitis C patients, nine females had positive antithyroid antibodies. Two antibody-negative patients had TSH 5–6 mU/L with reduced free T4. After 1 year, three of four with positive antithyroid antibodies and baseline TSH < 4 mU/L had elevated TSH with reduced free T4.

Conclusions

In chronically ill patients, there is inadequate evidence to determine: 1) that isolated TSH elevations usually persist or progress to overt hypothyroidism; 2) the etiology and clinical significance of isolated TSH elevations; and 3) whether levothyroxine therapy is indicated for persistent isolated TSH elevations. Thus, isolated TSH elevations in chronic renal, cardiac, or liver diseases have not been documented to indicate mild thyroid gland failure.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^113skzpS]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care.
Adjustment of the screening strategy will reduce costs, unnecessary follow-up and patient concerns.
An alternative strategy is to elevate the TSH cutoff value; this also led to improved positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism
