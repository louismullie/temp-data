## Question

Best weight loss method

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best weight loss method is and how to choose it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "best" should be defined clinically and by guidelines. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence-based options and their expected outcomes. Next, I will examine the core components of intensive lifestyle intervention and their maintenance requirements. After that, I need to check escalation pathways, including pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery, and align them with BMI and comorbidity profiles. Finally, I should consider special populations, early nonresponse, and practical implementation to synthesize a personalized recommendation anchored in current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition of "best". Clinically meaningful weight loss is generally defined as at least 5% of initial body weight, with greater benefits accruing at 10% or more, and the intervention should be sustainable, safe, and aligned with patient goals and comorbidities. I should double-check that these thresholds are consistent across guidelines, and yes, USPSTF, ACC/AHA, and diabetes standards converge on 5–10% as the key range for cardiometabolic benefit [^115RdrCP] [^113nUNkq] [^115dBKuV].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite newer medications, comprehensive lifestyle intervention remains first-line for most adults with overweight or obesity because it is safe, broadly effective, and guideline-endorsed. I need to ensure I cite the right sources, and USPSTF gives a B recommendation for intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions, while ACC/AHA and diabetes standards similarly prioritize lifestyle as foundational therapy [^115RdrCP] [^113nUNkq] [^115dBKuV].

> I will now examine the core components of effective lifestyle therapy. Wait, let me verify the intensity and structure: high-intensity programs with at least 14 contacts over 6 months, a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit, at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic activity with progression to 200–300 minutes for maintenance, and behavior therapy with self-monitoring and relapse prevention yield average 5–10% weight loss at 6–12 months. I should confirm that these elements are consistently supported, and yes, USPSTF, ACC/AHA, and diabetes standards align on these specifics [^115RdrCP] [^113nUNkq] [^115dBKuV].

> But wait, what about durability and maintenance — this is where many programs falter. I need to check the long-term data: without structured maintenance, weight regain is common, yet extended behavioral support reduces regain by about 1.6 kg on average, and programs that taper intensity gradually and remain accessible after the active phase are associated with slower regain. I should confirm these figures, and the BMJ meta-analyses and USPSTF evidence report support them [^111HzuQr] [^112JVzR9] [^115qN4qH].

> Now, I should review escalation pathways. If lifestyle alone fails to achieve clinically meaningful loss or if BMI is high with significant comorbidities, pharmacotherapy is appropriate. I should double-check the magnitude of benefit: orlistat yields about 2.8% additional TBWL, naltrexone-bupropion achieves roughly 4–5%, liraglutide 3.0 mg about 4–5%, semaglutide 2.4 mg about 12–15%, and tirzepatide about 15–23%, with the strongest evidence for GLP-1–based agents. I need to ensure I cite pivotal trials and guidelines, and STEP 3, SURMOUNT-3, and AGA guidance corroborate these ranges [^112BFVzL] [^116NJcXz] [^111CVSAV].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of surgery. For BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with serious comorbidities, metabolic and bariatric surgery achieves the largest and most durable weight loss, typically > 20% TBWL, with high rates of diabetes remission and long-term cardiovascular benefit. I should confirm indications and outcomes, and ASMBS/IFSO and diabetes standards support these indications and magnitude of effect [^1134E8J5].

> Let me consider special populations and thresholds. For type 2 diabetes, modest weight loss improves glycemia, and ≥ 10% loss increases remission likelihood. For NAFLD, ≥ 5% improves steatosis, ≥ 7% resolves NASH, and ≥ 10% can regress fibrosis. For older adults, I need to ensure we prioritize preserving muscle mass and avoid overly aggressive caloric restriction. These disease-specific targets are supported by diabetes standards, AASLD/AGA guidance, and cardiovascular prevention guidelines [^115dBKuV] [^113QcofM] [^117F6gxu].

> I should double-check early nonresponse and stepped care. Slow early weight loss predicts poor long-term outcomes, so if patients fail to lose about 2.5% by 1 month, guidelines advise escalation; stepped-care models can be resource-efficient, though standard high-intensity programs may yield slightly greater losses; I need to ensure I cite both the early nonresponse data and the stepped-care RCT, which are supported by AACE and the STEP trial [^115KsNtH] [^114pnZga].

> Next, I should review implementation realities. In-person, group-based programs are most effective but hard to scale. Digital and hybrid models expand reach with smaller average losses. I should confirm that combining modalities and ensuring frequent contact improves outcomes, and USPSTF and behavioral reviews support this, while also noting that real-world translation often shows lower effect sizes than trials [^115RdrCP] [^114xjnoy].

> Let me synthesize a practical, personalized approach. For most adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², start with high-intensity, multicomponent lifestyle therapy targeting 5–10% loss, embed maintenance planning from the outset, and reassess at 1 month. Escalate to pharmacotherapy if < 2.5% loss or if BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities, choosing an agent based on comorbidity profile and patient preference. Consider referral for bariatric surgery if BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with serious comorbidities after failure of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy. Throughout, align goals with the patient's values, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust the plan longitudinally. I should confirm that this pathway aligns with USPSTF, ACC/AHA, and endocrine guidance, which it does [^115RdrCP] [^113nUNkq] [^117BF7Mj].

> Final answer: There is no single "best" method for everyone. The best method is the one that achieves at least 5–10% sustained weight loss safely and is feasible for the individual. For most, that begins with intensive, multicomponent lifestyle intervention as first-line. For those who do not achieve clinically meaningful loss or have higher BMI and comorbidities, add pharmacotherapy, with bariatric surgery for eligible patients with severe obesity or refractory disease. Personalize the choice to BMI, comorbidities, prior response, access, and preferences, and plan proactively for maintenance to preserve health gains [^115RdrCP] [^115dBKuV] [^117MyZPs].

---

The best weight loss method is a **comprehensive lifestyle intervention** [^113nUNkq] that combines a calorie-restricted diet, regular physical activity, and behavioral therapy [^114NJoL7], delivered with at least 14 structured contacts over 6 months [^114VFF7x]. This approach achieves **5–10% weight loss** [^114VFF7x] and improves cardiometabolic health [^113nUNkq]; for greater or sustained loss, add pharmacotherapy (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) [^112BFVzL] or consider bariatric surgery for BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities [^notfound]. Weight regain is common [^112JVzR9], so ongoing support and monitoring are essential [^111HzuQr].

---

## Dietary interventions

- **Caloric restriction**: Creating a 500–750 kcal/day deficit [^115dBKuV] is foundational and yields ~3–5 kg loss over 6–12 months [^111NcqVb].

- **Macronutrient composition**: No single diet is superior [^116yGGPb]; Mediterranean, low-fat, and low-carb diets are effective when they achieve sustained caloric deficits [^116yGGPb].

- **Meal replacements**: Portion-controlled or meal replacements can enhance adherence and short-term loss [^116sJ8jf].

---

## Physical activity

Regular **aerobic exercise** (≥ 150 min/week) supports weight loss and maintenance [^114NJoL7]; increasing to 200–300 min/week improves long-term weight control [^117Ggn8d]. Resistance training **preserves lean mass** during weight loss and improves metabolic health [^notfound].

---

## Behavioral therapy

Self-monitoring of intake, activity, and weight [^114xjnoy] improves adherence and outcomes [^114xjnoy]. Cognitive-behavioral strategies — goal setting, problem solving, and relapse prevention — enhance long-term success [^111y5X3U].

---

## Pharmacotherapy

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for **BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities** after lifestyle therapy [^notfound]. Current options include **GLP-1 receptor agonists** (semaglutide, liraglutide), which achieve 10–15% weight loss [^112BFVzL] and improve glycemic and cardiovascular risk factors [^11695jAi], and **combination therapies** such as naltrexone-bupropion and phentermine-topiramate, which achieve 5–10% loss [^notfound].

---

## Bariatric surgery

Bariatric surgery is indicated for **BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with serious comorbidities** [^notfound]. Procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and adjustable gastric banding typically achieve 20–35% excess weight loss and durable metabolic benefits [^1134E8J5].

---

## Long-term weight maintenance

Long-term weight maintenance commonly involves **weight regain** [^112JVzR9]; about 50% regain within 1–2 years without ongoing support [^notfound]. Continued contact (monthly or more) [^117Ggn8d], high physical activity (200–300 min/week) [^114NJoL7], and regular self-monitoring reduce regain [^114xjnoy].

---

## Individualized approach

An individualized approach tailors therapy to **age, gender, comorbidities, preferences, and readiness to change** [^114VFF7x]. Shared decision-making aligns treatment with patient goals and improves adherence [^117BF7Mj].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Intervention** | **Average weight loss** | **Long-term effectiveness** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lifestyle intervention | 5–10% | Moderate | First-line for all |
| Pharmacotherapy | 10–15% | Moderate | BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 with comorbidities |
| Bariatric surgery | 20–35% | High | BMI ≥ 40 or ≥ 35 with comorbidities |

---

The most effective, evidence-based weight loss method is a **comprehensive lifestyle intervention** [^112gpDTN] combining caloric restriction, physical activity, and behavioral therapy, with escalation to pharmacotherapy or surgery as needed [^1134E8J5]. Sustained success requires ongoing support and individualized care [^117BF7Mj].

Behavior-based weight loss interventions in adults — health outcomes, diabetes incidence, and weight change show modest benefits. Few health outcomes were identified in the behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance trials (20 trials [n = 9910]), with no significant differences in mortality (4 trials [n = 4442]) or cardiovascular events (2 trials [n = 2666]), and health-related quality of life mostly showing no statistically significant differences (17 trials [n = 7120]). Thirteen behavior-based weight loss trials (n = 4095) evaluated incident type 2 diabetes; in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, intervention participants were less likely to develop diabetes after 9 years (40.0% vs 54.5%; hazard ratio, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3 to 0.7]), and pooling 9 studies showed a reduced 10-year risk (pooled risk ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89]). At 12 to 18 months, pooled weight loss among intervention participants was −2.39 kg [−5.3 lb] [95% CI, −2.86 to −1.93], and participants were more likely to lose 5% of initial weight than controls (risk ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.70 to 2.22]; number needed to treat = 8). In weight loss maintenance interventions, participants had less weight gain than controls (pooled mean difference, −1.59 kg [−3.5 lb] [95% CI, −2.38 to −0.79]).

Introduction

Excess adiposity is a leading cause of preventable disease and death worldwide. Behavioural weight management programmes that aim to achieve weight loss in adults by changes in diet, exercise, or both, are recommended for the treatment of obesity. Most programmes produce short term weight loss but considerable uncertainty exists about their longer term effects.

In a companion systematic review, pooled analyses from 145 studies comparing behavioural weight loss programmes with minimal intervention controls estimated that regain in weight after the end of the programme was 0.12–0.32 kg/year in intervention groups relative to a minimal or no intervention comparator, with a difference between groups evident for at least five years but with considerable variation in the rate of regain in weight (unpublished data). Behavioural weight loss programmes reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, with reductions in risk factors for cardiovascular disease and improvements in quality of life corresponding to the weight loss. Regain in weight reversed some of these differences, however, with improvements in blood pressure, lipids, and quality of life seen at the end of the programme declining over time in association with regain in weight.

Concern about regain in weight and the long term value of attempts at weight loss has been identified as a barrier to engagement in behavioural weight loss programmes from patients and healthcare providers. Considerable research has been done on developing and testing specific weight loss maintenance programmes, but with little success. Programmes have achieved modest success, with behavioural support intended to promote lasting adherence to changes in diet and increased physical activity. Continuing support is expensive, however, and most people choose not to take it up.

Our study aimed to determine whether specific characteristics of behavioural weight loss programmes influence the rate of change in weight after the end of the programme, specifically focusing on the effect of these programmes on regain in weight. Such evidence could inform the development of interventions, patient choice, and expectations of practitioners, and improve the effectiveness of treatment in the long term for people with overweight or obesity.

Discussion

While early total body weight loss of at least 5% labels patients as responders to AOM, a higher response should be targeted; 5–10% total body weight loss is associated with a reduction in the risk of various metabolic, skeletal, and anatomical complications of obesity, and a total body weight loss > 15% may be needed to result in improvement of CV outcomes, as observed in studies assessing effects of weight loss in response to lifestyle modifications. The effectiveness of the currently available weight loss monotherapies is still modest, with the exception of GLP-1 RA, and in particular semaglutide, which in combination with behavioral modification therapy, may achieve more than 15% weight loss. The combination of more than one molecule may be needed to achieve a larger total body weight loss; for instance, tirzepatide, a GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist, led to ∼23% weight loss with the highest dose. New drugs seem thus have a much higher potency and are expected to change the medical weight management landscape in the not-so-distant future. Trials on AOM showed improvement in various metabolic parameters, some of which were of a small magnitude with a limited clinical implication. Furthermore, whether this effect has been driven solely by total body weight loss, rather than a direct effect of the drug per se, and whether it differs between metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy individuals with obesity, has been poorly investigated. While some available data showed improvement in liver steatosis with GLP1-RA, there is no evidence of reduction in liver fibrosis with any AOM, a parameter that requires longer term studies to show benefit. To-date, data on the effect of AOM on CV outcomes are still lacking. However, indirect evidence from trials in patients with DM is promising. The LEADER trial compared liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) to placebo in patients with DM on a composite CV outcome (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarct and non-fatal stroke). After a median follow up of 3.8 years, there was a 13% relative risk reduction in the composite CV outcomes and 22% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death, in liraglutide group, compared to placebo. In a similar study design in patients with DM, semaglutide showed a 26% relative risk reduction the composite CV outcome, compared to placebo, while there was no difference in CV death. Interestingly, new findings suggest a potential neuroprotective effect of GLP-1 agonist, with a reduction of the risk of dementia and age-related cognitive decline, associated with diabetes and obesity; such a promising effect needs to be demonstrated in large prospective studies, extending over several years to decades.

Methods

A protocol was registered in advance; full methodological details are in the protocoland in a companion publication (unpublished).

Data sources and searches

We searched for randomised controlled trials in clinical trials registries (and) and 11 electronic databases, with terms relating to obesity, weight loss, diet, exercise, behaviour change, and behavioural weight loss programmes. We also searched the Health Services Research Unit's (University of Aberdeen) register of weight loss trials. Searches were run from database inception to September 2018 and were restricted to full papers published in English. The authors were contacted for additional information where necessary. In December 2019 (before the analyses), we conducted forward citation searches for included or ongoing studies where the most recent publication was from January 2007 onwards, to identify additional longer term follow-up data.

Study selection

Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, with disagreements resolved by discussion or by referral to a third reviewer. We included randomised controlled trials of non-pregnant adults (aged ≥ 18) who were mostly with overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥ 25, or ≥ 23 in Asian populations) at the start of the study. Interventions included behavioural weight loss programmes delivered in any setting, and comparators were another behavioural weight loss programme, a less intensive intervention, or no intervention. We excluded interventions targeting multiple risk factors (eg, also including interventions for stopping smoking) and interventions involving drug treatments, surgery, or both. Studies had to follow participants for ≥ 12 months from baseline and measure the change in weight at the end of the programme and after the end of the programme. We defined the end of the programme as the time when the intensity of the contact was considerably reduced or ended (full details are in the protocol).

Outcome

Our primary outcome was rate of change in weight after the end of the programme in the intervention group relative to the control groups. In most of the studies included in the review, data on weight were based on complete case or multiple imputation methods. The control group was determined by the intensity of the intervention (that is, comparing the most intensive with the least intensive intervention). This definition was based on contact time and the elements of the programme (eg, in a study of behavioural support with meal replacements v behavioural support only, the meal replacement arm would be the primary intervention of interest).

### Interpreting weight losses from lifestyle modification trials: using categorical data [^115MaKgW]. International Journal of Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

Although studies in obese subjects using weight loss medications typically report mean and categorical weight loss, results from diet and exercise intervention trials typically only report mean weight change from baseline along with a level of significance. These data alone do not give clinicians or administrators the data needed to determine the probability that an individual will achieve clinically relevant weight loss. Thus, it is difficult to decide which patients, employees or health plan enrollee would benefit from the type and level of support used in a clinical trial. Our goal was to assess what fraction of subjects enrolled in lifestyle modification interventions achieved clinically significant weight loss. Thus, we requested categorical weight loss data from several investigators who had published results from studies involving either a high- or low-intensity lifestyle modification intervention arm. These categorical data indicate that a substantial fraction of subjects in each lifestyle modification intervention achieved clinically meaningful weight loss, even when the average weight loss is modest.

### Lifestyle modification for the management of obesity [^116sJ8jf]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Several expert panels have recommended that obese individuals attempt to lose 10% of their initial body weight through a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy (frequently referred to as lifestyle modification). This article reviews the short-and long-term results of lifestyle modification and methods to improve them. Randomized controlled trials were examined that compared different diet and activity interventions for inducing and maintaining weight loss. Studies that compared different methods of providing lifestyle modification, including on-site vs. Internet-based delivery, also were examined. A comprehensive lifestyle modification program was found to induce a loss of approximately 10% of initial weight in 16 to 26 weeks of group or individual treatment, delivered on-site. Comprehensive Internet-based programs induced a loss of approximately half this size. Patients' consumption of portion-controlled diets, including liquid meal replacements, was associated with significantly greater short-term weight loss than was the consumption of isocaloric diets comprised of conventional foods. Factors associated with long-term weight control included continued patient-practitioner contact (whether on-site or by e-mail), high levels of physical activity, and the long-term use of pharmacotherapy combined with lifestyle modification. In summary, lifestyle modification induces clinically significant weight loss that is associated with the prevention or amelioration of cardiovascular risk factors.

2 LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION

Lifestyle interventions encompass dietary, physical activity and behavioural modifications to induce weight loss. The complex interplay between behavioural, biological, cultural, economic, environmental and psycho‐social factors needs to be considered during such interventions, as these factors play a crucial role not only in the effectiveness of inducing weight loss but also in maintaining weight loss. Central to lifestyle intervention are strategies to reduce energy intake, coupled with high levels of physical activity (e.g. prescribed aerobic exercise and resistance training), promoting active leisure‐time pursuits and reduced sedentary time, all of which aim to induce and maintain meaningful weight loss – often defined as a reduction of > 5% of initial weight, a target weight loss known to be associated with cardio‐metabolic benefits.

In 2018, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reaffirmed its recommendation that primary care health professionals screen all adults for obesity and offer those affected 'intensive, multicomponent behavioural interventions'This recommendation reflect the strength of evidence that supports the efficacy of behavioural intervention, described in this review for the management of obesity. However this is likely to be challenging to deliver, due to the vast number of people living with obesity as well as the limited expertise to deliver this.

### Need for lifestyle intervention: how to begin [^111y5X3U]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The metabolic syndrome is the fastest growing disease entity in the world. Prevention and effective treatment emphasize lifestyle intervention, including healthful diet, physical activity, and pharmacologic agents to target specific risk factors. Weight loss improves all aspects of the metabolic syndrome and is a primary intervention target. Effective weight management also helps prevent the development of the metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle change strategies — including setting reasonable goals, raising awareness, confronting barriers to change, managing stress, cognitive restructuring, preventing relapse, and providing support — are the keys to long-term success.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114xx6dg]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD NAFLD practice guidance — lifestyle intervention (weight loss) states that weight loss of 3%–5% improves steatosis, but greater weight loss (> 10%) is generally required to improve NASH and fibrosis. Few patients (< 10%) achieve effective weight loss despite structured interventions at 1 year, and fewer than half of these maintain the weight lost 5 years after intervention. Sustained weight loss reduces adipose tissue stress and improves peripheral insulin sensitivity, although achieving and sustaining weight loss is challenging.

### The future of obesity reduction: beyond weight loss [^111mfcVN]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Obesity increases the risk of morbidity and mortality and reduces quality of life independent of age, sex or ethnicity. Leading health authorities recommend weight loss as a primary treatment strategy for obesity reduction — weight loss goals range from 5% to 10% of initial body weight. Intentional weight loss in most adults is associated with a reduction in many of the health complications of obesity. Nonetheless, emerging evidence supports the notion that a lifestyle-modification program characterized by an increase in physical activity and a balanced diet can reduce obesity and the risk of obesity-related comorbid conditions despite minimal or no weight loss. The benefits of such an approach include appreciable reductions in abdominal obesity, visceral fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, and increases in both skeletal muscle mass and cardiorespiratory fitness. Individuals with obesity face a serious challenge if they are to attain even modest weight loss in today's obesogenic environment. Clinicians could encourage positive lifestyle changes in their patients by counseling them that obesity and its associated health risks can be reduced in response to an increase in physical activity with or without weight loss.

### The role of lifestyle changes in the management of chronic liver disease [^111hCbmd]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We and others have demonstrated in a research setting that sustained weight loss of even a few kilograms has a beneficial effect on the biochemical and histological features of disease in overweight patients with NAFLD and chronic HCV. In one of the only randomized, controlled trials examining the effects of weight loss on NAFLD after intensive lifestyle modification, it was reported that after 48 weeks of intervention, patients who received intensive lifestyle modification lost 9.3% of their body weight as compared to 0.2% loss in control subjects. Importantly, in addition to weight loss, patients experienced improvement in the NAS activity score as well as reduction in alanine transaminase levels. These studies reflect the need for effective methods of weight reduction in an outpatient setting to become a more important aspect of clinical care. Despite the recognized benefits, achieving even modest amounts of weight loss and maintaining it in clinical practice is difficult. Intensive interventions that mimic those established by research projects are perceived as expensive and demanding on the dietetic service. Typically, patients are unable to lose or even maintain their weight, so they lose motivation. In these cases, the patients do not follow through with lifestyle interventions and/or use pharmacological interventions instead. Therefore, when discussing physical activity with patients, the discussion should focus on impediments to increasing physical activity and finding ways for patients to incorporate exercise into their lives on a regular basis. It is often helpful to separate the benefits of exercise from weight loss. Since exercise has its own benefits in terms of a sense of well-being, and improved metabolic status including insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis. Being discouraged about lack of weight loss during these lifestyle interventions should not be a reason to quit.

### AGA clinical practice update on lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^117YKtyu]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Lifestyle modification and weight loss for NAFLD — Best Practice Advice 1 states that lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss is beneficial for all patients with NAFLD, and adds that lifestyle modification centered on diet and physical activity to achieve weight loss as well as the avoidance of alcohol are the foundations of treatment for all patients with NAFLD, regardless of histologic type. It also notes that lifestyle modification including significant weight loss through hypocaloric diet and exercise is considered as a first-line intervention for the treatment of NAFLD, while medications, bariatric endoscopy, and surgery to achieve weight loss may be considered for select subsets of patients with severe obesity, co-existing diabetes mellitus, and/or biopsy-proven NASH with, at a minimum, stage 2 fibrosis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for obesity, more specifically with respect to maintenance of weight loss, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to offer face-to-face or telephone-delivered weight-loss maintenance programs for weight-loss maintenance to provide regular contact (monthly or more frequently) with a trained interventionist helping participants engage in high levels of physical activity (200–300 min/week), monitor body weight regularly (weekly or more frequently), and consume a reduced-calorie diet (needed to maintain lower body weight).

### A closer look at ACC / AHA and ESC Guidelines for managing obesity and Overweight in adults [^117F6gxu]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Weight loss in obesity and overweight

Both the ACC/AHA and ECS guidelines recommend weight loss in individuals with overweight and obesity to improve the risk factor profile for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A clinically meaningful weight loss is defined as a 5% reduction in body weight, which is associated with improvements in blood pressure, lipid profiles, glycemic control, and even premature all-cause mortality in patients with obesity or overweight. However, ESC guidelines caution that weight loss should not be the primary focus in older adults, as it may be associated with higher mortality, a phenomenon known as the obesity paradox. The ESC guidelines recommend that older adults with obesity or overweight should focus on preserving muscle mass and getting adequate nutrition rather than losing weight, considering uncertainties around the obesity paradox and potential biases like reverse causality. The ACC/AHA guideline also stresses caution in achieving weight loss in older adults, in order to prevent loss of lean body mass and nutritional deficiencies.

### Effect of subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 3 randomized clinical trial [^112BFVzL]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Weight loss improves cardiometabolic risk factors in people with overweight or obesity. Intensive lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy are the most effective noninvasive weight loss approaches.

Objective

To compare the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg vs placebo for weight management as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy with initial low-calorie diet in adults with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 68-week, phase 3a study (STEP 3) conducted at 41 sites in the US from August 2018 to April 2020 in adults without diabetes (N = 611) and with either overweight (body mass index ≥ 27) plus at least 1 comorbidity or obesity (body mass index ≥ 30).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (2:1) to semaglutide, 2.4 mg (n = 407) or placebo (n = 204), both combined with a low-calorie diet for the first 8 weeks and intensive behavioral therapy (ie, 30 counseling visits) during 68 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The co-primary end points were percentage change in body weight and the loss of 5% or more of baseline weight by week 68. Confirmatory secondary end points included losses of at least 10% or 15% of baseline weight.

Results

Of 611 randomized participants (495 women [81.0%], mean age 46 years [SD, 13], body weight 105.8 kg [SD, 22.9], and body mass index 38.0 [SD, 6.7]), 567 (92.8%) completed the trial, and 505 (82.7%) were receiving treatment at trial end. At week 68, the estimated mean body weight change from baseline was -16.0% for semaglutide vs -5.7% for placebo (difference, -10.3 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -8.6]; P < .001). More participants treated with semaglutide vs placebo lost at least 5% of baseline body weight (86.6% vs 47.6%, respectively; P < .001). A higher proportion of participants in the semaglutide vs placebo group achieved weight losses of at least 10% or 15% (75.3% vs 27.0% and 55.8% vs 13.2%, respectively; P < .001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide (82.8%) vs placebo (63.2%). Treatment was discontinued owing to these events in 3.4% of semaglutide participants vs 0% of placebo participants.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with placebo, used as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy and initial low-calorie diet, resulted in significantly greater weight loss during 68 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the durability of these findings.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

General principles — medical management of obesity — emphasize that comprehensive treatment of obesity is multimodal, obesity treatment is multidisciplinary, and patients should be guided toward evidence-based interventions while being educated regarding nonevidence-based options that may pose potential harm. Clinicians should incorporate shared decision-making to balance risks and benefits, and off-label, but evidence-based, strategies may be considered to mitigate potential harms and optimize health outcomes (for example, lowest therapeutic dose for weight loss maintenance and combination therapies).

Lifestyle modification and weight loss for NAFLD — Best Practice Advice 3 states that clinically significant weight loss generally requires a hypocaloric diet targeting 1200–1500 kcal/d or a reduction of 500–1000 kcal/d from baseline. The text further specifies that hypocaloric diets are characterized by a decrease in daily caloric intake by 500–1000 kcal/d or to a target of 1200 kcal/d for women and 1400–1500 kcal/d for men.

### The latest evidence and guidance in lifestyle and surgical interventions to achieve weight loss in people with overweight or obesity [^114VFF7x]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Irrespective of the approach, frequent contact is crucial for effective weight loss. As such, in the first 6 months of a lifestyle intervention, individuals should receive at least 14 individual or group treatment sessions. Such high‐intensity programs produce approximately 5% to 10% body weight loss, on average, over 6 months, with no additional benefits observed by increasing intensity further (e.g. 24 rather than 16 sessions in 6 months). A recent meta‐analysis indicated that online, group‐based interventions would also produce a statistically significant impact on weight loss in people with severe obesity, but barriers such as internet accessibility, digital literacy and unfamiliarity with group members need to be mitigated. Cost effectiveness may favour the use of group rather than individual treatment, with a recent systematic review reporting greater efficacy with group treatmentbut the approach needs to be individualized according to patients' preferences. Where patients fail to achieve > 2.5% weight loss within 1 month of starting treatment, behavioural interventions need to be escalated. Maintenance of weight loss is challenging, with many individuals affected by weight regain. The reasons for this are multifactorial, which include physiological and psychological factors, adherence to dietary and lifestyle interventions, socio‐economic factors, and the impact of comorbidities as well as the use of concurrent therapies that may promote weight gain. Clinical assessments should therefore include identification of obesity‐related comorbidities using the AACE/ACE guidelineor the Edmonton Obesity staging system(Table 1) and readiness to make change. The presence of comorbidities should individualize treatment targets, that is, a minimum of 5% weight loss for obesity stages 1 & 2; and at least 10% weight loss for individuals with higher stages of obesity.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obesity, more specifically with respect to multicomponent lifestyle/behavioral interventions, AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend to intensify behavioral lifestyle intervention and support if patients do not achieve a 2.5% weight loss in the first month of treatment, as early weight reduction is a key predictor of long-term weight-loss success.

### Effect of a stepped-care intervention approach on weight loss in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^114pnZga]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Given the obesity epidemic, effective but resource-efficient weight loss treatments are needed. Stepped-treatment approaches customize interventions based on milestone completion and can be more effective while costing less to administer than conventional treatment approaches.

Objective

To determine whether a stepped-care weight loss intervention (STEP) compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (SBWI) would result in greater weight loss.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial of 363 overweight and obese adults (body mass index: 25- < 40; age: 18–55 years, 33% nonwhite, and 83% female) who were randomized to SBWI (n = 165) or STEP (n = 198) at 2 universities affiliated with academic medical centers in the United States (Step-Up Study). Participants were enrolled between May 2008 and February 2010 and data collection was completed by September 2011.

Interventions

All participants were placed on a low-calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical activity, and attended group counseling sessions ranging from weekly to monthly during an 18-month period. The SBWI group was assigned to a fixed program. Counseling frequency, type, and weight loss strategies could be modified every 3 months for the STEP group in response to observed weight loss as it related to weight loss goals.

Main Outcome Measure

Mean change in weight over 18 months. Additional outcomes included resting heart rate and blood pressure, waist circumference, body composition, fitness, physical activity, dietary intake, and cost of the program.

Results

Of the 363 participants randomized, 260 (71.6%) provided a measure of mean change in weight over 18 months. The 18-month intervention resulted in weight decreasing from 93.1 kg (95% CI, 91.0 to 95.2 kg) to 85.6 kg (95% CI, 83.4 to 87.7 kg) (P < .001) in the SBWI group and from 92.7 kg (95% CI, 90.8 to 94.6 kg) to 86.4 kg (95% CI, 84.5 to 88.4 kg) in the STEP group (P < .001). The percentage change in weight from baseline to 18 months was -8.1% (95% CI, -9.4% to -6.9%) in the SBWI group (P < .001) compared with -6.9% (95% CI, -8.0% to -5.8%) in the STEP group (P < .001). Although the between-group difference in 18-month weight loss was not statistically different (-1.3 kg [95% CI, -2.8 to 0.2 kg]; p = 0.09), there was a significant group × time interaction effect (P = 0.03). The cost per participant was $1357 (95% CI, $1272 to $1442) for the SBWI group vs $785 (95% CI, $739 to $830) for the STEP group (P < .001). Both groups had significant and comparable improvements in resting heart rate, blood pressure level, and fitness.

Conclusions

Among overweight and obese adults, the use of SBWI resulted in a greater mean weight loss than STEP over 18 months. Compared with SBWI, STEP resulted in clinically meaningful weight loss that cost less to implement.

### Behavioral lifestyle interventions for moderate and severe obesity: a systematic review [^114kRUJ8]. Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Moderate and severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) affect 15% of US adults, with a projected increase over the next two decades. This study reviews evidence of behavioral lifestyle interventions for weight loss in this population. We searched PubMed, PsychInfo, CINAHL®, and Scopus through February 2016 for experimental and quasi-experimental studies that tested a dietary and/or physical activity intervention with a behavioral modification component versus a comparator; and had ≥ six-month follow-up and a weight-related primary outcome. Twelve studies representing 1862 participants (mean BMI 37.5–48.3, mean age 30–54 years) were included. Nine studies compared different behavioral interventions and three tested behavioral intervention(s) versus pharmacological or surgical treatments. Among the 25 behavioral interventions in the 12 studies, 18 reported percent of participants achieving clinically significant weight loss up to 12months (32–97% achieving 5% or 3–70% achieving 10%). Three studies measured other cardiometabolic risk factors, but showed no significant risk reduction. Seven interventions with greater effectiveness (i.e., at least 31% achieving ≥ 10% or 62% achieving ≥ 5% weight loss up to one year) included multiple components (diet, physical activity, and behavioral strategies), long duration (e.g., one year), and/or intensive contacts (e.g., inpatient stays for clinic-based interventions, weekly contacts for community-based ones). Evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions versus pharmacological or surgical treatment was limited. Comprehensive and intensive behavioral interventions can result in clinically significant, albeit modest, weight loss in this obese subpopulation but may not result significant improvements in other cardiometabolic risk factors. More research on scalable and sustainable interventions is needed.

### Long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertension [^113rjAaG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

All major guidelines for antihypertensive therapy recommend weight loss. Dietary interventions that aim to reduce body weight might therefore be a useful intervention to reduce blood pressure and adverse cardiovascular events associated with hypertension.

Objectives

Primary objectives To assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertension on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and total non-serious adverse events). Secondary objectives To assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertension on change from baseline in systolic blood pressure, change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure, and body weight reduction.

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2020, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 24 weeks' duration that compared weight-reducing dietary interventions to no dietary intervention in adults with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Where appropriate and in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (P > 0.1), we pooled studies using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. In case of moderate or larger heterogeneity as measured by Higgins I², we used a random-effects model.

Main Results

This second review update did not reveal any new trials, so the number of included trials remains the same: eight RCTs involving a total of 2100 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 45 to 66 years. Mean treatment duration was 6 to 36 months. We judged the risks of bias as unclear or high for all but two trials. No study included mortality as a predefined outcome. One RCT evaluated the effects of dietary weight loss on a combined endpoint consisting of the necessity of reinstating antihypertensive therapy and severe cardiovascular complications. In this RCT, weight-reducing diet lowered the endpoint compared to no diet: hazard ratio 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.87). None of the trials evaluated adverse events as designated in our protocol. The certainty of the evidence was low for a blood pressure reduction in participants assigned to weight-loss diets as compared to controls: systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) -4.5 mm Hg (95% CI -7.2 to -1.8 mm Hg) (3 studies, 731 participants), and diastolic blood pressure: MD -3.2 mm Hg (95% CI -4.8 to -1.5 mm Hg) (3 studies, 731 participants). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for weight reduction in dietary weight loss groups as compared to controls: MD -4.0 kg (95% CI -4.8 to -3.2) (5 trials, 880 participants). Two trials used withdrawal of antihypertensive medication as their primary outcome. Even though we did not consider this a relevant outcome for our review, the results of these RCTs strengthen the finding of a reduction of blood pressure by dietary weight-loss interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

In this second update, the conclusions remain unchanged, as we found no new trials. In people with primary hypertension, weight-loss diets reduced body weight and blood pressure, but the magnitude of the effects are uncertain due to the small number of participants and studies included in the analyses. Whether weight loss reduces mortality and morbidity is unknown. No useful information on adverse effects was reported in the relevant trials.

Lifestyle modification and weight loss for NAFLD — Best Practice Advice 2 indicates that among patients with NASH, weight loss of ≥ 5% total body weight (TBW) can decrease hepatic steatosis, weight loss of ≥ 7% TBW can lead to NASH resolution, and weight loss of ≥ 10% TBW can result in fibrosis regression/stability. Supporting trial data reported that although the control had no significant change in weight, the ILI group lost, on average, 9.3% TBW, and that patients with ≥ 7% TBW loss had significant improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and NAFLD activity score, although no change in fibrosis was seen.

Behavioral counseling interventions — weight loss maintenance trials enrolled adults after prior weight loss and reported midlife BMI and age ranges. Nine trials focused on behavior-based weight loss maintenance. Study sites were in the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, and Australia. In most trials (8 trials), participants came from an unselected population of adults who were overweight or had obesity, and one trial enrolled participants with cardiovascular risk factors. Trial sample sizes ranged from 92 to 1032. Participants were required to meet weight loss goals before enrollment. The mean BMI at enrollment ranged from 28.4 to 41.7 and the mean age ranged from 46.4 to 61.8 years (median, 49.2 years). One trial was limited to women, and 1 trial was limited to men.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^115PYZgr]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA guideline — Efficacy thresholds and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for total body weight loss (TBWL): The panel set the MCID for pharmacotherapy benefits as a mean difference of 3% TBWL versus lifestyle alone or an absolute 5% TBWL over baseline; given approximately 2% TBWL in placebo groups in randomized controlled trials, a ≥ 3% TBWL difference reaches 5% TBWL over baseline and was used as the MCID. In a secondary analysis of a lifestyle RCT in patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² and T2DM, losing 2%–5% TBWL was associated with improvements in blood pressure, glycemic control, and triglycerides. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services uses a threshold of 3-kg weight loss at 6 months for intensive behavioral therapy coverage. For regulatory and harm thresholds, the US FDA uses a 5% TBWL threshold to assess long-term pharmacotherapy efficacy, and the guideline panel deemed crossing 1% absolute risk to be an imprecise harms threshold.

### Demographic factors associated with postoperative complications in primary bariatric surgery: a rapid review [^114zEEEh]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity and associated complications compared to non-surgical management options. This procedure has had a surge in popularity worldwide where the total number of surgical and endoluminal procedures performed increased substantially in recent years. Current international clinical guidelines recommend bariatric surgery for adults with body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 kg/m², regardless of comorbidities, and consideration for those with a BMI of 30–34.9 kg/m² and metabolic disease who have had unsuccessful non-surgical treatment attempts to lose weight or improve their comorbidities.

Current understanding about bariatric surgery focuses on its benefits in terms of weight loss and improvements in weight-related complications. When compared to non-surgical treatment options, bariatric surgery is more effective in achieving weight loss after 12 and 24 months, including a recent systematic review reporting a mean weight loss of 30 kg at 20 years. Some studies even reported net weight gain 2 and 10 years after conventional treatment while surgical patients consistently lost weight. Bariatric surgery has been shown to provide further health benefits for individuals with weight-related complications, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Research has demonstrated improvements in T2DM following substantial weight loss of ≥ 10%, with bariatric surgery being the most cost-effective intervention. Furthermore, observational evidence suggests a direct linear relationship between weight loss beginning from at least 2% and improvements in glycated haemoglobin and fasting glucose. Although bariatric surgery is highly effective in managing severe obesity and its associated complications, further research is required to better understand its safety profile.

### Time to peak weight loss during extended behavioral treatment [^115rfsrD]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to examine the variability in timing of peak weight loss in behavioral treatment (BT), that is, when treatment participants reach their greatest amount of cumulative weight loss.

Methods

Secondary data analyses were conducted, drawing upon data from two clinical trials that provided 12 months of group-based BT, with sessions meeting less frequently in the second half of the treatment year. Weight was measured at the beginning of each treatment session.

Results

Cumulative proportions of participants reaching peak weight loss were as follows: 25.0% of study 1 and 20.0% of study 2 participants by month 4; 43.2% of study 1 and 52.2% of study 2 participants by month 6; 54.5% of study 1 and 77.8% of study 2 participants by month 8. Among participants who peaked after 4 months, the mean amount of additional weight loss achieved between 4 months and the peak session was 4.74 kg in study 1 and 4.07 kg in study 2.

Conclusions

Substantial variability in the timing of peak weight loss was observed, with larger than expected proportions of participants reaching their greatest amount of cumulative weight loss in the final months of treatment. This variability may create methodological and clinical challenges.

### Structured lifestyle modification as an adjunct to obesity pharmacotherapy: there is much to learn [^113b5WrL]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence for structured lifestyle modification in patients with obesity

Several well-conducted randomised controlled trials have shown the benefits of structured lifestyle modification programme patients with cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes. For example, the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial recruited over 5000 participants with type 2 diabetes and an average body mass index of 36 kg/m² who were randomised to "usual care" diabetes structured education or to "intensive lifestyle intervention", with an ambitious weight loss target of 10%, using meal replacement, if necessary, to achieve that goal. After ten years of follow-up, the intensive lifestyle intervention group lost more weight and had improvements in many important health related outcomes such as diabetes control and medication usage, but with no difference in the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events. This may have been due to a lower incidence than expected of cardiovascular events in the control group, and the overwhelming health improvements from intensive lifestyle intervention demonstrated in the trial should not be dismissed.

Drop-out from intensive lifestyle modification programmes can be very high in "real world" clinical studies, total weight loss is often modest and can be difficult to maintain in the longer term. While 10% weight loss is generally regarded as a meaningful level with which to improve health, it is rarely achieved with lifestyle modification alone, in stark contrast to the new generation of obesity drugs. In our own hospital-based regional referral centre for patients with severe obesity, only 12.8% of patients completing a ten-week, group-based, multidisciplinary structured diet and physical activity programme had reductions in body weight of 5% or more.

Structured lifestyle modification programmes are rarely offered in isolation in specialised multidisciplinary obesity clinics and are usually combined with surgical or pharmacological interventions. However, evidence that pre-operative lifestyle modification programmes are beneficial in patients undergoing bariatric surgery is also relatively weak, with methodological inconsistencies in some studies and very few high-quality randomised controlled trials being well-described limitations. In well-conducted clinical trials, results have not shown any benefits from structured lifestyle modification prior to bariatric surgery. In one trial, the only difference in participants who completed a structured lifestyle intervention before bariatric surgery was that, somewhat unexpectedly, they lost less rather than more weight in the years after surgery. Despite the lack of evidence, some jurisdictions and healthcare organisations still require patients to undertake mandatory structured lifestyle modification programmes before proceeding to surgery, which can act as a barrier to care and is contrary to European and American clinical practice guidelines.

### Long term maintenance of weight loss with non-surgical interventions in obese adults: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^113uG2qz]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Initial weight loss phases

Of the 42 studies that included a formal weight loss phase, the average weight loss across studies ranged from −4.03 kgto −21.3 kg, with a weighted average of averages of −10.8 kg. The length of weight loss treatment before the maintenance phase ranged from two to 12 months (median 4.0). Most advocated change in behaviour/lifestyle, diet, and physical activity (n = 26), commonly referred to as "standard behavioural therapy". Other studies used a diet only (n = 11) or physical activity only (n = 1) approach. Some studies used a combination of pharmacotherapy in addition to behavioural/lifestyle change (n = 3) or placebo treatment for pharmacotherapy and behavioural/lifestyle change (n = 1). The dietary approaches advocated were described as general energy deficit diets (n = 14), very low energy diets (defined as ≤ 800 kcal (3344 kJ)/day, n = 11), low energy diets (defined as ≤ 1500 kcal (6270 kJ)/day, n = 7), and a combination of the two (n = 4). Some studies provided no detail (n = 6) or explicitly stated not using a dietary approach for weight loss (n = 1).

The physical activity recommendations for weight loss varied considerably, with walking as the most commonly recommended activity (n = 4). Intensity of recommended physical activity varied from 20–30 minutes three to five times a weekto 60 minutes every day. Two studies provided exercise classes. Most studies provided no details of recommendations for physical activity.

Several studies (n = 17) reported a formal weight loss criterion for entry into the weight loss maintenance treatment. Entry criteria ranged from 5% to 10% of original body weight or 4–8 kg of initial weight loss. Three studies recruiting from the community without a formal weight loss phase required objective evidence of either 5% weight loss in the previous six monthsor 10% weight loss in the previous oneor two years.

### Treatment of obesity: beyond the diet [^111d6RmY]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Obesity affects 2 of 5 Americans, and nearly 1 of 10 is considered severely obese, with the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality. A reduction in body weight of 2% to 5% can lead to improvements in cardiovascular health, with weight loss maintenance associated with the best health outcomes. Lifestyle interventions that focus on changes in diet and physical activity behaviors are best to maintain weight loss. This article provides a review of the treatment of adult obesity with a focus on dietary interventions.

However, it is essential that this new approach be carefully assessed with regard to outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and impact on access to care for those with more severe obesity.

### Evolution of multidisciplinary obesity treatments: past, present, and future role of nutrition [^116NJcXz]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

PRESCRIBING OM: BEYOND WEIGHT REDUCTION

Most pharmacotherapy strategies currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for obesity management reduce appetite, acting either through central or neurometabolic pathways involving enteroendocrine and endo‐pancreatic hormones. Recently introduced incretin mimetic‐based OMs have been highly effective in achieving weight reduction and will be the focus of this discussion.

and weight reduction

Semaglutide, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) agonist, and tirzepatide, which acts as both a GLP‐1 and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide agonist, are both FDA‐approved OMs that have demonstrated substantial weight reduction in placebo‐controlled trials. In the randomized, placebo‐controlled Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 3 trial, subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly in addition to intensive behavioral therapy in patients with overweight or obesity was associated with 16.0% weight reduction versus 5.7% with placebo (p < 0.001). Of note, the addition of intensive behavioral therapy in STEP 3 only achieved an additional 1% weight loss compared with weight loss achieved with semaglutide in addition to a less‐intensive lifestyle intervention in the STEP 1 trial. The Study of Tirzepatide (LY3298176) in Participants After a Lifestyle Weight Loss Program (SURMOUNT)‐3 randomized, placebo‐controlled trial reported that in patients with overweight or obesity and at least one obesity‐related complication (excluding diabetes) who had initially achieved a ≥ 5.0% weight reduction with an intensive lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide resulted in an additional 18.4% weight reduction versus 2.5% weight gain with placebo (p < 0.001).

Further analyses from the STEP clinical trial program have reported positive effects on dietary behavior. In the STEP trials, when compared with placebo, semaglutide resulted in significant improvements in all domains of the Control of Eating Questionnaire, including craving control, craving for savory, craving for sweet, and positive mood. Tirzepatide has also been associated with improved eating behaviors in patients in Japan with type 2 diabetes.

As the field of OMs expands, researchers continue to explore the effects of incretin mimetic‐based OMs acting on GLP‐1, glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and other hormone receptors, as well as novel agents that act on multiple receptors, in the hope of better targeting the complex endocrine‐based pathophysiology of obesity disease.

### Behavioral weight loss interventions to prevent obesity-related morbidity and mortality in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115RdrCP]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 35% of men and 40% of women in the United States are obese. Obesity is associated with health problems such as increased risk for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, various types of cancer, gallstones, and disability. Obesity is also associated with an increased risk for death, particularly among adults younger than 65 years.

Objective

To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2012 recommendation on screening for obesity in adults.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on interventions (behavioral and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight loss maintenance that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting. Surgical weight loss interventions and nonsurgical weight loss devices (eg, gastric balloons) are considered to be outside the scope of the primary care setting.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; these interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (including weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity are small to none. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive behavioral interventions or behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions has a moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer or refer adults with a body mass index of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. (B recommendation).

Adults with overweight and obesity — recommendations table specifies: In individuals with overweight and obesity, weight loss is recommended to improve the ASCVD risk factor profile (COR I, LOE B-R). Counseling and comprehensive lifestyle interventions, including caloric restriction, are recommended for achieving and maintaining weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity (COR I, LOE B-R). Calculating body mass index (BMI) is recommended annually or more frequently to identify adults with overweight and obesity for weight loss considerations (COR I, LOE C-EO). It is reasonable to measure waist circumference to identify those at higher cardiometabolic risk (COR IIa, LOE B-NR).

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity / adiposity-based chronic disease-2025 update [^117BF7Mj]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Algorithm 1 — Principles of person-centered and complication-centric management of obesity/adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) — emphasizes to "Emphasize whole-person health and de-emphasize BMI and weight-centric approaches in the treatment of individuals with obesity/ABCD". It directs that "People with obesity/ABCD should be evaluated by an empathetic trained health care professional to include both the anthropometric and clinical components of the diagnosis and should be followed long-term by a health care professional who will manage weight loss and assure that treatment goals for optimizing health are achieved". For diagnosis, "For the anthropometric component of the diagnosis, obesity is evaluated using BMI with clinical confirmation of excess adiposity, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and assessment of body composition when clinically needed". Clinically, "For the clinical component of the diagnosis and disease staging of ABCD, assess the risk, presence, and severity of ORCD. Include internalized weight bias and impact of stigmatization as part of clinical staging". Care planning instructs to "Involve the individual in shared decision-making to determine personalized health goals while targeting sufficient weight loss to achieve clinical treatment goals for health" and to "Develop treatment plans involving lifestyle, pharmacologic, and surgical options using an individualized approach that considers complications and their severity, patient preferences, social determinants of health, psychological disorders, and access to care". Treatment goals state, "The goals of therapy are to improve health and the quality of life by preventing or treating ORCD, not solely defined by the loss of a specific amount of weight", and intensity guidance states, "Therapy, beyond behavioral/lifestyle alone, should be considered at all stages of ABCD (stages 1, 2, or 3) when needed to improve the health of patients".

Diet and energy balance — consensus and comparative effectiveness indicate that "Dietary approaches that lead to a reduction in energy intake will be the most effective for treating excess body weight and adiposity", and that "Dietary approaches that reduce portion size can assist in the prevention of weight gain and may contribute to reducing energy intake resulting in weight loss"; additionally, "Time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting do not appear to be superior to low-energy intake diets", and "At the population level, one type of diet and macronutrient composition does not appear to be more effective for weight loss when compared to other approaches, provided that these approaches result in similar effects in achieving negative energy balance".

### Association between characteristics of behavioural weight loss programmes and weight change after programme end: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122hqYK]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine if the characteristics of behavioural weight loss programmes influence the rate of change in weight after the end of the programme.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Trial registries, 11 electronic databases, and forward citation searching (from database inception; latest search December 2019). Randomised trials of behavioural weight loss programmes in adults with overweight or obesity, reporting outcomes at ≥ 12 months, including at the end of the programme and after the end of the programme.

Review Methods

Studies were screened by two independent reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion. 5% of the studies identified in the searches met the inclusion criteria. One reviewer extracted the data and a second reviewer checked the data. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane's risk of bias tool (version 1). The rate of change in weight was calculated (kg/month; converted to kg/year for interpretability) after the end of the programme in the intervention versus control groups by a mixed model with a random intercept. Associations between the rate of change in weight and prespecified variables were tested.

Results

Data were analysed from 249 trials (n = 59081) with a mean length of follow-up of two years (longest 30 years). 56% of studies (n = 140) had an unclear risk of bias, 21% (n = 52) a low risk, and 23% (n = 57) a high risk of bias. Regain in weight was faster in the intervention versus the no intervention control groups (0.12–0.32 kg/year) but the difference between groups was maintained for at least five years. Each kilogram of weight lost at the end of the programme was associated with faster regain in weight at a rate of 0.13–0.19 kg/year. Financial incentives for weight loss were associated with faster regain in weight at a rate of 1–1.5 kg/year. Compared with programmes with no meal replacements, interventions involving partial meal replacements were associated with faster regain in weight but not after adjustment for weight loss during the programme. Access to the programme outside of the study was associated with slower regain in weight. Programmes where the intensity of the interaction reduced gradually were also associated with slower regain in weight in the multivariable analysis, although the point estimate suggested that the association was small. Other characteristics did not explain the heterogeneity in regain in weight.

Conclusion

Faster regain in weight after weight loss was associated with greater initial weight loss, but greater initial weight loss was still associated with reduced weight for at least five years after the end of the programme, after which data were limited. Continued availability of the programme to participants outside of the study predicted a slower regain in weight, and provision of financial incentives predicted faster regain in weight; no other clear associations were found.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: a living benefit-harm modelling study [^1119hpAP]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefit of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) in weight reduction against potential harms remains unclear. This study aimed at evaluating the benefit-harm balance of initiating GLP-1 RAs versus placebo for weight loss in people living with overweight and obesity but without diabetes.

Methods

We performed benefit-harm balance modelling, which will be updated as new evidence emerges. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, controlled trials registry, drug approval and regulatory documents, and outcome preference weights as of April 10, 2024. We synthesize data using pairwise meta-analysis to estimate the effect of GLP-1 RAs to inform the benefit-harm balance modelling. We predicted the absolute effects of the positive and negative outcomes over 1 and 2 years of treatment using exponential models. We applied preference weights to the outcomes, ranging from 0 for least concerning to 1.0 for most concerning. We then calculated whether the benefit of achieving 5% and 10% weight loss outweighed the harms on a common scale. The analyses accounted for the statistical uncertainties of treatment effects, preference weights, and outcome risks.

Findings

We included 8 RCTs involving 8847 participants. The pooled average age was 46.7 years, with the majority being women (74%) and people living with obesity (96%). Of 1000 persons treated with GLP-1 RAs for 2 years, 375 (95% confidence interval 352 to 399) achieved a 10% weight loss, and 318 (296 to 339) achieved a 5% weight loss compared to those treated with placebo. Several harm outcomes were more frequent in the GLP-1 RA group, including 41 abdominal pain events per 1000 persons over 2 years (19 to 69), cholelithiasis (8, 1 to 21), constipation (118, 78 to 164), diarrhoea (100, 42 to 173), alopecia (57, 10 to 176), hypoglycaemia (17, 1 to 68), injection site reactions (4, -3 to 19), and vomiting (110, 80 to 145) among others. Achieving a 10% weight loss with GLP-1 RA therapy outweighed the cumulative harms, with a net benefit probability of 0.97 at year 1 and 0.91 at year 2. The absolute net benefit was equivalent to 104 (100 to 112) per 1000 persons achieving a 10% weight loss over 2 years without experiencing any worrisome harm. A 5% weight loss did not show a net benefit, with probabilities of 0.13 and 0.01 at year 1 and year 2, respectively. However, these benefits were sensitive to preference weights, suggesting that even a 5% weight loss could be net beneficial for individuals with less concern about harm outcomes. The net benefit for a 10% weight loss was highest for semaglutide, followed by liraglutide and tirzepatide, with 2-year probabilities of 0.96, 0.72, and 0.60, respectively.

Interpretation

The benefit of GLP-1 RAs exceeded the harms for weight loss in the first 2 years of treatment, yet the net benefit was dependent on individual' treatment goals (10% or 5% weight loss) and willingness to accept harms in pursuit of weight loss. This implies that treatment decisions have to be personalized to individuals to optimize benefits and reduce harms and overuse of treatments. Due to varying evidence, especially regarding harm outcomes across studies, it is necessary to continuously update and monitor the benefit-harm balance of GLP-1 RAs.

### Long-term pharmacotherapy for obesity and overweight [^1152M2pw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide prevalence rates of obesity and overweight are rising and safe and effective treatment strategies are urgently needed. A number of anti-obesity agents have been studied in short-term clinical trials, but long-term efficacy and safety need to be established.

Objectives

To assess/compare the effects and safety of approved anti-obesity medications in clinical trials of at least one-year duration.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Current Science Meta-register of Controlled Trials, and reference lists of original studies and reviews were searched. Date of last search was December 2002. Drug manufacturers and two obesity experts were contacted in to detect unpublished trials. No language restrictions were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised controlled weight loss and weight maintenance trials of approved anti-obesity agents that 1) enrolled adult overweight or obese patients, 2) included a placebo control group or compared two or more anti-obesity drugs 3) used an intention-to-treat analysis, and 4) had a minimum follow-up period of one year. Abstracts and pseudo-randomised trials were not included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed all potentially relevant citations for inclusion and methodological quality. The primary outcome measure was weight loss.

Main Results

Of the eight anti-obesity agents investigated, only orlistat and sibutramine trials met inclusion criteria. Eleven orlistat weight loss studies (four of which reported a second year weight maintenance phase) and five sibutramine studies (three weight loss and two weight maintenance trials) were included. Attrition rates averaged 33% during the weight loss phase of orlistat trials and 43% in sibutramine studies. All patients received lifestyle modification as a co-intervention. Compared to placebo, orlistat-treated patients lost 2.7 kg (95% CI: 2.3 kg to 3.1 kg) or 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3% to 3.4%) more weight and patients on sibutramine experienced 4.3 kg (95% CI: 3.6 kg to 4.9 kg) or 4.6% (95% CI: 3.8% to 5.4%) greater weight loss. The number of patients achieving ten percent or greater weight loss was 12% (95% CI: 8% to 16%) higher with orlistat and 15% (95% CI: 4% to 27%) higher with sibutramine therapy. Weight loss maintenance results were similar. Orlistat caused gastrointestinal side effects and sibutramine was associated with small increases in blood pressure and pulse rate.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of anti-obesity agents are limited to orlistat and sibutramine. Both drugs appear modestly effective in promoting weight loss; however, interpretation is limited by high attrition rates. Longer and more methodologically rigorous studies of anti-obesity drugs that are powered to examine endpoints such as mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are required to fully evaluate any potential benefit of such agents.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1134E8J5]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Obesity and weight management for type 2 diabetes — evidence overview: Obesity is described as "a chronic, relapsing disease" with a "substantially increased risk for the development and progression of type 2 diabetes", and "obesity management can delay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes". In people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, "modest weight loss improves glycemia and reduces the need for glucose-lowering medications", while "greater weight loss substantially reduces A1C and fasting glucose and may promote sustained diabetes remission". "Metabolic surgery, which results in, on average > 20% body weight loss", is noted as "greatly improving glycemia and often leading to remission of diabetes, improved quality of life, improved cardiovascular outcomes, and reduced mortality", and "intensive behavioral and lifestyle counseling, weight management pharmacotherapy, and metabolic surgery" are identified as modalities that "may aid in achieving and maintaining meaningful weight loss and reducing obesity-associated health risks".

### Obesity: overview of weight management [^1144RDR4]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a chronic illness that requires a multifaceted personalized treatment approach.

Methods & Findings

Using current guidelines and recent studies in weight management, this article reviews the multiple components of weight management: lifestyle intervention (dietary intervention, physical activity, and behavioral interventions), pharmacotherapy, endoscopic procedures, and surgical procedures. This review briefly discusses specific diets and dietary strategies, compensatory mechanisms acting against weight loss, recent changes to Food and Drug Administration approved antiobesity medications, and technological advances in weight management delivery.

Conclusion

Current literature is lacking large studies on the safety and efficacy of combination therapies involving pharmacotherapy plus 1 or more procedures.

### Long term maintenance of weight loss with non-surgical interventions in obese adults: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^111HzuQr]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is one of the greatest causes of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide, with weight loss associated with reductions in risk of morbidity and mortality. Evidence from systematic reviews suggests that long term weight loss through changes in eating and physical activity is possible, even in adults who have already acquired obesity related illness, and effective weight loss programmes are now available. Wardle and colleagues reported that 28% of adults in the United Kingdom claimed to be actively trying to lose weight. In a population survey based in the United States, Nicklas and colleagues found that that 63% of obese participants had attempted to lose weight over the past 12 months, of whom 40% had succeeded in losing ≥ 5% of their initial weight and 20% had succeeded in losing ≥ 10%. Though formal behaviour change interventions and self guided efforts at individual behaviour change are successful in inducing weight loss, however, few people manage to maintain these changes in weight over the long term. Weight loss from behavioural interventions typically peaks at around six months into the weight loss attempt, followed by gradual regain of weight in most individuals. As maintenance of the weight loss is crucial to uphold health benefits, understanding how best to support people in sustaining weight loss is paramount to controlling the obesity epidemic and its consequences.

Compared with initiation of weight loss, the evidence base for maintenance of weight loss is in its infancy. A recent systematic review of 13 randomised controlled trials examining effects of "extended care" for weight loss maintenance reported an average 3.2 kg difference in weight regain between extended care and no or minimal additional contact. Other reviews that have examined weight loss maintenance studies confirm the potential of successful maintenance treatment, although there is considerable heterogeneity between studies. Currently available reviews are limited by not using meta-analyses, no separation of studies focused on weight loss or maintenance, the use of restrictive inclusion criteria focusing on specific subsets of non-surgical studies, inclusion of non-randomised trials, or a lack of systematic identification of studies. To date, no comprehensive systematic review of long term effects of non-surgical treatments for maintenance of weight loss tested in randomised controlled trials is available to examine the effects of different treatments in the prevention of weight regain. We describe currently available non-surgical interventions for weight loss maintenance and have synthesised the randomised controlled evidence for the effectiveness of interventions and intervention delivery features.

### Structured lifestyle modification prior to bariatric surgery: how much is enough? [^111LoHZA]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

What Clinical Trial Evidence Supports Mandatory Participation in a Lifestyle Modification Programme Prior to Bariatric Surgery?

The first randomised controlled clinical trial of lifestyle modification to improve post-operative outcomes in bariatric surgical patients was not conducted until 2007 and found no difference in patients who were randomised to a weight loss requirement of 10% versus no such requirement. However, there were just 100 trial participants, 39 of whom were lost to follow-up, so the risks of bias and confounding, as well as being underpowered to detect an intervention effect, were high. Even though a similar trial at the time found that pre-operative weight loss 'should be encouraged' because it predicted post-operative weight loss, the allocation to the weight loss intervention (with a mean reduction in excess body weight of 9.3% more than control participants) did not lead to any between-group differences in outcomes. In other words, there was a distinction between weight loss 'working', which it did, and being allocated to a weight loss group, which did not have an effect. A larger multicentre trial found that pre-operative weight loss with a 14-day very low-calorie diet (VLCD) did lead to important benefits, including reduced perceived difficulty by the surgeon during the operation and reduced early post-operative complications, but there were no differences in intraoperative complications, blood loss or operative time. This latter trial was distinct from others in that it sought short-term calorie restriction in the immediate pre-operative period in order to achieve a reduction in the size of the liver rather than weight loss per se, in order to make the operations technically less challenging for the surgeon. This highlights the large degree of heterogeneity in this domain of clinical research, such as variations in the lifestyle interventions, their duration and the identification of the most relevant endpoints.

### The therapeutics of lifestyle management on obesity [^111PVLun]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

The global incidence and prevalence of obesity continue to increase, with the fastest rate of increase in the developing world. Obesity is associated with many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Weight loss can reduce the risk of developing these diseases and can be achieved by means of surgery, pharmacotherapy and lifestyle interventions. Lifestyle interventions for prevention and treatment of obesity include diet, exercise and psychological interventions. All lifestyle interventions have a modest but significant effect on weight loss, but there is little evidence to indicate that any one intervention is more effective. There is evidence of an additive effect for adjunct therapy, and the combination of diet, exercise and behavioural interventions appears to be most effective for both the prevention and treatment of obesity.

### IFSO consensus on definitions and clinical practice guidelines for obesity management-an international Delphi study [^112asLkG]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The biological basis of obesity and the response to MBS underscore the importance of recognizing that a suboptimal clinical response rarely reflects either substandard surgical skill or technique. Similarly, it is rarely caused by noncompliance or other aberrant or inadequate behavior by the patient. Thus, the language we use to describe less robust clinical outcomes must avoid being judgemental, ascribing blame, or drawing unproven, causal inferences. Thus, by consensus, we recommend that less than ideal weight loss or clinical improvement after MBS be described as a "suboptimal clinical response" or "suboptimal weight loss", rather than "non-response" or an "inadequate" response to treatment. Similarly, consensus was reached on using "recurrent weight gain" for those who experience significant weight gain after initial postoperative weight loss.

Within the normal distribution of weight loss response to MBS, there is no specific magnitude of weight loss that clearly differentiates between treatment success and suboptimal response. There is some evidence that 20% of total body weight loss is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk, so many clinicians and investigators have used this criterion to assess clinical responses to MBS. It is recognized that the magnitude of weight loss has widely different clinical effects in different patients, and a categorical definition of weight loss should not be used as the single determinant of the need for additional clinical intervention. Through this Delphi process, unanimous consensus was achieved on using the following reporting standards for "suboptimal initial clinical response" as initial total body weight loss < 20% or inadequate improvement in an obesity complication that was a significant indication for surgery and "recurrent weight gain" as recurrent weight gain > 30% or worsening of an obesity complication that was a significant indication for surgery. Given the different effectiveness of each MBS procedures and variable effects in different populations, these criteria should be applied to individual patients combined with expert clinical judgement.

### Effectiveness of behavioural weight loss interventions delivered in a primary care setting: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GAVET]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search

A literature search was implemented in the online databases Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials to search for English language papers from 1990 to the 17th September, 2012. The search was repeated on the 19th March 2014 and no new papers for inclusion were identified. The search terms are presented in the. Studies using drug treatment were included in the main search strategy as part of a larger project, but excluded at the full text stage from this review. Hand-searching of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included papers were used to search for further articles. Searching and selection of articles was conducted by one researcher. Resource constraints meant that grey literature, unpublished works and articles not in English were not considered for inclusion.

Study selection

Interventions promoting behaviour change for weight loss were eligible for inclusion in the review. Titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles were evaluated using pre-defined criteria and the full text was consulted where study eligibility was unclear. The following inclusion criteria were used to select studies from their titles and abstracts: participants were overweight and/or obese adults in primary care, weight loss was a primary outcome and an RCT design was used. Interventions did not have to be delivered by a PCP, but participants had to be selected from their practice patient list and the intervention conducted within the primary care setting. This is reflective of the multidisciplinary teams that now deliver primary care services. Follow-up was for a minimum of 12 months.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Participant and intervention characteristics from the included studies were tabulated. Information defined a priori included sample sizes, baseline characteristics, inclusion criteria, intervention details, study duration and number of contacts. Outcome data for weight loss were extracted into a pre-prepared form by one reviewer and checked by an additional reviewer. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which assesses evidence of selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting biases by testing six key domains plus an additional option for any other bias. The seven domains are judged to be at high or low risk of bias, or unclear due to lack of information. Publication bias or other asymmetry in the published results due to quality issues was assessed using funnel plots. Data relating to behavioural science theory underpinning the interventions and techniques used in the interventions for behaviour change were also extracted and assessed using published tools.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^112jrADx]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Weight loss — Obesity is a major risk factor for T2D and its prevalence has closely mirrored obesity; in the United States, over two-thirds of adults have overweight or obesity, including 85% of those with diabetes, and if present trends continue, about 1 in 3 Americans will have diabetes by 2050. The panel agreed that the goal for weight loss should be expressed in terms of percent weight loss (e.g., 5% to 15% of baseline body weight), not a specific amount of weight (e.g., 5 pounds), to ameliorate insulin resistance and alleviate hyperglycemia.

### Behavioral and pharmacotherapy weight loss interventions to prevent obesity-related morbidity and mortality in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^115qN4qH]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Overweight and obesity have been associated with adverse health effects.

Objective

To systematically review evidence on benefits and harms of behavioral and pharmacotherapy weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions in adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed Publisher-Supplied Records, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published through June 6, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials through August 2017; and ongoing surveillance in targeted publications through March 23, 2018. Studies from previous reviews were reevaluated for inclusion.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) focusing on weight loss or weight loss maintenance in adults.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted by one reviewer and confirmed by another. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for weight loss outcomes in behavior-based interventions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Health outcomes, weight loss or weight loss maintenance, reduction in obesity-related conditions, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 122 RCTs (N = 62 533) and 2 observational studies (N = 209 993) were identified. Compared with controls, participants in behavior-based interventions had greater mean weight loss at 12 to 18 months (-2.39 kg [95% CI, -2.86 to -1.93]; 67 studies [n = 22065]) and less weight regain (-1.59 kg [95% CI, -2.38 to -0.79]; 8 studies [n = 1408]). Studies of medication-based weight loss and maintenance interventions also reported greater weight loss or less weight regain in intervention compared with placebo groups at 12 to 18 months (range, -0.6 to -5.8 kg; no meta-analysis). Participants with prediabetes in weight loss interventions had a lower risk of developing diabetes compared with controls (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89]). There was no evidence of other benefits, but most health outcomes such as mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer were infrequently reported. Small improvements in quality of life in some medication trials were noted but were of unclear clinical significance. There was no evidence of harm such as cardiovascular disease from behavior-based interventions; higher rates of adverse events were associated with higher dropout rates in medication groups than in placebo groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Behavior-based weight loss interventions with or without weight loss medications were associated with more weight loss and a lower risk of developing diabetes than control conditions. Weight loss medications, but not behavior-based interventions, were associated with higher rates of harms. Long-term weight and health outcomes data, as well as data on important subgroups, were limited.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2022 — Intensive lifestyle/weight-loss interventions and diabetes prevention: In persons with ABCD and prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome, weight loss is a highly effective way to prevent progression to T2D and improves multiple metabolic and cardiovascular markers. In the Diabetes Prevention Program, after 4 years, lifestyle modification reduced progression to T2D by 58% and metformin by 31% versus placebo; participants in the lifestyle arm achieved approximately 6% mean weight loss at 2 to 3 years and 4% at 4 years, with a progressive 7% reduction in T2D risk per kilogram lost, and at 10 years there remained a significant reduction in cumulative T2D incidence. In the Da Qing Study, CVD events and mortality were reduced comparing combined diet-plus-exercise subgroups with controls. Translation studies show real-world effectiveness: a meta-analysis of 44 Diabetes Prevention Program translations reported an average 9.3-month weight loss of 3.77 kg and a decrease in fasting glucose of 2.4 mg/dL, and another meta-analysis of 63 prevention efforts found 5.2 kg weight loss in participants versus 0.8 kg in controls with a 25% reduction in incident DM.

### Association between characteristics of behavioural weight loss programmes and weight change after programme end: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117QJvUQ]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine if the characteristics of behavioural weight loss programmes influence the rate of change in weight after the end of the programme.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Trial registries, 11 electronic databases, and forward citation searching (from database inception; latest search December 2019). Randomised trials of behavioural weight loss programmes in adults with overweight or obesity, reporting outcomes at ≥ 12 months, including at the end of the programme and after the end of the programme.

Review methods

Studies were screened by two independent reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion. 5% of the studies identified in the searches met the inclusion criteria. One reviewer extracted the data and a second reviewer checked the data. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane's risk of bias tool (version 1). The rate of change in weight was calculated (kg/month; converted to kg/year for interpretability) after the end of the programme in the intervention versus control groups by a mixed model with a random intercept. Associations between the rate of change in weight and prespecified variables were tested.

Results

Data were analysed from 249 trials (n = 59 081) with a mean length of follow-up of two years (longest 30 years). 56% of studies (n = 140) had an unclear risk of bias, 21% (n = 52) a low risk, and 23% (n = 57) a high risk of bias. Regain in weight was faster in the intervention versus the no intervention control groups (0.12–0.32 kg/year) but the difference between groups was maintained for at least five years. Each kilogram of weight lost at the end of the programme was associated with faster regain in weight at a rate of 0.13–0.19 kg/year. Financial incentives for weight loss were associated with faster regain in weight at a rate of 1–1.5 kg/year. Compared with programmes with no meal replacements, interventions involving partial meal replacements were associated with faster regain in weight but not after adjustment for weight loss during the programme. Access to the programme outside of the study was associated with slower regain in weight. Programmes where the intensity of the interaction reduced gradually were also associated with slower regain in weight in the multivariable analysis, although the point estimate suggested that the association was small. Other characteristics did not explain the heterogeneity in regain in weight.

Conclusion

Faster regain in weight after weight loss was associated with greater initial weight loss, but greater initial weight loss was still associated with reduced weight for at least five years after the end of the programme, after which data were limited. Continued availability of the programme to participants outside of the study predicted a slower regain in weight, and provision of financial incentives predicted faster regain in weight; no other clear associations were found.

Overweight and obesity — comprehensive lifestyle intervention recommendations state there is no evidence that one weight loss diet is superior or ideal, and counseling and caloric restriction with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention are recommended for achieving and maintaining weight loss; high-intensity interventions including referral to a nutrition professional (registered dietitian nutritionist [RDN]) and participation in ≥ 14 visits over 6 months with a trained interventionist have improved outcomes, and guidelines recommend a structured program with a multidisciplinary primary team; core components include reduced calorie intake, increased physical activity, and behavior change therapy with regular self-monitoring; physical activity for weight loss includes ≥ 150 min/wk of aerobic activity, whereas to maintain lost weight or minimize regain in the long term (> 1 year), approximately 200 to 300 min/wk are recommended; achieving a "normal" weight may be unrealistic for many, but a sustained weight loss of 5–10% is often achievable and improves health; referral to an RDN for multiple face-to-face visits can improve biomarkers including weight loss, lipids, and glycemic control.

### Effective weight loss management with endoscopic gastric plication using stomaphyX device: is it achievable? [^111sr1oA]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in promoting excess weight loss, 40% of the patients regain weight. Endoscopic gastric plication (EGP) using the StomaphyX device can serve as a less-invasive procedure for promoting the loss of regained weight. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the StomaphyX device in sustaining ongoing weight loss in patients who have regained weight after RYGB at the Division of Minimally Invasive and Bariatric Surgery, Howard University Hospital.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing EGP using the StomaphyX device from April 2008 to May 2010. The patient demographics and clinical information were assessed. Effective weight loss and the proportion of weight lost after EGP relative to the weight regained after achieving the lowest weight following RYGB was calculated.

Results

A total of 27 patients underwent EGP using the StomaphyX device; of these, most were women (n = 25, 93%) and black (n = 14, 52%), followed by white (n = 11, 42%), and Hispanic (n = 1, 4%). The median interval between RYGB and EGP was 6 years, with an interquartile range of 5–8 years. After the EGP procedure, the median effective weight loss was 37% (interquartile range 24–61%). Of the 27 patients, 18 had ≥ 6 months of follow-up after EGP. Eleven patients had achieved their lowest weight at 1–3 months, 7 at 6 months, and 3 at 12 months. Of the 18 patients, 13 (72%) experienced an increase in weight after achieving their lowest weight after EGP.

Conclusion

The use of the StomaphyX device achieved the maximum effective weight loss during the 1–6-month period after EGP.

### Impact of program characteristics on weight loss in adult behavioral weight management interventions: systematic review and component network meta-analysis [^117BkZum]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

There are some further limitations to consider relating to our specific analyses. A total of 41 of the included studies were considered at high risk of bias; sensitivity analysis removing these did not meaningfully change effect estimates but did widen CrIs in some instances. As this was a secondary analysis of data extracted for a previous systematic review, we only included studies that measured weight at and after program end. This means that some studies that might have been eligible for the analysis presented here will not have been included (e.g. studies that only followed up participants at 12 months would have been excluded from the parent review). However, although this will have resulted in a smaller sample size, there is no reason to think such studies would differ in terms of component effects from those presented here; therefore, this is unlikely to have systematically biased our results. We did not consider effects over longer‐term follow‐up. Our base reviews showed that initial weight loss was the single most important factor contributing to long term benefit; therefore, our focus here was on the components delivered within program, which could conceivably maximize early weight loss. Finally, analyses for less common components lacked power, particularly in the subset of studies reporting on intensity. Absence of evidence of an association for these should not be confused with evidence of absence.

### Long-term effectiveness of lifestyle and behavioral weight loss interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^117DVEBG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Most persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight, and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with diabetes. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of lifestyle and behavioral weight loss and weight control interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Studies were obtained from searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with hand searches of selected journals and consultation with experts in obesity research. Studies were included if they were published or unpublished randomized controlled trials in any language that examined weight loss or weight control strategies using one or more dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions, with a follow-up interval of at least 12 months. Effects were combined using a random-effects model.

Results

The 22 studies of weight loss interventions identified yielded a total of 4659 participants with a follow-up of 1 to 5 years. The pooled weight loss for any intervention in comparison with usual care among 585 subjects was 1.7 kg (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3 to 3.2 kg), or 3.1% of baseline body weight among 511 subjects. Among 126 persons who underwent a physical activity and behavioral intervention, those who also received a very low-calorie diet lost 3.0 kg (95% CI: -0.5 to 6.4 kg), or 1.6% of baseline body weight, more than persons who received a low-calorie diet. Among 53 persons who received identical dietary and behavioral interventions, those who received a more intense physical activity intervention lost 3.9 kg (95% CI: -1.9 to 9.7 kg), or 3.6% of baseline body weight, more than those who received a less intense or no physical activity intervention. Comparison groups often achieved substantial weight loss (up to 10.0 kg), minimizing between-group differences. Changes in glycated hemoglobin level generally corresponded to changes in weight and were not substantial when between-group differences were examined.

Conclusion

Weight loss strategies involving dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions were associated with small between-group improvements in weight. These results were minimized by weight loss in the comparison group, however, and examination of individual study arms revealed that multicomponent interventions, including very low-calorie diets or low-calorie diets, may hold promise for achieving weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.

### The past, present, and future of behavioral obesity treatment [^116nikm7]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the last century, hundreds of evaluations have been conducted to examine weight-management interventions related to diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy. These investigations have contributed to a growing body of knowledge that has consistently advanced the field of obesity treatment, while also revealing some persistent challenges. This narrative review summarizes key findings from randomized controlled trials conducted in adults that have combined diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy, an approach variously referred to as behavioral treatment, comprehensive lifestyle modification, or intensive lifestyle intervention. The review shows that current behavioral approaches induce average reductions in baseline body weight of 5 to 10% at 6 to 12 months. Such losses have proven effective in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes in persons with impaired glucose tolerance and in improving other obesity-related complications. These benefits have also been associated with reductions in healthcare costs. Despite these advances, behavioral treatment is challenged by the need for larger losses to achieve optimal improvements in health, by difficulties associated with maintaining weight loss, and by barriers limiting access to treatment. New anti-obesity medications, when combined with behavioral obesity treatment, hold promise of addressing the first two issues.

### The latest evidence and guidance in lifestyle and surgical interventions to achieve weight loss in people with overweight or obesity [^112Q5YBH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the varying levels of certainty in the efficacy of different dietary strategies discussed above, the strength of evidence for the efficacy and safety of very‐low energy diets (VLED) for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes is now widely established. By limiting dailyto less than 800 kilocalories (kcal), VLED interventions – usually by means of Total Dietary Replacement – result in approximately 13–18% weight loss. Furthermore, in the context of type 2 diabetes, VLED can induce diabetes remission. The DIRECT study was an open‐label, cluster‐randomized trial at 49 primary care practices aimed at assessing whether intensive weight management within primary care would achieve remission of type 2 diabetes. The intervention comprised the withdrawal of antidiabetic drugs and a total diet replacement (825–853 kcal/day) formula diet for 3–5 months. This was provided by soups and shakes produced by the Cambridge Weight plan. The 12‐week period is followed by a stepped food reintroduction (for 2–8 weeks) followed by a weight loss maintenance phase where participants were advised to follow a food‐based diet and were provided with an individually tailored energy prescription to support weight stabilization and prevent weight regain. At 12 months, mean body weight fell by approximately 10 kg in the intervention group and 1.0 kg in the control group, whilst diabetes remission was achieved in 46% and 4%, respectively. The remission rate, however, was reduced to 36% at 2 years and at 5 years, 13% remained in remission. At 5 years, average weight loss in the intervention group was 5.6 kg and 4.6 kg in the control group. Following publication of the original DIRECT study, this dietary intervention programme has been replicated in real‐world practice. In 2019, the English National Health Service (NHS) established a total dietary replacement‐based interventional programme within a real‐world environment, known as the NHS Type 2 Diabetes Path To Remission Programme. This involves a 12‐month behavioural intervention to support weight loss involving an initial 3‐month period of total dietary replacement. The mean weight loss for the 1710 participants who started the programme was 8.3% (~9.4 kg) and the mean weight loss of the 945 participants who completed the programme was 9.3% (~10.3 kg). Among the latter group, 32% (N = 145) achieved diabetes remission at 1 year. The rate of remission in a real‐world setting is lower than that observed in the randomized controlled trial. Further research into strategies to maintain weight loss and diabetes remission over the longer term is required.

### A closer look at ACC / AHA and ESC Guidelines for managing obesity and Overweight in adults [^115qjJ4t]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives: a viewpoint

Overall, both guidelines highlight the importance of addressing overweight and obesity to prevent CVD. One key difference is ESC guidelines recommend a comprehensive lifestyle intervention that includes dietary modification, increased physical activity, and behavioral support, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a healthy lifestyle that includes counseling, caloric restriction, regular physical activity, and weight management. The ESC guidelines also provide specific recommendations for weight-loss medications and bariatric surgery in select patients with obesity and high CVD risk, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines do not have specific recommendations for these interventions.

However, what is missing from these guidelines? While both the ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines provide recommendations on managing obesity and overweight, there are some areas where they may be lacking. Personalized approaches to weight management and addressing social and environmental determinants of obesity may not be fully considered. Early intervention and addressing childhood obesity are also areas that may require more emphasis. Despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines for managing obesity in adults, implementing lifestyle interventions in routine clinical practice remains a challenge. While randomized controlled trials provide important information about the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for weight management and are valuable in guiding the guidelines, the programmatic approaches used in these trials may not always be feasible or sustainable in routine clinical practice. For example, lifestyle interventions delivered in academic centers may require significant resources and infrastructure, which may not be available in primary care settings. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based tools that can facilitate weight loss and weight loss maintenance, easily implementable and address the challenges associated with long-term weight management in routine clinical practice. The development and evaluation of such tools should also be a priority for future research in this area.

### Lifestyle modification approaches for the treatment of obesity in adults [^114xjnoy]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that primary care clinicians screen all adults for obesity and provide those affected intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions. Approximately 95 million U.S. adults qualify for such care, also referred to as lifestyle modification. Using the Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults (hereafter, Obesity Guidelines) as a framework, this article reviews the principal components of comprehensive lifestyle modification, which include diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy. To lose weight, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 6 months in high-intensity programs that provide 14 or more counseling sessions with a trained interventionist. When provided face-to-face individual or group treatment, participants lose up to 8 kg (8% of weight) in 6 months and experience improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors and quality of life. To prevent weight regain, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 1 year in weight-loss-maintenance programs that provide at least monthly counseling. High levels of physical activity, frequent monitoring of body weight, and consumption of a reduced-calorie diet are associated with long-term weight loss. Investigators currently are seeking to increase the availability of lifestyle modification by delivering it in community-based programs, as well as on digital platforms (e.g. Internet and Smartphone). Digitally delivered programs lower costs and expand treatment reach; their efficacy is likely to improve further with the addition of new technologies for monitoring food intake, activity, and weight. Ultimately, to improve long-term weight management, individual lifestyle counseling must be joined with collective and institutional efforts to improve the nation's eating and activity environments.

### Association between characteristics of behavioural weight loss programmes and weight change after programme end: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112moC8M]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Comparisons with other studies

Considerable research has been done on developing and testing specific strategies for maintaining weight loss, but these strategies are not regularly implemented in routine practice. Low intensity interventions have proven to be ineffective, whereas a systematic review of more intensive interventions providing ongoing behavioural support, in effect extending the behavioural weight loss programme, reported a reduction in regain in weight of −1.56 kg (95% confidence interval −2.27 to −0.86). This analysis included data from the weight loss phase, with most studies reporting overall weight loss, not regain. Moreover, attendance at behavioural weight loss programmes declines over time and many participants struggle to maintain the cognitive effort required to adhere to ongoing interventions. Some weight loss programmes included specific strategies for maintaining weight loss but we found no evidence that these strategies improved long term outcomes. Programmes that were available to participants outside of the clinical trial setting were associated with weight loss beyond the end of the programme, however. This finding is consistent with the results of a recent randomised controlled trial of a total diet replacement programme; 30 months after the end of the programme, participants who reported trying to lose weight in the last three months (of their own volition) maintained greater weight loss (−7.6 kg v −4.8 kg in the total diet replacement group; −3.6 kg v −1.6 kg in the usual care group). This result could suggest that focusing on recurrent weight loss interventions rather than maintenance of weight loss might be a more helpful public health strategy.

### Bariatric and metabolic surgery: a shift in eligibility and success criteria [^114JFQbF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

The obesity epidemic, combined with the lack of available and effective treatments for morbid obesity, is a scientific and public health priority. Worldwide, bariatric and metabolic surgeries are increasingly being performed to effectively aid weight loss in patients with severe obesity, as well as because of the favourable metabolic effects of the procedures. The positive effects of bariatric surgery, especially with respect to improvements in type 2 diabetes mellitus, have expanded the eligibility criteria for metabolic surgery to patients with diabetes mellitus and a BMI of 30–35 kg/m(2). However, the limitations of BMI, both in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients, need to be considered, particularly for determining the actual adiposity and fat distribution of the patients following weight loss. Understanding the characteristics shared by bariatric and metabolic surgeries, as well as their differential aspects and outcomes, is required to enhance patient benefits and operative achievements. For a holistic approach that focuses on the multifactorial effects of bariatric and metabolic surgery to be possible, a paradigm shift that goes beyond the pure semantics is needed. Such a shift could lead to profound clinical implications for eligibility criteria and the definition of success of the surgical approach.

### A closer look at ACC / AHA and ESC Guidelines for managing obesity and Overweight in adults [^1161uNEy]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical activity

Physical activity is important alongside dietary modifications to maximize the benefit. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends at least 150 minutes aerobic physical activity (eg, brisk walking) per week (equivalent to 30 minutes per day for 5 days of the week) for initial weight loss, increasing to round 200 to 300 minutes per week to maintain body weight and prevent weight regain. Overall, a comprehensive lifestyle intervention integrating diet and exercise can result in 5 to 10% weight loss and improvement in metabolic health. The ESC guideline acknowledges the significance of physical activity in managing obesity and overweight but does not provide specific recommendation. Recent evidence suggests that a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise, along with weight loss, is effective for improving physical and metabolic status in older adults with obesity. Adjustments may be necessary for this population due to challenges such as sarcopenic obesity, and exercise regiments should consider individual preferences and realistic goals.

Pharmacotherapy

In addition to lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy can also be used for achieving weight loss. The ESC guidelines endorse medications such as orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, and high-dose liraglutide, while the ACC/AHA does not. Differences in approve medications may exist due to variations in approvals by regulatory agencies. Clinicians should be aware of these differences, considering regional differences. The lack of consensus between guidelines and approved medications may pose challenges in clinical decision-making and may also impact patient access to effective treatments. However, the impact of these medications on obesity-related CVD remains uncertain, although some studies suggest potential benefits for primary prevention. Nonetheless, it is important to note that conclusive evidence regarding the CV outcomes of these treatments in obesity is still lacking, highlighting the need for adequately powered CV safety trials.

Bariatric surgery

The ESC guidelines recommend bariatric surgery for "obese high-risk individuals" when lifestyle changes fail to result in weight loss maintenance. They emphasize the inclusion of LIFEtime-perspective CardioVascular Disease calculator for predicting lifetime CVD risk, which can help identify high-risk individuals in both the short and long term. This information can aid in clinical decision-making for the management of obesity and associated cardiovascular risks.

### Layperson-led vs professional-led behavioral interventions for weight loss in pediatric obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Hkw5s]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Child and adolescent obesity are a global public health concern. Intensive behavioral lifestyle therapy is considered the cornerstone for treatment of obesity in this age group. Systematic reviews of the literature show that intensive behavioral lifestyle interventions elicit modest short-term weight loss, and improved cardiometabolic health, among children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. While efficacious, these approaches are costly and often impractical in real-world settings. Less intensive interventions delivered in community settings are less costly but often yield less significant weight loss. Few studies have directly compared the association between short-term and sustained interventions on weight management in children and adolescents with overweight and obesity.

Engaging laypersons or community-based health workers to deliver health interventions is an attractive public health model for disease management, as it is cost-effective and can be tailored to local needs. In some settings, community health workers or peer leaders yield meaningful improvements in lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes among persons living with chronic disease. A series of recent trials suggested that behavioral interventions led by nonprofessionals yield similar results to those led by trained professionals. In the context of pediatric obesity, a limited number of trials suggest that peer- or layperson-led approaches may be associated with the achievement of successful weight loss. To the best of our knowledge, this has yet to be investigated by a systematic literature review with meta-analysis.

Network meta-analysis allows for the comparison of multiple treatments in 1 statistical model. Network meta-analyses can assess treatment outcomes or safety when few direct head-to-head trials exist. With the abundance of therapeutic trials for weight loss among children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, a network meta-analysis is an attractive model for comparing the associations of layperson- and professional-led approaches with weight loss. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to assess the association of behavioral interventions led by lay individuals vs those led by professionals, compared with the standard of care, with short- and long-term weight loss among children and adolescents younger than 18 years with overweight or obesity.

### Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetes-how far have we come? [^1166Z1Pp]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

3 TREATMENT OF OBESE PEOPLE WITH T2D

3.1 Enhancing weight loss with current therapeutic options

As discussed above, weight management emerges as another important target as glycaemic control for a majority of people with T2D. Various treatments aid achieving glycaemic targets and enhancing body weight loss to a different extent. Here, lifestyle interventions, weight loss medications, anti‐diabetes pharmacotherapies and bariatric surgery will be discussed as well as their effects on both targets.

3.1.1 Diet, physical activity and behavioural intervention

Lifestyle modifications such as diet and increased physical activity have been established as a cornerstone of the treatment of T2D and obesity. Moreover, it has been recommended as a first‐line strategy by guidelines for management of both diabetes and obesity. The aim is management and reversal of excess weight that can lead to better glycaemic control. The approach should be a high‐quality hypocaloric diet, which promotes patient's adherence accompanied by a minimum of 150 min of moderate activity per week.

The feasibility of these recommendations was demonstrated in the Look AHEAD clinical trial. In that study, intensive lifestyle intervention resulted in clinically meaningful weight loss (≥ 5%) in 50% of people with T2D, and approximately 26% maintained a body weight loss of ≥ 10% at year 8. Moreover, intensive dietary interventions with low‐, and very‐low‐calorie diets, have been shown to achieve substantial reduction of HbA1c and sustained T2D remission in obese people with T2D. However, according to the ADA, such structured, low‐calorie diets should be prescribed only for carefully selected patients by well‐trained and experienced practitioners with close monitoring. For the vast majority of obese people with T2D, significant weight loss is feasible with lifestyle programs that achieve a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit, somewhat regardless of macronutrient composition. Accordingly, dietary choice should be individually tailored to the patient's preferences and nutritional needs.

### Anti-obesity medication for weight loss in early nonresponders to behavioral treatment: a randomized controlled trial [^1174boMC]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Current obesity management guidelines recommend a ≥ 6-month course of behavioral treatment (BT) that includes a reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity and behavioral strategies to facilitate goal adherence as the first intervention for improving weight and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. On average, patients lose 5–8% of initial weight after 4–6 months of high-intensity BT (that is, ≥ 14 sessions in 6 months), with smaller mean losses in less intensive programs. A loss of ≥ 5% of initial weight is a common criterion for clinically meaningful weight loss and is associated with improvements in CVD risk factors. However, 35–50% of patients fail to lose this amount with high-intensity BT.

Slow early weight loss in the first 1–2 months of BT is a strong predictor of limited total weight loss after 6–12 months of treatment –. Approximately one-third of participants lose < 0.5% of body weight per week in the first month of intensive BT, and the majority of these early nonresponders (53–70%) do not achieve a loss of ≥ 5% initial weight after 6 months of treatment. Some investigators have suggested that BT nonresponders be provided an additional therapy or a different intervention altogether as early as possible, rather than spending ≥ 6 months in a treatment that is unlikely to facilitate a clinically significant weight loss –. Early nonresponders to BT can become discouraged about reaching their desired weight loss goals and are more likely to drop out of treatment.

### Impact of program characteristics on weight loss in adult behavioral weight management interventions: systematic review and component network meta-analysis [^111LshSn]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This is a further analysis of a study‐level data set originally compiled for a previous review investigating weight regain and associated health impacts following completion of BWMPs. Full methods for search, screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment can be found in the preregistered protocol (PROSPERO ID CRD42018105744) and study report.

Screening and data extraction

Randomized trials of BWMPs in adults with overweight or obesity reporting outcomes at ≥ 12 months, including at and after program end, were identified through searching trial registries, searching 11 electronic databases, and conducting forward citation searching (from database inception; latest search: December 2019). Studies also had to report a measure of weight change between 10 and 14 months after study start and had to be deemed "jointly randomizable", meaning that, in principle, it would be reasonable for all of the intervention components included in the network to be delivered in a trial. This meant that we excluded interventions to which some of the participants in the network could not be reasonably assigned in a hypothetical scenario. This includes those interventions in which the program is tailored to specific population characteristics: for example, for patients with a preexisting medical condition. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion. One reviewer extracted the data that were checked by a second reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane's risk of bias tool (version 1).

Measures of treatment effect

Mean weight change, SD, and number allocated (n) were extracted or estimated for each arm. If weight change was not available, we estimated it from weight at baseline and follow‐up. If the SD for weight change was not reported, it was estimated using SD at baseline and follow‐up. If the SD at follow‐up was missing, it was assumed to be equal to the SD at baseline. If neither weight change nor weight at baseline and follow‐up was available, we used the reported percentage weight change. When n for weight change was not available, n at baseline was used. When SD weight change was not available, we estimated it using the SE obtained from the reported 95% CI. If medians were reported, we assumed they were means. If interquartile range (IQR) or minimum and maximum were reported, we estimated SD using methods that have been described elsewhere.

For such individuals, weight loss through intensive lifestyle intervention, rather than surgical intervention or dietary restriction alone, is recommended as first-line therapy. Weight loss is recommended for obese patients with asthma by The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, but a lack of strong evidence of the efficacy of weight loss for improving asthma control was recognized by the Expert Panel. BE WELL will provide objective evidence on whether a state-of-the-art weight loss lifestyle intervention achieves a statistically and clinically meaningful improvement over a year's follow-up in asthma control and other manifestations that EPR3 considers indicative of current impairment (symptoms, lung function, rescue medication use, asthma-specific quality of life) and future risk (asthma exacerbations and medication side effects).

Achieving the goals of this study holds considerable potential for advancing the understanding of the causality of the obesity-asthma association and identifying effective behavioral approaches for the management of asthma in adults with comorbid obesity. This study will also serve as a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which weight loss is expected to improve asthma control, which may also illuminate the mechanism(s) linking obesity and the development of asthma. Future research is also needed to investigate the effect of weight loss on asthma control among children - a significantly under-researched area even compared to the limited research in adults. Findings from this RCT, if as projected, will strengthen current guidelines for treating obese adults with asthma, which may lead to reduced morbidity and mortality related to both chronic diseases.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, lifestyle changes, AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend to offer lifestyle therapy to achieve ≥ 5–15% weight loss as needed to achieve targeted lowering of HbA1c in patients with overweight or obesity and T2DM. Consider offering weight-loss therapy regardless of the duration or severity of T2DM, both in newly diagnosed patients and in patients with a longer-term disease on multiple diabetes medications.

### Behavior, motivational interviewing, eating disorders, and obesity management technologies: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^112YcmwX]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

National Weight Control Registry — adult weight-loss maintainers are defined as those "18 years or older who have lost at least 30 pounds of weight and maintained their loss for at least 1 year", with membership including "over 10,000 adults, of whom 78% are women and 20% are members of a minority race". Reported behaviors include that "Over 70% eat breakfast daily and weigh themselves at least once a week", the most frequently reported physical activity was walking, and weight loss methods varied, with participants reporting "45%" lost weight on their own and "55%" did so with a program.

### The use of biosimulation in the design of a novel multilevel weight loss maintenance program for overweight children [^116sz4vE]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

Weight loss outcomes achieved through conventional behavior change interventions are prone to deterioration over time. Basic learning laboratory studies in the area of behavioral extinction and renewal and multilevel models of weight control offer clues as to why newly acquired weight loss skills are prone to relapse. According to these models, current clinic-based interventions may not be of sufficient duration or scope to allow for the practice of new skills across the multiple community contexts necessary to promote sustainable weight loss. Although longer, more intensive interventions with greater reach may hold the key to improving weight loss outcomes, it is difficult to test these assumptions in a time efficient and cost-effective manner. A research design tool that has been increasingly utilized in other fields (e.g., pharmaceuticals) is the use of biosimulation analyses. The present study describes our research team's use of computer simulation models to assist in designing a study to test a novel, comprehensive socio-environmental treatment approach to weight loss maintenance in children ages 7–12 years. Weight outcome data from the weight loss, weight maintenance, and follow-up phases of a recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) were used to describe the time course of a proposed, extended multilevel treatment program. Simulations were then conducted to project the expected changes in child percent overweight (POW) trajectories in the proposed study. A 12.9% decrease in POW at 30 months was estimated based upon the midway point between models of "best-case" and "worst-case" weight maintenance scenarios. Preliminary data and further analyses, including biosimulation projections, suggest that our socio-environmental approach to weight loss maintenance treatment is promising and warrants evaluation in a large-scale RCT. Biosimulation techniques may have utility in the design of future community-level interventions for the treatment and prevention of childhood overweight.

### Lifestyle therapy for obesity [^112tf3ae]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle management of obesity includes nutritional therapy, physical activity, and several intermittent fasting therapies. Effective nutrition therapies include optimized low-fat diets, high-quality ketogenic diets, and energy-restricted diets. Adherence to dietary change remains the most substantial barrier to success; therefore, patients engaging in lifestyle changes require intensive support and resources. Physical activity is shown to have benefits to body composition and disease risk beyond the effects on weight loss. Patients should be guided toward a regimen that is appropriate for their capacity for movement. Multiple intermittent fasting strategies have now been shown to cause substantial weight loss and metabolic health improvement.

### Transtheoretical model for dietary and physical exercise modification in weight loss management for overweight and obese adults [^113ccnaD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is a global public health threat. The transtheoretical model stages of change (TTM SOC) model has long been considered a useful interventional approach in lifestyle modification programmes, but its effectiveness in producing sustainable weight loss in overweight and obese individuals has been found to vary considerably.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of dietary and physical activity interventions based on the transtheoretical model, to produce sustainable weight loss in overweight and obese adults.

Search Strategy

Studies were obtained from searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases. Date of last search for The Cochrane Library was issue 10, 2010, for MEDLINE Dezember 2010, for EMBASE January 2011 and for PSYCHINFO Januar 2011.

Selection Criteria

Trials were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: randomised controlled clinical trials using TTM SOC as a model, theoretical framework or guideline in designing lifestyle modification strategies, mainly dietary and physical exercise versus a comparison intervention of usual care; one of the outcome measures of the study was weight loss; and participants were overweight or obese adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two researchers independently applied the inclusion criteria to the identified studies and assessed risk of bias. Disagreement was resolved by discussion or by intervention of a third party. Descriptive analysis was conducted for the review.

Main Results

A total of five studies met the inclusion criteria and a total of 3910 participants were evaluated. The total number of participants randomised to intervention groups was 1834 and 2076 were randomised to control groups. Overall risk of bias was high. The trials varied in length of intervention from six weeks to 24 months, with a median length of nine months. The intervention was found to have limited impact on weight loss (about 2 kg or less) and other outcome measures. There was no conclusive evidence for sustainable weight loss. However, TTM SOC and a combination of physical activity, diet and other interventions tended to produce significant outcomes (particularly change in physical activity and dietary intake). TTM SOC was used inconsistently as a theoretical framework for intervention in the trials. Death and weight gain are the two adverse events reported by the included trials. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, and costs as outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

TTM SOC and a combination of physical activity, diet and other interventions resulted in minimal weight loss, and there was no conclusive evidence for sustainable weight loss. The impact of TTM SOC as theoretical framework in weight loss management may depend on how it is used as a framework for intervention and in combination with other strategies like diet and physical activities.

### Intensive lifestyle intervention for obesity: principles, practices, and results [^112gpDTN]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Using the Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults as a framework, this article reviews intensive lifestyle interventions for weight loss. The Guidelines recommend a minimum of 6 months of high-intensity, comprehensive lifestyle intervention, consisting of a reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavior therapy. Persons with obesity typically lose approximately 8 kg (approximately 8% of initial weight) with this approach, accompanied by improvements in health and quality of life. To prevent weight regain, the Guidelines recommend a 1-year weight loss maintenance program that includes at least monthly counseling with a trained interventionist. Lifestyle interventions usually are delivered in-person; however, treatment increasingly is being disseminated through community- and commercial-based programs, as well as delivered by telephone, Internet, and smartphone platforms. These latter modalities expand treatment reach but usually produce smaller weight losses than in-person interventions. The review concludes with an examination of challenges in weight management.

### Practical strategies to manage obesity in type 2 diabetes [^1168yvjy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The rising phenomenon of obesity, a major risk factor for the development and progression of type 2 diabetes, is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach to be prevented and managed. Although novel pharmacological measures to combat obesity have achieved unprecedented efficacy, a healthy lifestyle remains essential for the long-term success of any therapeutic intervention. However, this requires a high level of intrinsic motivation and continued behavioural changes in the face of multiple metabolic, psychological and environmental factors promoting weight gain, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes. This review is intended to provide practical recommendations in the context of a holistic, person-centred approach to weight management, including evidence-based and expert recommendations addressing supportive communication, shared decision-making, as well as nutritional and pharmacological therapeutic approaches to achieve sustained weight loss.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115dBKuV]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025, weight-loss targets and caloric prescriptions — sustained weight loss (3–7% of body weight) improves glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids and may reduce the need for disease-specific medications, and in people at risk, 3–7% weight loss reduces progression to diabetes. To achieve significant weight loss with lifestyle change programs, creating a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit is recommended, which for most women is approximately 1,200–1,500 kcal/day and for most men approximately 1,500–1,800 kcal/day, with adjustment for baseline body weight. Clinical benefits typically begin upon achieving 3% weight loss, and these benefits are progressive; more intensive weight loss goals (> 7%, > 10%, > 15%, etc.) can achieve further health improvements if feasible and safe. Mounting data indicate that > 10% body weight loss usually confers greater benefits on glycemia and diabetes remission and improves other metabolic comorbidities, and in Look AHEAD almost one-third of intensive lifestyle group participants lost and maintained ≥ 10% of initial body weight at 8 years and required fewer glucose-, blood pressure-, and lipid-lowering medications than those assigned to standard care.

### Precision medicine in weight loss and healthy living [^116AqGkB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Obesity affects 600 million people globally and over one third of the American population. Along with associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer; the direct and indirect costs of managing obesity are 21% of the total medical costs. These factors shed light on why developing effective and pragmatic strategies to reduce body weight in obese individuals is a major public health concern. An estimated 60–70% of obese Americans attempt to lose weight each year, with only a small minority able to achieve and maintain long term weight loss. To address this issue a precision medicine approach for weight loss has been considered, which places an emphasis on sustainability and real-world application to individualized therapy. In this article we review weight loss interventions in the context of precision medicine and discuss the role of genetic and epigenetic factors, pharmacological interventions, lifestyle interventions, and bariatric surgery on weight loss.

### The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: a narrative review of current evidence and future directions [^116Jgqff]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Other obesity management approaches

While GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated substantial efficacy in promoting weight loss, it is useful to first examine other treatment modalities in obesity management. Lifestyle interventions, alternative anti-obesity medications, and bariatric surgery offer different approaches for weight loss and may provide useful context for evaluating the overall impact of GLP-1 RAs.

Lifestyle interventions and behavioral therapy

Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone for treating obesity. Clinical guidelines on obesity management, including the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the 2016 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology guidelines, highlight the importance of a structured lifestyle intervention program. These programs typically include a calorie-restricted diet, increased physical activity, and behavioral therapy, which together are recommended as the first-line treatment for individuals with overweight or obesity. However, these strategies are often insufficient to achieve and sustain weight loss. Many patients struggle to maintain the necessary behavioral changes long term, leading to modest results which are often inadequate in addressing the complex physiological, genetic, and environmental factors underlying obesity. On average, patients regain one-third of the weight lost (5–10% of baseline bodyweight) within the first year of treatment discontinuation, and nearly half of patients return to their initial weight within five years. Consequently, lifestyle interventions frequently require supplementation with pharmacological treatments to achieve more substantial weight loss outcomes.

### Bone health following lifestyle-induced weight loss in individuals with overweight / obesity: a narrative review [^117VCf56]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Although weight loss has many health benefits for people with overweight/obesity, its potential negative impact on bone health needs to be considered. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of intentional weight loss achieved by lifestyle changes on bone health outcomes in adults with overweight/obesity and discusses potential mechanisms underlying the observed skeletal effects and protective measures to preserve bone health in this context. Weight loss achieved through lifestyle modifications increases surrogate markers of bone resorption and small but persistent reductions in bone mineral density at clinically relevant sites (mainly at the level of the hip). Based on limited available data, weight loss achieved by lifestyle modifications may increase fragility fractures. Combating sedentary lifestyles and promoting exercise, particularly resistance exercise, adequate intakes of calcium (diets and/or supplements), vitamin D supplementation, and higher dietary protein intakes could attenuate but not fully prevent the increased bone turnover or bone loss often associated with intentional weight loss. Further research needs to explore the skeletal effects of pragmatic interventions that match clinical scenarios, verify if changes in bone macro- and/or microstructure translate to an increased fracture risk, and investigate novel/combined strategies to improve bone health due to weight loss.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^113nUNkq]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Obesity management — weight loss benefits and intervention intensity — Clinically meaningful weight loss (≥ 5% initial weight) is associated with moderate improvement in BP, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride, and glucose levels among individuals with overweight/obesity. Weight loss reduces or delays the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in persons with obesity. High-intensity (≥ 14 sessions in 6 months) comprehensive weight-loss interventions provided by a trained interventionist work best, though electronically delivered programs with personalized feedback and some commercial-based programs have also shown moderate results.
