## Question

What can be the cause of episodes of tachycardia, palpitations, heat flushing, and dizziness at rest in a patient with a fever of unknown origin, fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss that have all resolved?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what most likely caused episodic tachycardia, palpitations, heat flushing, and dizziness at rest in a patient with a fever of unknown origin, fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss that have all resolved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which single diagnosis best explains the entire symptom complex. Then, I should verify whether the resolution of symptoms changes the diagnostic weighting. Next, I will consider key differentials that could mimic this presentation and why they are less likely. Finally, I will outline the diagnostic approach and management implications, ensuring I anchor to guideline-based testing and treatment where applicable [^1155ujiB] [^111exyft].

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Hyperthyroidism, particularly Graves' disease, classically presents with tachycardia, palpitations, heat intolerance/flushing, dizziness, fatigue, weight loss despite increased appetite, and can be associated with fever in thyrotoxicosis; the constellation of adrenergic symptoms with systemic features fits this case well, and the resolution of symptoms could reflect spontaneous remission or transient thyroiditis, which is not uncommon in early or subacute presentations [^111exyft] [^116DpmMN] [^1155ujiB].

> Wait, let me verify the fever component before I jump ahead. I initially thought fever is not typical in hyperthyroidism, but that is not correct; thyrotoxicosis can present with low-grade fever and even hyperpyrexia in severe cases, so the documented fever of unknown origin does not exclude hyperthyroidism and may actually support it when aligned with the other adrenergic and systemic features seen here [^113uziqY] [^1149MzCv] [^1132njm6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review competing explanations. Post-COVID autonomic dysfunction, including POTS, can cause palpitations, dizziness, and fatigue, but the presence of fever and weight loss is not expected in isolated POTS and would be atypical for a purely autonomic presentation, making this less likely as a unifying diagnosis despite the overlap in autonomic symptoms [^1171u51n] [^116yPJuu] [^113YrvpZ].

> I need to check medication-induced thyrotoxicosis as a potential driver. Excess levothyroxine or liothyronine can reproduce the full hyperthyroid symptom complex, including tachycardia, palpitations, heat intolerance, weight loss, and even fever; if the patient was on thyroid hormone, a dosing error, drug interaction, or formulation change could explain an episodic, now-resolved presentation, so a careful medication reconciliation is essential before concluding primary thyroid disease [^113uziqY] [^1149MzCv] [^1132njm6] [^115EbFGp] [^114XnG87].

> Let me consider other endocrine mimics. Pheochromocytoma can cause episodic palpitations, flushing, and diaphoresis, but sustained weight loss and fever are less characteristic, and the absence of paroxysmal hypertension reduces its likelihood here; still, if symptoms recur or blood pressure is labile, targeted catecholamine testing would be reasonable to exclude it definitively [^notfound].

> I should double-check infectious and inflammatory etiologies. Occult infection or inflammatory disease could explain fever, fatigue, weight loss, and even tachycardia, but the clustering of heat intolerance, flushing, and adrenergic symptoms is far more specific for hyperthyroidism than for most infections; the resolution of symptoms also makes a self-limited thyroiditis a plausible bridge between infectious triggers and transient thyrotoxicosis, which is a recognized pathway in subacute thyroiditis [^111exyft].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach to confirm hyperthyroidism. First-line testing should include a sensitive TSH with free T4; a suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 would confirm biochemical thyrotoxicosis, and if etiology is unclear, radioactive iodine uptake and scan can differentiate Graves' disease from thyroiditis or nodular disease, which directly informs management decisions and prognosis [^1155ujiB] [^111exyft].

> I will now examine management implications if hyperthyroidism is confirmed. For Graves' disease, thionamides such as methimazole are first-line to control hormone synthesis, with consideration of beta-blockers for symptomatic relief of adrenergic symptoms; in selected cases, radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy are definitive options, and the choice should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, goiter size, and patient preference, consistent with guideline-based care [^111exyft].

> But wait, what if symptoms recur intermittently? Given the resolution, I should also consider subacute thyroiditis with a transient thyrotoxic phase followed by recovery; in such cases, supportive care and monitoring are appropriate, with attention to the subsequent hypothyroid phase that may require temporary or permanent thyroid hormone replacement, aligning with standard follow-up for thyroiditis [^notfound].

> In summary, after reconsidering the differential and anchoring to guideline-based features, the most likely unified diagnosis is hyperthyroidism, most consistent with Graves' disease or a transient thyroiditis, with the resolution of symptoms compatible with a self-limited thyrotoxic phase; confirming with TSH and free T4, and proceeding to uptake scanning if needed, will clarify etiology and guide next steps in management [^1155ujiB] [^111exyft].

The most likely cause of episodic tachycardia, palpitations, flushing, and dizziness at rest with prior fever, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss is **hyperthyroidism** (Graves' disease or toxic nodular disease) [^111exyft], given the classic adrenergic and systemic features and the resolution of systemic symptoms with treatment or spontaneous remission [^111exyft]. Other considerations include **pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma** (episodic catecholamine surges), mast cell activation syndrome (episodic flushing with autonomic symptoms), and anxiety/panic disorder (episodic autonomic symptoms without organic disease) [^112qnCDC] [^111pDmt6]. Less likely are **infectious or inflammatory etiologies** (e.g. endocarditis, myocarditis, rheumatologic disease) or medication-induced causes (e.g. thyroid hormone excess, sympathomimetics) [^113do15t] [^113uziqY]. Evaluation should include thyroid function tests, catecholamines/metanephrines, and autonomic testing; management is cause-specific, with beta-blockers for symptomatic relief [^1155ujiB].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Endocrine disorders

- **Hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter)**: Classic features include tachycardia, palpitations, flushing, weight loss, fatigue, and heat intolerance; systemic symptoms may resolve with treatment or spontaneous remission [^111exyft] [^116DpmMN].

- **Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma**: Episodic catecholamine surges cause tachycardia, palpitations, flushing, dizziness, and diaphoresis; systemic symptoms are less prominent but can occur [^notfound].

- **Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS)**: Episodic flushing, palpitations, dizziness, and autonomic symptoms; often triggered by heat, stress, or foods [^112qnCDC].

---

### Autonomic dysfunction

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) presents with orthostatic intolerance, tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, and fatigue; it is often post-viral and may follow infections such as COVID-19 [^1171u51n] [^113YrvpZ]. Anxiety/panic disorder produces episodic tachycardia, palpitations, flushing, dizziness, and perceived feverishness; systemic symptoms are typically absent or mild [^111pDmt6].

---

### Infectious and inflammatory conditions

Endocarditis/myocarditis may present with fever, fatigue, weight loss, and palpitations; tachycardia and dizziness are common, but episodic symptoms are less typical [^113do15t]. Rheumatologic diseases (e.g. SLE, vasculitis) can cause fever, fatigue, weight loss, and episodic symptoms due to autonomic involvement or medication effects.

---

### Medication-induced causes

Thyroid hormone excess (levothyroxine, liothyronine) can cause hyperthyroidism-like symptoms, including tachycardia, palpitations, flushing, and weight loss [^113uziqY] [^115EbFGp]. Sympathomimetic medications (e.g. decongestants, stimulants) may cause episodic tachycardia, palpitations, and flushing.

---

## Diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4, free T3) | Screen for hyperthyroidism [^111exyft] |
| 2 | 24-hour urine catecholamines and metanephrines | Screen for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma [^notfound] |
| 3 | Autonomic function testing (tilt table, QSART) | Evaluate for POTS or autonomic dysfunction [^1171u51n] |
| 4 | ECG, echocardiogram, Holter monitor | Assess cardiac structure and rhythm abnormalities [^1153CK6f] |
| 5 | Laboratory tests (CBC, ESR, CRP, ANA, rheumatoid factor) | Screen for infectious or inflammatory etiologies |
| 6 | Medication review | Identify potential drug-induced causes [^113uziqY] |

---

## Management strategies

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Antithyroid drugs (methimazole), beta-blockers for symptom control, radioactive iodine or surgery for definitive treatment [^111exyft].

- **Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma**: Surgical resection after alpha-blockade; beta-blockers for tachycardia control [^notfound].

- **MCAS**: Antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, avoidance of triggers [^notfound].

- **POTS**: Increased salt intake, hydration, compression garments, beta-blockers, and autonomic rehabilitation [^notfound].

- **Anxiety/panic disorder**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, SSRIs/SNRIs, benzodiazepines for acute episodes [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause is **hyperthyroidism**, but pheochromocytoma, MCAS, POTS, and anxiety/panic disorder should also be considered. A structured diagnostic approach and targeted management are essential for symptom control and recurrence prevention.

### Dicyclomine hydrochloride [^115rjYHP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions

Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System

The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect.

Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/ or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug.

Dicyclomine may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine.

### Lorazepam [^113JuMZs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Abrupt termination of treatment may be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms reported following discontinuation of benzodiazepines include headache, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, rebound phenomena, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, hyperacusis, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, noise, and physical contact/perceptual changes, involuntary movements, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, hallucinations/delirium, convulsions/seizures, tremor, abdominal cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, vertigo, hyperreflexia, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. Convulsions/seizures may be more common in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or who are taking other drugs that lower the convulsive threshold such as antidepressants.

There is evidence that tolerance develops to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines.

Lorazepam may have abuse potential, especially in patients with a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.

### Prevalence of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and headache before and after long COVID onset: a case-control study in the total population of region stockholm [^113RSaoh]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis with profound and long-lasting effects on individuals and healthcare systems. While most patients recover from the acute COVID-19 infection, a significant number of individuals experience symptoms that persist for months or years, described as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID. Long COVID is defined as having persistent symptoms > 12 weeks after the acute infection, which cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The range of symptoms often experienced by patients includes fatigue, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and depressive symptoms, dizziness, sensorimotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, palpitations, dyspnea, chronic cough, and chest pain, ultimately impacting the overall health-related quality of life.

It is estimated that around 10–30% of people previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 are affected by long COVID, with the frequency appearing to have decreased in more recent times. However, longitudinal studies have reported numbers as high as 46% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 still having persistent symptoms after 12 months. The variation in numbers is linked to the uncertainties and complexity surrounding the precise diagnostics of long COVID. While long COVID today is recognized as a single condition with multiple distinct phenotypes, its pathophysiology remains unclear. Evidence points to a multifactorial explanation as multiple organs are involved, and a combination of direct viral-specific pathophysiological damage, immune dysregulation, microvascular injury, and inflammation in response to acute infection, which may persist and lead to chronic inflammation, exacerbating long-term symptoms. Further, persistent viral reservoirs, aberrant immune responses, and post-viral autonomic dysfunction have all been hypothesized as contributing factors. Importantly, persistent symptoms are not unique to COVID-19 but have also been observed across a wide range of medical conditions, suggesting the involvement of potential transdiagnostic mechanisms. Finally, researchers have argued that different mechanisms may underlie persistent symptoms in individuals with varying infection severity, even though current long COVID criteria do not distinguish between mild and severe cases. Conversely, given that functional neurological disorder often begins after a noxious sensory event, it is expected that some individuals develop functional symptoms following COVID-19 infection. The association between long COVID and functional disorders remains a topic of ongoing debate.

Diagnosis of GD

Awareness of common and atypical presentations of GD is necessary as failure to diagnose GD in a timely manner may lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Most patients with GD present with classic signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, but they can also present with TED in about 40%of cases and dermopathy in 5% to 15% of patients. Thymic enlargement has also been reported. Clinical presentation depends on the age of onset, severity, and duration of hyperthyroidism.

Common presentations such as heat intolerance, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, palpitation, tremors, anxiety, nervousness, as well as eye symptoms and palpable goiter are often seen in younger population. In older patients, symptoms are usually subtle with fatigue, weight loss, and new onset atrial fibrillation. Atypical presentation of hyperthyroidism in older adults is also referred as apathetic thyrotoxicosis.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in the context of long COVID

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a condition marked by tachycardia and a constellation of autonomic symptoms upon standing, has drawn increasing attention in the context of Long COVID. Originally characterized in 1993 by Philip Low at the Mayo Clinic, POTS is now widely recognized as one of the manifestations of orthostatic intolerance.POTS is defined as a clinical "syndrome" that is usually characterized by:
1) Frequent symptoms that occur with standing such as lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue
2) An increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 beats/min when moving from a recumbent to a standing position held for more than 30 seconds (or ≥ 40 beats/min in individuals 12–19 years of age)
3) The absence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) (> 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure). Typically defined by the following criteria:

### Aripiprazole (Abilify) [^11452KS5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

It should be noted that ABILIFY is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population.

5.4	Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY. Rare cases of NMS occurred during ABILIFY treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

### Prochlorperazine maleate [^115LEwdZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): A potentially fatal syndrome complex sometimes referred to as neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous systems (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^111exyft]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is characterized by overproduction of thyroid hormone in the thyroid gland and affects 1.3% of adults in the United States. Thyrotoxicosis is a state of thyroid hormone excess and may be caused by hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, or exogenous administration. The most common symptoms of hyperthyroidism are weakness, palpitations, weight loss, and heat intolerance, and the most common signs are a palpable goiter, tachycardia, muscle weakness, and tremor. A low thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin) level has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing thyrotoxicosis. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune condition Graves disease, typically diagnosed by the presence of thyroid eye disease, which is pathognomonic, or thyrotropin receptor antibodies. Other causes of hyperthyroidism are toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, and thyroiditis, which can be differentiated by the pattern of uptake on a radioactive iodine scan. Thionamides (most commonly methimazole) typically induce remission of Graves disease and can control hyperthyroidism caused by multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma. Radioactive iodine resolves hyperthyroidism in more than 90% of patients with Graves disease and toxic multinodular goiter, with hypothyroidism developing in most patients 1 year after treatment. Thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with compressive symptoms from an obstructive goiter.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^113oo1tU]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Clozapine — regulatory requirements, adverse effects, and patient-centered considerations — requires via the FDA a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) with registration of prescribers, pharmacies, and recipients and adherence to blood testing before prescribing and dispensing, and Black Box warnings include orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia and syncope, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, and a dose-related increased risk of seizures. A systematic review (SR) comparing clozapine with other antipsychotic medications as a group found seizures, sialorrhea, tachycardia, fever, dizziness, and sedation more common with clozapine, while insomnia was more common with other antipsychotic medications and weight gain did not differ among medications, with the GRADE rating for differences in adverse effects described as moderate. Pairwise SR comparisons indicated extrapyramidal symptoms were more common with risperidone than clozapine and weight gain more common with clozapine than risperidone, with the GRADE rating for pairwise adverse effect comparisons ranging from very low to moderate; neither SR provided data on rare but potentially severe adverse events such as agranulocytosis, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy, which are more common with clozapine, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is more common with other antipsychotic medications. Patient preferences vary significantly; a patient focus group emphasized treatment goals encompassing being able to live, work, and learn, noted alignment with use of clozapine for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and highlighted anxiety about rare but potentially serious adverse effects and the increased monitoring needed, with psychoeducation and shared decision making described as vehicles to address variation in values and achieve patient-centered goals.

### Cardiac channelopathies: clinical diagnosis and promising therapeutics [^1153CK6f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CPVT should be considered in patients with a structurally normal heart and a normal resting ECG, presenting with dizziness, palpitations, fainting, seizure‐like episodes, or family history of juvenile sudden cardiac death during physical/emotional stress. During acute episodes, ECG presentations may exhibit 2 distinct types of polymorphic VT. The first type is the typical polymorphic VT with characteristic changing QRS morphology. The other subtype is bidirectional tachycardia characterized by 180‐degree rotation of the QRS complex between one beat and the other. It is important to distinguish normal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from those seen in patients with CPVT. The PVCs in CPVT are typically late coupled and can exhibit a right bundle branch block pattern with a superior axis or a left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis. During exercise, the PVCs in patients with CPVT can be distinguished from normal heathy controls due to a variety of characteristics. These include a bigger number of PVCs that start appearing at high cardiac workload, left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis, bigeminy or trigeminy at peak stress, QRS > 120 milliseconds, coupling interval > 400 ms, or disappearance in the first minute of rest. Of those characteristics, the most sensitive and specific one is the left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis. This pattern suggests the presence of an RV outflow tract as an ectopic initiation site.

The primary diagnostic tool for CPVT is an exercise stress test. The test is done in a closely monitored environment and followed using a standard Bruce protocol. As the duration and intensity of the test increases, the beats can transition into a bigeminal or trigeminal pattern and may become a ventricular arrhythmia. A negative exercise stress test cannot rule out CPVT as it provokes a VT in around two thirds of patients only. In such cases, a novel "burst" exercise protocol may be used. The hypothesis is that short intense bursts of exercise cause an abrupt surge in heart rate, predisposing to higher risks of calcium dysregulation and arrhythmogenesis. In patients who cannot undergo exercise stress testing, a pharmacological stress test by epinephrine infusion is used. CPVT is diagnosed when the infusion triggers a polymorphic VT with > 10 PVCs per minute or the presence of new T‐wave alternations.

### Haloperidol decanoate (Haldol decanoate) [^115mBHPX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with HALDOL.

Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies

Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity with haloperidol treatment include severe extrapyramidal symptoms, confusion, sedation, and falls. In addition, haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. HALDOL decanoate is contraindicated in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions with haloperidol. These include anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, dermatitis exfoliative, hypersensitivity vasculitis, rash, urticaria, face edema, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Characterization of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in long COVID: self-reported data from the LISTEN study [^116yPJuu]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In our study of individuals with self-reported long COVID, self-reported POTS was prevalent, affecting nearly one-third of participants, with a preponderance of young females. Those with self-reported POTS reported higher rates of associated conditions and experienced more severe symptoms across multiple domains compared with those without self-reported POTS. Importantly, individuals with self-reported POTS exhibited worse health status, financial difficulties, social isolation, and increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts, highlighting the need to understand the mechanism, better characterize physiological derangements, and develop targeted interventions for this subgroup.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND PATIENT CARE: Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for POTS as a complication of long COVID and promptly refer patients with indicative symptoms for further testing and symptomatic treatment options.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Individuals with long COVID-associated POTS face significant physical, psychological, and social challenges, emphasizing the need for increased awareness, proactive support, and ongoing research. Multidisciplinary team-based care is crucial for improving outcomes and addressing the burdens of long COVID.

### Tragus nerve stimulation attenuates postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in post COVID-19 infection [^116gESuX]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Autonomic Dysfunction and COVID‐19

While COVID‐19 primarily affects the respiratory system, it can also have systemic effects that extend beyond the acute phase of the illness. Some patients who have recovered from COVID‐19 may experience a range of persistent symptoms and complications, collectively known as post‐acute sequelae of COVID‐19 or Long COVID. Among the diverse symptoms observed in this prolonged phase, POTS has been frequently reported. POTS is widely recognized as a complex disorder of the autonomic nervous system, characterized by orthostatic intolerance. Clinically, while POTS presents with orthostatic tachycardia as a hallmark feature, it also encompasses a broader range of symptoms associated with autonomic dysregulation, including headache, cognitive impairment, nausea, and gastrointestinal dysmotility. The potential mechanisms are likely related to an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, as well as hemodynamic abnormalities such as reduced systemic venous return, augmented splanchnic and extremity pooling, decreased cardiac output, and decreased cerebral perfusion. This dysregulation manifests as a decrease in parasympathetic tone and an increase in sympathetic activity, particularly during postural changes from supine to upright positions. HRV provides a noninvasive method to assess the interaction between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.

In HRV analysis, HF primarily represents vagal (parasympathetic) activity. High HF power indicates increased vagal tone and is associated with relaxation and restorative processes in the body. On the other hand, the low‐frequency (LF) component, along with the LF/HF ratio, is often interpreted as a marker of sympathetic activity. Higher LF power and LF/HF ratio are typically associated with increased sympathetic tone and arousal. In the present study, we observed a reduction in HF, and increases in LF and LF/HF ratio within 10 min of standing, accompanying postural changes from a recumbent to an upright position, highlighting the dysregulation of the ANS in patients with POTS. This dysregulation is typified by a decrease in parasympathetic activity and a concurrent increase in sympathetic activity, which are key contributors to the hallmark symptoms of POTS. Therefore, potentiation of parasympathetic response and inhibition of sympathetic drive may work as an effective therapeutic strategy in POTS.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old female presented to the urgent care clinic with a complaint of sharp, intermittent, non-exertional chest pain localized to the left anterior chest. The pain had a sudden onset at rest and persisted for several hours before presentation. The patient denied any radiation of the pain, and there were no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or dizziness. The pain was not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics and was unaffected by changes in position or respiration. She reported no history of fever, cough, recent infections, or any other symptoms suggestive of systemic or respiratory conditions. There was no history of previous trauma or recent physical exertion, and she had not experienced similar episodes in the past. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no significant illnesses or chronic conditions. She was not on any medications, had no known drug allergies, and her family history was negative for cardiac or congenital anomalies, sudden cardiac death, or other heritable conditions. Socially, the patient was a non-smoker, denied alcohol or illicit drug use, and reported no recent stress or psychological distress.

On physical examination, the patient appeared alert and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and she was afebrile. The cardiovascular examination was normal, with a regular heart rhythm, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no evidence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or cyanosis, and peripheral pulses were symmetrical and palpable. The respiratory examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi, and normal chest expansion. The gastrointestinal examination was unremarkable, with a soft, non-tender abdomen, no organomegaly, and normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination revealed no chest wall tenderness, and the thoracic cage appeared normal. The patient had a full range of motion in the upper limbs, with no evidence of joint or muscle abnormalities. Neurological examination was unremarkable, with intact cranial nerves and normal motor and sensory functions.

### A 20-year-old with anterior chest pain: rare diagnosis behind a common concern [^1174cnTg]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 20-year-old previously healthy man presented to our hospital with a 2-week history of dull aching pain localized to the anterior chest wall, specifically in the sternum region. The pain was non-radiating and was exacerbated by physical activity or deep inspiration. There was no associated swelling, redness, or deformity of the chest wall. There were no associated systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. Additionally, there was no history of recent respiratory infections, coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, palpitations, edema, or orthopnea to suggest pulmonary or cardiac involvement. The patient was of Indian ethnicity and has been living in India since birth. However, he had no known exposure to individuals with active pulmonary TB. The patient reported no history of trauma, repetitive physical strain, or prior surgical interventions, such as sternotomy or chest wall procedures. His medical history was unremarkable, with no prior hospitalizations or chronic illnesses. There was no personal or family history of autoimmune disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis, and he specifically denied symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint swelling, or peripheral joint pain that might suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder. The absence of gastrointestinal or urogenital symptoms further reduced the likelihood of reactive arthritis or other systemic conditions. Relevant negatives also included no history of smoking, immunosuppressive therapy, or conditions such as diabetes or HIV that could increase susceptibility to infections.

### Droxidopa [^113vDE9h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The exact mechanism of action of droxidopa capsules in the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is unknown droxidopa capsules is a synthetic amino acid analog that is directly metabolized to norepinephrine by dopa-decarboxylase, which is extensively distributed throughout the body. droxidopa capsules is believed to exert its pharmacological effects through norepinephrine and not through the parent molecule or other metabolites. Norepinephrine increases blood pressure by inducing peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction droxidopa capsules in humans induces small and transient rises in plasma norepinephrine.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Peak droxidopa plasma concentrations are associated with increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Droxidopa has no clinically significant effect on standing or supine heart rates in patients with autonomic failure.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

No prolongation of the QTc interval was observed with droxidopa capsules at single oral doses up to 2,000 mg, as shown in a dedicated thorough QT study.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^116XFDrW]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the comparison of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, although there was no difference on average age, the proportion of symptomatic patients was significantly lower in those under 20 years of age, with only 3 out of 12 (25%) having palpitations. This is generally consistent with the results of previous studies. On the other hand, in the 21–65 age group, the proportion of symptomatic patients was obviously higher. In this age group, no significant difference in proportion was found when comparing patients in the PVC‐relevant group with those in the PVC‐irrelevant group, indicating that palpitations were more likely to be caused by reasons other than PVC.

Liang et al. discovered that 27% of patients with PVCs had depression, which is similar to the 32% in our group. In this study, anxiety was significantly more prevalent in those with palpitations than in those without. There may be a reciprocal causal relationship between palpitations and depression. Barsky et al. found that 45% of those with palpitations had anxiety or depressive disorder. They also observed that the correlation between palpitations and arrhythmia was weaker in patients with more severe psychiatric symptoms, suggesting that patients with depression and anxiety are more likely to have palpitations unrelated to arrhythmia.

Palpitations experienced by patients with PVCs are not necessarily directly related to PVCs and may be caused by other arrhythmias or non‐arrhythmic factors. In the present study, we excluded patients with coexisting other arrhythmias, but the role of sinus tachycardia, a common cause of palpitations, could not be ruled out. To establish a definite correlation between palpitations and PVCs, detailed face‐to‐face counseling was conducted in each of our patients, and a reliable judgment was made based on the temporal consistency of symptom onset and the detection of PVCs on ECG recording or physical examination. In this study, a clear correlation between palpitations and PVCs could be established in only 34%, suggesting that further confirmation of the correlation between symptoms and arrhythmia is necessary to determine treatment options for patients with PVCs. In contrast to patients in the PVC‐irrelevant group, a higher proportion of those in the PVC‐relevant group experienced palpitations lasting only a few seconds, indicating that short‐duration palpitations are more likely to be directly caused by PVCs.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111fWi9P]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — asparaginase hypersensitivity and infusion reactions notes that asparaginase products are associated with potentially severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) due to anti-asparaginase or anti-PEG antibodies and may be associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies and lack of asparaginase activity. ERW-rywn is used for patients who develop allergic reactions to E. coli-derived asparaginase. With IV pegaspargase and calaspargase, nonallergic infusion reactions can occur within minutes or seconds and may manifest with flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, tachypnea, and anxiety. Slowing the infusion to ≥ 2 hours (but < 4 hours for calaspargase), with concurrent infusion of saline and use of anti-allergy premedications given IV or PO such as hydrocortisone, diphenhydramine, other antihistamines including cetirizine (category 2B for IV cetirizine), and acetaminophen, can reduce these reactions. Although routine premedication has been generally avoided, universal premedication and TDM can be considered to decrease the incidence and severity of adverse events and the need to substitute pegaspargase with ERW-rywn. In patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to pegaspargase, some studies have found desensitization protocols helpful; however, this practice is not currently recommended in the guidelines.

### Hypothyroidism: a review [^113Titvo]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hypothyroidism is a chronic endocrine disease associated with the deficiency of thyroxine and T3 thyroid hormones.
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypothyroidism is most frequently caused by a failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (99%). Other causes include the underproduction of TSH by the pituitary gland and deficiency of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism in the US is estimated at 300 per 100,000 population and 4,300 per 100,000 population, respectively. Hypothyroidism is 2–8 times more prevalent in women than men, and it's prevalence increases with age.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include weight gain, fatigue, proximal weakness, decreased concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, menstrual irregularities, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and sensory neuropathy. A severe form of hypothyroidism-myxedema coma- presents with altered mental status, hypothermia, hyponatremia and bradycardia. The disease decreases productivity and QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypothyroidism is not associated with an increase in mortality. Treatment is well tolerated and results in improved QoL in most patients. However, untreated hypothyroidism leads to disease progression and ultimately, coma and death.

### A review of the sequelae of post COVID-19 with neurological implications (post-viral syndrome) [^116wcKJF]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Post Covid-19 conditions represent a medical challenge; a unified definition is not achieved after 5 years of the Pandemic. The incidence of Post Covid-19 conditions varies, nevertheless the neurological complications represent an important aspect in the spectrums of fields involved. The current perception is that varied manifestations and long-term complications of COVID-19 reflect underlying pathophysiological processes, including inflammatory, immune-mediated, and vascular mechanisms. These mechanisms underscore the complexity of COVID-19's impact including the nervous system and its potential for lasting effects. A number of symptoms are extremely severe and may also need neurologic attention including fatigue, cognitive disturbances, autonomic symptoms, headache, and sleep disorders. Post Covid-19 conditions are often of chronic nature. Management as in other chronic conditions should rely on the conventional diagnostic measures and management of symptoms irrespective of the temporal relation to the viral infection. To date Post Covid-19 conditions is only accepted as an additional or explanatory diagnosis.

### Post infectious fatigue and circadian rhythm disruption in long-COVID and other infections: a need for further research [^113TBg9Z]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID: mechanistic insights and therapeutic implications

Circadian rhythm disruptions in Long COVID are likely influenced by immune dysregulation, autonomic dysfunction, and mitochondrial impairment. Elevated cytokines disrupt hypothalamic control of melatonin synthesis, compounding sleep disturbances and perpetuating fatigue. Autoantibodies targeting β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors further disrupt autonomic and circadian processes, exacerbating symptoms.

In a case control study with healthy volunteers ME/CFS affected approximately 10–12% of individuals following certain infections, with a notable association with Epstein–Barr Virus and potentially SARS-CoV-2. A critical finding was the distinct biological differences between male and female ME/CFS participants. Gene expression analyses revealed that less than 5% of differentially expressed genes overlapped between sexes, indicating significant sex-specific pathways involved in the disease. For instance, males exhibited upregulation in T-cell activation and proteasome pathways, while females showed changes in B-cell proliferation processes. On the other hand, circadian and sleep disruptions were notable in the post-infectious ME/CFS (PI-ME/CFS) cohort. Polysomnography revealed no clinically relevant differences in sleep architecture between PI-ME/CFS patients and healthy volunteers. However, autonomic dysfunction was evident, with diminished heart rate variability and altered sleep patterns suggesting increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity. These findings highlight the significant impact of rhythm disturbances may have on the overall fatigue experienced by patients after an infection. Interestingly, post-COVID-19 associated symptoms have been corelated with reduced levels of serotonin. This may arise from reduced tryptophan intestinal absorption, following an interferon-driven inflammatory response to viral infection. This in turn may impact hippocampal brain activity and form the basis of a mechanistic link between gastrointestinal absorption mechanisms and neurocognitive impairment and dysfunction following an acute infection especially one that involves the gastrointestinal tract.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^111pDmt6]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Anxiety, fear, and avoidance: conceptual framework

Core differences between anxiety and fear

Anxiety and fear are related but conceptually distinct states. Fear is an acute emotional response to a real or perceived immediate threat, activating the autonomic nervous system and preparing the body for a fight-or-flight reaction. In contrast, anxiety is a more diffuse, future-oriented state of unease or worry without a specific external stimulus. The primary distinction between the two lies in their temporal orientation: fear is reactive to immediate danger, whereas anxiety is anticipatory and concerned with potential future threats. On the basis of three responses, namely, verbal-subjective, overt motor acts, and somato-visceral activity, fear is characterized by thoughts of imminent threat, urges to escape, and a strong autonomic surge resulting in physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, heart palpitations, and nausea, whereas anxiety is often expressed through worry, avoidance, and muscle tension.

Several studies support the distinction between fear and anxiety on the basis of self-reported symptoms. A two-factor model, which distinguishes between physiological arousal (e.g. heart racing) and subjective anxiety (e.g. nervousness, inability to relax), has demonstrated a better fit than a one-factor model across diverse populations, including children/adolescents, undergraduates, and psychiatric outpatients. These findings indicate that fear is more closely associated with autonomic arousal, whereas anxiety is linked to subjective cognitive distress. However, while fear and anxiety are conceptually distinct, the symptoms of these states exist along a continuum and are likely to diverge and converge to varying degrees. Clinically, anxiety disorders can lean toward fear (e.g. AG) or anxiety (e.g. GAD), but these disorders frequently overlap. Anxiety can heighten fear responses, while fear can contribute to persistent anxious states, reinforcing a cycle of avoidance and distress.

Physician and patient agreement on baseline symptom prevalence

Agreement on baseline symptom prevalence between physician and patients´ assessment was quite low. Even for symptoms which are objectively measurable, such as weight loss, reports on symptom frequency were discrepant (any (unintentional) weight loss in the past 6 months reported by 26% (706/2687) of patients, whereas physicians reported weight loss in only 6% (169/2687) of patients). Table 2 shows physician and patient ratings of weight loss at baseline for the 2687 patients for whom both physician and patient ratings were available.

Table 2
Cross tabulation of weight loss as assessed by physician and patient.

In 44 cases the physician reported weight loss while the patient did not indicate burden from this symptom.

Similar cross-tabulations were used to calculate the prevalence of symptoms in patients with and without cytoreductive therapy, as well as the agreement κ between physician and patient assessment (see Table 3). In all but two cases, there was a statistically significant difference in agreement between physician and patient with p < 0.05, except for fever with a prevalence assumption of 4 or more points for both patients with and without cytoreductive therapy, where there was no statistically significant difference in agreement. For all symptoms, patients reported a higher prevalence of symptoms than physicians. Agreement was low and improved only slightly for symptoms with a severity score of ≥ 4. In addition, agreement was similar for patients with and without cytoreductive therapy.

### Apomorphine hydrochloride (Onapgo) [^113kFBb6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Syncope/Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension

Dopamine agonists, including ONAPGO, may cause orthostatic hypotension at any time, but especially during dose escalation. Patients with PD may also have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, PD patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk.

When evaluated at various times after dosing in Study 1, patients undergoing titration of ONAPGO showed an increased incidence (from 4.5% pre-dose to 44.4% post-dose) of systolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 20 mm Hg decrease upon standing) compared to placebo (7.1% pre-dose to 16.3% post-dose). Similarly, increased incidences of diastolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 10 mm Hg decrease upon standing) were noted in patients titrated with ONAPGO (4.5% pre-dose to 44.4% post-dose) compared to placebo (11.9% pre-dose to 30.2% post-dose). Through the 12-week treatment period, these differences in incidence rates for systolic and diastolic orthostatic hypotension remained similar between ONAPGO and placebo patients. Patients in both ONAPGO and placebo groups developed severe systolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 40 mm Hg decrease) and/or diastolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 20 mm Hg decrease).

### Autonomic dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease [^1114SCHN]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

In addition to their more studied cognitive and motor effects, neurodegenerative diseases are also associated with impairments in autonomic function - the regulation of involuntary physiological processes. These autonomic impairments manifest in different ways and at different stages depending on the specific disease. The neural networks responsible for autonomic regulation in the brain and body have characteristics that render them particularly susceptible to the prion-like spread of protein aggregation involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, the axons of these neurons - in both peripheral and central networks - are long and poorly myelinated axons, which make them preferential targets for pathological protein aggregation. Moreover, cortical regions integrating information about the internal state of the body are highly connected with other brain regions, which increases the likelihood of intersection with pathological pathways and prion-like spread of abnormal proteins. This leads to an autonomic 'signature' of dysfunction, characteristic of each neurodegenerative disease, that is linked to the affected networks and regions undergoing pathological aggregation.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Effect of perioperative autonomic nervous system imbalance on surgical outcomes: a systematic review [^112UMcEE]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review uniquely synthesises multidisciplinary evidence from anaesthesia, neuroscience, and immunology to mechanistically link surgical stressors and ANS-mediated pathophysiology. By integrating advanced assessment tools, we provide actionable insights for real-time monitoring of ANS dynamics, surpassing prior reviews focused on isolated biomarkers. Additionally, we dissect the effects of pharmacological interventions and nonpharmacological strategies, emphasising their potential to restore ANS equilibrium while addressing gaps in clinical translation. Therefore, targeted rebalancing of ANS tone is not merely a theoretical concept but a pragmatic pathway to preserve organ function and enhance patient recovery. Innovative monitoring and refined treatments to restore perioperative ANS balance hold promise for enhancing better surgical outcomes per se.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^114akfGQ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

SAD is characterized by a pronounced fear of social or performance situations, where individuals worry about being negatively judged or observed by others. This fear drives avoidance behaviors such as avoiding public speaking or social gatherings, which can severely impair social and occupational functioning. GAD is characterized by chronic, excessive worry about various topics, often without a clear trigger. The persistent worry leads to generalized feelings of tension and apprehension, often affecting multiple areas of daily life. PD is associated with recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, accompanied by intense fear and physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, sweating, and dizziness. The anticipatory anxiety of having another attack often contributes to the development of AG, where individuals avoid places or situations where escape might be difficult or where help might not be available. AG often presents as the avoidance of open spaces, crowded areas, or public transportation. Finally, SP involves intense fear of a specific object or situation, such as heights, animals, or flying. Exposure to a feared stimulus triggers immediate fear responses, which often result in avoidance behaviors. Although these disorders present distinct patterns of symptoms, such as varying intensities of fear and anxiety, different ages of onset, and unique behavioral manifestations, these anxiety disorders share the core features of heightened anxiety and fear, often accompanied by avoidance behaviors.

This narrative review integrates current knowledge on the interactions among anxiety, fear, and avoidance behaviors across these five anxiety disorders. On the basis of the intensity of fear, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, we can categorize these five anxiety disorders into three distinct groups: fear-dominant (SP, AG), mixed (PD, SAD), and anxiety-dominant (GAD). This review synthesizes findings from clinical, neuropsychological, brain function, treatment, genetic, and epigenetic studies, with a particular focus on how these components across fear, anxiety and avoidance behaviors contribute to disorder-specific profiles.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116ZxyPJ]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of ECOPD cardiovascular considerations — The current GOLD recommendations emphasize the importance of an appropriate differential diagnosis of ECOPD from other conditions that may mimic/aggravate them, and if they do exist, they need to be treated appropriately. It may be advisable to measure routinely during ECOPD markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as troponin and brain-natriuretic peptides, and the evidence supporting this proposal is still weak; if any of these markers are abnormal during the episode of ECOPD, appropriate further investigations and treatment are required following CVD recommendations. Currently, there is no evidence to support the routine use of preventive cardiovascular treatment during or following an episode of ECOPD, but β-blockers and statins need to be prescribed following their CV indications and COPD patients should not be denied β-blocker use if there is a CV indication. Finally, the increased cardiovascular risk that occurs during and following the acute episode is another strong clinical argument to prevent these acute episodes.

### Trandolapril [^115MjM2U]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Hypertension

Trandolapril tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medication such as hydrochlorothiazide.

Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction or Left-Ventricular Dysfunction Post Myocardial Infarction

Trandolapril tablets are indicated in stable patients who have evidence of left-ventricular systolic dysfunction (identified by wall motion abnormalities) or who are symptomatic from congestive heart failure within the first few days after sustaining acute myocardial infarction. Administration of trandolapril to Caucasian patients has been shown to decrease the risk of death (principally cardiovascular death) and to decrease the risk of heart failure-related hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY -Heart Failure or Left-Ventricular Dysfunction Post Myocardial Infarction for details of the survival trial).

### Paclitaxel — paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension — albumin-bound [^1166eLWZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.2 	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) or with paclitaxel injection and may be expected to occur with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions. Cross-hypersensitivity between paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and other taxanes has been reported.

Cardiovascular

Congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and atrioventricular block. Most patients were previously exposed to cardiotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, or had underlying cardiac history.

Respiratory

Pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism

Radiation pneumonitis in patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy.

Lung fibrosis has been reported with paclitaxel injection.

Neurologic

Cranial nerve palsies and vocal cord paresis, as well as autonomic neuropathy resulting in paralytic ileus.

Vision Disorders

Reduced visual acuity due to cystoid macular edema (CME). After cessation of treatment, CME may improve, and visual acuity may return to baseline. Abnormal visual evoked potentials in patients treated with paclitaxel injection suggest persistent optic nerve damage.

### Comparison of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring among patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, autonomic dysfunction, and controls [^116cb5LQ]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The utility of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) among patients with various forms of autonomic dysfunction (AD) is unknown. Twenty-four-hour ABPM among patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), AD without POTS, and control patients without AD were compared. Patients with AD without POTS had high rates of uncontrolled blood pressure (76%), whereas 19% of patients with POTS had uncontrolled blood pressure, suggesting ABPM may provide less value among patients with POTS.

### Global prevalence and risk factors of fatigue and post-infectious fatigue among patients with dengue: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rawf8]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dengue, a mosquito-borne acute febrile illness, is a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions globally. In 2024, over 7.6 million cases were reported, including 3.4 million confirmed cases, more than 16,000 severe cases, and over 3000 deaths. Dengue transmission is currently active in 90 countries. Symptomatic dengue typically manifests as mild to moderate acute febrile illness lasting from 2 to 7 days, with treatment focusing solely on supportive care.

Diagnosing dengue virus infection involves both clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as the infection presents with a wide range of non-specific symptoms. It is crucial to consider the stage of infection at which the patient seeks medical attention, as dengue progresses through three distinct phases: febrile (acute), critical, and convalescent phases. Clinical symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, nausea, and body aches and pains typically lead to suspicion of dengue during the acute phase, but these are not specific to dengue and may overlap with other febrile illnesses. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis of acute dengue should be confirmed through laboratory tests, including viral isolation, detection of viral RNA via a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), or detection of viral antigens by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or rapid diagnostic test.

Fatigue, which is defined as a subjective and unpleasant symptom ranging from tiredness to complete exhaustion and impacting individuals' normal functioning, is commonly experienced during the acute phase alongside high fever and other signs of infection. Fatigue is not unique to dengue; it is also a common symptom in other acute viral infections, such as Q fever, Epstein–Barr virus, Ebola virus, SARS-CoV-2, and chikungunya virus. In some cases, fatigue can persist beyond the acute phase of infection and potentially develop into chronic or post-infectious fatigue (PIF) syndrome. Terms like PIF syndrome and post-viral fatigue syndrome are sometimes used to describe fatigue that occurs after infections, including dengue, where the infectious agent plays a significant role in its persistence. However, there is no clear consensus on distinctions between these terms. Various viral infections are potential causes of post-viral fatigue syndrome or chronic fatigue syndrome. The proposed mechanisms for post-viral fatigue syndrome or chronic fatigue syndrome include viral persistence, autoimmunity, immune dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115QyZVK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) considerations during intensive BP treatment: In trials assessing intensive BP control, there was no evidence for harm among those with standing hypotension (SBP < 110 mm Hg). In a post-hoc NAILED study analysis, the population (n = 814, 35% experiencing OH at least once) showed that intensification of BP control was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events or death in this stroke/TIA population. Systematic titration of antihypertensive treatment did not increase the prevalence of OH compared with usual care, and there is emerging evidence that OH does not reduce the gains of intensive antihypertensive treatment. For practice, an assessment for OH in symptomatic patients, particularly after initiation of treatment or adding a new class of antihypertensive medication, is acceptable to detect unmasked autonomic system dysfunction or other acute or chronic conditions.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116K6trV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — clinical presentation and T-ALL features — Patients with ALL develop symptoms from infiltration of blasts in bone marrow, lymphoid system, and extramedullary sites including central nervous system (CNS) and testicles, with fatigue, constitutional symptoms, dyspnea, dizziness, infections, and easy bruising or bleeding; in children, extremity or joint pain may be the only presenting symptom. Compared to B-ALL, T-ALL generally presents at older ages, is more often male (3:1 male:female predominance), and more often has higher white blood cell (WBC) counts and extramedullary disease including lymphadenopathy, mediastinal mass, and CNS involvement. Mediastinal mass is present in > 50% of patients with T-ALL and can compress adjacent organs causing dyspnea/airway obstruction and venous obstruction/facial edema/thrombosis; pleural and cardiac effusions can also be seen.
