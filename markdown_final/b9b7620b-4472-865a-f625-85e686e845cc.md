## Question

Ruth is counting the number of spots on her cow. The cow has 16 spots on its left side and three times that number plus 7 on its right side. How many spots does it have total?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate the total number of spots on a cow, given 16 spots on the left side and "three times that number plus 7" on the right side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the left-side count and confirm it is 16. Then, I should translate the right-side description into a mathematical expression. Next, I will compute the right-side count. Finally, I will add the left and right counts to get the total and double-check my arithmetic.

> Let me first confirm the left-side count. The problem states the cow has 16 spots on its left side, so left = 16 spots.

> Now, I need to translate the right-side description into math. "Three times that number" refers to three times the left-side count, and "plus 7" means we add 7 to that product, so right = 3 × 16 + 7.

> Wait, let me verify the multiplication before adding. 3 × 16 equals 48, and then 48 + 7 equals 55, so the right side has 55 spots.

> Next, I should add the left and right sides to get the total. Total spots = left + right = 16 + 55 = 71 spots.

> Hold on, I should double-check the final sum to avoid a careless mistake. 16 + 55 is indeed 71, so the total number of spots on the cow is 71.

---

The cow has **16 spots on the left** and **3 × 16 + 7 = 55 spots on the right**, for a total of **16 + 55 = 71 spots**.

---

## Calculation

- **Left side spots**: 16
- **Right side spots**: 3 × 16 + 7 = 48 + 7 = 55
- **Total spots**: 16 + 55 = 71

---

The cow has a total of **71 spots**.

Data and spot preprocessing for STANLY

We inspected all 16 samples visually, excluding any with serious tissue damage or a large amount of tissue folding after adhesion to the slide limiting our analysis to 13 samples. Samples were collected from the left or right hemisphere, but to maximize spatial similarity, we mirrored the right hemisphere samples (2) to the left hemisphere, so that all samples could be aligned in the left hemisphere space. After importing the image data of the slice along with the filtered feature matrix, we reduced the list of spots per slice down to only those listed as "in tissue" by Space Ranger and masked the filtered feature matrix for each sample to first remove empty non-tissue spots. We further removed from the analysis any in tissue spots that had fewer than 5000 total gene counts, which might indicate an error with the spot itself. Any genes that expressed 0 total reads across an entire sample were removed due to low statistical viability. For these 13 samples, the average number of in tissue spots per slide was 2548. Given the localized nature of gene expression to certain tissues or regions of a sample, raw gene counts in each spot are likely to be correlated to their neighbors, but not necessarily across an entire sample. This leads to a high likelihood of a right tail distribution of data when genes are regionally expressed, with potentially high counts in some spots and counts of zero in others. In order to account for this distribution of data, we performed log base 2 normalization on the raw gene counts being fed into the analysis. Log base2 normalization is specifically useful in the case of biological data such as gene counts as this normalizes the data to look for proportional rather than additive changes in expression. STANLY uses 7 neighboring spots in each calculation to account for spatial uncertainty, which is an inevitable problem for every alignment process. Importantly, every spot retains its original log base 2 value, and all 7 spots are utilized in our t-statistics. This strategy reduces spurious findings based on small misalignments.

While this basic principle — the alignment of individual data sets to a common template — is applicable to all kinds of multiomics data sets, this version of STANLY has been optimized for the data sets in this study (e.g. regarding resolution, the number of dots, etc.).

### Evidence for a low number prior in children's intuitive number sense [^112aTLdM]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

For the number discrimination trials, participants saw two sets of "seeds" (i.e. Gabor patches), one on the left in a blue rectangle (i.e. a blue bag) and one on the right in a green rectangle (i.e. a green bag) indefinitely. Because online testing meant that we could not precisely control brightness of screens, we made exposure time infinite, allowing children to spend as long as they need encoding the stimuli. Experimenters then pressed the "z" key if participants believed the left side (i.e. blue bag) to have more objects and the "m" key if participants believed the right side (i.e.g.reen bag) to have more objects. If a participant began to count (e.g. verbally, with a pointed hand, or their eye gaze clearly demonstrated counting), the experimenter reminded participants to not count and to "make their best guess". Experimenters were instructed to not give participants any feedback during the experiment. Instead, experimenters were instructed to motivate participants to finish the task by drawing their attention to the progress bar and reminding participants they were getting closer and closer to seeing the next plant. Each block contained 16 trials with a total of 4 blocks. Adults completed the same exact task as children.

Stimuli and experiment design

Visual stimuli were presented on a 69.84 × 39.29 cm LCD screen (Cambridge Research Systems) behind the MRI bore. Participant was required to lie still and view the display through a mirror attached to the head coil. The total distance from the attached mirror to the display screen was 220 cm. The display resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels. Visual stimuli were generated in Matlab using PsychToolbox. A large diagonal cross composed of thin red lines was displayed consistently across the entire screen, which allows accurate fixation. Participants were asked to fixate the intersection of the cross. Stimuli consisted of a group of dots with a constant total surface area presented in the central 4° (diameter) of the visual field. Dots were randomly positioned at each presentation so that each dot fell entirely within this area, to distribute contrast energy equally across the stimulus area for all numerosities (Fig. 5). Each numerosity presentation that contained the same number of dots was placed in a new, random position, so no specific visual position was associated with any numerosity. To prevent perceptual grouping, individual items were distributed roughly homogeneously across the stimulus area. All of the numerosity presentations were displayed as black or white dots on a grey background. Dot patterns were presented briefly (300 ms) to ensure participants did not have time to count. A new random pattern was presented every 650 ms, with 350 ms presentation of a uniform grey background between dot pattern presentations. This was repeated six times, over 3900 ms, corresponding to two fMRI volume acquisitions (TRs), before the numerosity changed. On 10% of numerosity presentations, the dots were shown in white instead of black. Participants were instructed to press a button when white dots were shown to ensure they were paying attention to the stimulus during the fMRI acquisition and responded to 90–100% of white dot presentations within each functional run. No numerosity judgements were required. Main stimuli in the small numerosity range consisted of 1 to 7 dots, with 20 dots as the baseline, while large numerosities consisted of 1 to 64 dots and a baseline of 512 dots. To test neural populations responses to larger numerosities, a third numerosity range consisted of only large numerosities from 8 to 64 dots and a baseline line of 512 dots was introduced, namely, the large-control range (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The main numerosity stimuli were first presented in ascending order, followed by a longer period (15.6 seconds) where presented with the baseline stimuli (20 or 512 dots in the small or large range respectively), then followed by the main numerosities in descending order, followed by another identical baseline period. This sequence was repeated four times (4 cycles) for each functional run. The long baseline period had a similar function to the blank periods used in visual field mapping stimuli in population receptive field experiments. During this period, little neural response was expected from numerosity-selective neurons preferring the main numerosities of interest, as such a relatively large numerosity should be well outside of the numerosity range that elicits strong responses. This long period also allows hemodynamic responses to return to baseline between blocks of changing numerosity.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (introvale) [^115p7jjZ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 3 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting for each respective 91-day cycle.

Table 3	Number of Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting Days per 91-day Cycle

Q1 = Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting

Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting

Q3 = Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting

Table 4 shows the percentages of women with ≥ 7 days and ≥ 20 days of unscheduled spotting and/or bleeding in the levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol and the 28-day cycle treatment groups.

Table 4	Percentage of Subjects with Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting

aBased on spotting and/or bleeding on days 1 to 84 of a 91 day cycle in the levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol subjects and days 1 to 21 of a 28 day cycle over 4 cycles in the 28-day dosing regimen.

Total days of bleeding and/or spotting (scheduled plus unscheduled) were similar over one year of treatment for levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol subjects and subjects on the 28-day cycle regimen.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who are not pregnant and use levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol may experience amenorrhea. Based on data from the clinical trial, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 0.8% of women during Cycle 1, 1.2% of women during Cycle 2, 3.7% of women during Cycle 3, and 3.4% of women during Cycle 4. Because women using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol will likely have scheduled bleeding only 4 times per year, rule out pregnancy at the time of any missed menstrual period.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

Total days of bleeding and/or spotting (scheduled plus unscheduled) were similar over one year of treatment for levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects and subjects on the 28-day cycle regimen.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Females who use SETLAKIN may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on data from the clinical trial of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 0.8% of females during Cycle 1, 1.2% of females during Cycle 2, 3.7% of females during Cycle 3, and 3.4% of females during Cycle 4.

Because females using SETLAKIN will likely have scheduled bleeding only 4 times per year, rule out pregnancy at the time of any missed menstrual period.

After discontinuation of SETLAKIN, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

Visual numerosity stimuli

Visual stimuli were presented on a 69.84 × 39.29 cm LCD screen (Cambridge Research Systems) at the end of the MRI bore and viewed through a mirror. The total distance from the participant's eyes was 220 cm. The display resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels.

Visual numerosity stimuli were similar to previous studies. In short, stimuli were generated in MATLAB using PsychToolbox. Thin red lines crossed the gray background display and formed a large diagonal cross, aiding fixation at the cross intersection (Fig. 1b). Stimuli were randomly presented groups of black circles of equal size spread roughly homogenously within 2° radius of fixation. The random patterns of circles were presented for 300 ms, and in-between 350 ms of gray background was presented. Each numerosity was presented (in different random patterns) 6 times over 3.9 s before moving to the next. In order to ensure that participants were paying attention, white circles were presented about 10% of the time. Participants were asked to press a button when this happened. Numerosities 1–7 were presented in ascending order, followed by 15.6 s showing 20 circles, followed by 7 to 1 in descending order, followed by a similar presentation of 20 circles for 15.6 s. This cycle was repeated four times during a functional run. No numerosity judgment was required.

Behavioral measures of visual numerosity perception

Five participants sat in front of a display screen at a distance of 220 cm. We used the same visual stimuli of randomly presented groups of black dots that were presented in the scanner and described above. Thin red lines crossed the gray background display and formed a large diagonal cross, aiding fixation at the cross intersection. Dots were presented for 300 ms followed by a gray background. Here, however, the dots were presented in random order. The participants were asked to judge the number of dots presented and to respond with their left hand, marking on a keyboard how many dots they perceived. The gray background was kept until participants responded (with a minimum display time of 350 ms). In one test each numerosity was presented 5 times. Total duration of one test was on average 98 s (standard error = 2.2 s). This was repeated 4 times, thus in total, each numerosity was presented 20 times. Mean error rate was computed per participant. Reaction time analysis was tested on the median values of each participant.

2) in what order to take the pills (follow the arrows), and

3) the week numbers as shown in the following picture:
Each Tilia™ Fe tablet dispenser contains five active white tablets, seven active light-green tablets, nine active green tablets, and seven inactive brown tablets. These tablets are to be taken in the following order: one white tablet each day for five days, then one light-green tablet each day for seven days, followed by one green tablet each day for nine days, and then one brown tablet each day for seven days.
BE SURE YOU HAVE READY AT ALL TIMES:

ANOTHER KIND OF BIRTH CONTROL (such as condoms or spermicide) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills.

An EXTRA, FULL PILL PACK.

You have a choice of which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your doctor or clinic which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember.

DAY-1 START:

Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. (This is the day you start bleeding or spotting, even if it is almost midnight when the bleeding begins.)
Place this day label strip on the tablet dispenser over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) printed on the plastic.
Take the first "active" white pill of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period.
You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, since you are starting the pill at the beginning of your period.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Females who use JOLESSA may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on data from the clinical trial of JOLESSA, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 0.8% of females during Cycle 1, 1.2% of females during Cycle 2, 3.7% of females during Cycle 3, and 3.4% of females during Cycle 4.

Because females using JOLESSA will likely have scheduled bleeding only 4 times per year, rule out pregnancy at the time of any missed menstrual period.

After discontinuation of JOLESSA, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

5.10 Depression

Carefully observe females with a history of depression and discontinue JOLESSA if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of COCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited.

Behavioural logistic regression

To quantify the dynamics of evidence accumulation, behavioural data was analysed using another logistic regression. Importantly, in equations (5) and (7) we quantified the rat's weighting of evidence using a single number, because we considered the generative rates — that is, the expected strength of location and frequency evidence on a given trial. Now, we seek instead to quantify how these weights vary throughout stimulus presentation, by taking advantage of the knowledge of the exact pulse timing. For each rat, data across all sessions was compiled into a single vector of choices (right versus left), and two matrices detailing the pulse information presented on every trial. More specifically, the choice vector was parameterized as a binary vector (right = 1; left = 0), with dimensionality N, where N is the total number of valid trials. Pulse information was split into location evidence and frequency evidence, and was binned into 26 bins with 50-ms width. For a given bin, the amount of location evidence was computed as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of right and the number of left pulses, and was compiled in a location pulse matrix X L with dimensionality N × 26. Similarly, frequency evidence was computed as the logarithm of the ratio between high-frequency and low-frequency pulses, and was compiled into a frequency pulse matrix X F with dimensionality N × 26. We chose to use the logarithm of the ratio instead of the difference because it provided a better fit to cross-validated data. To quantify the impact on choices of evidence presented at different time points we fit a logistic regression, where the probability of choosing right at trial k was given bywhereindicates the location evidence at time t on trial k, indicates the frequency evidence at time t on trial k, indicates the location weight at time t, indicates the frequency weight at time t, and β indicates the bias to one particular side. Weights were fit using ridge regression, and the ridge regularizer was chosen to optimally predict cross-validated choices. The regression was applied separately for trials in the LOC context, and trials in the FRQ context, resulting in four sets of weights computed for each rat (Supplementary Fig. 1.2). To study how evidence was differentially integrated across the two contexts, we then computed a differential behavioural kernel. The location differential kernel was equal to the difference between the location weights computed in the LOC context, and the location weights computed in the FRQ context. Similarly, the frequency differential kernel was equal to the difference between the frequency weights computed across the two contexts.

How to Use the Blister Cards

There are two ways to start taking birth control pills, Sunday Start or Day 1 Start. Your healthcare provider will tell you which to use.

Pick the Days of the Week Sticker that starts the first day of your period. (This is the day you begin bleeding or spotting, even if it is midnight when bleeding begins.) When you have picked the right sticker, throw away the others and place the sticker on the blister card over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills.
Your blister package consists of three parts, the foil pouch, wallet, and a blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills, with the pre-printed days of the week printed above them. There are 7 gray "active" pills, 7 light blue "active" pills, 7 blue "active" pills, and 7 white "reminder" pills. Refer to the sample of the blister card below:
After taking the last white pill, start a new blister card the very next day no matter when your period started. You will be taking a pill every day without interruption. Anytime you start the pills later than directed, protect yourself by using another method of birth control until you have taken a pill a day for seven consecutive days. After taking the last white pill, start taking the first gray pill from the blister card the very next day.
Take the pills in each new package as before. Start with the gray pill on row #1 and take one pill each day, left to right, until the last white pill has been taken.

### Perirhinal firing patterns are sustained across large spatial segments of the task environment [^112Pe72P]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Whereas firing patterns in area CA1 and S1BF exhibited brief, transient peaks in firing rate along the arms, PRH neurons often showed a prolonged firing-rate change, usually stretching from the spatial decision point, just before reaching the PNR, to the PRM. These differences were already visible by comparing single trials into the left or right arm (Fig. 1c, d). A significant left–right discrimination was made by 72.2% of the total number of PRH neurons (Methods and Supplementary Table 1); PRH neurons recorded on the same tetrode were not correlated in their left–right selectivity. These discriminatory patterns were marked by an increment in firing rate on one side but not the other (Figs 1e and 2a), by a decrement on one side (Fig. 1e), or bidirectional left–right modulations (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2; firing-rate changes are denoted as increments and decrements relative to the baseline, computed during the ITI, spent in the middle lane). A minority of units showed a sustained increase or decrease in both arms, thus distinguishing the middle lane from both side loops (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). In contrast to PRH, CA1 (Figs 1f and 2c) and S1BF neurons (Fig. 2d) exhibited transient changes in firing activity. For area CA1, showing left–right discrimination in 61.2% of the total number of cells, selectivity could be ascribed to place fields located on the left or right arm. In S1BF, a similar pattern of 'punctate' responses was found in 39.7% of the total number of left–right selective cells (which however should not be considered place cells). Below we will primarily focus on the sustained nature of PRH responses.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED:

Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex.

KEEP TAKING ONE "ACTIVE" PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional.

How to Use the Blister Packs for the 28 Tablets

The blister pack comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your physician has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1. Take one active pill daily for 21 days followed by one green placebo pill daily for 7 days.
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the white to off-white pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 during the first 24 hours of your period and then take one pill each day, left to right, until the last pill in row # 3 has been taken. Once all of the active pills have been taken, proceed to row #4 and take the 7 "reminder" pills to complete the pack.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. The 21 (white to off-white) pills are "active" birth control pills. The 7 green pills are inactive; their purpose is to help make your pill-taking schedule simple and easy to remember.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. Always start with the white to off-white pills in row #1. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:

Further than this, we refine the above models by combining task variables in the logistic regression modelof choice probabilityagain based on the choice variableif choice is right, 0 if choice is left (Fig. 2C). We included the following trial-by-trial regressors: expected value of left and right offersand(computed as); magnitudesand; risk, or variance of left/right offers, and(computed as); order of offers presentation(if first offer is left, −1 first offer is right); and fraction of time looking at right screen side. To compare the magnitudes of the regressors, we normalizedandto their maximum value across all trials and sessions, and in both subjects, so for the analyses on the whole data set their trial-by-trial values ranged within unitary values (in the set [0, 1]). Comparisons between various logistic regression models of the choice probabilityand choiceprediction accuracy over-fold cross-validation data subsets are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. Results for the regression of, andare reported in Supplementary Table ST3. Results are also shown separately for the two subjects (Supplementary Fig. S3A). To test the effect of the fraction of looking time on the choice, we added to the previous logistic regression model the fractions of looking at the right side in each of the following relevant task epochs: offer 1, delay 1, offer 2, delay 2 (Fig. 2D), showing thatin delay 2 has significant impact on the choice (, FDR corrected via Benjamini & Hochbergmethod) even when other regressors are included. We performed an additional analysis by redefining the looking timesandas the total amount of time when the gaze of the subjects is inside the physical locations of the offers (or when they are left empty) (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The locations of the visual stimuli are: left side, horizontal coordinates −7.5 ± 1.5 cm; right side, horizontal coordinates +7.5 ± 1.5 cm; Left and right sides: vertical coordinates between ± 6 cm. This allowed us to determine whether gaze spatial precision is important for the encoding of the stimulus (gazing to the offer vs looking to the screen side where the offer was located). We find no qualitative difference in our results when using screen side vs offer looking times (Supplementary Fig. S3B; compare with Fig. 2C).

Molecular breast imaging (MBI) imaging — acquisition views, timing, and labeling: Imaging may begin within 5 min of injection. Planar imaging should be acquired in 2 standard views: craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO), and for single-head systems the CC view is with the detector under the breast and the MLO view with the detector at approximately 45° oblique on the lateral side of the breast; if needed, additional views may be acquired. Typical image acquisition time is between 7 to 10 min per view, and for MBI detectors with 1.6 mm or 2.5 mm detector elements, it is suggested to select an acquisition time that will achieve at least 30 counts per pixel or 50 counts per pixel, respectively, in areas of normal breast tissue. Images should be labeled with laterality ("left" or "right"), and Radioactive Co-57 markers may be used.

### Left-right-alternating theta sweeps in entorhinal-hippocampal maps of space [^114FfQ9R]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Source data

Sweeps were counted and measured by a sequence-detection procedure that looked for near-linear trajectories of decoded positions spanning at least four successive time bins of the theta cycle, with analysis restricted to locomotion periods (more than 15 cm s −1). Sweeps were detected in all 16 animals with recording sites in the MEC or parasubiculum (Fig. 1b). The number of identified sweeps increased linearly with the number of recorded cells and the number of spikes recorded per theta cycle (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Sweeps were detected in 72.9 ± 5.8% (mean ± s.e.m.) of the theta cycles in recordings with more than 1,000 cells (3 rats). In the full sample (16 rats, mean of 769 cells), sweeps were detected in 48.0 ± 5.2% of theta cycles. Sweep directions alternated from side to side across theta cycles in all rats (Fig. 1b, c and Extended Data Fig. 3c, d), with left–right–left or right–left–right alternation occurring in 79.8 ± 2.24% (mean ± s.e.m.) of successive sweep triplets, significantly more often than when sweep directions were shuffled (61.1 ± 0.2%; higher than the 99.9th percentile in all animals). Alternation was also significant with wider windows (more than three theta cycles; Extended Data Fig. 3i). Sweeps were directed forwards at an angle of 23.9 ± 2.7° (mean ± s.e.m. across 16 animals) to either side of the animal's head direction (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 3c, d), approaching around 30° to either side in the animals with most cells (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The average length of a sweep was 22.5 ± 1.4 cm (mean ± s.e.m.). Left–right alternating sweeps were preserved when other decoding methods were used (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Video 1).

3 RESULTS

Sixty‐four experiments (44 × right hand MNS; 20 × left hand MNS) from 48 subjects (16 of 44 participants for right hand MNS also participated in left hand MNS; 4 participants were only analyzed for left hand MNS) with distinguishable SI activation and NVC responses and data from 143 channels in total (106 left hemisphere; 37 right hemisphere) were included in the time‐course analysis. In 16 subjects, the experiment was carried out for both sides (right and left hand MNS) and delivered discernible hemodynamic SI responses contralaterally for both sides. Figure 4 illustrates the number of channels with functional hemoglobin changes during right (a) and left (b) hand MNS. The additional data from left hand MNS were used to assess functional imaging but were not included in the time course analysis to avoid a statistical bias since these data were not obtained from independent samples.

2.5.2 Laterality index

The second tau‐PET outcome we defined as asymmetry in the temporal meta‐ROI computed as a LI. The index was formulated as the difference between the left and right hemispheres normalized to the average signal in the left and right hemispheres, as was done in, for example, whereis the SUVR of brain region i and N is the total number of brain regions used. To make the LI specific for the Braak I‐IV composite, only brain regions in Braak I‐IV were used for i, and N. A negative LI represents more tau in the right hemisphere than the left and vice versa. Because the index was normalized to the total amount of tau load in the Braak I‐IV composite, a more clinically relevant and dispersed distribution was achieved when including only individuals categorized as tau‐positive (Figure 1A, B). See Figure 1C for examples of symmetric and asymmetric tau‐PET scans in this ROI. For classification tasks, a lower and upper threshold of the composite was computed in the BF2 training cohort as the mean value plus/minus two standard deviations in the tau‐negative group: –7.61 and 7.27. Tau‐positive participants were divided into three corresponding classes: right‐asymmetric (LI < –7.61), left‐asymmetric (LI > 7.27), or symmetric (–7.61 < LI < 7.27).

Right sided stations vs. left sided station

Right sided stations were present for Stations 2, 4, 8, and 9 whereas left ones included Stations 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. When assuming that the total number of expected LN to be at least 248 (4 lymph node stations in 62 cadavers) in the total, we were able to detect 179 (72.1%) LN on the right side. In contrast, the expected number of LN was to be at least 372 for the left side; however, we dissected 277 (74.4%) LN from the left side. There was a statistically insignificant difference between the number of the LN at each side (p:0,748). The mean of the weight of right sided LN were 0,90 ± 1,39gr and 0,66 ± 2,15 gr. for the left side which was not statistically significant (p:0,45). On the other hand, mean of the diameter of the LN was significantly different between sides as 14,16 ± 7,41 mm on the right side vs. 12,85 ± 5,68 mm on the left (p: 0,045). Histopathologic dissection revealed a mean number of 2,92 ± 1,95 LN on the right side and 2,48 ± 1,56 LN on the left side (p:0,010). As a result, weight of lymph nodes with respect to side of localization were not different at each side. The right sided lymph nodes were found to be longer in diameter and more in number than left sided ones (p < 0.05) [Table 2].

In implementation of this data to the clinical practice, we have analyzed the possible number of nodes to be dissected during a systematic mediastinal lymph node assessment with respect to side. We compared the stations 2R, 4R, 7, 8, and 9 of the right side to stations with 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the left side. We found out that 12 lymph nodes should be dissected on right systematic MLND and 11 lymph nodes would be dissected on left systematic MLND. Thus, systematic mediastinal nodal dissection on both sides demonstrated statistically indifferent number of nodes (Table 3).

### Holographic colour prints for enhanced optical security by combined phase and amplitude control [^115E2WBJ]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Fabrication process for holographic colour pixels. a In the direct laser writing exposure process, a 780 nm femtosecond pulsed IR laser beam is focused into a liquid puddle of negative-tone photoresist. At the focal point of the laser spot, the UV-sensitive photoresist is cross-linked by two-photon polymerisation and becomes solid. (Unexposed photoresist remains as a liquid and is later washed away during development.) The laser spot is translated in three dimensions (x, y, and z) according to the sequence in b to create complex structures. Resolution in the z -direction is not limited by the axially elongated shape of the point spread function as it is determined by the positioning accuracy of the laser spot. b Process flow for fabricating a holographic colour pixel using direct laser writing: (1) Blocks are created by rastering the laser spot to fill a square in the xy -plane with a continuous line exposure (hatching); (2) Step 1 is optionally repeated at higher z -positions to give thicker blocks (slicing); (3) Pillar arrays are created by point exposures, where the diameter is controlled by the exposure dose; (4) Step 3 is optionally repeated at higher z -positions to give taller pillars. Block thickness and pillar height are controlled in Steps 2 and 4 by overlapping multiple layers of exposures along the z -direction. A full holographic colour print is made by patterning an array of many pixels with different block thicknesses and pillar dimensions

The area to be patterned was split into a square grid of 120 × 120 μm 2 write-fields based on the maximum undistorted field of view of the microscope objective. The write-fields were written sequentially and stitched together by successive translations of the stage on which the substrate was mounted. In each write-field, we grouped blocks of the same thickness and performed the writing sequence in Fig. 6b for each group in ascending order of thickness. Within each group of blocks, all blocks were patterned before their pillars were patterned. We chose to group the blocks by thickness instead of spatial coordinate to minimise patterning time, as refocusing in the z -direction is much slower than lateral scanning in the xy -plane. The total writing time for a 1.44 mm square print (480 × 480 array of 3 μm pixels) was 6–8 h.

### Topical eflornithine hydrochloride improves the effectiveness of standard laser hair removal for treating pseudofolliculitis barbae: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^117PFRVd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) significantly impacts the military population, especially deployed personnel.

Objective

This study was designed to determine whether the addition of topical eflornithine to hair laser treatment would improve efficacy in treating PFB.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, paired (right and left neck) comparison study examining a combination of eflornithine and hair laser versus placebo and hair laser for the treatment of PFB. In all, 27 male patients with clinical PFB were treated with a long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser with an energy fluence of 25 to 30 J/cm(2), a pulse duration of 20 to 30 milliseconds, and a 10-mm spot size to the entire bearded neck region. The laser treatment was performed every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. Between laser treatments, patients applied eflornithine and placebo creams twice daily to opposite sides of the bearded neck region. The number of hairs and inflammatory papules were counted bilaterally at each visit.

Results

The eflornithine side had a statistically significant decrease in the number of hairs and inflammatory papules compared with the placebo side. At 16 weeks, the eflornithine side had a median hair reduction of 99.5% from baseline (range 48.5%-100.0%), whereas the placebo side had an 85.0% median hair reduction from baseline (range 50.5%-94.5%), P less than .001.

Limitations

Patients were not followed up beyond 16 weeks.

Conclusion

The addition of topical eflornithine to hair laser treatment decreased hairs and inflammatory papules faster when compared with hair laser therapy alone in the treatment of PFB.

### Nested neuronal dynamics orchestrate a behavioral hierarchy across timescales [^113PC8vk]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Polar histogram statistics

We tested the significance of the distributions in Figures 1 F, 5 D–5G, 7 G, and 7H using resampling. We determined the probability of obtaining a distribution as skewed as the real one by chance. For each half-cycle (Figures 1 F, 7 G, and 7H) or full cycle (Figures 5 D–5G) from which the real data had been extracted, we randomly selected one phase, to generate a random distribution of phases of the same number as the real distribution. Because peaks were detected using a parameter delta for Figures 1 F, 7 G, and 7H, we restricted the time points that could be selected to those where peaks could possibly have been found (i.e. those at least delta away from the previous peak). We binned the data in the same manner as the real data and quantified the absolute difference, bin-by-bin, between the resampled distribution and the all-phases distribution, which was calculated using the same phases from which the random data was selected. These bin-by-bin absolute differences were summed to give a total difference between the resampled data and the all-phases distribution as a measure of sample distribution skewness. This procedure was repeated 10⁶ times and the skewness of the real distribution was measured the same way. The p value is the fraction of randomly sampled distributions that were at least as skewed as the actual distribution.

Significance between forward (Figure 5 F) and reverse (Figure 5 G) SMD peak distributions were determined by resampling independently for each SMD. The reverse distribution contained fewer peaks than the forward distribution, so we randomly selected, from the forward distribution, 10⁶ samples of the same size as the reverse distribution. We binned the data in the same manner as the real data and quantified, bin-by-bin, the absolute difference between the resampled and real forward distribution. These bin-by-bin absolute differences were summed to give a total difference. The same procedure was done to measure the difference between the forward and reversal distributions, and the p value is the fraction of randomly sampled forward distributions that differed from the actual forward distribution at least as much as the reversal distribution did.

### Improvement of medical judgments by numerical training in patients with multiple sclerosis [^115fkL3U]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychological background assessment

Tests assessed logical reasoning, response inhibition, verbal attention span, verbal working memory and mental complex calculation (see Appendix S1, online only). Participants also responded to a questionnaire on anxiety and depression symptoms. Additionally, they performed two ratio‐processing tasks in which they were, for example, required to convert percentages or compare proportions. The percentage of total correct answers in both tasks was submitted to analysis.

Framing task

This task contained 20 statements about the success of fictive medications 6. Participants were informed that medications were used for the treatment of mild diseases like a common cold and were asked to evaluate them on a 7‐point color‐based scale from negative (left side, red colored) to positive (right side, green colored). Answers were recorded by the examiner by associating a number to each point (from 1, left‐most point to 7, right‐most point). Medications were described using either positive (e.g. effective in 84% of cases) or negative (e.g. ineffective in 16% of cases) terms. Performance on the framing task (framing effect) was measured as the difference between scores given to positively framed items (n = 10) and negatively framed items (n = 10). A score difference above zero indicates that positively framed items are evaluated more positively than negatively framed items. We also computed a measure of changes in performance over time specific to the numerical training as 'Framing effect at T1 minus framing effect at T2' for the participants assigned to training order A and 'Framing effect at T2 minus framing effect at T3' for the participants assigned to training order B. This measure was used in the correlation analysis.

Numerical training

In the first two sessions, participants had to link percentages and frequencies to pictographs and to convert frequencies to percentages and vice versa. In the third session, they performed comparison tasks with symbolic (frequencies, percentages) and non‐symbolic (pictographs) representations. In the fourth session, tasks required the comparison of decimals and fractions and the conversion of decimals into fractions and vice versa. In the last session, participants had to compute discounted prices (see Appendix S1, online only).

Control training

In each of five sessions, participants received one page of text to read 14, followed by eight multiple‐choice questions to probe text comprehension. Texts contained either no numerical information or integers (e.g. 34) but no ratio numbers.

### Regional cerebral correlates of global motion perception: evidence from unilateral cerebral brain damage [^115E3a5F]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

We used a psychophysical task to measure sensitivity to motion direction in 50 stroke patients with unilateral brain lesions and 85 control subjects. Subjects were asked to discriminate the overall direction of motion in dynamic stochastic random dot displays in which only a variable proportion of the spots moved in a single direction while the remainder moved randomly. Behavioural and neurophysiological evidence shows that the middle temporal (MT/V5) and middle superior temporal (MST) areas in the macaque monkey are indispensably involved in the perception of this type of motion. In human subjects too, lesions in the same region disrupt performance on this task. Here we assessed more extensively the correlation between direction sensitivity for global motion and the anatomical locus of the lesion. Thresholds for perceiving the direction of global motion were impaired in the visual field contralateral to the lesion in patients with lesions in the occipitoparietal and parietotemporal areas involving the human analogue of areas MT/V5 and MST, but not by lesions in the occipito-temporal or anterior frontal areas. Patients with lesions involving the anterior temporal or parietal lobes displayed poor performance for stimuli presented in either visual field, which is consistent with the large and bilateral receptive fields in these areas in monkeys. The perception of global motion was also more impaired in the centripetal than the centrifugal direction in the hemifield contralateral to the MT/V5 lesion. Surprisingly, thresholds were normal in all patients when the displays contained static but not dynamic visual noise, suggesting that their deficit reflects an inability to filter out dynamic noise. Although frequent repeated testing of some patients whose lesion involved the human homologue of MT was accompanied by an improvement in performance, this was no greater than in other patients who received training on different motion tasks.

### Species-specific gamete recognition initiates fusion-driving trimer formation by conserved fusogen HAP2 [^1112M97m]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cell wall loss assay

The ability of gametes to lose their cell walls upon mixing, which is a measure of ciliary adhesion-induced signaling and gamete activation, was determined as described. Briefly, plus and minus gametes (5 ×10 7 cells/ml in N-free medium) were mixed for 10 min, aliquots were added to 1.6 volumes of ice-cold N-free medium containing 0.075% Triton-X 100 and 5 mM EDTA, briefly vortexed, subjected to centrifugation (8700 × g for 30 s), and the OD435 of the supernatant was determined immediately using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The OD435 of a sample of similarly treated gametes that had first been disrupted by sonication (three times for 5 s each on ice (Microson XL sonicator) was used as a measure of 100% cell wall loss.

Mating structure adhesion

After mixing equal numbers of plus and minus gametes (2×10 7 cells/ml in N-free medium) for 10 min, cells were fixed by adding an equal volume of 5% glutaraldehyde. Ciliary adhesions were disrupted by gently pipetting cells 10 times with a 1 mL pipette tip. The numbers of cells in pairs per 200 cells for each sample were determined using phase-contrast microscopy (Zeiss).

Gamete fusion

Plus and minus gametes in equal numbers were mixed for 5 min, fixed with an equal volume of 5% glutaraldehyde, and the percent of single cells that had fused to form quadri-ciliated zygotes was determined (2 × number of quadri-ciliated cells/([2 × number of quadri-ciliated cells + number of single gametes] × 100). At least 200 cells were counted for each sample.

Quantification and statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean ± SD and were analyzed by Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-test were utilized to analyze the significance of differences among different groups.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1172tDwu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

KEEP TAKING ONE "ACTIVE" PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional.

How to Use the Blister Packs for the 28 Tablets

The blister pack comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your physician has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1. Take one active pill daily for 21 days followed by one green placebo pill daily for 7 days.
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the white to off-white pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 during the first 24 hours of your period and then take one pill each day, left to right, until the last pill in row # 3 has been taken. Once all of the active pills have been taken, proceed to row #4 and take the 7 "reminder" pills to complete the pack.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. The 21 (7 white to off-white, 7 light peach, 7 peach) pills are "active" birth control pills. The 7 green pills are inactive; their purpose is to help make your pill-taking schedule simple and easy to remember.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. Always start with the white to off-white pills in row #1. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING YOUR WALLET

Please Read Me!

□ Sunday Start

or

□ Day 1 Start

There are two ways to start taking birth control pills: Sunday Start or Day 1 Start.

Your healthcare provider will tell you which to use.

Save these instructions.

1 If this is the first time you are taking birth control pills, or if you have not taken birth control pills for 10 days or more, your first step is to wait until the first day you get your menstrual period. Then, follow these instructions for either Sunday Start or Day 1 Start.

2 When you get your period:

▪ You will use a Sunday Start if your doctor told you to take your first pill on a Sunday. Take pill "1" on the Sunday after your period starts. If your period starts on a Sunday, take pill "1" that day.

▪ You will use a Day 1 Start if your doctor told you to take pill "1" on the first day of your period.

3 Set the day:

▪ Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. Place this day label strip over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) pre-printed on the wallet (Refer figure below).

4. Remove pill "1" by pushing down on the pill. The pill will come out through a hole in the back of the strip.

5. Swallow the pill. You will take one pill each day. If you use a Sunday Start and you are taking the pill for the FIRST TIME, YOU MUST USE A BACK-UP METHOD OF BIRTH CONTROL FOR THE FIRST 7 DAYS. If you use a Day 1 Start, you are protected from becoming pregnant as soon as you take your first pill.

6. Wait 24 hours to take your next pill. Continue to take one pill each day until all the pills have been taken.

7. Take your pill at the same time every day. It is important to take the correct pill each day and not miss any pills. To help you remember, take your pill at the same time as another daily activity, like turning off your alarm clock or brushing your teeth.

8. When your wallet is empty. You will start a new wallet on the day after pill "28".

9. THE FIRST PILL IN EVERY WALLET WILL ALWAYS BE TAKEN ON THE SAME DAY OF THE WEEK, NO MATTER WHEN YOUR NEXT PERIOD STARTS.

### The ALT-70 cellulitis model maintains predictive value at 24 and 48 hours after presentation [^113zUj9v]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "ALT-70 score for cellulitis" for cellulitis, skin abscess and animal bites.

The ALT-70 is a clinical prediction rule for cellulitis. It is used to differentiate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis in adult patients presenting with lower extremity redness. The acronym ALT-70 stands for Age (over 70), Lesion characteristics (asymmetry, well-demarcated border), Temperature (37.9°C or higher), and White blood cell count (more than 10,000 cells/mm³). Each of these four factors is assigned a score, and the total score is used to predict the likelihood of true cellulitis. This calculator is particularly useful in emergency departments and outpatient settings to guide treatment decisions and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. It should not be used in patients with known skin infections other than cellulitis, or in patients with skin changes due to chronic conditions like venous insufficiency or lymphedema.

The ALT-70 score for cellulitis is a tool designed to assess the likelihood of cellulitis in patients by considering four key clinical factors. Each factor is rated with a specific point value, and the total score informs the probability of cellulitis.

You input four true or false answers related to these clinical factors:

- Presence of asymmetric skin abnormalities
- Age of 70 years or older
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more

The scoring for these factors is as follows:

- Asymmetric skin abnormalities contribute 3 points
- Age of 70 years or older adds 2 points
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more adds 1 point
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more also adds 1 point

To compute the ALT-70 score, you sum the points of all true responses, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 7.

Interpreting the score:

- A score of 0 to 2 suggests a low probability of cellulitis. It's advisable to explore other diagnoses.
- A score between 3 and 4 indicates an intermediate probability and suggests consulting a specialist for further evaluation.
- A score from 5 to 7 implies a high probability of cellulitis, for which initiating treatment may be recommended.

### Clock drawing: analysis in a retirement community [^116iZWm4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that performance on a clock-drawing test in a mailed survey to an older cohort is associated with known and potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease.

Design

The Leisure World Cohort Study is an ongoing study, begun in 1981, of nearly 14,000 older adults. In November 1992, the 8,406 living cohort members were mailed a follow-up questionnaire.

Setting

Leisure World Laguna Hills, a southern California retirement community.

Participants

The study population is a predominantly white, well-educated, upper-middle-class community; approximately two-thirds are women. Data from 4,843 cohort members (mean age 80 years; range 52–101) were analyzed.

Measurements

The questionnaire included a clock-drawing task: a predrawn circle 3 1/4 inches (8.3 cm) in diameter was provided with instructions "In the circle below, draw in the numbers as on a clock face. Make no erasures". Clocks were scored on 7 items: all numbers 1–12 present without adding extra or omitting numbers, sequencing of numbers, position of numbers, orientation of numbers to circle, consistent number style (either Arabic or Roman), tilt of numbers, and superfluous marks. A total clock score was calculated by summing the number of correct individual items (0–7). We also classified individuals as cognitively impaired by a previously suggested method: individuals were affected if they did not have three numbers drawn in the upper left quadrant of the clock face.

Results

Ninety percent or more of the participants across all ages placed the numbers 1 to 12 on their clocks without omissions or additions; 35% completed the clock drawing without error. The mean total clock scores decreased with each successive 5-year age group in both men and women. Regression analysis indicated a significant effect for age (b = -0.15, P < .0001), education (b = 0.05, P = 0.0001), smoking (b = 0.13, P = 0.03), and female gender (b = -0.05, P = 0.05) and a marginally significant effect of nonrheumatoid arthritis (b = 0.05, P = 0.07) on total clock score. No other measured variable had a significant effect. Cognitively impaired individuals were more likely to be female and older. After adjusting for age and gender, they were also more likely to be hypertensive and to have taken blood pressure medication and less likely to be college graduates, have glaucoma or arthritis, and to have taken vitamin supplements.

Conclusion

The clock-drawing task is an appealing measure of cognitive function for large epidemiological studies because it is a simple, self-administered test that is easily adapted to mail surveys and correlates with more-detailed and more-time-consuming cognitive screens. Although it is relatively free of influence by language, cultural, or ethnic factors, our study shows that even in a highly educated population, clock drawing is influenced by educational level and other known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Thus a clock-drawing task may help predict cognitive frailty and future disability in older people. Such determination can direct high-risk individuals to earlier diagnosis, potential therapies, and better management.

### Motor cortex activity predicts response alternation during sensorimotor decisions [^111nF7wu]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Behavioural task

On each trial, participants had to decide whether coherent motion was present in centrally presented dynamic random dot pattern (random dot kinematogram, RDK) and to report their percept (yes/no) by button-press with the left or the right index finger (Fig. 1a, 2-alternative forced choice). The choice- response mapping was newly assigned on each trial by a colour cue (red or green). For the main and control task, this choic–response cue was presented after or before the stimulus, respectively. For temporal symmetry, an irrelevant cue (blue) was presented before or after the stimulus for the main and control task, respectively. Each trial started with a 1.5 s fixation period, followed by the first 0.25 s cue period, a blank 1 s delay, 2 s of stimulus presentation, another 1 s delay, the second 0.25 s cue period, another 1s delay and a brief (33 ms) dimming of the fixation spot, which served as the go-cue to respond. The mean (across subjects) median +/−5/95 percentile (within subject) response times were 0.63 +/− 0.37/1.42 s and 0.62 +/− 0.35/1.38 s for the main and control experiments, respectively. There was no significant difference of response times between right- and left-hand responses for the main or control experiment (both P > 0.05; permutation test, n = 20). 250 ms after the response, a brief (100 ms) visual feedback was presented centrally (red or green circle; 2.1 degree diameter; green: correct, red: incorrect). The following ITI was controlled by the participants through their fixation behaviour. The experiment was paused as long as participants did not fixate the central fixation spot or closed their eyes. The pause was indicated by presentation of thin red lines at the edges of the screen. This resulted in variable inter trial intervals with a median duration of 1,290 ms. Participants were instructed to blink only during the ITI. Subjects completed 240 trials of the main task and 240 trials of the control task in two consecutive recording sessions. In addition, participants performed 240 trials (cued task), for which participants did not have to make a decision about the stimulus but received explicit instructions which button to press on each trial. Furthermore, for another 80 trials (passive task) participants had to press no button at all, but were instructed to passively view the stimulus. Cued and passive task trials were not analysed for the present study. All tasks were randomly interleaved. Before the recording, participants practiced the task for at least 45 min.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Longitudinal effects of herpesviruses on multiple cognitive outcomes in healthy elderly adults [^112zGKYT]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

At the age of 75 years, a trained research nurse administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B, and the four brief tests of the 7-minute screening test (7MS) – enhanced free and cued recall, Benton temporal orientation, verbal fluency, and clock drawing. Only the MMSE and the TMT-A and -B were assessed at the age of 80 years. The MMSE is used to assess individuals' visuospatial, language, concentration, working memory, memory recall, and orientation abilities. Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive ability. The revised Swedish version of the MMSE was administered according to a previously established procedure. The TMT is used to assess executive function, related mainly to the speed and fluidity of cognitive abilities. It showed the greatest prodromal decline among 15 cognitive parameters in persons later diagnosed with AD in a previous study, indicating its relevance for the measurement of abilities affected in prodromal AD. For the TMT-A, participants are timed while drawing lines between 25 encircled numbers in numeric order on paper; for the TMT-B, numbers and letters are alternated, offering a greater challenge, primarily in terms of speed. The numbers of seconds required to complete the tests were recorded (TMT-B maximum = 600 s) and treated as continuous variables. The 7MS was developed to distinguish patients with probable AD from cognitively healthy individuals, and has been validated also for all-cause dementia. It consists of four brief tests — enhanced free and cued recall, Benton temporal orientation, verbal fluency, and clock drawing — which assess memory, orientation, expressive language, and visuospatial ability, respectively. In the enhanced recall test, individuals are instructed to remember 16 items presented 4 at a time after a distraction activity, with (cued recall) or without (free recall) semantic cues. The number of freely or cued recalled items is counted, with total scores ranging from 0 to 16. In the verbal fluency test, individuals are instructed to generate unique examples of as many animals as possible in 1 min. The score is the total number of examples provided. In the Benton temporal orientation test, participants are asked about the current month, date, year, day of the week, and time of day. Responses are scored relative to the degree of error: 5 points for each month off (maximum = 30), 10 points for each year off (maximum = 60), 1 point for each date off (maximum = 15), 1 point for each weekday off (maximum = 3), and 1 point for each 30-min deviation (maximum = 5). The maximum score is 113, indicating low performance. In the clock drawing test, participants draw the face of a clock with all numbers and the hands indicating "twenty to four". One point each is given for drawing the numbers 1–12, placing them in the correct order and locations, drawing two hands, indicating the correct hour and minute, and making the hour hand shorter than the minute hand. The maximum score is 7. Total 7MS scores (representing the log-odds of having AD) were calculated using Solomon et al.'s formula: total score = 35.59–1.303×ECR – 1.378×VF+3.298×BTO – 0.838×CD, where ECR, VF, BTO, and CD are the scores for enhanced cued recall, verbal fluency, Benton temporal orientation, and clock drawing, respectively.

### Glomeruli count and arterial injury in real-time ultrasound-guided needle kidney biopsy specimens: adequacy of three approaches for pig kidneys [^1123Ey4C]. American Journal of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Real-time ultrasound-guided percutaneous kidney biopsy is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning; nonetheless, the optimal puncture approach has yet to be established. In vivo, performing different approaches on the same patient at once is not possible. This study aimed to determine the impact of different approaches on the number of obtained glomeruli and their potential to cause arterial injury using pig kidneys, which are similar to humans.

Methods

A total of 120 pig kidneys (60 right-sided kidneys and 60 left-sided kidneys) for research were obtained from a slaughterhouse. The specimens were collected from the lower pole on the sagittal plane of the kidney using three different approaches on the same kidney: caudocranial approach, caudal to cranial; craniocaudal approach, cranial to caudal; and vertical approach, through the surface cortex. Five blinded pediatric nephrologists assessed the number of glomeruli and arterial injuries.

Results

Overall, 360 specimens were collected from the kidneys through biopsy using a 16-gauge needle (mean vertical kidney length, 11.2 ± 0.7 cm; mean depth, 3.47 ± 0.23 cm). No significant difference in the incidence of arterial injury was observed between the three approaches (caudocranial vs. craniocaudal vs. vertical approaches: 78% vs. 87% vs. 87%, p = 0.14). In contrast, the vertical approach retrieved significantly more glomeruli than the caudocranial and craniocaudal approaches (caudocranial approach: 7.5 ± 2.8, craniocaudal approach: 7.8 ± 2.7, and vertical approach: 8.9 ± 3.3, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Considering its efficacy and safety profile, the vertical approach may be preferred, as more glomeruli can be obtained without increasing the incidence of arterial injury. Although the results cannot be directly extrapolated to humans due to the differences between species, they still offer important insights into the characteristics of each approach.

### Clinical features and natural history of the acute idiopathic enlarged blind spot syndrome [^114asohb]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the clinical pattern and natural history of patients with the symptom of an enlarged blind spot.

Design

A retrospective case series. Twenty-one patients were collected from a neuro-ophthalmologic practice during the period January 14, 1983, to July 1, 1996, and four consecutive patients were added from three vitreoretinal practices during the period April 14, 1986, to June 7, 1999.

Participants

Twenty-six eyes of 25 patients were studied at onset and at repeat visits from 1 year and 7 months to 15 years and 6 months later.

Methods

The first visit was composed of a complete neuro-ophthalmologic examination with fundus photos and fluorescein angiography in 12 of the 26 eyes. Follow-up examination consisted of an interval history, ophthalmologic examination, visual fields, fundus photographs, fluorescein angiograms in eight eyes, indocyanine green angiograms in seven eyes, and multifocal electroretinograms (mfERG) in both eyes of seven patients.

Main Outcome Measures

The major outcome measures were onset and long-term visual field characteristics, disc and peripapillary features, association with other chorioretinal diseases, and mfERG features.

Results

Twenty-one eyes had clinical features of chorioretinal syndromes, which are usually associated with an enlarged blind spot. Five eyes were examined too late after onset to expect such features. The visual field defect regressed in all but 12 eyes but never to an unequivocally normal-sized blind spot. Four of the 12 had chorioretinal scarring that corresponded to the permanent field defect. Twenty-one of 26 eyes had peripapillary scarring. The peripapillary scarring appeared the same no matter what the associated chorioretinal disease or type or size of field defect was. mfERG testing of seven patients at follow-up revealed first-order and second-order abnormalities long after clinical recovery, abnormalities that were bilateral even when the clinical signs had been unilateral.

Conclusions

If an eye with an enlarged blind spot is examined within 2 weeks of onset, signs of a chorioretinal disease will usually be present. Beyond that period, signs such as disc congestion, disc staining, peripapillary retinitis, foveal changes, and peripheral retinal spots may not be present. Although the patient usually becomes asymptomatic, the blind spot is slightly and permanently enlarged, and there is usually peripapillary disc scarring. mfERG testing indicates that retinal damage is more widespread, bilateral, and permanent than the visual field and clinical features would indicate. Chorioretinal syndromes that are associated with a temporal field defect have some features in common and others that are distinctive.

Retinotopic mapping

In the retinotopic mapping experiment, we mapped polar angle using a phase‐encoded stimulus very similar to that used in previous recent work by Sereno et al. [2013]. The stimulus (Fig. 2) consisted of a continuously rotating thin wedge (18 deg wide) populated with a random‐colored checkerboard with 35% luminance contrast. The checkerboard was overlaid with white dot fields moving in 500 msec periods of coherent motion that extended slightly beyond the checkerboard wedge to 21.6 deg wide (each new flow period had randomly chosen contraction/dilation and clockwise/anti‐clockwise components, dots had 50% average luminance contrast), as well as two simultaneous asynchronous streams of random objects (tiffs of single objects with a transparent background, 0.5 sec duration, 0.1 sec gap) and random black letters (0.4 sec duration, 0.1 sec gap) placed at random eccentricities; both kinds of stimuli were scaled with eccentricity to fit within the confines of the 21.6 deg wide wedge, and their centers were rotated together with the wedge. The objects had an additional random radial (inward or outward, eccentricity‐scaled) motion. This polar angle mapping stimulus was designed to evoke activation in the maximum number of lower‐level and higher‐level visual areas. The participant was presented with the periodic stimulus (64 sec per full rotation cycle, eight cycles/run). 512 second runs (four in total) alternated between clockwise and anti‐clockwise rotation of wedges. Participants were required to fixate on the center dot at all times. Additionally they were instructed to monitor for occasional numbers (among the letters) and occasional upside down objects (among the right‐side‐up objects) to maintain a high and continuous level of peripheral attention to the entire wedge during central fixation.

### Path integration maintains spatial periodicity of grid cell firing in a 1D circular track [^113YHFaH]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Grid cell activity is aligned with the track

To identify grid cells, MEC single units were first recorded while rats freely foraged in a 1.5-meter-diameter arena polarized by a white cue card attached to the wall. Of 365 well-separated MEC units, 64 were identified as robust grid cells recorded across six rats (Supplementary Figure 1, Table 1). Following recording in the circular arena, rats were confined to the 15-cm-wide peripheral rim of the arena by inserting an opaque inner wall. Although movements were restricted to the rim and therefore mostly one-dimensional, no barrier required the rat to turn about. Moreover, visibility of the cue card was limited to a region covering about 160° of arc in the circular track (supplementary information). This allowed us to analyze which coding process (allocentric, path integrated, travelled distance, or time) is used by grid cells to code the distance, and to investigate whether availability of the visual cue influences grid cell firing patterns. At the time of MEC recordings, all animals were highly familiar with both the arena and the track. Animals ran 3 laps in average, covering 42.3 m during 10 min and changing direction around 100 times in one recording session (Table 2).

Table 1
Summary of the cell distribution

Table 2
Summary of behavior in the circular track

The position of firing fields in the track did not correspond to the position of the fields in the arena (Fig. 2a, b). Distances between fields (i.e. field spacing) were highly irregular in the track, in contrast to the regular spacing observed in the arena. We first confirmed that field arrangement in the arena differed from that observed in the peripheral rim, by computing the correlation of grid cell activity in the corresponding spatial bins of the two setups (average correlation: 0.007 ± 0.026, not different from 0, one-sample t -test on Z scores, t 63 = 0.26, n.s.), indicating that grid cell activity remapped in the track.

### Online circular contrast perimetry via a web-application: establishing a normative database for central 10-degree perimetry [^116pUUAG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To establish a normative database using a central 10-degree grid pattern for the online circular contrast perimetry (OCCP) application.

Participants

Fifty participants with mean age 65 ± 13 years were selected for this study. One eye from each participant that met inclusion criteria was randomly included in the cohort.

Methods

The web-application delivered online 52-loci perimetry in a central 10-degree pattern using circular flickering targets. These targets consist of concentric sinusoidal alternating contrast rings. Users were guided by the application to the correct viewing distance and head position using in-built blind spot localization and webcam monitoring. A spinning golden star was used as the fixation target and patients performed the test in a darkened room following standard automated perimetry (SAP).

Results

The reliability rates and global indices for OCCP were similar to SAP. OCCP mean sensitivity reduced with age at a similar rate to SAP. Mean sensitivity per loci of 10-degree OCCP was greater than SAP by 1.24 log units (95% CI 1.23 to 1.26) and obeyed a physiological hill of vision. Small differences existed in mean sensitivities between OCCP and SAP which increased with increasing spot eccentricity. Mean deviation (MD) displayed good agreement between the two tests.

Conclusion

Central 10-degree online circular contrast perimetry via a computer-based application has comparable perimetric results to standard automated perimetry in a normal cohort.

### A stepwise mapping approach for localization and ablation of ectopic right, left, and septal atrial foci using electroanatomic mapping [^112ESCxp]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

We describe a new strategic stepwise mapping approach for fast and accurate identification and ablation of ectopic atrial foci using an electroanatomic mapping system.

Methods and Results

Mapping procedures started with the acquisition of four points at the superior/septal part of the tricuspid annulus. According to this activation sequence, maps were continued towards the right atrial free wall if relatively early activation was shown at the superior part of the initial map or towards the triangle of Koch and, if necessary, to the left atrium, in cases of relatively early activation at the septum. High density mapping and detailed electrogram analysis only of the target area allowed identification and ablation of 34 foci in 30 of the 32 studied consecutive patients. A small number of mapping points were sufficient within a procedure time of 90 ± 41 min for right 148 ± 68 min and for left sided foci and a total fluoroscopy time of 9.6 ± 7.2 min and 24.8 ± 16.4 min respectively. Sixteen foci were located at the right free wall, eight at the left free wall, and 10 at the right or left side of the septum.

Conclusion

Strategic electroanatomic mapping with fast identification of the area of tachycardia origin and high density mapping only of this target area allowed fast and successful localization and ablation of right and left free wall and septal ectopic atrial foci.
