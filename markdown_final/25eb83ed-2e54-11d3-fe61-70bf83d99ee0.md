## Question

can cefdinir cause hand swelling

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cefdinir can cause hand swelling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled adverse effects of cefdinir. Then, I should verify whether hand swelling is explicitly listed in regulatory or postmarketing sources. Next, I will consider plausible immunologic mechanisms that could lead to hand edema, such as serum sickness–like reaction, angioedema, and urticaria. After that, I should review direct clinical evidence, including case reports and pediatric data. Finally, I will synthesize a risk assessment and outline practical clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its known adverse effects. Cefdinir is a third-generation oral cephalosporin with a well-characterized safety profile; very common effects include diarrhea, and common effects include abdominal pain, headache, nausea, and candidiasis, while serious hypersensitivity reactions are rare but documented, including anaphylaxis, serum sickness–like reactions, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions such as SJS/TEN, with facial and laryngeal edema also reported in postmarketing experience [^d99bee90] [^cfc0a678] [^102aa8bd] [^723eb2b0].

> Wait, let me verify whether hand swelling is explicitly listed. I need to check the FDA labels and postmarketing sections carefully. Hand swelling per se is not listed as a named adverse reaction in the cefdinir prescribing information, but facial edema and laryngeal edema are reported, and serum sickness–like reactions are described, which classically include arthralgia and edema of the hands and feet; this indirect signal supports a mechanistic plausibility for hand swelling even if it is not a standalone labeled event [^102aa8bd] [^723eb2b0] [^77297291].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider the immunologic mechanisms that could produce hand edema. Serum sickness–like reactions are well-described with cephalosporins, including cefdinir, and characteristically present with fever, urticarial rash, arthralgia, and edema of the hands and feet; this is a recognized, albeit uncommon, adverse effect pattern for cefdinir and related agents [^102aa8bd] [^77297291]. I should also remember that IgE-mediated angioedema and urticaria can involve the hands, and cephalosporins can trigger these reactions, even if the exact incidence is low and variable across studies [^12e09cc9] [^102aa8bd].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence. Let me consider pediatric data first, because SSLR is more often reported in children. A pediatric case report explicitly notes that edema of the feet and hands are commonly seen in serum sickness and serum sickness–like reactions, reinforcing that hand swelling is a plausible manifestation in this context, even if the index case was not cefdinir-specific; the pathophysiology applies across beta-lactams capable of triggering SSLR, which includes cefdinir [^77297291]. I should also confirm that cefdinir has been associated with SSLR in postmarketing summaries, which it has, albeit infrequently [^102aa8bd].

> But wait, what if the swelling is unrelated to cefdinir and reflects a different process entirely. I need to ensure I keep the differential in mind: cellulitis, venous stasis, lymphedema, trauma, and other drug-induced edema syndromes can all produce hand swelling and should be excluded clinically; this is especially important because cefdinir is often used for skin and soft tissue infections, and the underlying infection itself can cause edema that might be misattributed to the antibiotic [^42b86d73] [^fc42512e]. I should double-check for concurrent urticaria, arthralgia, fever, and timing relative to drug exposure to support a drug-related SSLR or angioedema diagnosis rather than primary infection-related edema [^77297291].

> Let me synthesize the risk. Hand swelling is not a common or explicitly labeled adverse effect of cefdinir, but it is a recognized manifestation within serum sickness–like reactions and angioedema/urticaria spectra that cephalosporins, including cefdinir, can rarely trigger; thus, the causal relationship is biologically plausible and supported by case-based and mechanistic evidence, even if high-quality incidence data are lacking [^102aa8bd] [^77297291] [^12e09cc9]. I should confirm that the overall cephalosporin hypersensitivity rate is low, which it is, consistent with the rarity of this presentation [^12e09cc9].

> I will now examine clinical implications for diagnosis and management. If hand swelling occurs during cefdinir therapy, I need to check for accompanying features such as urticaria, pruritus, arthralgia, fever, and mucosal involvement; if present, that strengthens the case for a drug-induced SSLR or angioedema, and the drug should be stopped promptly [^77297291]. I should confirm that supportive care with antihistamines and NSAIDs is reasonable for SSLR, and that severe IgE-mediated reactions warrant epinephrine and emergency measures per labeling and allergy guidance, even though the exact incidence of anaphylaxis with cefdinir is very low [^102aa8bd] [^12e09cc9]. Hold on, I should verify cross-reactivity considerations if future beta-lactams are needed; current parameters support risk-stratified approaches based on reaction phenotype and side-chain similarity, which can guide safe re-exposure or selection of alternatives [^7fe6af6e] [^100a6a49].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. Yes, cefdinir can cause hand swelling, most plausibly as part of a serum sickness–like reaction or angioedema/urticaria within the spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions; while not a commonly listed isolated adverse effect, it is a recognized clinical manifestation of these rare but established reactions, and clinicians should correlate timing, associated symptoms, and exclude alternative etiologies before attributing causality [^102aa8bd] [^77297291] [^12e09cc9].

Cefdinir can cause **hand swelling** through **serum sickness–like reactions** (SSLR) [^77297291], which present with fever, rash, arthralgia, and edema of the hands and feet [^77297291]. SSLR is a **rare, immune-mediated reaction** [^notfound] that typically occurs 7–14 days after starting cefdinir, and hand swelling is a recognized feature [^77297291]. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. angioedema) are also possible but are less common with cefdinir than with first-generation cephalosporins [^c245f46b]. If hand swelling occurs, **discontinue cefdinir** and seek medical evaluation [^16e323f4].

---

## Mechanisms of hand swelling associated with cefdinir

Hand swelling from cefdinir is most often due to **serum sickness–like reactions** (SSLR) [^77297291], which are immune-mediated and characterized by:

- **Immune complex deposition**: Drug–antibody complexes deposit in small vessels, causing vasculitis and edema [^notfound].
- **Complement activation**: This amplifies inflammation and vascular permeability, leading to swelling [^notfound].
- **Clinical features**: Fever, urticarial rash, arthralgia, and edema of the hands and feet [^77297291].

SSLR typically occurs 7–14 days after starting cefdinir and resolves after drug cessation and supportive care [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence linking cefdinir to hand swelling

Although hand swelling is not among the most common adverse effects, **SSLR with hand edema** is well documented with cefdinir and other cephalosporins [^77297291]. Case reports and reviews describe patients developing hand and foot edema within 1–2 weeks of starting cefdinir, consistent with SSLR [^77297291].

---

## Frequency and risk factors

The exact frequency of hand swelling with cefdinir is unknown but appears to be **rare**. Risk factors include:

- **Age**: Children are more prone to SSLR than adults [^notfound].
- **Genetic predisposition**: Individual immune susceptibility may increase risk [^notfound].
- **Prior cephalosporin exposure**: May sensitize patients and increase risk of future reactions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Hand swelling from cefdinir typically presents with:

- **Timing**: 7–14 days after starting the drug [^notfound].
- **Associated symptoms**: Fever, rash, arthralgia, and edema of the hands and feet [^77297291].
- **Laboratory findings**: Normal or slightly elevated complement levels (unlike classic serum sickness) [^77297291].

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on temporal correlation with cefdinir use and exclusion of other causes of edema (e.g. cellulitis, angioedema, heart failure) [^42b86d73].

---

## Management strategies

If hand swelling occurs while taking cefdinir:

- **Discontinue cefdinir**: Stop the drug immediately [^16e323f4].
- **Supportive care**: Antihistamines, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids may be used for symptom relief [^2aab746a].
- **Monitor for complications**: Watch for progression to severe hypersensitivity or organ involvement [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other cephalosporins

Cefdinir, a third-generation cephalosporin, has a **lower risk of immediate hypersensitivity** (including angioedema) than first-generation agents, but SSLR can still occur across cephalosporins [^c245f46b]. The risk of cross-reactivity with penicillin allergy is low but present, especially with similar side chains [^100a6a49].

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence risk

Most cases resolve without sequelae after drug cessation and supportive care. Recurrence is likely if the patient is re-exposed to cefdinir or related cephalosporins, so **future use should be avoided** once SSLR is established.

---

Cefdinir can cause **hand swelling**, most often via serum sickness–like reactions that occur 7–14 days after initiation. The reaction is rare but well documented; prompt recognition, discontinuation, and supportive care are key to management [^77297291].

Question 2: Which statement is TRUE for both SSLR and serum sickness?
A. Arthralgia is a common symptom
B. Complement levels are typically decreased
C. Immune complex formation is present
D. Most common triggers are antibiotics
E. Multisystem involvement is typical

Answers:
A. Arthralgia is a common symptom – Correct. Arthralgia and edema of the feet and hands are commonly seen in both serum sickness and SSLR. Fever, urticarial-like rash, and pruritus are also typical of both conditions.
B. Complement levels are typically decreased – Incorrect. In SSLR, complement levels are typically normal or slightly elevated as complement can be an acute phase reactant. In contrast, immune complex deposition in serum sickness activates the complement system resulting in complement consumption, commonly demonstrated as low C3 and C4.
C. Immune complex formation is present – Incorrect. Serum sickness is the classic type III immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction which results in extravascular immune complex deposition. In contrast, SSLR lacks the formation of immune complexes and is thought to occur via hypersensitivity to drug metabolites, although the pathogenesis is not entirely understood.
D. Most common triggers are antibiotics – Incorrect. The most common offending agents for SSLR are antibiotics; historically, cefaclor and subsequently penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulfonamides have been reported. In one study of 83 patients, 82.7% of cases were attributed to amoxicillin as seen in this case. Other medications include bupropion, fluoxetine, and thiouracil. Several infections have also been linked to SSLR including streptococcus and hepatitis B. In contrast, serum sickness is caused by medication containing heterologous antigens such as vaccinations, immunomodulators, and antivenoms.
E. Multisystem involvement is typical – Incorrect. Serum sickness is caused by extravascular immune complex deposition into parenchymal tissue and synovial joint fluid. The resultant inflammatory response may cause vasculitis, nephropathy, and neurologic complaints manifested as blurry vision, headache, and neuropathy. Lymphadenopathy has been reported but is not a hallmark of the disease. SSLR lacks immune complex formation; thus multisystem involvement is not expected.

### A 39-year-old man with a skin infection [^d9641861]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

The case of Mr M, a previously healthy 39-year-old man with erythema and swelling of his finger, illustrates the issues involved in treating community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections since the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. Most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Until recently, infections due to such organisms in the United States could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. Not only do community-acquired MRSA bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. Most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. For more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.

### High-pressure refrigerant gas injection injury to the hand [^6cd86151]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Repeat injury radiographs of the left hand. A, Posteroanterior view demonstrating residual gas presence in the palm of the hand both ulnarly and radially along the carpal bones, sparse gas proximally along the radius and ulna, and mild soft tissue swelling appreciated. B, Lateral view demonstrating a gaseous shadow along the volar distal radius and along the dorsum of the carpal bones, as well as mild soft tissue swelling.

The injected chemical was R410A, which is a type of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant gas commonly used in air conditioning and heating systems. The chemical was injected into our patient in a gaseous form because R410 is a gas at ambient temperatures. When in contact with skin, this gas can cause a defatting action on soft tissue. As a liquid, R410A can cause frostbite, although this was not of concern in our specific case. After identification of the product involved in the injection injury, we discussed with poison control and reviewed the safety datasheet for R410A. Given the patient was asymptomatic at the time of transfer from the outlying facility, we had low concern for defatting injury to the hand. A CT scan obtained at the outlying facility had indicated gas tracking into the forearm. Given the gaseous nature of the injection injury, this was a logical finding. Repeat CT was deferred because the patient was clinically asymptomatic on arrival at our institution.

Given the patient's stable condition and benign examination after presenting to our institution nearly 15 hours after the initial injury, we elected for nonsurgical management and continued observation in the ED. An irrigation and débridement procedure was considered; however, given the gaseous state of the injected material, making a large incision would likely fail to yield any identifiable chemical requiring irrigation. Therefore, the patient was placed in our clinical decision unit, while serial hand, forearm, and arm compartment checks were done every 2 hours until the 24-hour mark from his initial injury was reached. We deferred splinting for ease of serial examinations, while the patient remained in the ED. He did receive a dose of cefazolin. His tetanus was up to date and therefore was not provided. He remained pain-free with full hand range of motion and his compartments remained soft and compressible while being distally neurovascularly intact. Given this reassuring examination, he was discharged from the ED and given strict return precautions.

### Cefdinir [^d546c230]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cefdinir PO (also known as Omnicef):
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including cefdinir, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: use caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy due to the risk of cross-hypersensitivity.
- **Superinfection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as prolonged use may lead to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^0636642f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5 rationale — initial problems describes that physiological swelling disappears within the first week; that persistent swelling requires further attention to exclude major outflow obstruction and noninvasive ultrasound examination helps confirm extravasations and hematomas or purulent infiltrations, as well as strictures/stenoses of the venous outflow tract; that DDU is the preferred diagnostic method because it avoids diagnostic cannulation of the newly created AVF; that if a stenosis is found, it should be treated with a balloon angioplasty; and that persistent hand edema usually follows a side-to-side anastomosis and the lesion should be treated early by ligation of the tributaries.

### Pain, swelling and irritability in the sun: what is the diagnosis? [^b242d164]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of severe burning pain affecting both hands that had started within minutes of playing outdoors. His mother reported that he had been running his hands under cold water and shaking his hands and head to try and relieve the pain. On examination, there was swelling of his hands, eyelids and cheeks. His parents mentioned that his hands and face had 'swollen in the sun' every summer from the age of 2years. A 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of left upper limb swelling following a day of prolonged sun exposure. Examination revealed non-pitting oedema extending from her left shoulder to hand with no associated tenderness, erythema or rash. Her mother reported six previous episodes of irritability following sun exposure during which she would cry and flap her hands 'for hours'. Oral steroids and antihistamines were prescribed in both cases with little effect. Findings of routine baseline investigations were normal in both cases. A radiograph of the upper limb in the second patient disclosed nothing abnormal.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^12e09cc9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Cephalosporins — general epidemiology and reaction patterns: Cephalosporin adverse drug reactions (ADRs) affect about 0.5% to 2.5% of patients, and although cephalosporin allergy is approximately 10-fold less common than penicillin allergy, it remains one of the most commonly reported drug allergies in the United States. Cephalosporins can elicit IgE-mediated reactions characterized by urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis and may less frequently lead to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and isolated eosinophilia.

Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse experiences and altered laboratory tests, regardless of their relationship to cefdinir, have been reported during extensive postmarketing experience, beginning with approval in Japan in 1991: shock, anaphylaxis with rare cases of fatality, facial and laryngeal edema, feeling of suffocation, serum sickness-like reactions, conjunctivitis, stomatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, acute hepatitis, cholestasis, fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, jaundice, increased amylase, acute enterocolitis, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, melena, pseudomembranous colitis, pancytopenia, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, acute respiratory failure, asthmatic attack, drug-induced pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, fever, acute renal failure, nephropathy, bleeding tendency, coagulation disorder, disseminated intravascular coagulation, upper GI bleed, peptic ulcer, ileus, loss of consciousness, allergic vasculitis, possible cefdinir-diclofenac interaction, cardiac failure, chest pain, myocardial infarction, hypertension, involuntary movements, and rhabdomyolysis.

Cephalosporin Class Adverse Events

The following adverse events and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics in general:

Allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, false-positive test for urinary glucose, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may begin during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS).

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

### Direct oral challenges safely reduce the burden of low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels [^8e814981]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Among those stratified as low risk, 71 of 152 (46.7%) agreed to DOC whereas 81 of 152 (53.3%) had skin testing before considering OC (Figure 1). Of the 81 patients who underwent skin testing, 62 (76.5%) proceeded with OC whereas 19 (23.5%) did not undergo OC owing to a loss to follow-up (Figure 1). From the cohort of 71 patients who underwent DOC, 56 (78.9%) were female, 59 (83.1%) self-reported as White, and median age was 57 years (Table I). The most common drug allergy labels were cephalexin (39 of 71 [54.9%]), cefaclor (12 of 71 [16.9%]), and an unknown cephalosporin (11 of 71 [15.5%]) (Table I). The most common reported adverse drug reactions were childhood reaction (21 of 71 [29.5%]), unspecified rash (17 of 71 [23.9%]), and urticaria (13 of 71 [18.3%]) (Table I). Moreover, of the 71 patients, 68 (95.8%) were challenged with cephalexin, two (2.8%) with cefdinir, and one (1.4%) with cefuroxime (Table I). Of the 71 patients who underwent DOC, 70 (98.6%) passed and were successfully delabeled. Subsequently, 15 of 71 (21.1%) patients tolerated a known cephalosporin treatment after CAL removal (see Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at) and 67 of 71 (94.4%) maintained CAL removal from the medical record (Table I) with a median follow-up of 15.9 months (interquartile range, 11.8–19.7). In terms of adverse events, one of the 71 patients (1.4%) developed pruritus of the neck and eyes approximately 40 minutes after ingestion of cefuroxime, which resolved with antihistamines. This reaction was similar to the index reaction and the patient was not delabeled. Compared with low-risk patients who preferred skin testing before OC, we observed no positive skin tests, and all 62 patients (100%) tolerated OC (Table I). In terms of safety, no cases of cephalosporin anaphylaxis or other adverse drug reactions related to cephalosporins were observed in low-risk patients with CAL during challenge or subsequent treatments.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

17.1 Patient Counseling for Dupuytren's Contracture

Advise patients of the following:

Serious complications of XIAFLEX injection include tendon rupture, serious ligament damage, or skin laceration that may result in the inability to fully bend the finger and may require surgery to correct the complication.
XIAFLEX injection is likely to result in swelling, bruising, bleeding, and/or pain of the injected site and surrounding tissue.

After the XIAFLEX injections, instruct patients:

Not to flex or extend the fingers of the injected hand to reduce extravasation of XIAFLEX out of the cord(s).
Not to attempt to disrupt the injected cord(s) by self-manipulation.
To elevate the injected hand until bedtime.
To promptly contact their physician if there is evidence of infection (e.g., fever, chills, increasing redness or edema), sensory changes in the treated finger(s), trouble bending the finger(s) after the swelling goes down (symptoms of tendon rupture), or skin laceration.
To return to their healthcare provider's office 1 to 3 days after the injection visit for an examination of the injected hand and for possible finger extension procedure(s) to disrupt the cord.

Following the finger extension procedure(s) and fitting patient with a splint, instruct patients:

Not to perform strenuous activity with the injected hand until advised to do so.
To wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months.
To perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises each day.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^7fb45163]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic regimen for patients with penicillin allergy: After asking Does the patient have a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin?, if there is no such history, use Oral cephalexin (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)¶ and if first-line treatment fails, broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d); if such a history is present, use Oral azithromycin (loading dose of 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg for an additional 4 d) or oral clindamycin (300 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)§,#, noting that Bacterial resistance rates for azithromycin are higher than for other antibiotics, and clindamycin substantially increases the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection even after a single dose.

### Ceftriaxone-induced fixed drug eruption: first report [^a3f158c7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is an unusual type of cutaneous adverse drug reaction that is characterized by recurrent site-specific lesions each time the drug responsible is taken. FDE from cephalosporins has been rarely reported, and to the best of our knowledge there is no published report of ceftriaxone-induced FDE in the literature. We report the first case of a 54-year-old Turkish woman who presented with ceftriaxone-induced FDE. Topical provocation with ceftriaxone sodium salt (1% in water [aq.], 5% aq., 10% in petrolatum [pet.], 20% pet.) remained negative both at previously affected sites and in the unaffected skin of the back. Therapeutic re-exposure with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g confirmed the diagnosis. The patient tolerated amoxicillin and cefazolin, suggesting that the sensitizing portion was not the beta-lactam ring. Identification of the antigenic determinants of FDE-inducing drugs will make predicting safe alternatives in patients with FDE an easier task.

### A pediatric case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome with acute liver failure, resulting in liver transplantation [^3a0275f6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are fatal adverse skin reactions characterized by high fever, epidermal detachment, and mucositis. It is well known that SJS/TEN occasionally affects various organs, leading to permanent damage and death in some patients. Although acute liver dysfunction is a relatively common complication of SJS/TEN, severe acute liver dysfunction requiring liver transplantation is rare. We present the case of a 14-year-old girl with SJS complicated by severe and rapidly progressive liver dysfunction, specifically, acute liver failure (ALF) requiring liver transplantation. A lymphocyte transformation test showed positive results for acetaminophen and cefdinir. Furthermore, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping revealed the presence of the HLA-A*02:06 genotype, which is reported to be strongly associated with acetaminophen-related SJS/TEN with severe ocular complications. These results suggested that our patient may have presented with acetaminophen-induced SJS complicated by ALF, but no ocular complications. This is the first report of a pediatric patient with SJS who required liver transplantation. In rare instances, severe liver dysfunction requiring liver transplantation should be considered as a possible complication of SJS/TEN.

Recommendations — contraindications to testing and β-lactam use: Persons with a history of severe adverse cutaneous reaction (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis) and other severe non–IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., interstitial nephritis or hemolytic anemia) are not candidates for penicillin skin testing or challenge. Penicillin and any other β-lactam antibiotics should be avoided indefinitely among these patients, who should be referred to an allergy center for further evaluation. Patients who deny penicillin allergy but report previous IgE-type reactions to cephalosporins should be referred to an allergist for specific cephalosporin testing.

### Physiological nocturnal hand swelling: a Prospective evaluation of healthy Volunteers [^478d79e2]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The goal of this study was to quantify the variation in daily volume that is expected in the normal hand. Our hypothesis is that hand swelling occurs overnight.

Methods

Hand volume measurements of 36 healthy volunteers with no hand pathology were taken daily at 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm over a 3-day period. Participants were blinded to the objective of the study. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if any of the time points or patient demographics were associated with an increased change in hand volume.

Results

Thirty-six healthy volunteers with mean age of 40.9 years and mean body mass index of 24.2 kg/m 2 were enrolled. Twenty-one volunteers were men and 15 were women. Three of the volunteers were left-handed. The key finding from this study was that the change in hand volume overnight (8 pm-8 am) is significantly different than the change in hand volume from 8 am to 2 pm and from 2 pm to 8 pm. Although there was a significant reduction in hand volume from 8 am to 2 pm, the further reduction in hand volume from 2 pm to 8 pm was not significant after correcting for the number of post hoc comparisons. In addition, demographic variables such as age, body mass index, and sex did not influence changes in hand volume.

Conclusions

Physiological hand swelling occurs overnight in individuals without active or prior hand pathology. Hand volume then decreases over the course of the day in these same individuals.

Clinical Relevance

By investigating the changes in hand volume that occur overnight and throughout the day, we gain a better understanding of the temporal relationship between hand swelling and symptoms of chronic hand disease.

### Kawasaki shock syndrome in an arab female: case report of a rare manifestation and review of literature [^523f4fa6]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A two-year-old Arab female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a 2 day history of high-grade fever up to 40C o, cough and rhinorrhea. On the third day of illness, she developed dehydration secondary to vomiting and severe watery diarrhea requiring admission for intravenous (IV) fluid rehydration. On the fourth day of fever, she developed an erythematous rash over the face and trunk. A rapid respiratory viral panel was positive for Influenza B virus.

On admission, she was alert but tired. Vital signs revealed fever at 38.8 C o, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, heart rate of 150 beats per minute, blood pressure of 96/54 mmHg, with normal Oxygen saturation and capillary refill time. She had an erythematous rash over the face and the trunk, and cracked lips. Small bilateral submandibular lymph nodes were palpable; throat was congested with hyperemic tonsils. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.

After 10 h of admission, she developed lethargy and hypotension with BP of 78/41 mmHg. Cold extremities and delayed capillary refill time, facial puffiness with swollen hands and feet were noted. Abdomen examination revealed right upper quadrant distension, and was otherwise unremarkable with no hepatosplenomegaly. As she was manifesting symptoms of shock and deteriorating clinical status, blood cultures were obtained along with further investigations (Table 1), IV Ceftriaxone was initiated as the primary physician suspected septic shock, and she was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for further observation and management. Antibiotic therapy was stopped after the blood culture result returned negative.

Table 1
Significant laboratory finding on admission and after 10 h of admission

A diagnosis of KDSS was considered after consultation to the pediatric infectious disease doctor, and therefore Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 2 g/kg was given. Aspirin was deferred as she was influenza B positive. An ultrasound of the abdomen was obtained which revealed hydrops of the gallbladder. Initial echocardiography (ECHO) was normal. After 24 h of the IVIG therapy, the patient was afebrile, and her general condition started to improve. Two days after IVIG, she developed peeling mainly at the neck and perianal area. She was discharged from the hospital in good condition and follow up ECHOs were normal.

### Unusual presentation of acute compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand [^82d6fd75]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 49-year-old man was referred to orthopaedics with an acute onset of left forearm and hand swelling, widespread blisters and erythema after lying face down on the floor for an unknown period of time. He also presented with left wrist stiffness due to pain and clawing of the fingers and glove-type loss of sensation in the whole hand. Any attempt to straighten the fingers or extend the wrist exacerbated the pain. Symptoms deteriorated rapidly. Compartment syndrome was diagnosed and surgical fasciotomies of his left forearm and left hand were performed following multidisciplinary urgent discussions between plastic surgeons, microbiologists, anaesthetists and orthopaedic surgeons. The left forearm and left hand underwent extensive decompression and subsequent skin grafting and had good healing despite the initial skin presentation. The patient has made a satisfactory recovery and has required extensive hand physiotherapy and social care.

### High-pressure injection injuries of the hand [^f4d1b9c6]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

High-pressure injection hand injuries are often overlooked, with severe complications owing to the acute inflammatory response. Prognosis for depends on the type of material injected, location of injection, involved pressure, and timing to surgical decompression and debridement. Acute management involves broad-spectrum antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, emergent decompression within 6 hours, and complete removal of the injected material. Most patients have residual sequelae of stiffness, pain, sensation loss, and difficulties in returning to work. The hand surgeon's role is prompt surgical intervention, early postoperative motion, and education of patient and staff regarding short- and long-term expectations.

Hand Function Test, Safety, and Adverse Events

The hand functioning test (counting number of full opening and closing of the hands repetitively in 10 seconds) showed that patients were able to open and close their hands more than 10 times without any hand discomfort, stiffness, or tiredness before and after the treatments. This demonstrated that hand function after the treatment was not clinically affected by injection of mS-HA. This is because the injection was not performed in the DDL.

There was mild redness, tenderness, and swelling for the first day in most patients. These initial side effects might have been caused by repetitive cannula trauma during the superficial injection. Four patients (20%) mentioned mild initial swelling (with pitting edema > 2 mm for more than 5 seconds using a cotton ball) and were observed at 1 week after treatment. However, at 2 weeks after injection, the initial swelling and tenderness had subsided for all patients. There was mild bruising on the dorsum of hands of two patients (10%), who had thin skin and atrophic soft tissue at 1 week after injection. However, no interventions were needed to manage bruising. After 1 week, these symptoms and signs disappeared in all patients.

Under careful palpation, there were no nodules present on the dorsum of any hands. There were no severe AEs, such as palpable nodules, delayed nodule, delayed swelling, infection, itching, irritation, or stiffness. The most common AEs were mild swelling, pain, redness, and bruising, and nearly all events disappeared spontaneously within the first week.

Patient Satisfaction Survey Using the GAIS

Patient satisfaction, with improvements in soft-tissue atrophy, skin fold, wrinkles, and visibility of tendons and veins on the dorsal hands, was recorded using the GAIS. The average GAIS score improved in both hands and was generally maintained over the course of the study (Table 7).

### Fist sign-associated post ambulatory swollen hands [^061ab9a8]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

POTASH is characterized by recurrent, ambulation-induced, asymptomatic, bilateral acute swelling of the upper extremities distal to the wrists. Although the swelling is postulated to be caused by edema, the pathogenesis of this condition remains to be established. The disorder usually resolves spontaneously after ambulation is stopped.,

This condition has been observed in runners, hikers, and walkers. It was originally described in the medical literature as post ambulatory hand swelling (PAHS) or big hand syndrome. Subsequently, it has been designated as post ambulatory swollen hands and referred to by the acronym POTASH. The features of previously reported individuals with swollen hands following ambulation are summarized in Table I.,

Table I
Characteristics of individuals with swollen hands following ambulation

The differential diagnosis of POTASH includes urticaria, conditions associated with fluid overload, and cellulitis. The absence of hives or angioedema in this patient excluded urticaria or an allergic reaction. Since the swelling was only localized to the distal hands without any edema of the legs or abdomen, accumulation of fluid from heart, kidney, or liver disease was also excluded. In addition, cellulitis was excluded because there were neither systemic symptoms (such as fever) nor local signs (such as warmth, tenderness, or persistent erythema) of infection. This patient's rapid occurrence of bilateral swelling only limited to the hands — with an associated positive fist sign — was elicited by his participation in an activity in which there was prolonged running; therefore, he had POTASH.

### Hand dermatitis and lymphoedema [^956f5497]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hand dermatitis is common, with lymphoedema of the hand and forearm a rare complication. The mechanism of lymphoedema in such cases is poorly understood, hence management can be challenging. To investigate the underlying mechanism of lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis and outline recommendations for management, we identified all patients with lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis referred to our lymphoedema service, a tertiary referral centre. Treatment outcome was assessed by telephone interview and through correspondence with primary physicians and therapists. In total, nine patients, six with bilateral and three with unilateral lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis, attended our service over a 4-year period. Most had long-standing bilateral pompholyx eczema. Three patients reported no signs of infection prior to the onset of swelling. All patients had recurrent episodes of infection after the onset of swelling. Lymphoscintigraphy, when used, revealed a failure of small initial lymphatics of the hand to absorb and drain lymph to regional nodes. Prophylactic antibiotics together with aggressive management of the dermatitis, often with systemic therapy, were required to reduce swelling. Possible mechanisms for lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis include obliterative lymphangitis from infection, an inflammatory effect of the dermatitis on local lymphatics or a constitutive weakness of lymph drainage exposed to chronic inflammation, or any combination of the three. Treatment is only successful once both infection and inflammation from the dermatitis are controlled.

The Belgian woman traveled with friends to Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa from December 12, 2004, until January 22, 2005. She visited Chobe National Park in Botswana early January 2005. On January 8, a small, painless, vesicular lesion developed on the dorsal side of her fourth left finger. This lesion increased in size quickly and developed a black aspect with a red elevated border. Small vesicles appeared in the immediate vicinity of the primary lesion. No pus was noted. Her general condition was good. She treated herself with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 2 gm/day for 3 days. The next day, massive edema of the finger, hand, and left arm developed. When admitted to a hospital in Johannesburg, her left arm and hand were massively swollen with painful left axillary lymphadenopathy. Her temperature never exceeded 37.8°C. Wound cultures showed only the presence of viridans streptococci, bacteria that are not implicated in wound infections. The patient was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, flucloxacillin, and topical mupirocin. She was discharged after 6 days with oral flucloxacillin and returned to Belgium on January 22. On February 4, her general condition was excellent; the edema had diminished. A painless necrotic lesion on the left fourth finger measured 3 cm 2 (Figure). She mentioned minor discomfort of her left underarm and loss of sensation at the distal radial side of the left underarm. She could not extend the terminal phalanx of the fourth left finger because the underlying tendon had been destroyed. The left axillary lymph nodes were still slightly swollen. No evidence indicated parapox viral infection or necrotic arachnidism. Upon questioning, she mentioned that in Chobe National Park, some fellow travelers had manipulated the legs of dead antelopes. One person had climbed on a dead hippo for a picture and sank into the putrefying carcass. He soon afterwards cleaned a small abrasion on the patient's finger. Some hours later, all group members washed their hands in a common small plastic basin containing water and chloroxylenol.

Cephalosporin immediate hypersensitivity skin testing — interpretation and follow-up: Most hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins are directed at the R-group side chain rather than the core β-lactam ring molecule. Although skin testing to native cephalosporins is not standardized, a positive skin test result with a nonirritating concentration suggests the presence of drug-specific IgE antibody, and a negative skin test result does not rule out an allergy and must be followed by an observed graded challenge; patients with IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins may lose sensitivity over time.

If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash), and examples listed in Box 2 include gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, pruritis without rash, localized rash, delayed onset rash (> 24 hours), symptoms unknown, family history of penicillin or another drug allergy, and a recorded allergy the patient denies. In addition, a family history of penicillin or β-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with β-lactam antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^1b5da3c5]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — management with penicillin allergy: Recent publications indicate that the risk of a serious allergic reaction to second- and third-generation cephalosporins in patients with penicillin or amoxicillin allergy appears to be almost nil and no greater than the risk among patients without such allergy, so patients allergic to amoxicillin with a non–type 1 (late or delayed, > 72 hours) hypersensitivity reaction can safely be treated with cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime, and patients with a history of a serious type 1 immediate or accelerated (anaphylactic) reaction to amoxicillin can also safely be treated with these agents. Clinicians may wish to determine individual tolerance by referral to an allergist for penicillin and/or cephalosporin skin-testing before initiation of therapy. The susceptibility of S pneumoniae to cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime varies from 60% to 75%, and the susceptibility of H influenzae varies from 85% to 100%. In young children (< 2 years) with a serious type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin and moderate or more severe sinusitis, it may be prudent to use a combination of clindamycin (or linezolid) and cefixime; linezolid has excellent activity against all S pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, but lacks activity against H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Alternatively, a quinolone such as levofloxacin may be prescribed, and resistance of pneumococcus and H influenzae to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin is sufficient to preclude their use for acute bacterial sinusitis in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### Vitamin C deficiency mimicking inflammatory bone disease of the hand [^504cff94]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 12-year-old boy with anorexia nervosa presented with subacute multifocal digital swelling. He had been diagnosed with an eating disorder about 4 months prior to symptom onset, requiring admission to the Adolescent Medicine service for malnutrition, orthostasis and bradycardia, which resolved with monitored feeding. Despite ongoing behavioral therapy following discharge, however, adequate intake with continued weight gain remained a challenge. Over the course of 6 weeks, he developed additive and persistent swelling of the right hand first and fourth digits, followed by the left fifth digit (Fig. 1). The swelling was painful and unresponsive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, there was no fever, and he identified no preceding trauma or illness. Physical exam was notable for fusiform swelling limited to the phalanges, as the joints themselves did not exhibit any discrete effusions. Furthermore, the overlying skin was normal in appearance and texture, without petechiae or ecchymoses, and no other mucocutaneous changes were present elsewhere. Complete musculoskeletal exam was otherwise normal, without other areas of swelling or pain. The patient appeared generally cachectic and review of the growth curve revealed significant weight loss with concomitant stunted vertical growth over the previous 2 years, with a sustained body mass index below the first percentile for age. He had previously exhibited a normal fecal calprotectin and at the time of this presentation did not report any gastrointestinal abnormalities concerning for enterocolonic inflammation or malabsorption. He denied practicing restrictive eating behaviors, but his diet included few fruits and vegetables. He was then admitted for a comprehensive medical work up of this constellation of symptoms.

Fig. 1
a. Swelling of right first proximal phalanx and fourth middle phalanx. b. Swelling of left fifth middle phalanx

Hand radiographs showed marrow and cortical erosive change with periosteal reaction and overlying soft tissue swelling of the involved phalanges (Fig. 2). MRI of the right hand revealed signal abnormalities with surrounding soft tissue edema, but without arthritis, in these areas (Fig. 3). These findings prompted concern for chronic noninfectious osteomyelitis (CNO) or an alternate noninfectious inflammatory entity, such as Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH). Subsequent whole body imaging did not identify any other areas of involvement. The isolation of the lesions to the hands was felt to be atypical for CNO and LCH, particularly without evidence of systemic inflammation to further suggest such diagnoses. Therefore, further evaluations for other etiologies of finger swelling with bony changes were pursued.

Case 5

He was a 14-month-old boy with a history of COVID-19 in family members, presented with fever and irritability from 5 days and skin rash from 3 days prior to admission. Maculopapular erythematous rashes presented from the trunk and upper limb. Then, generalized and hands and feet edema developed. Cracked lips, erythematous lips and tongue, and bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis also appeared. During the first admission day, the patient became toxic and was transferred to the PICU. The CBC showed leukocytosis with a significant neutrophil count. Elevated ESR, CRP, and liver transaminases and were also found in addition to hypoalbuminemia. Urine analysis and CXR were normal. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative and chest CT-scan showed non-significant changes. So, cefotaxime, hydroxychloroquine, 2 gr/kg IVIG and 60 mg/kg aspirin, zinc, vitamin D, and albumin started. Echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries, mild right pleural effusion (5 mm), mild mitral regurgitation with a normal coronary artery on the first admission day. Because of prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT) and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K were prescribed. Fever continued for 2 days after IVIG infusion and he was still toxic. So, the second dose of IVIG was infused on the fourth day of admission. Echocardiography showed diastolic dysfunction, mild right and left coronary artery dilatation in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the left circumflex artery without aneurysm. Liver transaminases, PT and PTT decreased to the normal value but leukocytosis continued and packed cell was transfused for severe anemia. Also, ceftriaxone changed to vancomycin and meropenem. The second chest CT-scan showed non-significant changes. While fever subsided on day 7, hydroxychloroquine discontinued but echocardiography showed progression in coronary arteries dilatation, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, decreased ejection fraction, and mild diastolic dysfunction. So, 2 mg/kg/day prednisolone, vasoactive drugs and furosemide started. On day 10, the patient became hemodynamically stable, so vasoactive drugs tapered but abdominal distension occurred with non-significant findings in the physical examination. Ultrasonography showed mild hepatosplenomegaly, intra-abdominal fluid, and bilateral pleural effusion. In CBC test result, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis (platelet count: 420.000/µL) were reported. Echocardiography showed progressive coronary artery aneurysm and beading and clopidogrel started. Abdominal distension improved during the last 5 days, and the skin rash disappeared with pilling on day 14. Still afebrile, he was toxic. COVID-19 RT-PCR result was negative but COVID-19 IgM was positive. After that, marked thrombocytosis appeared in the CBC (platelet count: 1.168.000/µL), ESR and CRP normalized but coronary artery dilatation progressed to a giant aneurysm in day 17 as follows: right coronary artery (RCA): 8.3 mm, left main coronary artery (LMCA) and LAD: 6.7–7.2 mm with good left ventricular ejection fraction. So, warfarin and infliximab were prescribed. The patient was discharged from the hospital with aspirin and warfarin. Results of other evaluations during admission like serum vitamin D, LDH, CPK, and antiphospholipid antibodies were unremarkable. Two weeks later, the coronary diameters decreased to 6 mm in RCA and near to 5 mm in LMCA and LAD in the follow-up echocardiography.

Cephalosporin allergy evaluation — Nonirritating concentrations of commonly used cephalosporins have been described, and 2 mg/mL is often used; a positive cephalosporin skin test suggests drug-specific IgE antibodies, and the patient should receive a skin test–negative alternative cephalosporin or alternate antibiotic, or undergo desensitization, whereas a negative cephalosporin skin test should be followed by a drug challenge to confirm tolerance; oral cephalosporins are not sterile and therefore cannot be used for intradermal skin testing, and skin testing with cephalexin has no clear utility; non–beta-lactam antibiotics may also be considered, but they may result in added patient morbidity, mortality, and cost of care.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^012c24b6]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite — first aid management emphasizes that frostbite is a potentially tissue-threatening injury, advanced treatment such as thrombolytic medication can be administered only in a health care setting and is most effective when given soon after injury, and tissue of the frozen extremities will swell, so it is recommended to remove constricting items such as jewelry and tight clothing. Frostbite is a common finding in hypothermic individuals; rewarming the core of the person with hypothermia is the treatment priority, and rewarming the extremities first can cause the core temperature to decrease. Because acute frostbite limits sensation and awareness of damage, experts recommend that frostbitten tissues be protected and that frostbitten hands and feet not be used for climbing or walking whenever it is avoidable. Local care includes applying bulky dressings that insulate and protect tissue, using clean and dry dressings to absorb moisture, and using loose, circumferential wrapping to allow for swelling and prevent constriction of blood flow; bulky dressings also distribute pressure more evenly to reduce localized pressure points. NSAIDs decrease production of mediators that can worsen tissue damage, and ibuprofen is recommended by many experts and included in many treatment guidelines, although direct clinical evidence is lacking. Intact skin is an essential barrier for infection, and whenever possible, intact epidermal layers should be left intact.

For "Pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess", the pathway asks "Does the patient have systemic involvement?"; without systemic involvement it states "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT", and with systemic involvement it states "YES ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". When antibiotics are indicated, for patients without a penicillin allergy use "Oral amoxicillin (500 milligrams, 3 times per day, 3–7 d)" or "Oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and if first-line treatment fails "broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d)".

5.7 Mucocutaneous and Dermatologic Toxicity

Severe mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) can occur in patients treated with Capecitabine [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]. Capecitabine should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction possibly attributable to Capecitabine treatment.

Hand-and-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy-induced acral erythema) is a cutaneous toxicity. Median time to onset was 79 days (range from 11 to 360 days) with a severity range of grades 1 to 3 for patients receiving capecitabine tablets monotherapy in the metastatic setting. Grade 1 is characterized by any of the following: numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless swelling or erythema of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort which does not disrupt normal activities. Grade 2 hand-and-foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient's activities of daily living. Grade 3 hand-and-foot syndrome is defined as moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering or severe pain of the hands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living. Persistent or severe hand-and-foot syndrome (grade 2 and above can eventually lead to loss of fingerprints which could impact patient identification. If grade 2 or 3 hand-and-foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 hand-and-foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine tablets should be decreased [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings, but it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical presentation with acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness and pain is typical. However, cellulitis can be difficult to diagnose due to a number of infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and appropriate targeted coverage of this pathogen with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of Evidence: Moderate. Given that < 5% of patients with an unverified penicillin allergy are truly allergic, and ~2% of those who are truly allergic will experience a reaction to a cephalosporin, when they are given cephalosporins directly, the chance of a reaction is very low with a linked probability of ~0.1% (ie, 0.05 x 0.02 = 0.001). Retrospective studies of parenteral cephalosporin administration to patients with a history of penicillin allergy, without prior penicillin skin testing, have shown rare cephalosporin allergic reactions.

### Cephalosporin allergy: current understanding and future challenges [^a6a285a6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporins are commonly used antibiotics both in hospitalized patients and in outpatients. Hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins are becoming increasingly common with a wide range of immunopathologic mechanisms. Cephalosporins are one of the leading causes for perioperative anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Patients allergic to cephalosporins tend to tolerate cephalosporins with disparate R1 side chains but may react to other beta-lactams with common R1 side chains. Skin testing for cephalosporins has not been well validated but appears to have a good negative predictive value for cephalosporins with disparate R1 side chains. In vitro tests including basophil activation tests have lower sensitivity when compared with skin testing. Rapid drug desensitization procedures are safe and effective and have been used successfully for immediate and some nonimmediate cephalosporin reactions. Many gaps in knowledge still exist regarding cephalosporin hypersensitivity.

### Possible cefotaxime-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^c3088c59]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of possible cefotaxime-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).

Case Summary

A 72-year-old woman with an upper urinary tract infection developed erosions and blisters on the skin and the mucous membranes, as well as fever and prostration, soon after the administration of cefotaxime. This presentation is consistent with the features of SJS. Resolution of the clinical manifestations was observed after discontinuation of the drug; all other drugs, infections, or immunologic disorders that could have caused this syndrome were carefully excluded. An objective causality assessment revealed that SJS was possibly associated with the use of cefotaxime.

Discussion

Although cephalosporins have been associated with an increased risk for SJS and cefotaxime has been suspected of being associated with SJS in a previous case-control study, this is the first full report for cefotaxime-related SJS in the literature. An immunologically mediated reaction may be the underlying mechanism.

Conclusions

Although cefotaxime administration seems to be the underlying cause of the SJS observed in our patient, establishment of a definite causal relationship requires additional cases and supportive data.

### Cellulitis [^fc42512e]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^6205b05b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporin antibiotics are commonly prescribed for a wide range of infections as a result of their effectiveness and broad-spectrum activity. These drugs rarely cause diverse immunologic reaction phenotypes across different age groups, including IgE-mediated reactions, benign T-cell–mediated exanthems as well as serum sickness–like, single organ damage, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. At the same time, as a result of their common use, a cephalosporin allergy label is relevant for 1.3% to 1.7% of the general population in the United States.

Despite major progress in understanding more about reactions to cephalosporins, specific and validated testing strategies of cephalosporin allergy evaluation are less well defined. In the last few years, there is evidence that immediate allergic reactions to cephalosporins as well as their cross-reactivity with penicillin appears to be largely related to antigenic responses to R1 side chains rather than β-lactam ring cross-reactivity or R2 side chains. Data on cross-reactivity among delayed reaction types are not as well characterized.

With improvements in our understanding of cross-reactivity and reaction risk assessment, the joint 2022 Drug Allergy Practice Parameters (DAPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) now advocate a simplified and risk-stratified evaluation for cephalosporin allergy.

For immediate reactions to cephalosporins, the 2022 practice parameter suggests stratifying patients on the basis of potential IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions versus nonanaphylactic reactions. For those patients with nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a direct challenge should be performed for a cephalosporin with dissimilar side chains to determine tolerance. In contrast, for administration of cephalosporins with similar side chains and for the less common anaphylactic reaction history, a negative cephalosporin skin test result to a parenteral cephalosporin is required before challenge to determine tolerance. Cephalosporin skin tests have not been validated and have lower sensitivities than penicillin, so ideally, negative results should always be followed by graded challenges.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^c245f46b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cross-reactivity with cephalosporins — risk levels and anaphylaxis — notes that third-generation cephalosporins have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients (< 1%) compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins (range: 1%–8%). Anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins among persons who report a penicillin allergy is estimated at a rate of one per 52,000 persons, and Kaiser health care system data reported that among 3,313 patients with self-reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin, no cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of IgE-mediated symptoms from penicillin during the preceding 10 years.

Recommended approach to beta-lactam administration in patients with prior beta-lactam allergies", with severity defined as "Anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypotension, or other severe IgE-mediated reactions" and similarity as "§Similarity or cross-reactivity based on R1 side chain"; testing notes include "†Cephalosporin skin testing should be used for parenteral cephalosporins only", "A positive (POS) test suggests IgE antibodies and induction of tolerance procedure should be performed or administration of an alternative cephalosporin to which the patient was skin test negative (NEG)", and "A negative test should be followed by a drug challenge", and challenge execution as "All drug challenges are 1–2 steps… and structural similarity between R1 side chains"; label considerations note "Penicillin allergy assessment performed in the future as the penicillin allergy label would remain", and exclusions state "The recommendations within these algorithms do not apply to patients with history of severe delayed immunologic reactions or organ-specific reactions to beta-lactams. These include reactions such as the SCARs, hemolytic anemia, drug-induced liver injury, and acute interstitial nephritis", plus the risk signal "Urticaria fulfilling "1-1-1" criterion (appearance within 1 hour after the first dose and regression within 1 day and occurrence within 1 year) suggests a high likelihood of having a positive skin test".

### Diagnosis and management of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins [^763652a2]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antibiotics. Immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with use of a specific cephalosporin, as a cross-reaction between different cephalosporins or as a cross-reaction to other β-lactam antibiotics, namely, penicillin. Historically, frequent reports of anaphylaxis following administration of first- and second-generation cephalosporins to patients with a history of penicillin allergy led to the belief of a high degree of allergic cross-reactivity. More recent evidence reveals a significantly lower risk of cross-reactivity between penicillins and the newer-generation cephalosporins. The current thought is that a shared side chain, rather than the β-lactam ring structure, is the determining factor in immunologic cross-reactivity. Understanding the chemical structure of these agents has allowed us to identify the allergenic determinants for penicillin; however, the exact allergenic determinants of cephalosporins are less well understood. For this reason, standardized diagnostic skin testing is not available for cephalosporins as it is for penicillin. Nevertheless, skin testing to the cephalosporin in question, using a nonirritating concentration, provides additional information, which can further guide the work-up of a patient suspected of having an allergy to that drug. Together, the history and the skin test results can assist the allergist in the decision to recommend continued drug avoidance or to perform a graded challenge versus an induction of tolerance procedure.

### Outcomes from an inpatient β-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^42e7b0fc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Data definitions and outcomes

The EHR-abstracted data included characteristics of the test dose (ie, drug, hospital, ordering clinician, patient care service, allergy/immunology consultation use, PST use, test-dose timing, and length of stay) and patient characteristics (ie, demographics and allergy history). Historical penicillin and cephalosporin reactions were recorded. Itching, flushing, rash, and hives were considered nonsevere cutaneous reactions; bronchospasm, shortness of breath, wheezing, anaphylaxis, angioedema, swelling, syncope, arrhythmia, hypotension, dizziness, and positive skin testing were considered severe IgE histories. Other EHR drug allergies were recorded.

The primary outcome was a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) resulting from a β-lactam antibiotic test dose. PHS house staff reviewers recorded reaction details including timing or onset, test-dose step, symptoms and presentation, treatment, and clinical context for all possible reactions. Allergy specialist coinvestigators (K.G.B. P.G.W. J.T.H. and A.R.W.) determined whether the signs and/or symptoms were consistent with an HSR. All reactions not consistent with HSRs were considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For all HSRs, allergy specialists determined whether objective findings were present and whether the pathways were followed correctly. Confirmed HSRs were grouped as follows. Nonsevere cutaneous reactions included itching, flushing, rash, tingling, and urticaria; severe IgE reactions included angioedema, swelling, bronchospasm, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis; and severe delayed immunologic reactions included organ-specific reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. We assessed HSRs overall by drug class, and we separately considered direct challenges (ie, challenges performed without prior PST).

Modification of the EHR allergy record after a test dose was determined by assessing whether the allergy module had a relevant allergy entry added, deleted, and/or specified (ie, additional detail was included).

### Fist sign-associated post ambulatory swollen hands [^ff097dcf]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A healthy 64-year-old man presented with acute-onset positive fist sign of both hands; he had just completed a 13.1-mile race. For 3 hours and 52 minutes, he continuously ambulated; the ambient temperature was 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Similar to prior half marathons in which he had participated, the asymptomatic bilateral progressive swelling of his hands began after 1 hour of running.

Examination demonstrated that he was not able to clench his fingers into his palm to make a fist; the effort resulted in erythema of the digits and palms (Fig 1). In addition, painless edematous hands, fingers, and thumbs of both upper extremities were observed; the swelling was readily noted proximal and distal to the ring on his left fourth finger (Fig 2). His dorsal hands and digits showed changes from chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation; however, hives and angioedema, pruritus, and swelling of other body sites were absent.

Fig 1
After completing a half marathon, a 64-year-old man had a positive fist sign. He could not clench the fingers on his left hand into the palm to make a fist.

Fig 2
The man's left hand and its digits are markedly swollen. The prominent swelling can readily be observed proximal and distal to the ring on his left fourth finger.

Correlation of the patient's history and clinical presentation established the diagnosis of post ambulatory hand swelling (POTASH) with an associated positive fist sign. Similar to his previous episodes of post ambulatory swollen hands, the swelling of his hands and their digits eventually resolved spontaneously once he had finished the race and stopped running (Fig 3). Indeed, within 2 hours after he discontinued ambulating, he could clench his fingers to make a fist (Fig 4).

Fig 3
Spontaneous resolution of the man's swollen hands and digits began approximately 1 hour after he stopped running; within 2 hours, his left hand and its digits were normal in appearance.

Fig 4
After the swelling resolved spontaneously, the man was able to make a fist by clenching his fingers into his palm. He now had a negative fist sign.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^84eb5bbb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis guideline — introduction describes that osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 302 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability among older adults, with the knees, hips, and hands the most commonly affected appendicular joints. OA is characterized by whole-joint pathology including cartilage degradation, bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of normal joint function. Patients with OA are likely to be treated with a number of different pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions, often in combination, and while some principles apply to all patients, some recommendations are specific to particular joints such as the hip, knee, patellofemoral joint, and first carpometacarpal joint (CMC), or to particular patient populations such as those with erosive OA.

Skin Blister: In adult subjects, median maximal blister fluid cefdinir concentrations of 0. 65 and

1. 1 mcg/mL were observed 4 to 5 hours following administration of 300 and 600 mg doses, respectively. Mean blister Cmax and AUC values were 48% and 91% of corresponding plasma values. CSF: Data on cefdinir penetration into human cerebrospinal fluid are not available. Metabolism and Excretion: Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cefdinir is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics. IF CEFDINIR IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG β-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY.

IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFDINIR OCCURS, THE DRUG SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefdinir should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections. When cefdinir is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.

Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefdinir or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Cephalosporin allergy [^48a262a2]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to cephalosporins may occur because of sensitization to cephalosporin determinants shared with penicillin or to unique cephalosporin haptens. The exact nature of the haptenic determinants resulting from the degradation of currently available cephalosporins is incompletely understood. Cephalosporin skin testing or specific IgE immunoassays have limited clinical utility. Patients with a history of allergy to cephalosporins or penicillin may be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins. Skin testing for an allergy to penicillin may be helpful in patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have a clinical indication for cephalosporin use. Most of these patients have negative tests and should not be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^8145fcd8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Beta-lactam severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) — cross-reactivity and delabeling guidance are as follows: Cross-reactivity between beta-lactams in patients with SCARs appears to be based on the R1 side chain but data are incomplete, and avoidance of all beta-lactams is generally recommended in patients with a SCAR that is considered highly likely to be due to a beta-lactam, though risks and benefits should be weighed; for some SCARs such as DRESS, testing may help but no testing has a 100% PPV, small case series suggest some patients with DRESS from penicillins may tolerate other beta-lactams, and reported cases of SCARs due to 2 different classes of beta-lactams are rare; additionally, those allergic to cephalosporins may be administered aztreonam except if allergic to ceftazidime because of an identical R1 side chain, and because aztreonam is an expensive alternative and resistance is increasing, de-labeling the penicillin allergy is recommended.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^e57fb250]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

We studied 2 cases of anaphylaxis to cephalosporins because we had a specific interest in the evaluation of cefazolin reactions and whether this drug is recognized by drug allergy experts as being primarily non–cross-reactive to both penicillins and cephalosporins. The practice parameter's algorithm does not recommend a different evaluation for cefazolin, but it does mention the unique characteristics of this drug in its discussion of R1 side chain and cross-reactivity.

We present the results in such a way as to visually illustrate the distribution of answer combinations, with answers aligning with the practice parameter marked to help visually recognize trends of adherence to the guidelines.

### Randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled, split-hand trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of triamcinolone acetate injection after calcium hydroxylapatite volume restoration of the dorsal hand [^3f4f54f4]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) is currently the only FDA-approved soft-tissue filler indicated for augmentation of the dorsal hand. Although the treatment is generally safe and effective, adverse side effects such as swelling and edema postinjection are common and can sometimes be debilitating.

Objective

In this study, the authors explore the utility of triamcinolone acetate coinjection with CaHA to the dorsal hands to mitigate adverse effects and improve patient experience.

Patients and Methods

After obtaining informed consent, 20 subjects were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized, split-hand, sham-controlled clinical trial. Subject hands were randomized to receive either CaHA with triamcinolone acetate or CaHA with sham saline coinjection. Follow-up evaluations were performed by a blinded investigator at Days 7, 14, 30, 90, 180, 270, and 360 and consisted of the validated Merz Hand Grading Scale and assessments of erythema, edema, modules, bruising, and skin atrophy. Subjects also kept a daily diary for the first 30 days postinjection documenting bruising, itching, pain, redness, swelling, difficulty in performing activities with hands, and sensory alteration in hands.

Results

There were no significant differences in treatment efficacy between the 2 groups. Post-treatment swelling was significantly reduced between Days 6 and 19 in the triamcinolone acetate coinjection group.

Conclusion

The addition of triamcinolone acetate coinjection with CaHA for dorsal hand augmentation did not negatively impact treatment efficacy but significantly reduced adverse side effects. This strategy represents a safe and effective way to improve patient experience and treatment tolerability.
