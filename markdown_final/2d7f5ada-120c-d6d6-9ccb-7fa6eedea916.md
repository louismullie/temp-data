## Question

Differential for unilateral papilledema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of unilateral papilledema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true papilledema and excluding pseudoedema. Then, I should categorize etiologies by pathophysiology and prioritize life-threatening causes. Next, I will integrate demographic clues and imaging strategies. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight pitfalls and special populations, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because pseudoedema such as optic disc drusen, congenitally crowded discs, or myopic tilt can mimic papilledema and are common causes of unilateral disc elevation with preserved visual function. Multimodal ophthalmic imaging, including fundus autofluorescence and enhanced-depth imaging OCT, is essential to distinguish pseudoedema from true edema, and I should double-check for peripapillary hemorrhages, venous congestion, and retinal folds that favor true papilledema [^8190173e] [^d9075835] [^22882b4d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology until I categorize the causes of unilateral papilledema. I need to ensure I separate increased intracranial pressure mechanisms from optic nerve sheath compartmentation, from infiltrative or compressive optic neuropathies, and from inflammatory or ischemic optic disc edema, because the management and urgency differ substantially across these buckets [^4c9bba8d] [^be492de2].

> I will now examine idiopathic intracranial hypertension as a leading cause of unilateral papilledema, even though papilledema is classically bilateral. Wait, let me verify the prevalence of asymmetric or strictly unilateral papilledema in IIH; contemporary series suggest highly asymmetric papilledema in 3.6–10% and strictly unilateral papilledema in about 1.4% of IIH cases, often related to lamina cribrosa stiffness, IOP gradients, or perioptic CSF compartmentation, and more common in older patients or those with prior IOP-lowering surgery, so I should keep IIH high on the list while still excluding secondary causes [^6173a4d0] [^874883f2] [^ae8eef9a].

> Next, I should review secondary causes of raised intracranial pressure that can present with unilateral papilledema, because missing these would be dangerous. Intracranial mass lesions, obstructive hydrocephalus, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis can all produce papilledema, and although papilledema is usually bilateral, asymmetric or even unilateral presentations occur due to variable CSF transmission and optic nerve sheath anatomy; I need to ensure urgent neuroimaging with MRI brain and orbits with contrast plus MR venography is obtained when the phenotype is atypical or the patient is outside the classic IIH demographic [^8190173e] [^b38ecac9] [^78aab46c].

> But wait, what if the mechanism is compartmentation of perioptic CSF rather than diffuse intracranial hypertension. Let me consider that arachnoid cysts, optic nerve sheath fenestration effects, and even spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular changes demonstrate how localized CSF dynamics can produce unilateral or highly asymmetric disc edema, reinforcing the need to correlate imaging of the optic canals and perioptic spaces with the clinical picture before concluding a systemic ICP process [^ef9544b1] [^1d3212d7] [^4eed5fd5].

> I should confirm the role of infiltrative and compressive etiologies when the disc edema is unilateral and visual function is impaired. Optic nerve sheath meningioma, sarcoidosis, and other granulomatous or neoplastic processes can cause unilateral disc swelling with early vision loss, and neuroretinitis can mimic papilledema with macular star formation; careful MRI of the orbits with fat suppression and contrast, along with targeted serologies and, when indicated, CSF analysis, are critical to avoid mislabeling these as papilledema from raised ICP [^8190173e] [^d60a8504] [^4882ef6c].

> Let me think about inflammatory and ischemic optic neuropathies that can be unilateral and confused with papilledema. Optic neuritis, including MOG-associated disease, and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy can present with unilateral disc swelling and acute vision loss, and differentiating features include pain with eye movements, RAPD, and age-related risk profiles; I should double-check for these when visual acuity or fields are abnormal, as they redirect the workup away from ICP-based etiologies and toward neuro-ophthalmic management [^4f108122] [^4c9bba8d].

> I need to ensure I integrate demographic and clinical clues to estimate pretest probabilities. In reproductive-age women with obesity and headache, IIH predominates, with population-based data suggesting IIH accounts for about 87% of papilledema cases without a previously known cause, whereas patients outside this profile have a higher likelihood of secondary etiologies; however, I should not anchor on demographics alone, as exceptions occur and mandate imaging and, when appropriate, lumbar puncture with opening pressure [^85e48cff] [^da4b8617] [^f1de63aa].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy and make sure I do not miss key sequences. MRI brain and orbits with contrast, fat-suppressed orbital sequences, and MR venography are first-line to exclude mass, venous thrombosis, and to identify indirect signs of raised ICP such as posterior globe flattening, perioptic subarachnoid space distension, and transverse sinus stenosis; CT venography is an alternative when MRI is contraindicated, and I should confirm that these are obtained promptly when red flags are present [^8190173e] [^6d40d80d] [^3b18f3fc].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of lumbar puncture. If MRI and MRV are normal and the phenotype is compatible with IIH, LP with opening pressure and CSF analysis is indicated to confirm elevated pressure and exclude alternative diagnoses; in children, normal opening pressure is lower, so I need to apply pediatric norms and interpret results in clinical context to avoid misclassification [^e4df4984] [^0c394a27].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic algorithm to ensure it is actionable. First, confirm true papilledema with imaging and exclude pseudoedema. Second, obtain MRI brain and orbits with contrast and MR venography to exclude secondary causes. Third, if imaging is unrevealing and the phenotype fits, proceed to LP with opening pressure and CSF analysis to confirm IIH. Fourth, if imaging reveals a secondary cause, manage that directly. Fifth, if pseudoedema is diagnosed, avoid unnecessary neuroimaging and arrange ophthalmic follow-up, documenting visual fields and OCT for progression risk [^8190173e] [^4c9bba8d] [^641b6af6].

> I should double-check special populations and pitfalls. In children, IIH without papilledema is not rare and obesity is less predictive, so a high index of suspicion for IIH or other causes is warranted. In infants and toddlers, abusive head trauma can rarely show papilledema, but retinal hemorrhages are the more sensitive and specific finding, and papilledema may be delayed, so timing and pattern matter. In patients with high myopia or peripapillary atrophy, diagnosing papilledema is harder and OCT can help, but I must be cautious not to overcall edema in crowded discs [^6ff0070d] [^4036828f] [^a2cbe67f].

> Finally, I need to ensure management implications are aligned with etiology. For IIH, weight loss and acetazolamide are foundational, with escalation to CSF shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration when vision is threatened, whereas for secondary causes such as venous thrombosis, tumor, or infection, disease-specific therapy is urgent. For pseudoedema, reassurance and longitudinal visual monitoring suffice, and I should avoid iatrogenic harm from unnecessary neurosurgical interventions [^bdd1e1aa] [^a8756e98] [^8190173e].

Unilateral papilledema is most often due to **idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)** with asymmetric disc involvement [^6173a4d0], but it is a diagnosis of exclusion [^0c394a27] and requires urgent neuroimaging to rule out life-threatening causes such as **mass lesions, hydrocephalus, or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)** [^8190173e] [^78aab46c]. Other causes include **optic nerve sheath compartmentation** (e.g. arachnoid cyst, optic nerve sheath fenestration) [^ef9544b1] [^1d3212d7], **optic perineuritis** [^8190173e], and **optic disc drusen** (pseudoedema) [^d9075835]. Evaluation should include MRI/MRV of the brain and orbits with contrast [^8190173e], followed by lumbar puncture if imaging is normal, to confirm IIH or identify secondary causes [^0c394a27]. Management is etiology-specific: treat IIH with acetazolamide and weight loss [^a8756e98]; treat CVST with anticoagulation [^notfound]; and treat optic perineuritis with corticosteroids [^notfound].

## Pathophysiology of unilateral papilledema

Unilateral papilledema arises from **asymmetric transmission of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)** to the optic nerve head, leading to axoplasmic flow stasis, disc edema, and vascular changes [^6173a4d0]. Proposed mechanisms include:

- **Lamina cribrosa stiffness**: Age-related stiffening can asymmetrically resist pressure transmission [^6173a4d0].
- **Optic nerve sheath compartmentation**: Micropartitions or arachnoid cysts can create localized pressure gradients [^6173a4d0] [^ef9544b1].
- **Optic canal asymmetry**: Smaller canal diameter on one side may impede CSF pressure transmission [^5037798a].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Assess for headache characteristics, visual symptoms, and systemic features; **red flags** include sudden onset, focal deficits, or cancer history [^notfound].

---

### Examination

- **Visual acuity and fields**: Often preserved early in papilledema [^ad3598e9].
- **Pupillary reactions**: Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) suggests optic neuropathy [^4f108122].
- **Funduscopy**: Grade papilledema (Frisén scale), look for hemorrhages, exudates, choroidal folds [^5a6cc920].
- **Neurologic exam**: Exclude focal deficits, cranial nerve palsies [^0c394a27].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

MRI brain and orbits with contrast and MR venography are **first-line** to exclude mass lesions, hydrocephalus, and CVST [^8190173e] [^78aab46c]. If MRI is normal and IIH is suspected, perform lumbar puncture with opening pressure and CSF analysis [^0c394a27].

---

## Management strategies

- **IIH**: Acetazolamide, weight loss, serial visual fields, consider CSF shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration if vision threatened [^a8756e98] [^1d3212d7].
- **CVST**: Anticoagulation is essential [^notfound].
- **Optic perineuritis**: Systemic corticosteroids [^notfound].
- **Pseudoedema**: Reassurance, no intervention needed [^be492de2].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause** and the **timeliness of intervention**. IIH has a favorable outlook with treatment, whereas delayed diagnosis of mass lesions or CVST can cause permanent vision loss [^a8756e98] [^412eb068].

---

Unilateral papilledema is uncommon and mandates a **structured workup**: confirm true edema, exclude life-threatening causes with MRI/MRV, and tailor therapy to the etiology. Early, accurate diagnosis preserves vision and prevents neurologic complications [^8190173e].

Key Points

Question

What is the likely etiology of papilledema among patients presenting to an eye clinic without a previously known cause?

Findings

In this population-based cross-sectional study including 86 patients diagnosed with papilledema, most patients (87%) were found to have idiopathic intracranial hypertension, while 13% presented with potentially life-threatening conditions, including intracranial tumor, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and granulomatous meningitis.

Meaning

All patients presenting with papilledema require neuroimaging; however, based on the results of this study, those with the typical demographic characteristics of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and lack of other neurologic symptoms may not need urgent neuroimaging, as long as the papilledema is not severe enough to threaten vision.

### Unilateral swollen disc due to increased intracranial pressure [^8c4754bf]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Truly unilateral papilledema is rare and poses a diagnostic problem. The authors have prospectively looked for patients with truly unilateral papilledema and found 15 patients, 10 of whom had idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Neuroimaging did not indicate a reason for the lack of swelling in the other nerve. The visual deficits and outcomes were similar to those of patients with bilateral papilledema. Although monocular papilledema is uncommon, a lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement should be considered.

### Mechanisms of visual loss in papilledema [^ad6978d9]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

The term "papilledema" indicates swelling of the optic discs secondary to increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema can be caused by an intracranial mass lesion or by other factors. Visual symptoms frequently accompany papilledema, which can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated. Starting with an illustrative case, the authors review the pathophysiology of the visual signs and symptoms of papilledema. They also briefly review potential treatment options, focusing on the role of the neurosurgeon in the treatment of patients with papilledema.

### Unilateral papilledema caused by a fronto-temporo-parietal arachnoid cyst [^ef9544b1]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of unilateral papilledema caused by an arachnoid cyst.

Methods

Interventional case report.

Results

A 36-year-old woman presented with unilateral papilledema in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated a large fronto-temporo-parietal arachnoid cyst in the left hemisphere. The papilledema resolved after placement of a cysto-peritoneal shunt that drained the cerebrospinal fluid directly from the arachnoid cyst into the peritoneum.

Conclusion

Papilledema caused by increased intracranial pressure is usually bilateral; unilateral papilledema is possible under special anatomical circumstances.

CONCLUSION

Although the majority of patients with IIH present classically with headache and papilledema, the disorder should be considered a syndrome with a clinical spectrum of presentations. Some patients with IIH can be relatively asymptomatic; whereas in others, papilledema may be highly asymmetric, unilateral, or not present at all. Unusual cranial nerve involvement beyond the abducens nerve has also been reported in association with IIH. Recent advancements in neuroimaging provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to some of these presentations, allowing the identification of new associations including spontaneous skull base CSF leak and temporal lobe epilepsy. Clinicians should be aware of clinical spectrum of IIH and implications for the management of these presentations.

HIGHLY ASYMMETRIC OR UNILATERAL PAPILLEDEMA

Papilledema is due to a mechanical phenomenon where increased CSF pressure in the optic nerve sheath causes axoplasmic flow stasis at the optic nerve head, leading to intraneuronal ischemia and secondary vascular changes within the optic nerves. For most patients, papilledema is bilateral and usually symmetric. Highly asymmetric papilledema, defined by an inter-eye Frisén grade difference of at least 2, occurs in 3.6–10% of IIH patients. Strictly unilateral papilledema in IIH is rare, occurring in 1.4% of patients in one series, and presents a diagnostic dilemma. These patients should undergo a detailed neuro-ophthalmic examination before the unilateral disc edema is attributed to IIH.

Several mechanisms for asymmetric papilledema and unilateral papilledema have been proposed, with the unifying hypothesis that differential CSF pressure is transmitted to the optic nerve head. Several studies have noted a propensity for unilateral papilledema in older patients. With aging, the lamina cribrosa becomes stiffer and less resilient because of an increase in total collagen and a reduction in the proportion of collagen type 3. The optic nerve sheath, composed of fibrous tissue, is able to distend in the presence of increased CSF pressure. However, a stiff lamina cribrosa may act as a barrier to the transmission of CSF pressure to the optic nerve head. Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) and the pressure gradient across the lamina cribrosa may also play a role. Several cases of unilateral papilledema have been described in IIH patients following surgical reduction of IOP for glaucoma. However, larger series of IIH patients with asymmetric papilledema have not found a significant difference in IOP between eyes.

Compartmentation of perioptic CSF has also been proposed as a mechanism for asymmetric papilledema. A complex system of 'micropartitions' in the subarachnoid space of the optic nerve sheath are believed to interfere with the transmission of CSF between the intracranial subarachnoid space and the lamina cribrosa. A similar hypothesis contends that a smaller bony optic canal may act as a barrier to the transmission of CSF pressure to the lamina cribrosa. One study found an association between larger optic canals on MRI and a greater severity of papilledema in patients with IIH. Subsequent studies employing CT, which delineates bony anatomy more accurately than MRI, found no significant relationship between optic canal dimension and severity of papilledema.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Although the majority of patients with IIH present classically with headache and papilledema, some patients may have unusual presentations or manifestations. Recent advancements in neuroimaging have facilitated the identification of other presentations associated with IIH. This review provides an overview of the expanding clinical spectrum of IIH.

Recent Findings

Presentations of IIH that are considered unusual include highly asymmetric or unilateral papilledema, IIH without papilledema, and IIH associated with cranial nerve involvement. These presentations likely reflect differences in the way cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is transmitted intracranially. Radiological signs of intracranial hypertension are increasingly recognized in patients with IIH and provide further insights into the effects of raised ICP on intracranial structures. Osseous changes in the skull base leading to formation of meningoceles and encephaloceles have been identified in patients with IIH, spontaneous skull base CSF leak, and drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting a possible association.

Summary

Clinicians should be familiar with the expanding clinical spectrum of IIH and the implications for the management of these presentations.

### Isolated increased intracranial pressure and unilateral papilledema in an infant with traumatic brain injury and nondepressed basilar skull fracture [^4765eb99]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury is one of the most common pediatric injuries; totaling more than 500,000 emergency department visits per year. When the injury involves a skull fracture, sinus venous thrombosis and the risk of resultant increased intracranial pressure (ICP) are a concern. We describe a previously healthy 11-month-old female infant with nondepressed skull fracture who developed increased ICP in the absence of intracranial changes on imaging. Funduscopic examination revealed unilateral papilledema, and opening pressure on lumbar puncture was elevated at 35 cm of H2O. Computed tomography scan demonstrated a nondepressed occipital bone fracture. However, further imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging with angiogram/venogram, did not reveal any intracranial abnormalities. In particular, there was no evidence of sinus venous thrombosis. Given her presentation and signs of increased ICP, she was started on acetazolamide and improved dramatically. A thorough literature search was completed but yielded no information on infants with increased ICP after nondepressed skull fracture in the absence of radiographic findings to suggest a cause for the increase in pressure. Trauma alone can lead to increased ICP secondary to several processes, although this is expected in moderate to severe head trauma. Our case demonstrates that increased ICP can be present in infants with mild traumatic brain injury in the absence of intracranial pathology. This should be considered in patients who present with persistent vomiting that is refractory to antiemetics.

### Approach to patient with unilateral optic disc edema and normal visual function [^8190173e]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with swollen optic nerve head and normal visual function, optic disc drusen (ODD) is the most common diagnosis. The best tests for detecting ODD are funds autofluorescence and enhanced-depth imaging ocular coherence tomography (EDIOCT). After ODD has been ruled out, asymmetric papilledema should be assumed to be the cause and MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast and venography should be performed in all patients. It allows one to look for indirect signs of increased inctracranial pressure (ICP), optic perineuritis, and other inflammatory or compressive processes affecting optic nerve or its sheath such as optic nerve sheath meningioma. If imaging signs of raised ICP are present, lumbar puncture should be performed with measurement of opening pressure and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents in all patients with fever, meningismus or neurologic deficits as well as patients who are not in the typical demographic group for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Optic nerve sheath enhancement on MRI should prompt work-up for causes of optic perineuritis. When the appropriate neuroimaging is normal, the differential diagnosis is limited and ophthalmological consultation is necessary to determine whether other subtle ocular abnormalities are present on biomicroscopic and dilated fundus examination.

### Unusual presentation of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^50a54913]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension typically presents with holocephalic headache associated with nausea, vomiting and bilateral papilledema. Involvement of the sixth cranial nerve is relatively common. The involvement of other cranial nerves, however, is rare in this disorder. We describe a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who presented with episodic unilateral retro-orbital pain and multiple cranial nerve abnormalities without papilledema. Imaging studies excluded alternate diagnoses, and the immediate resolution of symptoms after lumbar puncture confirmed that these symptoms were due to intracranial hypertension. Atypical presentations of such a disabling yet treatable disorder is very important to recognise and address.

Discussion

Diagnosis of papilledema generates immediate concern for a life-threatening etiology, such as intracranial mass, obstructive hydrocephalus, meningitis, or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). However, our study found that most patients with papilledema have IIH as the underlying etiology, which is a diagnosis of exclusion often occurring in women of childbearing age with obesity. IIH is non–life-threateningand usually requires a less urgent evaluation unless there is severe papilledema with eminent risk of vision loss. In comparison, other etiologies of papilledema, such as intracranial tumor or CVST, often need rapid workup, diagnosis, and treatment. Knowing the probability of a critical diagnosis aids in the physician's counseling of the patient and can help determine the urgency of neuroimagingwith subsequent lumbar puncture, as appropriate.

To help guide the evaluating clinician, statistics on demographic characteristics and symptoms have been reported in the literature as evidence for or against a diagnosis of IIH. Among patients presenting with papilledema of unknown cause, our study found that 87% had papilledema related to IIH, while only 13% were from a secondary cause. Among secondary etiologies, only 2 patients (22%) met the IIH demographic characteristics and had no focal neurologic symptoms. Patients with IIH had a significantly higher BMI than those with a secondary cause of raised intracranial pressure, consistent with the findings of Blanch et al. Our results also showed a 95% chance of papilledema being attributable to IIH if the patient's demographic characteristics were in line with IIH. Conversely, when papilledema was present among patients not meeting IIH demographic characteristics, 37% of patients were found to have a cause other than IIH. We also found that patients with IIH presented more frequently with headaches, supporting prior studies demonstrating that IIH often presents with substantial headache-related disability over the preceding month.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend to perform an ophthalmological examination to confirm papilledema and assess the imminent risk of visual function. Obtain and record the following in the presence of papilledema:

- visual acuity

- pupil examination

- intraocular pressure to exclude hypotony, a rare cause for disc swelling

- formal visual field test

- dilated fundal examination to grade the severity of the papilledema and exclude ocular causes for disc swelling.

### Severe bilateral papilledema after sigmoid sinus constriction surgery: a case report [^d21e10b2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Papilledema is optic nerve head edema secondary to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurologic syndrome characterized by increased ICP without an identifiable cause. The clinical manifestations of secondary intracranial hypertension (SIH) and IIH are similar. Ocular symptoms usually include decreased central visual acuity, visual field defect, transient visual obscurations, and diplopia. Other symptoms include bilateral or unilateral pulsating tinnitus (PT), gait instability, headache, nausea, vomiting, spontaneous rhinoliquorrhea, dizziness, and disturbed concentration. The diagnosis of IIH is based on the exclusion of SIH. The diagnostic and therapeutic principles for patients with papilledema are to find any underlying cause, protect and save vision, and provide onward care from multidisciplinary, experienced clinicians. Various causes of SIH have been reported, for example, drug-induced SIH (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline), infectious factors (e.g. cryptococcal meningitis, Lyme disease), hormone-related conditions (e.g. primary or secondary aldosteronism), and other diseases (e.g. anemia, rheumatic system diseases). However, no intracranial hypertension was reported related to sigmoid sinus constriction surgery.

Here, we report an uncommon case of severe bilateral papilledema following sigmoid sinus constriction surgery in a 25-year-old female.

### Ocular manifestations of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review [^d301c854]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations

Fourteen studies reported clinical manifestations in the optic nerve, such as optic neuritis or neuropathy, optic atrophy or papilledema, all described in teenage females. The pathogenesis of optic neuritis in JSLE, as in adult SLE, primarily involves vaso-occlusion of small vessels, leading to subsequent demyelination. In cases exhibiting pure demyelination, research suggests that demyelination might result from a less severe form of ischaemic injury affecting small vessels. However, in more severe cases, there's evidence of axonal damage and necrosis alongside demyelination. Both unilateral and bilateral cases of optic neuropathy have been reported with bilateral being more frequent, according to a study conducted in adults. Unilateral disease is most likely caused by a focal thrombotic event that should be treated with anticoagulation, while bilateral involvement is suggested to be the result of systemic vasculitic process and should be treated with immunosuppression. Optic nerve involvement, when reported as papilledema, is usually combined with retinal changes in the context of intracranial hypertension.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelits optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part I: diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^4f108122]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

When to consider NMOSD? — Clinical characteristics

NMOSD must be considered as a differential diagnosis in all patients presenting with acute attacks of transverse myelitis and/or (unilateral or, less frequently, bilateral) acute ON, the two clinical hallmarks of NMOSD, but also in patients presenting with suspected encephalitis or brainstem encephalitis. Myelitis and ON may occur either simultaneously or, far more often, successively. The combination of myelitis and ON gave the disease its name.

Patients with suspected myelitis must be examined for sensory, motor (including respiratory), bladder/bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Moreover, pain should be assessed, ideally using structured questionnaires in addition to clinical examination. Pain, as an immediate or long-term sequela of myelitis, is highly prevalent in both AQP4-IgG-positive and AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD and includes neuropathic pain, painful tonic spasms, neuropathic pruritus, and spasticity-associated pain; dysesthesia (often girdle-like in the case of thoracic myelitis) and hyperalgesia/allodynia are frequent.

ON mostly leads to blurred vision, decline in visual acuity, headache, retrobulbar pain/pain upon eye movement, phosphenes, a relative afferent pupillary defect (if unilateral or asymmetrical), i.e. a positive Marcus-Gunn sign/swinging flashlight test, sometimes optic disk swelling/papilledema visible upon fundoscopy (a finding much more frequent in MOG-EM/MOGAD), visual field deficiency, and/or color desaturation. Both eyes must be examined, since both optic nerves may be affected simultaneously with only minor or even subclinical damage possible in one eye. However, bilateral ON, which is rare in MS, is possibly more common in MOG-EM/MOGAD than in NMOSD, at least at onset.

TYPICAL PRESENTATIONS OF IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

The most common and 'classic' presentation of IIH is headache and papilledema (Fig. 1). Over 90% of IIH patients are affected by headache, which is the key determinant of morbidity in IIH. The features of headache in IIH vary substantially and frequently has a migraine phenotype. Although headaches can improve with reduction in ICP, more than half of IIH patients complain of persistent chronic headache despite normalization of ICP. Papilledema is an 'outstanding objective finding' of IIH and is the key diagnostic criterion in IIH, which also incorporates brain imaging to rule out secondary causes of raised ICP, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, and normal CSF constituents (Table 1). Visual symptoms that may accompany papilledema include transient visual obscurations, blurred vision, and double vision due to abducens nerve palsy. Other associated symptoms of IIH include dizziness, pulsatile tinnitus, and cognitive impairment.

FIGURE 1
The clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Typical IIH presents with headache (indicated by lines inside the head) and papilledema (indicated by enlarged eyes), often accompanied by other symptoms of raised intracranial pressure and normal neurological examination. This is the most common presentation (roughly indicated by size of head). A subset of patients with IIH are relatively asymptomatic or have mild IIH. These patients are often incidentally found to have papilledema and, compared with patients with typical IIH, have fewer headaches, less severe papilledema, and lower cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Patients with IIH without papilledema (IIHWOP) have a chronic refractory headache syndrome. It is unclear if IIHWOP represents a variant of IIH where ICP is not elevated enough for papilledema to develop or a separate disorder of intracranial hypertension. IIH can also present with highly asymmetric or unilateral papilledema and other cranial nerve manifestations, including ocular motor nerve palsies, trigeminal neuropathy or neuralgia, and facial nerve dysfunction. With chronic intracranial hypertension, osseous changes can occur in the skull base predisposing to spontaneous skull base CSF leak, which presents with CSF rhinorrhea and headache. Osseous changes can also lead to formation of temporal meningoceles and encephaloceles, potentially acting as a nidus for temporal lobe epilepsy.

DISC EDEMA OR PSEUDOEDEMA?

Clinical history and fundoscopic examination cannot reliably distinguish disc edema from pseudoedema

In most cases of optic nerve head elevation, clinical history and optic nerve examination are not sufficient to make the correct diagnosis. There are many overlapping clinical characteristics, and patients can present with normal vision or relatively nonspecific visual disturbances (Table 1). Patients with ODD or papilledema commonly have normal central vision, whereas those with optic disc edema because of optic neuritis or AION typically have symptomatic vision loss.

On funduscopic examination, most causes of optic nerve head elevation look similar – the optic disc is full and elevated, and there is blurred disc margin and small cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio (Table 2). There may be venous congestion and dilation, peripapillary arteriolar irregularity or narrowing, and signs of ischemia. These are important signs of vascular compromise that should heighten awareness for risk of sudden vision loss.

CHAPTER 11 VISUAL, REFRACTIVE AND MOTILITY IMPAIRMENTS

11.1 What screening is necessary to detect visual and motility impairments in the different types of non-syndromic and syndromic craniosynostosis in a timely manner?

Introduction

Loss of vision in craniosynostosis is caused by optic atrophy secondary to papilledema in elevated ICP, primary optician atrophy, corneal abnormalities by lagophthalmos, or amblyopia secondary to strabismus or refractive abnormalities. Timely recognition and treatment are essential for vision retention.

Search and Selection

For the following specific questions, original scientific studies or systematic reviews of original scientific studies have been included:

1 What is the prevalence of vision and motility disorders in the different types of non-syndromic and syndromic craniosynostosis?
2 Which screening tests are most accurate?

In the Medline (OVID) and Embase databases, one overall search was conducted for studies on craniosynostosis. The search strategy is given in the annex to the guideline. After deduplication, the literature search yielded 2732 hits.

Given the large number of studies, the chair of the working group first selected those that met the following general selection criteria:

The pre-selected studies that met the specific selection criteria listed in the Table below are included in the literature summary of this chapter.

Summary of the Literature

Non-syndromic craniosynostosis

Four studies describe eye abnormalities in sagittal, metopic and unilateral coronal suture synostosis and cover small patient groups, shown in Table 1. 1–4 The patients from Vasco's article had no refractive abnormalities and all had a normal vision postoperatively for 12 months. 2

TABLE 1. Prevalence of Strabismus and Refractive Abnormalities in Non-syndromic Craniosynostosis.

In a series of 64 children with trigonocephaly from 2011 by Macintosh, 20 children (31%) have abnormal visual function. 5 Eighteen of these 20 children have a refractive abnormality for which glasses are indicated; 10 have strabismus. The refractive abnormality is mainly based on hyperopia.

### Absence of papilledema in large intracranial tumours [^b38ecac9]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Papilledema refers to optic disc edema occurring secondary to raised intracranial pressure. In patients with intracranial tumours, tumour size might be the expected predictor of whether or not papilledema will develop, however, this is not the case in clinical practice. We report a series of 5 patients with large intracranial tumours and no evidence of papilledema and discuss the potential factors which may contribute to the lack of optic disc edema in these cases. Development of papilledema depends on both the presence of elevated intracranial pressure and transmission of elevated pressure to the subarachnoid space within the optic nerve sheath and to the optic nerve itself. We discuss how intracranial tumours may influence the physiology of the surrounding tissues, cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and cerebral venous outflow and how individual anatomic variations, particularly within the optic nerve sheath and optic canal, likely play a role in development of papilledema.

Ophthalmological examination

Compression of optic nerve and optic nerve ischemia are the two major theories explaining papilledema caused by elevated ICP in IIH. Papilledema is one of the hallmarks for diagnosis of IIH. Even though, papilledema is commonly symmetric or only mildly asymmetric, significant asymmetry may be found in some patients and can be explained by difference in size of bony optic canals or variation of trabecular meshwork in subarachnoid space surrounding optic discs. Unilateral papilledema is not commonly reported.

Fundoscopic examination is very important to evaluate this condition. Frisén'scriteria has been widely accepted for grading severity of papilledema. It is very important to differentiate true papilledema from pseudoedema, which is the physiologic variant, or benign changes of the optic disc. Findings from funduscopic examination showed that the presence of retinal or choroidal folds is a pathognomonic sign of true papilledema. However, this finding was seen only in 23% of the patients with true papilledema. The combination of four features from funduscopic examination, including the swelling of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, peripapillary hemorrhages, papilla elevation, and congestion of peripapillary vessels, provides very good validity in differentiating true papilledema from pseudoedema (accuracy 93%, sensitivity 95%, and specificity 89%).

Optical coherence tomography is a noninvasive imaging tool used to evaluate optic nerve status including the severity of papilledema either by measuring fast retinal nerve fiber layer thickness or total retinal thickness. High-resolution three-dimensional T2-weighted imaging performed at submillimeter slice thickness can effectively detect papilledema. In diffusion-weighted imaging, hyperintensity of optic nerve head at diagnosis of IIH was found to be correlated with the severity of papilledema. Macular thickness is significantly reduced in patients with resolved chronic papilledema, which is also correlated with severity of visual field loss. Macular thickness may be an indicator of ganglion cell loss in IIH patients with papilledema.

Importance

The study of health conditions associated with papilledema will augment the clinical judgment of eye care professionals treating patients with optic disc edema in determining the urgency of additional evaluation and counseling patients accordingly.

Objectives

To determine the incidence, demographic characteristics, and etiologies of papilledema based on a unique records-linkage research platform; and to describe the demographic and clinical differences between patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and other causes of papilledema.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective population-based cross-sectional study of patients treated for papilledema at outpatient eye clinics in Olmsted County, Minnesota, using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Data were collected from January 1990 to December 2014 and analyzed from September 2018 to April 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Etiologies of papilledema, body mass index, incidence of headache, or localizing neurologic signs.

Results

Eighty-six patients were diagnosed with papilledema during the 24-year period, providing an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 2.5 individuals per 100 000 per year; 68 patients (79%) were women, 73 (85%) were white patients, and the median (range) age was 27.7 (6.2–64.2) years. Nineteen patients (22%) presented with a previously diagnosed attributable cause (eg, trauma or intracranial tumor). Among patients presenting with papilledema without a previously diagnosed attributable cause, 58 patients (87%) had IIH, and 9 patients (13%) were found to have a secondary cause of raised intracranial pressure, such as intracranial tumor, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or granulomatous meningitis. Patients with IIH had a higher median (range) body mass index (37.5 [20.4–55.7] vs 27.4 [16.6–40.1]; P = 0.003) and headache prevalence (54 of 58 patients [93%] vs 6 of 9 patients [67%]; P = 0.004) than patients with other causes of papilledema. Of 9 patients with papilledema but no IIH, 2 (22%) had localizing neurologic signs, such as gait abnormalities, hearing loss, focal weakness or numbness, visual field defects, or aphasia. Among 42 patients with demographic characteristics typically associated with IIH (female sex, with obesity, aged 15 to 45 years, and absent localizing neurologic signs or symptoms), 40 (95%) had papilledema that was associated with IIH. Conversely, among the 19 patients without these demographic characteristics, 7 (37%) had an alternative cause.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, most patients who presented to the eye clinic with papilledema without a previously known cause were found to have IIH. These patients were more likely to present with headaches and had statistically higher body mass index. Clinicians should take these findings into account when determining the pretest probability of a patient having IIH or an alternative cause of papilledema.

### Evaluation of optic canal anatomy and symmetry using CT [^5037798a]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Of 335 subjects in our study, 272 (81.2%) had symmetric optic canals, leaving 18.8% of the population with optic canals that differed more than 20% bilaterally. Sohan Hayreh in 1964 suggested that the optic canal was important in the transmission of CSF pressure from the cranial compartment to the orbital compartment. He suspected that this was the underlying reason for cases of unilateral or asymmetric papilloedema with increased ICP. In a study by Bidot et al of 559 adult patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, 20 patients had very asymmetric papilloedema. Of those 20 patients, eight patients had neuroimaging, which showed smaller optic canal on the side with lower grade oedema for all eight patients. Since asymmetry of canal size is associated with asymmetric pathology, establishing the prevalence of asymmetry informs clinical understanding of the potential latent predisposition towards asymmetrical pathology in a population. Wall and White studied 478 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and found the prevalence of highly asymmetric papilledema to be 10%. If asymmetry of minimum cross-sectional area is the underlying aetiology of asymmetric papilloedema, in this study, we found twice the amount of asymmetry compared with Wall and White prior. However, there is likely a gap of unknown magnitude between measurable optic canal minimum area asymmetry and the degree of minimum area asymmetry that results in appreciable asymmetric papilloedema.

### Bilateral optic disc edema with preserved visual function not related to papilledema [^41351410]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Bilateral optic disc edema (ODE) with preserved visual function is typically a result of papilledema, but the causes of this finding in the absence of raised intracranial pressure have not been systematically evaluated. The goal of this study was to determine the causes of bilateral ODE with preserved visual function not related to intracranial hypertension to help in developing a differential diagnosis for this finding. We retrospectively reviewed 221 consecutive patients presenting to a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology practice over a period of 2 years. Four patients met the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 53 years (range 43 to 63), 2 patients were men and 2 were women. The final diagnoses were bilateral optic perineuritis secondary to p-ANCA vasculitis, bilateral incipient non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), hypertensive emergency, and intermediate uveitis. The patient with NAION developed an inferior altitudinal defect 4 months after presentation, but all other patients maintained normal visual function. The ODE resolved in all cases at a mean follow-up of 4.5 months (range 3 to 6 months). Optic disc edema with preserved visual function may not be related to papilledema, and this series indicates that optic perineuritis, incipient NAION, hypertensive emergency, and intermediate uveitis be considered in the differential diagnosis of these cases.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^4036828f]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — ophthalmic findings and diagnostic performance are summarized as follows: In a systematic review of 20 observational studies including 973 children with AHT, retinal hemorrhages were seen in about 80% with a mean sensitivity of 75% for AHT, and specificity based on extent, distribution, and associated findings can be as high as 94%. Retinal folds may be unilateral or bilateral and occur in about 3% of clinical cases of AHT, with the incidence increasing to 23% to 42% in severe or fatal cases of AHT. Papilledema is found in less than 10% of patients with AHT and usually takes a minimum of 12 to 24 hours to develop in patients with increased intracranial pressure following head injury.

### Etiology of papilledema in patients in the eye clinic setting [^7461e634]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

Eighty-six patients were diagnosed with papilledema in an outpatient eye clinic setting during the 24-year study period, providing an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 2.5 individuals per 100 000 per year; 68 patients (79%) were women, 73 (85%) were white patients, and the median (range) age was 27.7 (6.2–64.2) years.

Of the 86 patients newly diagnosed with papilledema, 19 (22%) had a previously diagnosed attributable cause of papilledema. Among patients presenting with papilledema without a previously known cause, 58 (67%) were diagnosed with IIH, and 9 (10%) were found to have a secondary cause of raised intracranial pressure. The most common causes of papilledema without IIH were intracranial tumor, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (Table 1).

Comparison of Patients With IIH vs Patients With Papilledema From Other Causes

Compared with the 28 patients with papilledema from other causes of intracranial hypertension, the 58 patients with IIH were found more likely to be women (53 [91%] vs 15 [54%]; P < .001), have a higher median (range) BMI (37.5 [20.4–55.7] vs 26.9 [14.2–46.9]; P < .001), and have a headache on presentation (54 [93%] vs 19 [68%]; P = 0.004). No patients with IIH had localizing neurologic symptoms, while 7 patients (25%) with papilledema from non-IIH etiologies demonstrated them.

As per the Modified Dandy criteria for IIH, sixth nerve palsy was not considered a localizing neurologic finding. Within the IIH population, 12 patients (21%) experienced a sixth nerve palsy, while 9 cases (32%) were documented in the non-IIH population (P = 0.37). In the non-IIH population, 1 patient had skew deviation, which is an acquired vertical misalignment of the eyes indicating an asymmetric disruption of supranuclear input from the otolithic organs.

### A study of the causes of bilateral optic disc swelling in Japanese patients [^88f0d0a1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Using Kitasato University's Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology medical records and fundus photographs of the period December 1977 through November 2010, we retrospectively identified 121 outpatients who had been initially confirmed with bilateral disc swelling. We excluded patients without fundus photographic confirmation of disc swelling. This study population consisted of 54 males and 67 females with an average age of 38.2 years (range 2–76 years). We defined terms as follows: "disc swelling" was the collective term used to describe disc swelling or protrusion; "papillitis" denoted optic neuritis with inflammatory findings on the optic disc such as swelling/redness or dilatation of the retinal vessels; and "papilledema" indicated bilateral disc swelling with elevated intracranial pressure. The final diagnosis was judged by ophthalmologic examinations (including light reflex of the pupil, visual acuity, visual field, critical flicker frequency, and fundus angiography) and intracranial examinations by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance venography (MRV), or computed tomography (CT), and consultation with the Kitasato University Department of Neurology or Department of Neurosurgery.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^a8756e98]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss the clinical presentation and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Discussion

Visual alterations and headache are the two main symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, although additional features including cranial nerve palsies, cognitive deficits, olfactory deficits and tinnitus are not uncommon. The headache associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension frequently has a migrainous phenotype. The underlying cause of the disorder has not yet been elucidated. Several hypotheses have been postulated but none of them can explain the full clinical picture. Therapeutic options remain limited, focusing mainly on reduction in body weight and the reduction of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Conclusion

The accurate diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is essential as visual deterioration due to papilledema may be irreversible. Given its phenotypic similarity and frequent overlap with chronic migraine it is essential to consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the diagnostic workup of chronic headache; in particular, when considering its increasing prevalence. Understanding in detail the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associated headache would also allow study of current and future therapeutic options in a structured way.

### Transient bilateral oculomotor palsy in pseudotumor cerebri [^01287d51]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Pseudotumor cerebri is a clinical condition marked by papilledema, normal cerebrospinal fluid composition, normal or small ventricles on radiography, and absence of an intracranial mass. In this condition, headache, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, and diplopia are frequently observed. The cause is often unknown but can occur with certain drug ingestions or systemic inflammatory and metabolic diseases. The treatment is primarily focused on the correction of the underlying cause with measures to reduce the raised intracranial pressure. The most important complication is optic atrophy, which results in visual loss. The sixth cranial nerve is most commonly affected. The involvement of the third cranial nerve is distinctly unusual. The present report describes a unique case of bilateral oculomotor palsy with sparing of the papillary fibers. It resolved promptly on administration of acetazolamide.

MRI Characteristics

To evaluate the associations of MRI characteristics with the presence of at least unilateral papilledema, the patients were divided into those with and without papilledema (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). On their MRI at diagnosis, more patients with than without papilledema presented with unilateral (53 patients [66.3%] vs 10 patients [21.3%]) and bilateral (43 patients [53.8%] vs 5 patients [10.6%]) posterior globe flattening, unilateral (56 patients [68.3%] vs 21 patients [41.2%]) and bilateral (54 patients [65.9%] vs 17 patients [33.3%]) perioptic subarachnoid space distension, and unilateral (35 patients [30.4%] vs 2 patients [2.3%]) and bilateral (22 patients [19.1%] vs 1 patient [1.1%]) optic nerve disc protrusion (Table 2). The bulb width and length, optic nerve tortuosity, optic nerve canal diameter, optic nerve and optic nerve sheath calibers, and absolute diameter of the perineural subarachnoid space did not differ between these groups (Table 2). Three patients underwent contrast-enhanced MRI as part of extended diagnostic workup, and none showed enhancement of the optic nerve (data not shown).

The MRI characteristics of the pituitary gland are shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. No significant difference was observed between the groups, regardless of the definitions used and signs studied.

The MRI characteristics of the venous sinuses are shown in Table 3. More patients with than without papilledema presented with unilateral (75 patients [79.8%] vs 29 patients [46.8%]) and bilateral (53 patients [56.4%] vs 22 patients [35.5%]) transverse sinus stenosis. In addition, the index of transverse sinus stenosis was significantly higher in the former group. The frequencies of stenoses of other venous sinuses did not differ between groups (Table 3).

### A case of increased intracranial pressure after unilateral modified radical neck dissection [^6b409993]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to study case reports and review the world literature concerning increased intracranial pressure secondary to unilateral radical neck dissection.

Case Report

A male patient presented with a painless lump in the left side of his neck. Diagnostic investigation revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma and 4 x 2-cm left cervical lymph node. Total thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection on the left side that included removal of the internal jugular vein was undertaken. Eleven days after the operation, the patient presented with a history of headache and diplopia. Clinical examination showed bilateral papilledema and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. A computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance image of the brain was normal. Subsequent magnetic resonance venography revealed an aplastic contralateral transverse sinus.

Conclusion

Based on our case, vascular anomalies should be considered in any patient who exhibits signs of increased intracranial pressure after unilateral neck dissection.

### Acute bilateral vision loss secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis-induced intracranial hypertension: a case report [^412eb068]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CVT can present with an acute onset of bilateral vision loss. This is potentially reversible with prompt diagnosis and intervention. Prompt neuroimaging was pivotal in diagnosing CVT and guiding effective intervention. Ophthalmologists must be aware of such an uncommon presentation in patients with papilledema secondary to CVT. Multidisciplinary approach will be required for successful management in all such cases.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^fb746165]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus — optic disc (diabetic papillopathy and laser-related pallor): Diabetic papillopathy is a distinct clinical entity that must be distinguished from papilledema or other etiologies of optic disc swelling and is characterized by unilateral or bilateral hyperemic disc swelling that may present with or without an afferent pupillary defect or visual field defect; diffuse microangiopathy may be associated, there appears to be no correlation with the degree of diabetic retinopathy or the level of clinical control, and diabetic papillopathy is a risk factor for progression of diabetic retinopathy. Visual acuity is usually moderately reduced and the prognosis is good, with most individuals resolving without treatment within a year and visual acuity improving to a level of ≥ 20/30. Optic disc pallor can occur following panretinal laser photocoagulation and does not result in a change in the cup/disc ratio.

### Etiology of papilledema in patients in the eye clinic setting [^846366c1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

As per the Modified Dandy criteria for IIH, sixth nerve palsy was not considered a localizing neurologic finding. This was seen in roughly equal percentages within our patients with IIH and non-IIH causes of papilledema and is therefore not helpful in distinguishing causes of papilledema. Because of the sixth nerve's long intracranial course before exiting the skull and its dural tethering, it is vulnerable to intracranial pressure shifts, regardless of etiology.

The non-IIH etiologies of papilledema seen in our study included intracranial tumor, hemorrhage, meningitis, neurosarcoidosis, and CVST. These diseases can all be life-threatening and often require urgent, targeted treatment. Among the 4 patients presenting with papilledema secondary to an undiagnosed tumor, 2 had focal neurologic deficits; 1 had headache, sixth nerve palsy, sleepiness, vomiting; and 1 had no symptoms at presentation. Other studies have shown that isolated headache is an uncommon presentation of a brain tumor.

While our patients with CVST had symptoms isolated to raised intracranial pressure, CVST can also cause venous infarctions, severe neurologic deficits, and seizures. A diagnosis of CVST is important to make to minimize the risk of these more severe central nervous system complications through the initiation of anticoagulation.

All patients presenting with papilledema require neuroimaging. However, based on our results, those with typical IIH demographic characteristics and lack of other neurologic symptoms may not need neuroimaging as urgently, as long as the papilledema is not severe and vision threatening.

Limitations

This study has limitations, including the retrospective design, the racial homogeneity of the study population, and the small sample size of the non-IIH subgroup. Given the retrospective nature of this investigation, some patients had poor follow-up or incomplete medical records. With 90% of the study population identifying themselves as white patients, it may be difficult to extrapolate these results to other nonwhite populations. Lastly, the study had a small sample size within the non-IIH, unanticipated papilledema subgroup, and therefore was underpowered to evaluate some associations, including differences between men and women. Despite these limitations, we believe our study is unique in analyzing a population-based cohort for etiologies of papilledema in the outpatient setting. This study provides the relative frequency of etiologies of papilledema and the accompanying signs and symptoms, which can be used to counsel patients as the workup of the papilledema is initiated.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^efca6ee4]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

OPTIC DISC DRUSEN AS A COMPRESSIVE OPTIC NEUROPATHY

ODD are present in 0.3–2.0% of general population. ODD may be found incidentally in patients with no visual symptoms as part of a routine ophthalmic examination, or during workup for headache and optic nerve head elevation. ODD are by far most common in Caucasians. They are typically idiopathic but can occur in families with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. In addition, ODD can occur in the setting of systemic or ocular genetic syndromes (Table 1).

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema

Although the cause is unknown, ODD formation may be related to axonopathy or abnormal axonal transport in congenitally crowded optic discs, leading to axonal rupture and release of abnormal mitochondria that serve as a nidus for drusen formation. ODD is more common in congenital optic nerve dysplasia or genetically determined small scleral canal. ODD is typically present at birth or early childhood and increases in size and number over the adolescence and move from deep to superficial with increasing age. Over time, enlarged ODD can compress and compromise neighboring axons and blood supply, leading to visual field loss.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, more specifically with respect to follow-up, ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend to assess headache of all patients with or without papilledema to include the features of the headache/s (to aid characterization of the headache), headache frequency and severity and frequency of analgesic use.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema [^54f0c968]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by high cerebrospinal fluid pressure with no underlying structural or systemic cause. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema, although well-described in adults, is rarely reported in the pediatric population. The usual presentation is similar to that of chronic daily headache, with some features of migraine. However, treatment modalities are different, and specific therapy can lead to significant improvement in symptoms. We describe six children with chronic daily headache, who were diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema. The response to medical management was variable. One child required a lumboperitoneal shunt for persistent signs, with good surgical outcome.

### Isolated third cranial nerve palsy in benign idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^0847e679]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is marked by increased intracranial pressure without any accompanying evidence of clinical, imaging or laboratory findings of intracranial pathology. In addition to headache, nausea and vomiting, typical symptoms might also include diplopia, photophobia and blurred vision. Third nerve palsy is rarely linked to IIH, although sixth nerve palsy is reported in the majority of individuals with IIH. This paper describes the unique case of a woman patient in her 50s with solitary IIH-related oculomotor nerve palsy. Dilated pupils, ptosis and medial rectus palsy of the right side were observed during the neurological examination, and grade 1 papilledema was found during the fundus examination. Based on the features of elevated intracranial pressure observed on MRI/magnetic resonance venography and CT scans, IIH was recognised as the most plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms.

- pupil examination

- formal visual field assessment

- dilated fundal examination to grade the papilledema

- BMI.

Papilledema — consult patterns and triage outcomes indicate that at a major academic hospital in 2022, a total of 153 patients were evaluated and 89 (58%) had bilateral optic disc edema; a follow-up study using ED-based nonmydriatic fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) with remote teleconsultation reduced median ED/hospital length of stay by 56% and mostly avoided in-person ophthalmology consultation.

### Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease presenting as intracranial hypertension: a case report [^8c8a8496]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The production of autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) can cause a spectrum of autoimmune disorders, including optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, brainstem encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. In this study, we present the case of a 19-year-old woman with an unusual clinical presentation of intracranial hypertension (IH) and bilateral papilledema. The patient presented with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, which followed a relapsing, remitting course over several months. Serial CSF studies showed an increased opening pressure during clinical relapses. The CSF and serum tested positive for MOG immunoglobulin G antibodies. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain showed mild meningeal enhancement in the left parietal region with subtle underlying cortical hyperintensities, indicating possible fluid-attenuated inversion recovery variable unilateral enhancement of the leptomeninges. The patient responded well to immunosuppressive therapy using rituximab. The presentation of MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) as IH without optic neuritis is rare. This report presents the first description of a relapsing remitting course presenting each time with only symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, without developing any typical clinical manifestations of MOGAD.

### Anatomic assessment… [^374d3369]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Anatomic Assessment EXTERNAL STRUCTURES Clinicians should look for inflammation and erythema of the eyelids, making note of any lesions or abnormalities. A hordeolum is a tender, inflamed nodule and can be observed with careful inspection of the external or internal eyelid. The upper lid should be everted if a corneal abrasion is suspected to look for a foreign body. Orbital cellulitis presents as unilateral erythema, swelling, and ptosis of the eyelid, with associated pain with eye movement and decreased visual acuity. 8 The eyelid and surrounding region should also be inspected for rashes or vesicles. Conjunctival or eyelid vesicles occur in about one-half of patients with HSV keratitis, 30 whereas herpes zoster ophthalmicus leads to associated pain and vesicular lesions appearing in a larger dermatome pattern on the forehead, nose, and upper eyelid.

3. PUPIL Normal pupillary size is 2 to 4 mm. Each pupil should constrict with consensual and direct light. Anisocoria of less than 1 mm occurs in up to 20% of the general population. 33 Anisocoria associated with eye pain can be a sign of anterior uveitis. A fixed dilated pupil at 4 to 6 mm can occur with acute angle-closure glaucoma. ANTERIOR UVEA The iris and ciliary body make up the anterior uvea. Inflammation of one or both of these structures is considered anterior uveitis. Although hypopyon can often be seen without magnification, a slit lamp is necessary for adequate evaluation.

3 The hallmark of acute anterior uveitis is the presence of white blood cells floating in the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber and a cloudy appearance consistent with a proteinaceous flare. Symptoms include achy eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision in the involved eye. 25, 32.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^be492de2]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Optic nerve head elevation is an important physical examination finding in the evaluation of patients with visual disturbances or vision loss. It may be associated with optic disc edema or not (pseudoedema). Common causes of optic nerve head elevation because of optic disc edema include elevated intracranial pressure (papilledema), optic neuritis (papillitis), diabetic or hypertensive papillitis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), neuroretinitis, uveitis, compression, or infiltration. Excellent reviews on different causes of optic disc edema have been published elsewhere.

An important cause of optic disc pseudoedema is optic disc drusen (ODD), which are acellular, extracellular concentric mucoprotein deposits that are often calcified and found in the unmyelinated optic nerve. An apparent fullness of the optic disc may also be because of congenitally anomalous optic disc. These structural changes of the optic disc are not neurological emergencies and do not require extensive and sometimes invasive testing, in contrast to optic disc edema or papilledema. However, careful ophthalmic assessment is important as these patients are at risk of vision loss. Multimodal imaging provides information beyond the physical examination and can help narrow down differential diagnosis.

This review aims to: describe key characteristics of ODD, compare clinical characteristics and key ophthalmic imaging features of ODD, papilledema, and optic disc edema, and provide an update regarding ODD and patients with concurrent ODD and optic disc edema. Evaluation and recognition of key features of ODD and different causes of optic disc edema will ensure that patients receive appropriate diagnostic workup and treatment.

### A young woman with blurred vision and distal paresthesias [^f593f73a]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old woman presented with blurred vision and distal paresthesias. Her initial evaluation revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema with distal lower-extremity sensory and motor deficits and electrodiagnostic evidence of a length-dependent mixed demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy. The results of routine diagnostic testing, including laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture, were nondiagnostic. A targeted biopsy was ultimately required for diagnosis. In this article, we discuss the differential diagnosis and outline the clinical evaluation indicated for a patient presenting with demyelinating polyneuropathy and concurrent papilledema.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^e2254ab0]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — retinal findings and diagnostic performance are characterized by the statement that retinal hemorrhages are the most frequent and most sensitive acute sign of AHT, and in a systematic review of 20 observational studies including 973 children retinal hemorrhages were seen in about 80% of children with a mean sensitivity of 75% for AHT; the extent, distribution, and pattern determine specificity, which can be as high as 94% for abuse. Ocular findings may include retinal folds, retinoschisis, papilledema, and optic nerve sheath and orbital fat hemorrhage on autopsy. Retinal folds may be unilateral or bilateral and occur in about 3% of clinical cases of AHT, increasing to 23% to 42% in severe or fatal cases. Papilledema is found in less than 10% of patients with AHT; it usually takes a minimum of 12 to 24 hours to develop after head injury, so if present on initial presentation it may suggest delay in seeking care, and papilledema is an ominous finding associated with high mortality. Poor vision on presentation, decreased pupillary response, papilledema, and severe retinal hemorrhages and retinal folds are ophthalmologic findings of AHT associated with increased mortality, and longer-term sequelae include optic nerve atrophy and retinal scarring.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^22882b4d]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optic nerve head elevation can be associated with vision loss. This review provides an update regarding key features of optic disc drusen (ODD) compared with papilledema from increased intracranial pressure and optic disc edema from other causes.

Recent Findings

Clinical history and funduscopic examination are not sufficient to correctly diagnose different causes of optic nerve head elevation. Multimodal ophthalmic imaging is noninvasive and should be used as first-line diagnostic testing to distinguish optic disc edema or papilledema from pseudoedema. Advanced ophthalmic imaging, including enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) and autofluorescence imaging, can visualize ODD at high resolution and determine whether there is optic disc edema. OCT angiography does not require contrast and can rapidly visualize papillary, peripapillary, and macular microvasculature and identify important vascular biomarker of ischemia and, potentially, visual prognosis.

Summary

Multimodal ophthalmic imaging can help in the diagnosis of ODD and optic disc edema and identify patients at high risk of vision loss and neurological issues in order to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^98e2d106]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — examination should include a complete ophthalmic evaluation with emphasis on best-corrected acuity, a check for afferent defect, and color acuity to screen for orbital and cavernous sinus pathology; a sensorimotor examination demonstrating incomitant esotropia, typically greater at distance, possibly associated with abduction nystagmus; and a fundus examination to look for papilledema or optic atrophy as indicators of elevated intracranial pressure.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^641b6af6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The diagnosis of patients with optic nerve head elevation should focus on a combination of history, neuro-ophthalmic examination, and multimodal ophthalmic imaging. This careful approach can help distinguish ODD, papilledema, and optic disc edema of various types and avoid unnecessary brain MRI and invasive lumbar puncture procedure in those without optic disc edema. Patients with ODD may have concurrent optic disc edema from papilledema or AION, so clinical suspicion and multimodal ophthalmic imaging are critical to correctly identify these patients who are at high risk of vision loss. In the future, more studies are needed to validate imaging biomarkers of optic nerve head elevation and identify features that are not just diagnostic but also prognostic of visual outcome.

### PAPILLEDEMA… [^aeee289b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

BEFORE describing the fundus conditions simulating papilledema, it is advantageous to discuss the important clinical features of papilledema that will be used as criteria. In using the term "papilledema, " we limit ourselves in this paper to the edema of the optic disk due to increased intracranial pressure. The clinical features will be discussed under the following headings: appearance of the fundus; the normal blind spot; histological appearance in papilledema and mode of effect on the blind spot; visual impairment due to papilledema; differences in responses of various optic disks to increased intracranial pressure. APPEARANCE OF FUNDUS IN PAPILLEDEMA Typical, well-developed papilledema usually offers no challenge to the trained observer.

### Etiology of papilledema in patients in the eye clinic setting [^f1de63aa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Comparison of Patients With IIH vs Without IIH in Cohort With Papilledema Undiagnosed at Time of Presentation

After excluding the 19 patients who presented to the eye clinic with a previously known cause of papilledema, 67 patients presented with an unknown etiology. Among these patients, 58 (87%) were diagnosed with IIH and 9 (13%) were ultimately found to have an intracranial pathology causing increased intracranial pressure (Table 1).

Two of the 9 patients without IIH (22%) had localizing neurologic deficits in addition to papilledema, which were found to be from intracranial tumors (Table 2). The median (range) BMI of the 9 patients with non-IIH etiologies (27.4 [16.6–40.1]) was significantly lower than that of patients with IIH (37.5 [20.4–55.7]) (P = 0.003). Two-thirds of patients without IIH etiologies presented with headaches (67%; 95% CI, 30%-93%), compared with 93% (95% CI, 83%-98%) of patients with IIH (P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in visual acuity upon presentation between patients with and without IIH.

Table 2.
Characteristics of Patients With Papilledema Undiagnosed at Time of Presentation

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); IIH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Of the 9 patients without IIH, 2 (22%; 95% CI, 3%-60%; P = 0.02) had demographic characteristics typically associated with IIH (female sex, with obesity, aged 15 to 45 years, and absent localizing neurologic signs or symptoms), constituting 3% of patients presenting with papilledema of unknown cause. In comparison, 40 of 52 patients (77%) with IIH had these characteristics (P = 0.003). (Six patients missing BMI data or with an unknown obesity status were excluded.) Among patients with demographic characteristics usually associated with IIH, 40 of 42 cases of papilledema (95%) resulted from IIH. Conversely, among patients without these demographic characteristics, 7 of 19 patients (37%) had an alternative cause.

### Ocular manifestations of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review [^840bdd95]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Papilledema

Six studies mention papilledema in children with JSLE, all of them reporting concurrent CNS involvement. In a 12-year retrospective cohort study from Brazil involving 117 patients, Fraga et al. describe papilledema in three patients concurrent with arterial hypertension, while Georgakopoulos et al. mention another case of bilateral papilledema in a 14-year-old female, attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to JSLE. Dorronsoro et al. describe a 15-year-old female showing bilateral papilla oedema with partial macular star more evident unilaterally, as a result of bilateral neuroretinitis, alongside with systemic symptoms at disease presentation. Neuroretinitis resolved after 7 months of immunosuppressive treatment.

Cases of bilateral disc oedema are also presented by Chan et al. and Hackett et al. Chan et al. report a case of an 8-year-old female, where funduscopic evaluation revealed bilateral disc oedema with absent spontaneous venous pulsation. The patient's history included noncommunicating hydrocephalus secondary to stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Hackett et al. describe an 11-year-old female, who later passed away, with optic neuritis presenting with ptosis, retrobulbar pain and loss of vision bilaterally, with progressive disc oedema and flame haemorrhages, congested veins, and retinal oedema.

Lanewalla et al. mentioned a case of bilateral papilledema and abducens nerve palsy in a 14-year-old female, also causing strabismus and acute-onset diplopia. These were suspected to be the result of lupus cerebritis and of raised intracranial pressure. Drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, as opposed to immunosuppression, proved beneficial.

Optic atrophy

In a retrospective cohort study that evaluated data from a 25-year period in Greece, one patient out of 47 JSLE patients developed optic atrophy. Optic atrophy was also mentioned to be a sign of JSLE ocular damage in a retrospective study in Egypt, as well as in a multi-centre cohort study by Ravelli et al. They reported 387 cases of JSLE, of which 10.9% had ocular involvement, including 4.4% had retinal changes or optic atrophy. Similarly, Salah et al. showed that among 148 patients, 6.1% had ocular involvement, of which 2.7% of retinal change or optic atrophy.

### The expanding spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^ba0ce036]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Once considered a rare and often difficult diagnosis in the era predating routine MRI, idiopathic intracranial hypertension has become an everyday concern in ophthalmology and neurology clinics where, especially in the latter, essentially every young overweight woman with headaches is initially presumed to have IIH. Has the diagnosis of IIH become too easy, and are we over-diagnosing IIH in this period of an accelerating obesity crisis? Or are we actually missing cases of IIH because they do not fit the classic clinical profile? We think it is both: at the same time IIH is being diagnosed in excess in obese women without papilledema, often resulting in unnecessary procedures, inappropriate treatment and even iatrogenic complications, the spectrum of this disorder is expanding to include a broad array of clinical presentations that involve multiple specialists beyond just the ophthalmologist and neurologist.

### Severe bilateral papilledema after sigmoid sinus constriction surgery: a case report [^01b9478b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 25-year-old woman presented to the ophthalmology department complaining of bilateral blurred vision, headache, and vomiting from one month ago. The patient had a history of right-side PT for one year and surgery for PT one month before. Her review of systems was negative. Her family and social history were insignificant. Her body mass index (BMI) was 21 kg/m 2.

We performed a comprehensive neuro-ophthalmic examination of the patient. Ocular examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) bilateral 20 of 20, with normal color vision and pupillary light responses. Extraocular motility testing showed no abnormality. Anterior segment examination was within normal limits. Fundus examination showed severe bilateral papilledema with blurred margins (Fig. 1). Bilateral Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of optic discs showed intraretinal fluid tracking from the disc and abnormal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness increases. Automated visual field 30 − 2 revealed mild loss of sensitivity on the total deviation plot bilaterally (Fig. 2). The flash visual electrophysiology showed normal latency and amplitude in both eyes with 1.0 Hz.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^9bb1ec32]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Examination — 3rd nerve palsy assessment specifies that a comprehensive eye examination should be performed paying particular attention to the sensorimotor examination, evidence of ptosis and anisocoria, and pupillary responses in bright and dim illumination. It should also include a fundus examination to evaluate for the presence of papilledema or optic atrophy. Evaluation of the 3rd nerve palsy depends on the presumed location of the lesion and is based on other accompanying neurologic findings, and isolated 3rd nerve palsy, however, is what most clinicians encounter. The important characteristics are whether the pupil is involved and the extent of the motility disorder and ptosis; a classic pupil-sparing 3rd nerve palsy has normal pupillary function, complete ptosis, and complete (related) motility dysfunction, and in this situation, the etiology is almost always secondary to microvascular.

### Acute bilateral vision loss secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis-induced intracranial hypertension: a case report [^ad3598e9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) results from the elevation of the pressure within the cranium. Excessive cerebrospinal fluid production or obstruction of its outflow leads to raised ICP. It can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Most cases are due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, space-occupying lesions, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), infections, cerebrovascular accidents, aneurysms, and systemic medications. CVT is an uncommon type of stroke with an incidence of 3–4 cases per million adults. It is associated with raised intracranial tension presenting as a new-onset headache in 70 to 90% of cases, and less frequently with papilledema and abducens nerve palsy. Visual acuity and colour vision are usually preserved in the early stages of papilledema. Chronic papilledema can result in optic atrophy with progressive vision loss. We report a rare case of CVT where a malignant rise in ICP led to the acute onset of bilateral vision loss.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^22b62d38]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — retinal findings takeaway points state that retinal hemorrhages do not spontaneously occur in healthy children after the postnatal period and are the most frequent and most sensitive acute ocular sign of AHT; they can be bilaterally symmetric, bilaterally asymmetric, or unilateral. Retinal hemorrhages that are numerous, present in multiple layers of the retina, and extend peripherally beyond the posterior pole are highly specific (94%) for severe head trauma and particularly AHT. Retinal hemorrhages cannot be accurately dated to determine the precise timing of the traumatic event, but the rate of resolution of different types of retinal hemorrhage can sometimes provide general guidance as to injury timing. Retinal hemorrhages are rare in the absence of neuroimaging findings or other evidence of head trauma; thus, dedicated retinal examinations are not needed in children evaluated for physical abuse in whom there is an absence of neuroimaging findings or other evidence of head trauma. Other ocular clinical findings may include vitreous hemorrhage, retinal folds, retinoschisis, and papilledema.

### Effect of optic nerve sheath fenestration on papilledema of the operated and the contralateral nonoperated eyes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1d3212d7]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) on papilledema grade in the operated eyes and the contralateral nonoperated fellow eyes in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Design

Retrospective review.

Participants

A total of 78 patients underwent ONSF, and 20 patients served as controls.

Methods

Charts of patients with IIH who had ONSF at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics were reviewed for age, gender, body mass index, and clinical findings. Optic disc photographs were graded by a masked observer using the Frisén papilledema grading scale at preoperative baseline and postoperatively at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to examine the change in papilledema grade in both operated and nonoperated eyes at each time point.

Main Outcome Measures

Grade of papilledema.

Results

Sixty-two patients (52 women and 10 men) with a mean age of 32 years (range, 13–57 years) underwent unilateral ONSF. The median grade of papilledema for operated and nonoperated eyes was 3 and 2, respectively, at preoperative baseline. Postoperatively the grade was 2 in each eye at 2 weeks (P < 0.0001 and < 0.0002 for operated and nonoperated eyes, respectively), 1 in each eye at 3 months (P < 0.0001 for both operated and nonoperated eyes), 1 in each eye at 6 months (P < 0.0001 for both operated and nonoperated eyes), and 0.5 and 1 for operated and nonoperated eyes, respectively, at 12 months follow-up (P < 0.0001 for both operated and nonoperated eyes). There was no significant difference in grade of disc edema or reduction of disc edema on the basis of age, gender, or body mass index.

Conclusions

Unilateral ONSF significantly decreases the grade of papilledema in both ipsilateral (operated) and contralateral (unoperated) eyes. The reduction of the papilledema and the stability of visual field in the contralateral (nonoperated) eyes suggest that bilateral ONSF may not always be necessary in patients with bilateral visual loss and papilledema due to IIH.

### Revised diagnostic criteria for the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome in adults and children [^e4df4984]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS) may be primary (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) or arise from an identifiable secondary cause. Characterization of typical neuroimaging abnormalities, clarification of normal opening pressure in children, and features distinguishing the syndrome of intracranial hypertension without papilledema from intracranial hypertension with papilledema have furthered our understanding of this disorder. We propose updated diagnostic criteria for PTCS to incorporate advances and insights into the disorder realized over the past 10 years.

### Magnetic resonance imaging signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^0c394a27]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause, resulting in typical symptoms such as headache and impairment of the optic nerve due to papilledema. It is rare in the general population but disproportionately affects women of childbearing age with obesity (20 cases per 100 000 population). Currently, the diagnosis of IIH is based on expert opinion, as summarized in the 2013 diagnostic criteria, and requires (1) normal neurological examination findings except abducens nerve palsy, (2) normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain parenchymal and cerebral venography findings, (3) normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, (4) elevated lumbar puncture opening pressure (≥ 25 cm H₂O in adults), and (5) papilledema. However, when papilledema is absent but conditions 1 to 4 are fulfilled, patients are classified as having IIH without papilledema when presenting with abducens nerve palsy or as having suspected IIH without papilledema when presenting with 3 of 4 MRI criteria (empty sella, flattening of the posterior aspect of the globe, distension of the perioptic subarachnoid space with or without a tortuous optic nerve, and transverse venous sinus stenosis) instead. However, the diagnostic impact of these MRI criteria is vague, because they are neither evidence based nor further specified, resulting in variable interpretation and application; furthermore, they are often difficult to assess with standard MRI examination and require specific thin-slice orbital or pituitary gland sequences. Because of these pitfalls, up to 40% of patients examined outside tertiary centers receive an incorrect diagnosis. An evidence-based update of the 2013 diagnostic criteria, in which IIH is defined by the presence of 2 of 3 findings (papilledema, opening pressure ≥ 25 cm H₂O, and ≥ 3 neuroimaging signs), has been suggested recently. With this update, abducens nerve palsy was removed from the criteria, and empty sella was replaced by suprasellar CSF herniation into more than one-third of the sella turcica. In addition, an increasingly large panel of neuroimaging signs associated with IIH has been proposed, although its use has yielded contradictory results, and these signs have not been validated in a prospective, clinical practice patient cohort. Here, we blindly evaluated a comprehensive panel of neuroimaging signs for IIH diagnosis in a well-defined, meticulously characterized population of patients with clinically suspected IIH and validated our results internally in parts of our patient cohort, as well as externally in patient cohorts from other university hospitals.

### Hyperintense optic nerve heads on diffusion-weighted imaging: a potential imaging sign of papilledema [^e53f2238]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Changes at the optic nerve head on DWI in the presence of papilledema have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if hyperintensity of ON heads on DWI is associated with papilledema.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective study, 19 patients (4 men, 15 women; median age, 32 years) with papilledema and 20 control participants (7 men, 13 women; median age, 48 years) who had undergone prior MR imaging of the brain were identified. Two neuroradiologists blinded to the diagnosis independently reviewed the DWI for the presence of hyperintense signal at the ON head of each eye. If present, they graded the signal as mild or prominent. Groups with and without papilledema were compared for the prevalence of ON head hyperintensity by using the Fisher exact test, with analyses performed both for groups of patients and for individual eyes. Presence of ON head hyperintensity was also studied as a function of Frisen papilledema grade on fundoscopy, when available.

Results

Hyperintensity of the ON heads on DWI was significantly associated with papilledema (P = 0.001). For the 2 readers, hyperintensity at both ON heads was 26.3% and 42.1% sensitive and 100% specific in the detection of papilledema. The presence of unilateral ON head hyperintensity was not specific for papilledema and was invariably graded as mild when seen in the control group. Patients with higher papilledema grades had a higher prevalence of hyperintensity at the ON heads.

Conclusions

Hyperintensity of the ON heads on DWI can serve as a useful imaging marker for papilledema, especially if bilateral. Its absence, however, does not exclude papilledema.

### Twin and triple peaks papilledema [^0505039f]. Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe 2 adult patients who presented with papilledema after band atrophy (i.e., twin and triple peaks papilledema).

Design

Retrospective small case series.

Participants

Two outpatients.

Methods

Observations made on 2 patients whose cases were reviewed in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic.

Results

The first patient had a pituitary tumor presenting with papilledema, causing a triple peaks clinical sign. Color photographs, optical coherence tomograms, and magnetic resonance images are shown. The second patient developed twin peaks papilledema due to a chiasmal glioma causing secondary raised intracranial pressure.

Conclusion

Twin peaks papilledema is a rare clinical sign that may develop in adults as well as in children. The first report and optical coherence tomography features of triple peaks papilledema illustrate a new clinical sign.

### A study of the causes of bilateral optic disc swelling in Japanese patients [^fbc12ef3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

In children, optic neuritis is typically bilateral. Although our study found two adult patients with bilateral optic neuritis, the current study identified no children who presented with this condition. However, bilateral optic neuritis occurred in 13 children admitted to our hospital for treatment between 1999 and 2010. This was thought to be because only subjects with "bilateral disc swelling" were targeted in this study, and the disease name listed for these patients from the beginning was "bilateral optic neuritis".

With regard to funduscopic differentiation between true optic disc edema (disc swelling) and pseudo optic disc edema (pseudopapillitis), Carta et aldescribe that peripapillary retinal folds seem to be related exclusively to optic disc edema. In our study, the diagnosis of pseudopapillitis was done with all normal patient indications of light reflex, visual acuity, critical frequency, and visual field.

One disease that typically involves elevated ICP despite normal CT or MRI findings is CVST. Thus, combining MRV with these standard imaging modalities would be useful when attempting to diagnose this condition. MRV can be used to confirm venous filling defects because it enables clear visualization of the major intracranial veins and cranial sinus without the use of a contrast agent.

de Bruijn et alreported finding papilledema in 23 of 56 CVST patients (41%), with poor outcomes observed in those patients who presented with intracerebral hemorrhage or with some degree of impaired consciousness. Although previous studies have asserted that Behçet's disease is complicated by CVST, and Al-Fahad et alreported finding papilledema in eleven of 40 patients with neuro-Behçet's disease (25.7%), none of the CVST patients in the present study had Behçet's disease (Table 5).

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^2643c328]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma — papilledema and retinal hemorrhage patterns are characterized by infrequent papilledema and pattern differences from nontraumatic causes, with the report noting that "Papilledema occurs infrequently in AHT (less than 10%)", and that "Nontraumatic causes of retinal hemorrhages usually occur in patterns different from head trauma".

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome presenting as papilledema [^0d8789cb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a central nervous system pathology characterized by headaches, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss. The syndrome is a clincoradiologic diagnosis, which mandates neuroimaging. The aim of this study is to describe a case of asymptomatic PRES in which the only sign was incidental papilledema found on ophthalmologic examination. A thin 19-year-old female G1P1 s/p natural spontaneous vaginal delivery was referred to our emergency department (ED) by the ophthalmology clinic after finding bilateral papilledema on fundoscopic examination. She denied any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, as well as headache, lightheadedness, visual changes, or blurriness. Lumbar puncture was performed, and opening pressure was found to be greater than 55 cmH₂O. After collecting Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for routine analysis, approximately 15 to 20 mL of CSF was drained. After several revisits to the ED, the neurology clinic was consulted. The magnetic resonance imaging ordered by the neurology clinic, as read by the radiologist, showed a focal lesion in splenium of the corpus callosum and diffusion restriction suggestive of acute infarction (although the anatomical location and age would be unusual). This is an atypical manifestation of PRES. The myriad of clinical symptoms and presentations of PRES has become more identifiable as more case reports of the syndrome are published. This case demonstrates that this atypical syndrome may present in an atypical way. The patient may be asymptomatic, and although imaging defines the diagnosis, a complete physical examination must not be ignored because the only sign may be papilledema.

Venous outlet obstruction has recently been reported to be a potentially treatable cause of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). In the English-language literature only 18 cases, all from the UK and Australia, involving the use of transverse sinus stenosis stent treatment for BIH have been reported; the youngest patient to receive treatment was a 17-year-old girl. The authors report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with headache, papilledema, decreased visual acuity, and diploplia who underwent successful unilateral transverse sinus stenosis stenting and experienced complete resolution of symptoms.

### The swollen optic nerve: an approach to diagnosis and management [^4c9bba8d]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of swollen optic nerves differs according to whether the swelling is unilateral or bilateral, or whether visual function is normal or affected. Patients with a unilaterally swollen optic nerve and normal visual function most likely have optic nerve head drusen. Patients with abnormal visual function most likely have demyelinating optic neuritis or non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Patients with bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads and normal visual function most likely have papilloedema, and require neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture. However, if their visual function is affected, the most likely causes are bilateral demyelinating optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein optic neuritis: these patients require investigating with contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits.

Figure 1.
A 26-year-old female presenting bilateral papilledema related to post COVID-19 infection. The optic nerve head OCT B scans show elevation of the optic disc in both eyes ((a) and (b)). The peripapillary OCT circle scans show increased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in all sectors ((c) and (d)). Retinography ((e) and (f)) showing papilledema and haemorrhage (arrow) in the right eye and papilledema in the left eye. In both eyes, oedema of the optic disc with high elevation is observed.

The clinical and laboratory characteristics of this clinical series are presented in Table 1. In this study, 56 consecutive COVID-19 patients underwent lumbar puncture for different neurological conditions during the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 13 of these (23.2%) had a new, persistent headache that prompted a CSF analysis. The most frequent complaint in these patients was a throbbing, holocranial, or bilateral intense daily headache. In four patients, there was a previous history of migraine without aura. However, the current headache was different, with more intense and more persistent pain than usual for them. Other relevant neurological complaints in these patients were peripheral facial palsy in one and blurred vision in three, with documented papilledema in two; all other patients had normal fundoscopy.

### Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: current perspectives [^5ae292ff]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical features of vision loss

LHON usually presents as painless, subacute, central visual loss in one eye. Weeks to months later, the second eye becomes involved, with a median delay of 6–8 weeks. Within 1 year, 97% of those affected have involvement of the second eye, such that a patient presenting with a unilateral optic neuropathy for longer than 1 year is highly unlikely to suffer from LHON-related vision loss. Approximately 25% have bilateral simultaneous vision loss, but in some individuals it may be that vision loss in the first eye is not noticed before the second eye becomes involved.

The majority of individuals progress to a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Due to preferential involvement of the papillomacular bundle, the earliest visual field abnormality is a cecocentral scotoma (Figure 1), which can enlarge to become a larger central defect. Dyschromatopsia is common and usually parallels the degree of visual acuity loss. Pupillary light reflexes usually remain intact due to relative sparing of melanopsin-containing RGCs. This subset of RGCs are thought to be more resistant to metabolic insult from mitochondrial dysfunction when compared with all RGCs. In cases of asymmetric bilateral or monocular vision loss, however, a relative afferent pupillary defect can occur.

On fundus examination preceding or during the acute stage of vision loss, there can be characteristic findings, including optic disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectatic blood vessels, vascular tortuosity, and swelling of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) around the optic disc (Figure 2A) without corresponding leakage on fluorescein angiography (sometimes termed "pseudoedema"). The fundus can look normal in 20%–40% of those in the active stage of vision loss, which can delay diagnosis. Eventually, as the disease progresses, disc hyperemia, peripapillary telangiectasias, and pseudoedema resolve. Approximately 6 weeks after onset of vision loss, optic disc pallor develops and can be accompanied by cupping of the optic disc, reflecting the death of RGCs that occurs in the chronic atrophic phase (Figure 2B).

### Challenges in identifying papilledema amid myopic peripapillary atrophy in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and high myopia: a case report [^a2cbe67f]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease entity characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause and presents predominantly in young obese females. Papilledema, optic disc swelling, and high intracranial pressure are critical diagnostic indicators of IIH. However, diagnosing papilledema can be challenging in patients with preexisting ocular conditions, such as high myopia. High myopia with a tilted optic disc and an elevated nasal disc, posteriorly displaced or blurred, frequently mimics optic disc swelling. Conversely, the identification of papilledema can be complicated when myopia is accompanied by severe peripapillary atrophy. The literature has documented the diagnostic difficulties encountered in such scenarios, emphasizing the need for a careful approach to timely and accurate diagnosis. This case report aimed to shed light on this diagnostic dilemma through a detailed examination of a patient with high myopia and IIH.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — retinal hemorrhage takeaway points emphasize that retinal hemorrhages do not spontaneously occur in healthy children after the postnatal period; they are the most frequent and most sensitive acute ocular sign of AHT and can be bilaterally symmetric, bilaterally asymmetric, or unilateral; when numerous, multilayered, and extending peripherally beyond the posterior pole they are highly specific (94%) for severe head trauma and particularly AHT; they cannot be accurately dated to the precise time of injury, though resolution patterns can offer general timing guidance; they are rare in the absence of neuroimaging findings or other evidence of head trauma and dedicated retinal examinations are not needed in such children evaluated for physical abuse; and other ocular findings may include vitreous hemorrhage, retinal folds, retinoschisis, papilledema, and at autopsy optic nerve sheath hemorrhage.

### Papilledema in patients with apert, crouzon, and pfeiffer syndrome: prevalence, efficacy of treatment, and risk factors [^129d1f2e]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis are at risk for elevated intracranial pressure because of various physiologic and anatomic abnormalities. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of papilledema in syndromic craniosynostosis, to evaluate the results of the treatment, and to examine the risk factors. This is a retrospective study on 84 patients with Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer syndrome. Papilledema was defined as blurring of the margins of the optic disk. The association between clinical symptoms, beaten-copper pattern on skull radiograph, ventricular dilatation on computed tomography scan, and papilledema was assessed. Papilledema was present in 51% of the patients. No relation between specific clinical symptoms and papilledema was found. The significant associations were complex craniosynostosis, exorbitism, and ventricular dilatation. The prevalence of papilledema in patients with Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer syndrome is high, not only before cranial decompression but also after vault expansion. Annual fundoscopy is recommended to screen for papilledema. We consider that early decompressive surgery (within the first year of age) prevents the development of papilledema and, most likely, elevated intracranial pressure.

### Aqueous floaters in the differential diagnosis of papillitis and papilledema… [^ca02a525]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The basic difference between papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure and papillitis was first described by Paton and Holmes1 in 1911. Since then there have been various other references to the same subject in the literature. 2–5 The outstanding features which distinguish the two entities are concerned with the type of pain as well as the type of visual impairment. The funduscopic picture as well as the laterality of the findings are also of importance. For purposes of this paper, these well-known points will be reviewed very briefly. Pain In optic neuritis the pain is in or behind the eye and increases with movement of or pressure on the globe. It either precedes the visual disturbance or accompanies it. In papilledema the pain is that of a generalized headache usually preceding the appearance of papilledema by a considerable. CHAMLIN M.

### Ophthalmologic involvement in the syndrome of headache, neurologic deficits, and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis [^513277f8]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To emphasize that papilledema and other ophthalmic manifestations may occur in the syndrome of headache, neurologic deficits, and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (HaNDL).

Design

Two interventional case reports.

Methods

Two patients were seen with ophthalmologic findings, including decreased vision, papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, and a variety of neurologic deficits. Each underwent cerebrospinal fluid analysis and intracranial pressure measurement by spinal tap and neuroimaging studies to confirm the diagnosis of HaNDL.

Results

Both patients received acetazolamide to lower intracranial pressure. The first patient had complete resolution of signs and symptoms. The second, who was also given systemic corticosteroids, was left with diminished visual acuity in the right eye with nasal visual field loss and optic atrophy.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of HaNDL is one of exclusion, which must be made in conjunction with a neurologist. HaNDL may be accompanied by elevated intracranial pressure and papilledema. As in other disorders causing papilledema, these patients may have permanent visual sequelae. Recognition by the ophthalmologist of this rarely reported syndrome will facilitate prompt patient diagnosis and treatment.

### Clinical features of visual disturbances secondary to isolated sphenoid sinus inflammatory diseases [^162651d4]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

When presents as orbital apex syndrome, some important entities should be differentiated. Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a life-threatening disorder that can complicate facial infection, sinusitis, orbital cellulitis, especially in the setting of a thrombophilic disorder. Early signs of CST include fever, headache, and ophthalmic involvements, which are nearly universal, including periorbital edema, lid erythema, ptosis, proptosis, restricted or painful eye movement, and less commonly papilledema, decreased visual acuity. High-resolution contrast-enhanced head CT typically shows cavernous sinus expansion and irregular filling defects as direct signs. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is another differential disease and is described as unilateral orbital pain associated with paresis of one or more of the III, IV and/or VI cranial nerves, which resolves spontaneously but may recur. Episodic orbital pain often localized around the ipsilateral brow and eye. Clinically, Paresis coincides with the onset of pain or follows it within 2 weeks and resolve within 72 h when treated adequately with corticosteroids. Granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure or orbit, demonstrated by MRI or biopsy are important in differential diagnosis.

There are some limitations in this study. Firstly, there was not complete information about the exact visual acuity outcomes since the patients were discharged from the Department of ENT and did not have a later ophthalmologic examination. Prospective enrollment of patients with ISSIDs may allow us to identify factors that influence final visual outcome in the short and long-term, and we propose to evaluate such factors in future research.

### Unilateral papilledema… [^faf8c145]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Although much of the ophthalmic literature deals with papilledema, its unilateral occurrence is mentioned only in widely scattered papers. Unilateral involvement is relatively rare but is nevertheless important and presents a difficult diagnostic problem. When the condition is bilateral certain causes are almost automatically excluded. Many additional factors which complicate the diagnosis must be taken into consideration when the condition is limited to one eye. The term choked disk is assiduously avoided in this paper, because it is often taken to include papillitis or optic neuritis, an entity having a different causation, different pathologic characteristics and symptoms and, to a lesser extent, a different appearance and different sequelae. In their early stages the differentiation of the two conditions may be difficult or impossible.

Since a clear understanding of the two conditions is important, for reasons which will be given later, a brief summary of their chief characteristics will be presented. SMITH EG. UNILATERAL PAPILLEDEMA: ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND PATHOLOGIC PHYSIOLOGY. Arch Ophthalmol. 1939; 21: 856–873.

### The escape of retrobulbar cerebrospinal fluid in the astronaut's eye: mission impossible? [^4eed5fd5]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Ophthalmic abnormalities including unilateral and bilateral optic disc edema, optic nerve sheath distention, globe flattening, choroidal folds, and hyperopic shifts have been observed in astronauts during and after long-duration spaceflight. An increased understanding of factors contributing to this syndrome, termed spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, is currently a top priority for the ESA and NASA, especially since this medical obstacle could impact the visual health of astronauts as well as the success of future missions, including continued trips to the International Space Station, a return to the moon, or a future human mission to Mars. Currently, the exact mechanisms causing this neuro-ocular syndrome are not fully understood. In the present paper, we propose a hypothetical framework by which optic disc edema in astronauts may result, at least partly, from the forcing of perioptic cerebrospinal fluid into the optic nerve and optic disc along perivascular spaces surrounding the central retinal vessels, related to long-standing microgravity fluid shifts and variations in optic nerve sheath anatomy and compliance. Although this hypothesis remains speculative at the present time, future research in this area of investigation could not only provide exciting new insights into the mechanisms underlying microgravity-induced optic disc swelling but also offer opportunities to develop countermeasure strategies.

### Cerebral venous hypertension and blindness: a reversible complication [^03683395]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old woman developed blindness during treatment for sarcoidosis-induced end-stage renal disease. An initial renal transplantation failed, and hemoaccess was maintained with multiple central catheters and upper extremity prosthetic arteriovenous grafts. A successful second transplantation eliminated her need for hemodialysis, but a right brachial to internal jugular graft remained patent. Progressive visual loss 2 years after transplantation prompted ophthalmic evaluation which initially revealed unilateral left optic nerve edema and visual loss, ultimately worsening over several months to no light perception in the left eye, 20/60 vision in the right eye, and bilateral papilledema. Arteriography demonstrated cerebral venous hypertension attributed to the functioning hemoaccess graft. Permanent graft occlusion normalized the papilledema, and visual field defects in the right eye and visual acuity returned to 20/20 in the right eye.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^f72cc551]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Pollackdescribed 22 syndromic children who routinely underwent ophthalmologic screening for increased ICP preoperatively and 6-month postoperatively. Papilledema was found preoperatively in 4 and postoperatively in 8 at a mean age of 16.5 months. Only 3 of these 8 showed clinical symptoms, which implies that this is an unreliable screening method.

Stavroureported on 9 children, among whom 4 with Crouzon syndrome and 2 with complex craniosynostosis, age range 1 to 6 years, who showed lowering of vision as a consequence of increased ICP.

Connolydescribed selected patients with multiple suture synostosis and signs of increased ICP. Most of them had Crouzon syndrome (confirmed by FGFR2 mutation) and generally showed a normal skull shape at birth with progressive synostosis. Increased ICP presented in these patients approximately at the age of 5 years. The authors recommended frequent screening using fundoscopy but did not indicate frequency or age limit.

Hoefkensdescribed 9 Crouzon syndrome children with postnatal synostosis, of whom 9 showed impressions on skull x-ray, 7 developed a bregma at the anterior fontanel, and 4 papilledema.

Tamburriniconcludes in a review of the literature that assessing the mean ICP during sleep in combination with plateau waves is the most reliable method indicating increased ICP.

Liasiscompares 3 ophthalmologic methods, viz. vision, fundoscopy, and VEP scan in 8 syndromic children. All 8 showed a decrease in N80 to P100 amplitude preceding surgery and an increase postoperatively. Fundoscopy showed no abnormalities in 3 patients, progressive bilateral swelling in 3, and unilateral swelling in 2 patients. Vision worsened in 1, improved in 4, and fluctuated in 2 patients, preoperatively. Invasive measurement demonstrated increased ICP in 3 of the 8 children, of whom 1 showed abnormal fundus, 1 unilateral papilledema, and 1 unnatural paleness of the papilla. The authors conclude that solely vision or fundoscopy is insufficient and that VEP will timely detect vision abnormalities. This article, however, provides only little evidence for this!

### Bilateral choroidal folds and optic neuropathy: a variant of the crowded disk syndrome? [^bced10d3]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical features of the syndrome that includes bilateral choroidal folds and optic neuropathy and to propose a novel etiology to explain this presentation.

Design

Observational small case series.

Participants

Three patients.

Methods

Three patients received an extensive clinical work-up including complete ocular examination, A and B scan ultrasonography, Humphrey visual field analysis, and imaging of the brain and orbit. Neurological consultation was obtained in each patient two of whom underwent lumbar puncture. The findings of this detailed investigation are reported.

Results

Each patient demonstrated bilateral choroidal folds with optic disk congestion and leakage in one eye and optic atrophy in the fellow eye. Extensive ocular and extraocular investigation failed to uncover a specific etiology. Pseudotumor cerebri, a well-documented cause of papilledema and choroidal folds, was ruled out in each case. Each patient did demonstrate variable degrees of hyperopia and shortened axial lengths.

Conclusions

The syndrome of bilateral choroidal folds and optic neuropathy may have various etiologies. Pseudotumor cerebri needs to be definitively ruled out. Normal neuro-ophthalmological investigation including lumbar puncture may indicate an alternative cause. Idiopathic acquired hyperopia in middle-aged patients who are hyperopic with shortened axial lengths may be associated with choroidal folds and a constricted scleral canal causing optic disk congestion and complicated by nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy due to a crowded disk.

### Somatropin (Zomacton) [^22bc96c5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Intracranial Hypertension

Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms resolved rapidly after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with ZOMACTON to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically thereafter. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with ZOMACTON can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH.

5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity

Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see Contraindications (4)].

5.7 Fluid Retention

Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent.

5.8 Hypoadrenalism

Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of ZOMACTON. Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.9 Hypothyroidism

Undiagnosed or untreated hypothyroidism may prevent response to ZOMACTON, in particular, the growth response in pediatric patients. Patients with Turner syndrome have an increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function tests performed, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated.

### The pathogenesis and treatment of optic disc swelling in neurosarcoidosis… [^d60a8504]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Optic disc swelling represents obstruction of axoplasmic flow at the lamina cribrosa, resulting in accumulation of axoplasm at the disc. 2 The patients described herein both presented with predominantly unilateral ODS but bilateral visual loss, and both were proven to have sarcoidosis. The pathophysiologic features of the ODS and visual loss differed in the 2 patients and prompted us to review the differential diagnosis of ODS in sarcoidosis. Patient 1 reminded us that although papilledema may manifest more in one eye, owing to anatomic asymmetry of the nerve sheaths, resolution of ODS in a patient with chronic papilledema may also reflect optic atrophy. Patient 2 reminded us that optic neuropathy can present with or without ODS. Although visual loss was bilateral, the optic neuropathy in the right eye was retrobulbar and only the left disc was swollen.

Correct interpretation of disc findings may reveal the degree of central nervous system involvement and have consequences for therapy. Granulomatous meningoencephalitis can elevate ICP sufficiently to cause papilledema and may have an acute, subacute, or chronic course. Patients with acute sarcoid meningoencephalitis may develop seizures and changes in mental status, ranging from confusion to coma and death. 5 Postmortem microscopic analysis in one such patient revealed noncaseating, epithelioid granulomata dispersed throughout the brain and meninges.
5. A posteriorly located sarcoid granuloma may present with an orbital apex syndrome, 11 including proptosis, diplopia, ODS, and visual loss. Patients with bilateral optic nerve infiltration or chiasmal involvement may present with bilateral papillitis mimicking papilledema, but whereas VA loss from papilledema is a late occurrence, it is the early hallmark of infiltrative optic neuropathy.

Infiltration of the optic chiasm by sarcoid may cause chiasmal pattern bitemporal VF loss.
10. Sarcoid optic neuritis may be subtly differentiated from DON with a more subacute loss of vision, progressing from 2 to 6 weeks in one study, 13 and a lower propensity to cause a central scotoma. The pathogeneses of papillitis in sarcoidosis include perineural vasculitis, 15 microscopic granulomatous infiltration of the anterior optic nerve, severe posterior uveitis, and retinal periphlebitis characterized by perivascular "candle-wax drippings".

### Visual loss in syndromic craniosynostosis with papilledema but without other symptoms of intracranial hypertension [^8d256331]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Four children with syndromic craniosynostosis (Crouzon's syndrome and Apert syndrome) developed irreversible visual loss. Apart from papilledema, there were no other clinical symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Ventriculomegaly or hydrocephalus was present in all cases. Two children were known to have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. These cases are reported to inform specialists involved in follow-up of children with syndromic craniosynostosis that visual loss can develop suddenly without other symptoms of intracranial hypertension. To prevent visual loss, papilledema should be detected at an early stage and intervention should be instituted promptly. Therefore, periodic funduscopy should be performed in children at risk, such as children with syndromic craniosynostosis and additional hydrocephalus or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

Statistical Analysis

Data analysis was performed from December 2021 to August 2023. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 29.0 (IBM). The groups were compared using the χ² and Fisher exact test (for frequencies < 5) for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. The threshold for statistical significance was 2 sided, and the significance level used for all analyses was P < .05. When patient data were insufficient for the evaluation of a neuroimaging sign, the patient was excluded from that analysis.

Papilledema and IIH-Estimating MRI Score Development

Detailed information about score calculation is provided in the eAppendix in Supplement 1. To identify crucial MRI signs associated with papilledema, we used multivariate logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization for the sparse shrinkage of regression coefficients. The analysis was performed using Stata SE statistical software version 17.0 (StataCorp). The binary outcome was papilledema. The following signs, which were part of the 2013 diagnostic criteria or were significantly associated in the univariate analyses, were used as explanatory variables: (1) unilateral or bilateral flattening of the posterior aspect of the globe, (2) unilateral or bilateral distension of the perioptic subarachnoid space, (3) unilateral or bilateral optic nerve disc protrusion, and (4) unilateral or bilateral transverse sinus stenosis along with the 4 categories of (5) herniation of the suprasellar cistern; thus, there was a total of 8 parameters including the intercept. Model performance was summarized in terms of discrimination as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) along with the E_max statistic proposed by Harrell et aland Austin et al. To address the problem of missing predictors, imputation was performed. Bootstrapping was performed to assess internal validity.

Score Validation

The diagnostic accuracy of the 2013 MRI criteriaand the MRI score developed in this study was compared. The presence of unilateral or bilateral papilledema was the binary outcome. The AUROC and Youden index (for cutoff value determination) were calculated. This analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 29.0 (IBM).

### Clinical value of neuroimaging indicators of intracranial hypertension in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis [^78aab46c]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Cohort

Between January 2012 and December 2017, we prospectively registered 70 patients presenting with acute CVT to our institution. Inclusion criteria were age > 18 years and CVT diagnosed by neuroimaging (CCT and CT-Angiography or MRI and MR-Angiography). Of these, 26 patients who completed the MRI study protocol were included in the cohort (supplementary Fig. 5). 26 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers without neurological disease underwent the study MRI to serve as controls.

General exclusion criteria were contraindications against MRI (ferro-magnetic implant, pregnancy, claustrophobia), critical illness (e.g. mechanical ventilation, severely altered consciousness), preexisting conditions causing intracranial hypertension (idiopathic intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus) and denial to participate. We further excluded CVT patients showing space occupying hemorrhage, edema or venous infarction with midline-shift or lateral ventricle compression (see below) and patients with symptoms suggestive of IH, in whom CSF pressure measurement, ophthalmological examination and/or ocular MRI were unavailable.

After diagnosing CVT, patients underwent cerebral and ocular MRI and, upon clinical suspicion of IH, CSF pressure measurement and additional ophthalmologic examination.

All 26 patients were part of a previous cross-sectional assessment of IH predictors in acute CVT.

Intracranial hypertension

We classified CVT patients as having intracranial hypertension based on the following predefined criteria:
Symptoms of acute CVT (e.g. headache, seizure) and
intracranial pressure > 25 cm H₂O (according to ICHD-3 classification) measured by CSF pressure in lateral decubitus position and/or
papilledema on optical coherence tomography and/or optic disc protrusion on ocular MRI

As described before, we chose papilledema for its 95–100% specificity for IH. Given reports of unilateral papilledema in IH, we rated both uni- and bilateral optic nerve head protrusion as an indicator for IH. Patients were defined as IH negative when they lacked criteria of the compound classifier.

### Patterns of retinal damage and visual long-term consequences in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^36fb9b46]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of IIH

IIH diagnosis was made according to the 2013 diagnostic criteria. Diagnosis of definite IIH required normal neurologic investigation (except cranial nerve abnormalities), normal imaging (MRI including MR/CT venography), normal composition of the CSF, elevated LPOP ≥ 25 cm CSF, and presence of papilledema. In the absence of papilledema, a diagnosis of IIHWOP was made, if the patient presented with at least unilateral abducens nerve palsy. In the absence of papilledema and abducens nerve palsy, the diagnosis of suggested IIHWOP was made, if the patient presented with at least 3 of 4 MRI criteria (empty sella, flattening of the posterior aspect of the globe, distention of the perioptic subarachnoid space with or without a tortuous optic nerve, transverse venous sinus stenosis). The diagnosis of probable IIH was made when all diagnostic criteria except LPOP ≥ 25 cm CSF were met.

Lumbar Puncture

Measurement of LPOP was standardized, with the relaxed patient placed in left lateral decubitus position and legs and neck extended. A standard issue manometer was used (cm CSF). CSF composition was analyzed.

Radiologic Diagnostics

Standardized radiologic diagnostics were evaluated by an experienced neuroradiologist blinded to the results of the diagnostic workup and patient identity and comprised 1.5T or 3T MRI without contrast, with or without thin-cut, fat-suppressed orbital sequences. Choice of modality for cerebral venography depended on contraindications and availability (contrast-enhanced CT venography or MRI time-of-flight without contrast).

### Retinal findings in young children with increased intracranial pressure from nontraumatic causes [^57ba403d]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) has been suggested in legal settings as an alternative cause of retinal hemorrhages (RHs) in young children who may have sustained abusive head trauma. We assessed the prevalence and characteristics of RHs in children with increased ICP.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter study of children < 4 years old with newly diagnosed increased ICP as determined by using direct measurement and/or clinical criteria. Infants who were premature, neonates, and suspected survivors of abusive head trauma were excluded on the basis of nonocular findings. Fundus examinations were performed; extent, number, and type of RH in each of 4 distinct retinal zones were recorded.

Results

Fifty-six children (27 boys) were studied (mean age 15.4 months; range 1–43 months). All of the children had elevated ICP that required intervention. One child had papilledema. No child (0%; 95% confidence interval: 0%-6.4%) or eye (0%; 95% confidence interval: 0%-3.3%) was found to have an RH. Causes of increased ICP included hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage, congenital malformations, malfunctioning shunts, and the presence of intracranial space-occupying lesions.

Conclusions

Although acute increased ICP can present in children with a pattern of peripapillary superficial RHs in the presence of papilledema, our study supports the conclusion that RHs rarely occur in the absence of optic disc swelling and do not present beyond the peripapillary area in the entities we have studied.

5.9 Unmasking of Brugada Syndrome

There have been postmarketing reports of a possible association between treatment with lithium and the unmasking of Brugada Syndrome. Brugada Syndrome is a disorder characterized by abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings and a risk of sudden death. Lithium should be avoided in patients with Brugada Syndrome or those suspected of having Brugada Syndrome. Consultation with a cardiologist is recommended if: (1) treatment with lithium is under consideration for patients suspected of having Brugada Syndrome or patients who have risk factors for Brugada Syndrome, e.g., unexplained syncope, a family history of Brugada Syndrome, or a family history of sudden unexplained death before the age of 45 years, (2) patients who develop unexplained syncope or palpitations after starting lithium treatment.

5.10 Pseudotumor Cerebri

Cases of pseudotumor cerebri (increased intracranial pressure and papilledema) have been reported with lithium use. If undetected, this condition may result in enlargement of the blind spot, constriction of visual fields and eventual blindness due to optic atrophy. Consider discontinuing lithium if this syndrome occurs.

5.5 Intracranial Hypertension

Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropins. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Fundoscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH.

5.6	Severe Hypersensitivity

Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropins. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs [see Contraindications (4)].

5.7	Fluid Retention

Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesia) are usually transient and dose dependent.

5.8	Hypoadrenalism

Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.9 Hypothyroidism

Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with growth hormone deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated.

### Incidence of papilledema and obesity in children diagnosed with idiopathic" benign" intracranial hypertension: case series and review [^6ff0070d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is an important cause of headaches in the pediatric population and can lead to permanent blindness if not diagnosed in a timely manner. The aim of this study was to characterize the incidence of papilledema and obesity in children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. We retrospectively analyzed 27 patients followed at The University of Texas Houston Pediatric Neurology Clinic. Papilledema was absent in 13 (48%) patients. The majority of our patients were nonobese (70%). Our results are contrary to the current medical practice of associating papilledema and obesity with idiopathic intracranial hypertension in childhood and highlight the importance of revised diagnostic criteria in this population needed to detect and manage this condition.

### Artificial intelligence to differentiate pediatric pseudopapilledema and true papilledema on fundus photographs [^893e75b7]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 851 fundus photographs of 235 children (105 with papilledema and 130 with pseudopapilledema). The demographics of included patients are shown in Table 1. The causes of papilledema and pseudopapilledema are provided in Table S1. The mean age at diagnosis was older in patients with papilledema (11.7 vs. 10.2 years, P = 0.0028). Females predominated in both groups, with no difference in sex distribution between groups. There was no difference in race or ethnicity between groups. Overall, the majority of patients were White, but Hispanic patients represented a significant minority (31%). There was a significant difference in distribution of patients by site, with University of California, Los Angeles and Stanford contributing relatively fewer patients with papilledema than the other sites. The most common cause of papilledema was pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (78%). The most common cause of pseudopapilledema was optic disc drusen (61%). Among patients with papilledema, 83 (79%) had lumbar puncture results available (in others, lumbar puncture was contraindicated due to a space-occupying lesion in the brain); the average opening pressure was 40 ± 10 cm H₂O.

### Endoscopic cauterization of a symptomatic choroid plexus cyst at the foramen of monro: case report [^3526b006]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Choroid plexus cysts are common in the developing fetus, and although often persisting into adulthood, they rarely represent the underlying cause of symptomatic unilateral ventriculomegaly. The case presented here highlights both the diagnostic obscurity and endoscopic management of a choroid plexus cyst in a symptomatic patient.

Clinical Presentation

The patient is a 47-year-old white woman who presented with acute exacerbation of debilitating, diffuse, and postural headache, nausea, vomiting, early papilledema, and short-term memory loss. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraventricular mass obstructing the foramen of Monro on the left with ventriculomegaly. Cranial computed tomographic imaging demonstrated unilateral ventricular enlargement.

Intervention

During stereotactic endoscopic exploration, a choroid plexus cyst was evident at the foramen of Monro. Endoscopic cauterization of the cyst resulted in a decrease in the size of the left lateral ventricle, with complete relief of the patient's headaches and resolution of her memory loss. She remained headache free at the time of a 3-year follow-up evaluation after surgery.

Conclusion

Choroid plexus cysts remain a diagnostic challenge; their presence should be sought out in the face of ventricular asymmetry and symptomatic hydrocephalus. Endoscopic ablation offers a minimally invasive treatment for the management of these lesions.

### A case of paraneoplastic optic neuropathy and outer retinitis positive for autoantibodies against collapsin response mediator protein-5, recoverin, and α-enolase [^4882ef6c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Bilateral neuroretinitis with unilateral focal outer retinitis developed in a cancer patient positive for autoantibodies against recoverin, CRMP-5, and α-enolase. The ocular manifestations depended largely on comorbid cancer activity, suggesting the possible involvement of paraneoplastic mechanisms in the ocular disorder.

Neuroretinitis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by optic disc edema and the surrounding exudation despite with or without RAPD. In the differential diagnosis, papilledema and optic disc tumors were eliminated owing to the lack of abnormal brain or orbital MRI findings. Hypertensive retinopathy was also denied based on the absence of systemic hypertension. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy was differentiated based on negative RAPD and the presence of anterior vitreous cells and retinal vasculitis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease was excluded because the patient had no extraocular symptoms of the disease and indocyanine green angiography showed no choroidal inflammation, such as multiple hypofluorescent spots that appear during the middle phase. Infectious neuroretinitis was denied because of the negative serological screening results including Bartonella henselae.

The pathogenesis of neuroretinitis is generally regarded as vasculitis at the optic disc. In this patient, a possible cause of optic disc swelling was thought to be vasculitis rather than neuritis because of several findings such as negative RAPD, normal P100 latency in VEP, and blind spot enlargement in perimetry. Anti-CRMP-5 antibody-positive PON presents optic neuritis or neuroretinitis characterized by optic disc swelling, the leakages of the optic disc and retinal vessels on FA, and anterior vitreous cells. Since the CRMP-5 protein localizes at oligodendrocytes within the myelin sheath of the optic nerve, bilateral neuroretinitis in this patient is thought to result from inflammation at the vicinity of the optic nerve caused by CRMP-5-related autoimmunity.

The present case also involved unilateral focal outer retinal inflammation with suspected fibrin formation at the fovea, which quickly responded to systemic corticosteroid therapy and completely resolved with the remaining loss of the IS/OS line. To our knowledge, no previous reports have shown such findings in patients with anti-CRMP-5 antibody-positive PON. Reasonably, autoantibodies other than anti-CRMP-5 antibody were likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of the outer retinal inflammation.

### Persistence of pulsatile tinnitus in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension following resolution of papilledema [^7ccb32ff]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Papilledema is commonly used as part of the diagnostic criteria for and to monitor progression and treatment of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH). Treatment is aimed at reducing intracranial pressure, and papilledema is typically seen to resolve with sufficient reduction of intracranial pressure. However, associated symptoms of intracranial hypertension may persist, adversely impacting quality of life. Our aim was to quantify the persistence of pulsatile tinnitus in IIH patients after resolution of their papilledema.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients seen in our tertiary academic neuro-ophthalmology clinic for management of IIH between September 2019 and October 2023.

Results

246 consecutive patients with IIH were identified, 132 cases in whom papilledema had been documented to be present and were later documented to have resolved. 73% (97/132) presented with pulsatile tinnitus. Of the patients with pulsatile tinnitus, 61 (59/97) were documented to have ongoing symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus even after resolution of papilledema. There were no significant differences in age, BMI, papilledema grade, or presence of transverse sinus stenosis at presentation between those with persistent tinnitus and those with resolved symptoms.

Conclusions

Pulsatile tinnitus persists in a large portion of IIH patients even after resolution of papilledema. Further research is needed to characterize the underlying mechanisms and its impact on quality of life.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^0129a2fd]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Examination

On examination papilloedema (unilateral or bilateral disc swelling) is one of the essential features required to diagnose IIH. However, examination of the fundus can be challenging, and up to 40% of those sent to a tertiary centre had an incorrect diagnosis of IIH made due to diagnostic error in the fundal examination. If there is any clinical uncertainty, papilloedema should be confirmed by an experienced specialist, as optic disc drusen, small hypermetropic discs, titled myopic discs and vitreous traction can all be mistaken for papilloedema.

Testing visual function is essential as not only is there no correlation between headache frequency and the degree of papilloedema, there is little correlation between papilloedema grade and LP OP. Visual function importantly guides management, particularly in the acute setting of diagnosis or in established IIH with an acute exacerbation of headache. The minimum visual data set recommended is a visual acuity, pupil examination, formal visual field assessment and dilated fundal examination. Where possible ocular imaging is helpful at baseline to document papilloedema and is essential for longitudinal follow-up either by photography or optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Fig. 1). Indeed certain OCT measures show the ability to help distinguish between papilloedema and pseudopapilloedema and other investigators have found associations and correlations with ICP. As with any device, care in interpretation is important due to proprietary software errors in moderate to severe papilloedema (Fig. 2).
