## Question

what is treatment for tonsil stones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for tonsil stones (tonsilloliths). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the condition definition and pathophysiology to anchor management. Then, I should verify the initial assessment and when stones are incidental versus symptomatic. Next, I will review conservative management, followed by office-based procedures, and then surgical options. After that, I need to compare techniques and outcomes, including cost-effectiveness. Finally, I should integrate guideline-based principles, special populations, and a practical decision framework with follow-up and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its mechanism. Tonsil stones are calcified concretions within tonsillar crypts that often reflect biofilm physiology with oxygen gradients and acid production, which explains halitosis and recurrent low-grade irritation. Importantly, many are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, so I should avoid overtreatment when they are not bothersome [^115Zd934] [^116bxofU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the initial assessment steps. I should confirm symptoms such as halitosis, foreign-body sensation, dysphagia, or recurrent sore throat, and distinguish incidental stones from those causing distress; I should also rule out non-tonsillar sources of halitosis (oral, sinonasal, pulmonary, GI) before attributing causality to the tonsils, using clinical examination and, when needed, adjuncts like Finkelstein's test or organoleptic assessment to verify tonsillar etiology [^117JXcSk] [^111dhxG1].

> Next, I should review conservative management. For small, asymptomatic stones, expectant management with reassurance is appropriate. For symptomatic but manageable cases, I can recommend saltwater gargles, improved oral hygiene including tongue hygiene, and gentle irrigation or manual expression in cooperative patients, with careful technique to avoid mucosal trauma. I need to ensure patients understand that aggressive manipulation can cause bleeding or infection, so moderation and aseptic technique matter [^112BrrDu] [^111dhxG1] [^113GoEGM].

> Wait, let me verify the role of office-based cryptolysis when conservative measures fail. Laser or coblation cryptolysis ablates crypts under local anesthesia, reducing stone recurrence and halitosis; observational series suggest high rates of halitosis improvement and low complication rates, though I should acknowledge the evidence quality is limited and patient selection is key (small tonsils, manageable gag reflex, cooperative adult) [^111ENTaS] [^1111txpG] [^112sdQe5] [^114FS5K8].

> I will now examine surgical options for refractory cases. Tonsillectomy provides definitive removal of crypt-bearing tissue and the highest likelihood of durable symptom resolution, but it requires general anesthesia and carries nontrivial pain and bleeding risk; tonsillotomy (partial intracapsular removal) preserves capsule and can be performed under local anesthesia in some settings, trading slightly higher residual symptom rates for faster recovery and less pain, which may suit patients prioritizing rapid return to function [^115MM6Mt] [^114iMW13] [^112bfzMb].

> Let me consider comparative outcomes carefully. Randomized data show tonsillotomy yields faster functional recovery and less early postoperative morbidity than tonsillectomy, but tonsillectomy achieves greater long-term symptom reduction; importantly, both approaches reduce symptom severity to clinically nonrelevant levels in most patients, and patient satisfaction can be similar despite differing rates of persistent symptoms, which supports shared decision-making about goals and trade-offs [^115MM6Mt] [^112bfzMb] [^117U8zF6].

> I should double-check cost-effectiveness because it influences real-world choices. CO2 laser tonsillotomy under local anesthesia has substantially lower direct and indirect costs than tonsillectomy under general anesthesia, with a high probability of cost-effectiveness at conventional thresholds, making it attractive for patients valuing quicker recovery and lower expense, provided they accept a higher chance of residual symptoms or a second procedure [^112bfzMb] [^111yNyzn].

> But wait, what about technique nuances and bleeding risk. Laser tonsillotomy reduces intraoperative bleeding and operative time compared with cold steel dissection in meta-analyses, and randomized trials show lower hemorrhage rates than tonsillectomy; however, tonsillotomy may require retreatment in a minority, so I need to counsel patients about this possibility upfront and align expectations with their priorities [^115MM6Mt] [^112bfzMb].

> Next, I should review guideline-aligned principles to avoid overuse. For recurrent throat infections, watchful waiting is preferred unless stringent Paradise criteria are met, and tonsillectomy should not be performed solely to reduce streptococcal episodes. While these statements target infection rather than stones per se, they reinforce a conservative-first mindset and the need for clear, patient-centered indications before proceeding to surgery for tonsillar disease, including stone-related symptoms [^1135uPKm] [^113w3A5v] [^112BrrDu].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In children, tonsillectomy decisions lean on infection frequency, documentation, and modifying factors. Tonsillotomy is commonly used for obstructive indications with faster recovery, though long-term recurrence data are less certain, so I should individualize and document shared decision-making. In adults with stone-predominant symptoms, office cryptolysis or tonsillotomy can be reasonable bridges before committing to complete tonsillectomy, especially if general anesthesia is undesirable [^1136dAam] [^115MM6Mt] [^114FS5K8].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and verify it aligns with evidence. Start with education and conservative measures for all; escalate to office cryptolysis if symptoms persist and anatomy is favorable; reserve tonsillotomy for adults prioritizing rapid recovery and lower invasiveness; choose tonsillectomy for definitive resolution when symptoms are severe, recurrent, or refractory and the patient accepts a longer, more painful recovery; at each step, confirm tonsillar etiology of halitosis or discomfort and counsel on expected outcomes, retreatment risks, and costs [^112BrrDu] [^111ENTaS] [^112bfzMb].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and safety counseling. After cryptolysis or tonsillotomy, reassess at 6 to 12 weeks for symptom recurrence and consider retreatment if crypts reform. After tonsillectomy, monitor for bleeding, dehydration, and pain control, and provide clear return precautions. Across modalities, emphasize oral hygiene and hydration to minimize debris accumulation and support healing [^114FS5K8] [^116mWfEs] [^111VrcL7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought tonsillotomy might match tonsillectomy for long-term symptom elimination, but I should correct that impression. Randomized data show higher persistent symptom rates after tonsillotomy even though severity drops to low levels and satisfaction remains high, so I must not overstate equivalence and instead frame tonsillotomy as a less invasive, cost-saving option with a meaningful but smaller net clinical benefit than tonsillectomy for definitive control [^112bfzMb] [^117U8zF6].

Tonsil stones are managed with a **stepwise approach**: start with **gargles and oral hygiene** (saltwater, non-alcoholic mouthwash, tongue scraping, and gentle irrigation) to reduce debris and odor [^111dhxG1]. If symptoms persist, consider **office cryptolysis** (laser or coblation) under local anesthesia for targeted crypt reduction and halitosis control [^111ENTaS] [^1111txpG] [^112sdQe5]. Reserve **tonsillectomy** for recurrent, large, or refractory stones after shared decision-making, balancing modest benefits against bleeding and pain risks [^1139QbJo] [^113ywYNu]. Antibiotics are not routinely used unless there is active infection; avoid harsh tools or aggressive manipulation to prevent mucosal injury [^112BrrDu].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative measures are **first-line** for small, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic tonsil stones and focus on reducing debris, bacterial load, and halitosis.

- **Saltwater gargles**: Regular gargling with warm salt water (½ teaspoon salt in 8 oz water) can reduce debris and bacterial load, decreasing stone formation and halitosis [^notfound].

- **Non-alcoholic mouthwash**: Daily use of non-alcoholic mouthwash (e.g. chlorhexidine) can reduce bacteria and odor; avoid alcohol-containing rinses due to drying and irritation.

- **Tongue scraping**: Daily tongue scraping reduces oral bacteria and halitosis, indirectly decreasing tonsil stone formation [^111dhxG1].

- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake maintains oral moisture and reduces debris accumulation.

- **Manual removal**: Gentle removal with a cotton swab or irrigator can be attempted, but avoid sharp instruments or aggressive manipulation to prevent mucosal injury or infection.

---

## Office-based procedures

When conservative measures fail or stones are recurrent, **office-based procedures** offer minimally invasive options with rapid recovery.

- **Laser tonsil cryptolysis**: CO2 laser cryptolysis under local anesthesia ablates crypts, reducing stone recurrence and halitosis. High patient satisfaction and low complication rates are reported, though repeat sessions may be needed [^111ENTaS] [^114FS5K8].

- **Coblation cryptolysis**: Radiofrequency coblation similarly ablates crypts with low pain and rapid recovery; small series show significant halitosis reduction and low complication rates [^1111txpG] [^112sdQe5].

- **Limitations**: Office cryptolysis may require repeat treatments and is less effective for very large or deeply embedded stones.

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **severe, recurrent, or refractory cases** after shared decision-making.

- **Tonsillectomy**: Complete tonsil removal under general anesthesia is definitive but carries risks of bleeding, pain, and anesthesia-related complications. Indications include recurrent stones with significant halitosis, dysphagia, or recurrent infections despite conservative care [^113ywYNu].

- **Tonsillotomy**: Partial tonsil removal (intracapsular) reduces tissue volume and crypts with less pain and faster recovery than tonsillectomy, but may require revision if symptoms persist or recur [^1136dAam] [^115MM6Mt].

- **Evidence summary**: Tonsillectomy offers modest reductions in recurrent infections and halitosis; tonsillotomy offers faster recovery but may need revision. Shared decision-making is essential given modest benefits and potential harms [^1139QbJo] [^115MM6Mt].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and lifestyle modifications

Adjuncts and lifestyle changes can **reduce recurrence and improve comfort**.

- **Dietary modifications**: Reduce dairy, sugar, and alcohol; increase fruits, vegetables, and water to lessen debris and bacterial growth.

- **Probiotics**: Evidence is limited, but probiotics may modulate oral microbiota and reduce halitosis.

- **Smoking cessation**: Smoking increases dry mouth and bacterial load, promoting stone formation.

---

## Patient education and counseling

Education is critical to set expectations and improve adherence. Emphasize that tonsil stones are **benign and common**, outline the stepwise treatment plan, and discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives, including the possibility of recurrence and the potential need for repeat or staged procedures. Reinforce consistent oral hygiene, hydration, and avoidance of trauma to the tonsillar tissue [^112BrrDu].

---

## Summary of treatment options

| **Treatment option** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** | **Risks/limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Saltwater gargles | Mild symptoms | Moderate | Minimal |
| Non-alcoholic mouthwash | Mild symptoms | Moderate | Minimal |
| Manual removal | Small, accessible stones | Moderate | Mucosal injury, infection |
| Laser cryptolysis | Recurrent stones, halitosis | High | Repeat sessions, mild pain |
| Coblation cryptolysis | Recurrent stones, halitosis | High | Repeat sessions, mild pain |
| Tonsillectomy | Severe, recurrent stones | Definitive | Bleeding, pain, anesthesia risks |
| Tonsillotomy | Moderate symptoms | High | Revision risk |

---

Treatment of tonsil stones is **stepwise**: begin with conservative measures, escalate to office cryptolysis if needed, and reserve surgery for refractory cases. Shared decision-making and patient education are essential to optimize outcomes and satisfaction.

### Adult tonsillectomy: an evaluation of indications and complications [^113ywYNu]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate current adult tonsillectomy indications along with risk factors associated with postoperative complications.

Methods

In this retrospective chart review, demographic, clinical, and surgical data were collected from 2004 to 2020 of adult patients who underwent tonsillectomy. Indications for surgery were categorized as infectious etiology, biopsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and tonsillar stones. Data regarding postoperative hemorrhage, emergency department (ED) visits, and readmissions were collected. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with postoperative complications.

Results

574 adults (mean age 32 years, 69.9% F vs. 30.1% M) were included. The most common indication was infections (62.2%), followed by biopsy (26.5%), tonsillar stones (6.8%), and OSA (4.5%). The highest frequency of postoperative bleeds (17.9%) occurred in the tonsillar stones cohort; however, the indication for surgery was not a significant predictor on multivariate analysis. Male sex and younger age were independent predictors of postoperative bleeding, while younger age was a significant predictor of postoperative ED visits. There was a significant linear trend of an increasing proportion of tonsillectomies performed for tonsillar stones compared to other indications for 2011–2019.

Conclusion

Infectious etiology was the most common indication for tonsillectomy. Indication for surgery was not a significant predictor of postoperative bleeding; however, male sex and younger age had higher odds of postoperative bleeding. The proportion of tonsillectomies performed for tonsillar stones was steadily increasing.

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117U8zF6]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial is the largest to compare long-term outcomes of CO 2 laser TO and TE in adults. Previous findings reported that CO 2 laser TO led to faster, less-painful recovery and lower postoperative hemorrhage compared with TE. Although symptom persistence was higher with CO 2 laser TO at 6 months, both groups experienced reduced symptom severity, improved quality of life, and high patient satisfaction. At 1- and 2-year follow-ups, patients who underwent TE reported fewer and milder symptoms than those who received CO 2 laser TO. Both groups with residual symptoms experienced significant symptom reduction to clinically nonrelevant levels after 2 years (VAS < 20 mm). Satisfaction, willingness to recommend surgery, and work productivity impact were similar across both time points. While CO 2 laser TO had slightly lower QALYs, it significantly reduced surgery and productivity costs, with a 71% to 93% likelihood of being cost-effective. These findings are consistent with the 6-month data, where 57% of patients in the CO 2 laser TO group and 35% of those in the TE group had persistent symptoms, with 13% of patients in the CO 2 laser TO group needing a second treatment. Both groups showed reduced symptom severity at 6 months, which continued through the 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Quality of life improvements also persisted. Although patients in the TE group had slightly higher satisfaction at 6 months, this difference diminished over time. A similar percentage of patients in both groups would recommend their surgeries. These results address gaps in the literature, which emphasize short-term benefits of TO but with limited evidence on long-term outcomes. The higher occurrence of residual symptoms after CO 2 laser TO is likely due to incomplete tonsil removal, unlike TE. Retaining the tonsillar bed with major nerves and blood vessels allows CO 2 laser TO to be performed under local anesthesia and reduces postoperative bleeding, which lowers the need for surgical revision due to hemorrhage and reduces postoperative pain and recovery time. However, the management of postoperative bleeding may vary across institutions, particularly in the threshold for performing surgical revisions. This highlights the importance of considering institutional practices and patient preferences when counseling on TO vs TE. Some patients required a second procedure within 6 months, resulting in significant and lasting symptom improvement, underscoring the importance of adequate tissue removal for successful CO 2 laser TO.

### Protection and consolidation of stone heritage by self-inoculation with indigenous carbonatogenic bacterial communities [^112Cp9Yw]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The new bacterial self-inoculation bio-treatment

The new bio-treatment consisted of the in situ application of a culture of stone-bacterial community isolated from the weathered stone and activated in the laboratory with the sterile M-3P nutritive solution (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for a detailed schematic of the treatment protocol). To obtain this culture, stone samples (~ 1 g in total) were collected from different spots of the weathered calcarenite stone surface prior to the application of any treatment. Sterile tweezers and Eppendorf vials were used during sample collection. Subsequently, stone samples were added to 5 mL of sterile nutritive solution M-3P and incubated during 48 h at 28 °C under shaking at 180 rpm. Aliquots of this activated bacterial community culture were stored in glycerol vials at −80 °C, in a 1:1 ratio (v/v) as bacterial suspensions for long-term preservation and for further molecular identification studies, and used as pre-inoculant in order to obtain a sufficient amount of a 24 h-old bacterial community culture necessary for the bio-consolidation treatment. The optical density of the 24 h-old community culture applied to the stone surface was 1.304, corresponding to ~ 8.2 ± 0.32 × 10⁸ CFU mL⁻¹. The application of this treatment was performed as described above for the other two bio-consolidation treatments. It was applied on a heavily weathered stone block, adjacent to those treated by the conventional bio-consolidation treatments described above (Fig. 1). In all the three cases, the volume of solution applied to the stone was approximately 0.125 mL cm⁻² for each application (twice a day for the 6 days of treatment), and the treatments were performed in May, a dry season when the average maximum and minimum T in the area are 24 and 10 °C, respectively, and the relative humidity is typically below 50%. The warm weather was chosen to avoid the potential detrimental effects of low T on the development of bacteria. The dry conditions during treatment application and subsequent in situ testing (see below) after 5, 12 and 24 months were selected to avoid any potential effects of a high humidity (i.e. associated with rainfall events) on the peeling tape and drilling resistance tests. A part of the stone block was maintained without any treatment as a control area.

### Oral infections and antibiotic therapy [^112tpWpn]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Oral infections commonly originate from an odontogenic source in adults and from tonsil and lymphatic sources in children. Odontogenic infections arise from advanced dental caries or periodontal disease. Oral trauma, radiation injury, chemotherapy mucositis, salivary gland infection, lymph node abscess, and postoperative infection are potential nonodontogenic sources of infections that could potentially be life threatening. This article reviews the serious nature and potential danger that exists from oral infection and the antibiotics available to treat them are reviewed. Successful treatment requires an understanding of the microflora, the regional anatomy, the disease process, the treatment methods available, and interdisciplinary team collaboration.

PANDAS and poorly validated indications — "Tonsillectomy has been considered for treating pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), but evidence is anecdotal and the etiology poorly understood", and "A recent systematic review found no recommendations either for or against performing tonsillectomy specifically to treat PANDAS". Poorly validated indications listed include "chronic tonsillitis, febrile seizures, muffled ("hot potato") speech, halitosis, malocclusion of teeth, tonsillar hypertrophy, cryptic tonsils, and chronic pharyngeal carriage of GABHS", and "There is a substantial role for shared decision making with caregivers when considering tonsillectomy for ≥ 1 of these conditions".

### Transcutaneous approach for the removal of parotid gland stones [^115wK83G]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Salivary stones in the parotid gland can be treated with a wide range of methods. Stones close to the opening of the duct can be easily removed through the oral cavity, whereas the entire salivary gland may need to be removed if stones are located close to the parotid gland. In such cases, surgical removal of the parotid gland may be lengthy and may produce facial nerve injury. We report a simple extraoral approach used for the removal of parotid gland stones located close to the parotid gland by precisely identifying the location of stones in 2 patients with parotid sialolithiasis.

Regarding surgical interventions for tonsillectomy, more specifically with respect to indications for tonsillectomy, recurrent throat infections, AAO-HNS 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate pediatric patients with recurrent throat infections not meeting criteria for tonsillectomy for modifying factors that may favor tonsillectomy, including but not limited to:

- multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance

- periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome

- history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess.

### Laser versus cold steel dissection tonsillectomy in recurrent acute tonsillitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111DKUDv]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

This systematic review and meta‐analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The prospective protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in April 2024 (ID: CRD42024533742).

2.1 Search Strategy

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to April 10, 2024. The following terms were searched in all three databases: "tonsillectomy", or "tonsil resection", or "tonsil removal", or "adenotonsillectomy", or "extracapsular", and "laser", or "CO2", or "carbon dioxide", or "KTP", or "potassium titanyl phosphate", or "thulium", or "diode", or "Nd:YAG" and "cold", or "steel", or "conventional", or "traditional", or "snare". The complete search strategy is available in the supporting material. Snowballing technique and a complementary search on the website ResearchGate were also performed to identify additional studies.

2.2 Study Selection

Two authors (M.M. and T.D.D.C.) independently screened articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Studies were included if they met all the following eligibility criteria, based on the PICOS statement: (1) RCTs or non‐randomized cohorts; (2) enrolling patients with the diagnosis of RAT and candidates for total TE, i.e. complete removal of the tonsils; (3) comparing laser dissection TE to (4) conventional cold steel dissection TE; (5) reporting data on at least one of the outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if they included patients with conditions other than RAT, or if only a partial or intracapsular TE was performed. There was no restriction on follow‐up time or publication year. We excluded studies (1) with no control group, (2) not peer‐reviewed, and (3) not written in English.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1157dwkx]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Enrollment and Randomization

Patients were registered in an electronic data capturing system (Castor EDC). Using computer generated random numbers, patients were randomly assigned to tonsillotomy or tonsillectomy treatment using stratified randomization, the strata being type of main tonsil concern. Stratification was used to control the potentially large influence of type of tonsil concern on study outcomes (strata: chronic tonsillitis, halitosis, tonsillolithiasis, dysphagia, and sleep apnea). Considering the different pathophysiological processes underlying the various concerns, small randomization imbalances could otherwise have a large influence on the analysis of observed treatment outcomes.

All patients randomly allocated to tonsillotomy were advised to start a gag-reflex desensitization training method. Patients were advised to slowly reduce their gag reflex by touching their tongue base and tonsils with a tooth brush each time they brushed their teeth. This method has been previously shown to reduce the gag reflex intensity in most patients within 2 weeks.

### Lasers in tonsillectomy: revisited with systematic review [^116zxhAn]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2005, the National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit was conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons England, reporting hot tonsillectomy techniques being associated with more postoperative pain and hemorrhage when compared with dissection. In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence declared its position on laser tonsillectomy reporting that bleeding may be less intraoperatively but is more postoperatively, that initial pain may be less but medium term is more and that healing is delayed.

Aim

To revisit the literature surrounding laser tonsil surgery and assess the aforementioned factors for any trend changes.

Methodology

A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-style systematic review conducted in July 2019 searched Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials comparing laser tonsil surgery with other techniques with the terms laser, tonsillectomy, and tonsillotomy for nonmalignant indications. A total of 14 articles were evaluated.

Results

A total of 1133 patients received surgery accounting for a total of 2266 tonsil removals. A variety of laser techniques were used including CO2 (66%) potassium-titanyl-phosphate (19%) and contact diode (15%). Nonlaser techniques included dissection (62%), diathermy (20%), and coblation (18%). The summated conclusions suggest that laser techniques are superior regarding intraoperative bleeding and procedure duration. Laser techniques also provide equivocal or superior outcomes regarding postoperative hemorrhage, pain, and total healing time.

Conclusion

Outcomes following laser surgery in recent years suggest an overall improvement. This could be due to enhanced familiarity with techniques and established centers performing laser procedures more routinely.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113SeG7f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — impact of surgical technique on bleeding: The traditional "cold" (metal instruments) dissection technique removes the tonsil with continuous hemostasis through ligation of blood vessels and is considered the standard from which to compare newer techniques. Electrosurgical dissection (diathermy) remains a common technique and is also used for hemostasis during "cold" tonsillectomy. Many newer "hot" techniques (radiofrequency, coblation, and harmonic scalpel) were intended to reduce intraoperative bleeding, postoperative morbidity, and risk of bleeding; however, there is concern that newer techniques increase PTB rates.

### Laser cryptolysis for the treatment of halitosis [^111ENTaS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the tonsils as a source of halitosis and to assess the efficacy of laser CO(2) cryptolysis for the treatment of oral bad breath caused by chronic fetid tonsillitis.

Methods

Fifty-three patients with halitosis originating from chronic fetid tonsillitis, who completed laser cryptolysis were enrolled in the study. The origin of halitosis was demonstrated by Finkelstein's tonsil smelling test, which included massaging the tonsils and smelling the squeezed discharge. All patients were treated by laser cryptolysis, an office procedure done under topical anesthesia. Subjective and objective postoperative assessment was based on self-and-family report and clinical assessment. Patients were reexamined 4 to 6 weeks post-treatment, and when the need for further laser treatment was determined.

Results

Complete elimination of halitosis required one session in 28 patients (52.8%), 2 sessions in 18 patients (34%), and 3 sessions in 5 patients (9.4%). Follow-up period ranged from 3 to 36 months (mean, 20.8 ± 8.5 months). No adverse effects or complications were encountered.

Conclusions

After excluding dental or periodontal, sinonasal, oral, pulmonary, or gastroenterological diseases as the origin of halitosis, chronic fetid tonsillitis remains a common cause of halitosis. Patients suffering from halitosis should be treated relying on their examination including Finkelstein's tonsil smelling test. Laser CO(2) cryptolysis is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated procedure for the treatment of halitosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1161NMiE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Paradise criteria for tonsillectomy — recurrent throat infection in children requires specified episode frequency plus qualifying clinical features, treatment, and documentation. Minimum frequency is Seven or more episodes in the preceding year, OR Five or more episodes in each of the preceding 2 y, OR Three or more episodes in each of the preceding 3 y. Clinical features that qualify an episode are Temperature > 38.3°C (> 101°F), Cervical lymphadenopathy (tender lymph nodes or > 2 cm), Tonsillar exudate, or Positive culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and sore throat plus the presence of ≥ 1 qualifies as a counting episode. Treatment requires that antibiotics had been administered in conventional dosage for proved or suspected streptococcal episodes. Documentation requires contemporaneous clinical record for each episode OR, if not fully documented, subsequent observance by the clinician of 2 episodes with consistent patterns; children who meet all other criteria may nonetheless qualify if the same pattern is observed and documented by the clinician in 2 subsequent episodes, and a 12-month period of observation is usually recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention.

### Coblation versus other surgical techniques for tonsillectomy [^112dr3bu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tonsillectomy is a very common operation and is performed using various surgical methods. Coblation is a popular method because it purportedly causes less pain than other surgical methods. However, the superiority of coblation is unproven.

Objectives

To compare the effects of coblation tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy with other surgical techniques, both hot and cold, on intraoperative morbidity, postoperative morbidity and procedural cost.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 3); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children and adults undergoing tonsillectomy with coblation compared with any other surgical technique. This review is limited to trials of extracapsular (traditional) tonsillectomy and excludes trials of intracapsular tonsil removal (tonsillotomy).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: patient-reported pain using a validated pain scale at postoperative days 1, 3 and 7; intraoperative blood loss; primary postoperative bleeding (within 24 hours) and secondary postoperative bleeding (more than 24 hours after surgery). Secondary outcomes were: time until resumption of normal diet, time until resumption of normal activity, duration of surgery and adverse effects including blood transfusion and the need for reoperation. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included 29 studies, with a total of 2561 participants. All studies had moderate or high risk of bias. Sixteen studies used an adequate randomisation technique, however the inability to mask the surgical teams and/or provide adequate methods to mitigate the risk of bias put nearly all studies at moderate or high risk of detection and measurement bias for intraoperative blood loss, and primary and secondary bleeding. In contrast most studies (20) were at low risk of bias for pain assessment. Most studies did not report data in a manner permitting meta-analysis. Most studies did not clearly report the participant characteristics, surgical indications or whether patients underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Most studies reported that tonsillitis (infection) and/or tonsillar hypertrophy (obstruction) were the indication for surgery. Seven studies included only adults, 16 studies included only children and six studies included both. Pain At postoperative day 1 there is very low quality evidence that patients in the coblation group had less pain, with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of -0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.38 to -0.19; 538 participants; six studies). This effect is reduced a SMD of -0.44 (95% CI -0.97 to 0.09; 401 participants; five studies; very low-quality evidence) at day 3, and at day 7 there is low quality evidence of little or no difference in pain (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.19; 420 participants; five studies). Although this suggests that pain may be slightly less in the coblation group between days 1 and 3, the clinical significance is unclear. Intraoperative blood loss Methodological differences between studies in the measurement of intraoperative blood loss precluded meta-analysis. Primary and secondary bleeding The risk of primary bleeding was similar (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.05; 2055 participants; 25 studies; low-quality evidence). The risk of secondary bleeding was greater in the coblation group with a risk ratio of 1.36 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.95; 2118 participants; 25 studies; low-quality evidence). Using the median of the control group as the baseline risk, the absolute risk in the coblation group was 5% versus 3.6% in the control group. The difference of 1.3% has a 95% CI of 0.2% lower in the coblation group to 3.5% higher. Secondary outcomes Differences in study design and data reporting precluded the identification of differences in the time to resumption of normal diet or activity, or whether there was a difference in the duration of surgery. Although we could not feasibly compare the costs of equipment or operative facility, anaesthetic and surgical fees across different healthcare systems we used duration of surgery as a proxy for cost. Although this outcome was commonly reported in studies, it was not possible to pool the data to determine whether there was a difference. Adverse events other than bleeding were not well reported. It is unclear whether there is a difference in postoperative infections or the need for reoperation.

Authors' Conclusions

The coblation technique may cause less pain on postoperative day 1, but the difference is small and may be clinically meaningless. By postoperative day 3, the difference decreases further and by postoperative day 7 there appears to be little or no difference. We found similar rates of primary bleeding but we cannot rule out a small increased risk of secondary bleeding with coblation. The evidence supporting these findings is of low or very low quality, i.e. there is a very high degree of uncertainty about the results. Moreover, for most outcomes data were only available from a few of the 29 included studies. The current evidence is of very low quality, therefore it is uncertain whether or not the coblation technique has any advantages over traditional tonsillectomy techniques. Despite the large number of studies, failure to use standardised or validated outcome measures precludes the ability to pool data across studies. Therefore, well-conducted RCTs using consistent, validated outcome measures are needed to establish whether the coblation technique has a benefit over other methods. In the included studies we identified no clear difference in adverse events. However, given the rarity of these events, randomised trials lack the power to detect a difference. Data from large-scale registries will provide a better estimate of any difference in these rare outcomes.

### What's new with tubes, tonsils, and adenoids? [^113WMGYs]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations are constantly being updated for various pediatric surgical procedures, including the role for tympanostomy tubes, as well as indications for adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. With a growing body of research available on some of the most prevalent pediatric conditions, an update on the current concepts surrounding management is warranted.

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111yNyzn]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Based on results of this randomized clinical trial, CO 2 laser TO appears to be ideal for adult patients prioritizing quicker recovery and less postoperative discomfort. It suits those unable or unwilling to undergo general anesthesia, need minimal disruption to daily activities, or are apprehensive about the invasiveness of TE.

In addition, CO 2 laser TO is recommended for patients with mild to moderate recurrent tonsil-related symptoms, where full tonsil removal may not always be necessary. Although some residual tissue and symptoms may remain, TO significantly reduces symptom severity to clinically nonrelevant levels, with low postoperative risk and low health care cost. Its reduced need for in-hospital care and preservation of tonsillar structure might align better with health care goals of individual patients.

For patients who wish to avoid the possibility of a secondary procedure, traditional TE may be the more appropriate choice. Careful patient selection and counseling about the potential for residual symptoms and a secondary procedure are essential to optimizing outcomes and satisfaction. This personalized approach, backed by the major economic benefits demonstrated in this study, underscores the value of integrating CO 2 laser TO into treatment strategies for persistent tonsil-related afflictions in adults.

This study's long-term follow-up showed that CO 2 laser TO was less effective than TE in fully resolving tonsil issues but led to a substantial decrease in symptoms for all patients with residual symptoms, resulting in similar patient satisfaction. A slight advantage in 2-year QALYs was noted with TE, but CO 2 laser TO was less costly, with lower societal costs due to reduced work absence and productivity loss. Based on these findings, CO 2 laser TO appears to be a safe, effective, and cost-effective method for long-term relief of tonsil-related problems with excellent patient satisfaction.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^112CMhfs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — research priorities on outcomes and perioperative care include determining if the 12-month watchful waiting period causes unnecessary morbidity based on QoL and school performance measures, defining the optimal follow-up schedule for oSDB after tonsillectomy, specifying when postoperative polysomnogram is indicated after tonsillectomy for oSDB and when a preoperative polysomnogram is indicated, determining the percentage of patients with full resolution, partial resolution, or no resolution of OSA posttonsillectomy in the short and long term, assessing how future weight gain or obesity play a role in failure to respond following tonsillectomy for OSA, assessing the immunologic role of the tonsils and when the benefits of tonsillectomy exceed the harm using a biomarker approach, determining the cost-effectiveness (direct and indirect) of different tonsillectomy techniques, evaluating and comparing oral postoperative pain medications, developing a unified set of core outcomes important to children and caregivers, determining the optimal regimen for treating PONV in children who have received dexamethasone, and encouraging self-monitoring of postoperative bleeding rates yearly.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^113Ym1F8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

History < 12 months and observation before tonsillectomy: There are currently no randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of tonsillectomy for patients experiencing recurrent tonsillitis over a period < 12 months, and all required a minimum number of sore throats in the preceding 12 months; for example, in the study by Paradise et al, 62 (33%) of the 187 children who satisfied the Paradise criteria had ≥ 7 throat infections in the preceding 12 months. Because of this tendency to improve with time, at least a 12-month period of observation is recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention, but this statement should not restrict access to tonsillectomy prior to 1 year of observation when patients may reasonably be considered in circumstances including complications of infection, such as ≥ 2 peritonsillar abscesses.

### Halitosis [^111dhxG1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Halitosis can be caused by oral disease or by respiratory tract conditions such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, and bronchiectasis, but an estimated 40% of affected individuals have no underlying organic disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with physiological halitosis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2013 (Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: artificial saliva; cleaning, brushing, or scraping the tongue; regular use of mouthwash; sugar-free chewing gums; and zinc toothpastes.

### Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^113zrmde]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation but the indications for surgery are controversial.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tonsillectomy, with and without adenoidectomy, in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), bibliographies, and additional sources were searched for published and unpublished trials. The date of the last search was 11 April 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. We included trials which used reduction in the number and severity of tonsillitis and sore throat as main outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria independently.

Main Results

This review includes five studies: four undertaken in children (719 participants) and one in adults (70 participants). Good information about the effects of tonsillectomy is only available for children and for effects in the first year following surgery. Children were divided into two subgroups: those who are severely affected (based on specific criteria which are often referred to as the 'Paradise criteria') and those less severely affected. For more severely affected children adeno-/tonsillectomy will avoid three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat, including one episode of moderate or severe sore throat in the next year. The cost of this is a predictable episode of pain in the immediate postoperative period. Less severely affected children may never have had another severe sore throat anyway and the chance of them so doing is modestly reduced by adeno-/tonsillectomy. For them, surgery will mean having an average of two rather than three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat. The cost of this reduction is one inevitable and predictable episode of postoperative pain. The 'average' patient will have 17 rather than 22 sore throat days but some of these 17 days (between five and seven) will be in the immediate postoperative period. Whilst the concept of the 'average' patient is attractive, in practice, wide variability is likely. One reason why the impact of surgery is so modest, is that many untreated patients get better spontaneously. There is a trade-off for the physician and patient who must weigh up a number of different uncertainties: what proportion of my throat symptoms are attributable to my tonsils, and will I get better without any treatment? Similarly, the potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy is effective in reducing the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throats in children, the gain being more marked in those most severely affected. The size of the effect is modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of it. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable.

### Tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in moderately affected children [^111d8Dng]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In previous clinical trials involving children severely affected with recurrent throat infection (7 or more well-documented, clinically important, adequately treated episodes of throat infection in the preceding year, or 5 or more such episodes in each of the 2 preceding years, or 3 or more such episodes in each of the 3 preceding years), we found tonsillectomy efficacious in reducing the number and severity of subsequent episodes of throat infection for at least 2 years. The results seemed to warrant the election of tonsillectomy in children meeting the trials' stringent eligibility criteria but also provided support for nonsurgical management. We undertook the present trials to determine 1) whether tonsillectomy would afford equivalent benefit in children who were less severely affected than those in our earlier trials but who nonetheless had indications for tonsillectomy comparable to those in general use, and 2) whether, in such children, the addition of adenoidectomy would confer additional benefit.

Methods

We conducted 2 parallel randomized, controlled trials in the Ambulatory Care Center of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. To be eligible, children were required to have had a history of recurrent episodes of throat infection that met standards slightly less stringent than the standards used in our earlier trials regarding either the frequency of previous episodes or their clinical features or their degree of documentation, but not regarding > 1 of those parameters. These reduced standards were nonetheless more stringent than those in current official guidelines, which list "3 or more infections of tonsils and/or adenoids per year despite adequate medical therapy" as an indication for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Of 2174 children referred by physicians or parents, 373 met the current trials' eligibility criteria and 328 were enrolled. Of these, 177 children without obstructing adenoids or recurrent or persistent otitis media were randomized to either a tonsillectomy group, an adenotonsillectomy group, or a control group (the 3-way trial), and 151 children who had 1 or more such conditions were randomized to either an adenotonsillectomy group or a control group (the 2-way trial). Outcome measures were the occurrence of episodes of throat infection during the 3 years of follow-up; other, indirect measures of morbidity; and complications of surgery.

Results

By various measures, the incidence of throat infection was significantly lower in surgical groups than in corresponding control groups during each of the 3 follow-up years. However, even among control children, mean rates of moderate or severe episodes were low, ranging from 0.16 to 0.43 per year. Adenotonsillectomy was no more efficacious than tonsillectomy alone. Of 203 children treated with surgery, 16 (7.9%) had surgery-related complications of varying types and severity.

Conclusions

The modest benefit conferred by tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy in children moderately affected with recurrent throat infection seems not to justify the inherent risks, morbidity, and cost of the operations. We conclude that, under ordinary circumstances, neither eligibility criteria such as those used for the present trials nor the criterion for surgery in current official guidelines are sufficiently stringent for use in clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111VrcL7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

(1)Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2)There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. (3)Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. (4)Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). (5)Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). (6)Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. (7)Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

### Postoperative analgesic regimens and their satisfaction rates-data from the Swedish quality register for tonsil surgery [^114pcq8W]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Tonsil surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures. In Sweden, around 13,000 tonsil surgeries are performed annually, mainly in the outpatient setting. The two main indications for tonsil surgery are upper airway obstruction causing abnormal ventilation during sleep and infection‐related problems such as recurrent tonsillitis. There are two types of surgical methods in current practice: complete removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) and intracapsular tonsillar reduction (tonsillotomy). Tonsillectomy continues to be the predominant method for infection‐related indications. However, over the past two decades, in Sweden as in some other countries, tonsillotomy has become the most common method to relieve tonsil‐related upper airway obstruction in children. Compared with tonsillectomy, tonsillotomy produces faster recovery and a lower risk of postoperative bleeding; on the contrary, re‐operation may be needed due to tonsillar regrowth after tonsillotomy.

Tonsil surgery is an effective treatment, but recovery is associated with significant morbidity and risk of complications such as postoperative bleeding and pain. The postoperative bleeding rate is relatively low, but should not be neglected due to severe and potentially fatal outcomes. Postoperative pain affects the entire population undergoing tonsil surgery for as long as 14 days in some casesand can cause behavior changes, disturbed sleep, eating and drinking difficulties, and a high frequency of unplanned contacts with health care. Thus, effective pharmacological pain treatment is both crucial for the postoperative outcome and an indicator of health care quality. Unfortunately, post‐tonsillectomy pain may be poorly managed at home because of inadequate prescription and administration of analgesics.

Safety issues with different analgesics have long been discussed. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAID, also known as cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors; the present article uses the latter term) after tonsil surgery are controversial because of adverse effects on platelet function that may prolong bleeding time and theoretically increase the risk of postoperative bleeding. Thus, COX inhibitors are not routinely prescribed by all ENT surgeons. A Cochrane review targeting the pediatric population showed no significant increase in bleeding requiring surgical intervention among recipients of COX inhibitors, but found insufficient evidence to exclude an increased risk (acetylsalicylic acid which is not recommended for children, and selective COX‐ 2 inhibitors which are known to have no effect on platelets, were not studied).

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114hvuih]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How does carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser tonsillotomy under local anesthesia (CO 2 laser TO) compare with traditional tonsillectomy (TE) in terms of long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness for adults with tonsil-related conditions?

Findings

In a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 196 patients, TE was more effective in reducing long-term symptoms, with similar quality-adjusted life-years, while CO 2 laser TO had lower costs. Both groups achieved significant symptom reduction and equal patient satisfaction, with CO 2 laser TO being 71% to 93% likely to be cost-effective.

Meaning

The results of this trial suggest that both TE and CO 2 laser TO effectively reduce long-term tonsil-related symptoms; TE is more effective, but CO 2 laser TO is a cost-effective option with shorter recovery and lower overall costs.

Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common pediatric surgical procedures performed in the United States; more than 530,000 are performed annually in children younger than 15 years of age. AT was traditionally performed for recurrent tonsillitis and its sequelae but in recent times, sleep-disordered breathing/obstructive sleep apnea in children has emerged as the primary indication for surgical removal of adenoids and tonsils. The new guidelines used by clinicians to identify children who are appropriate candidates for AT address indications based primarily on obstructive and infectious causes.

To study the morphology and activity of tonsilloliths, demonstrating oxygen respiration, denitrification, and acidification on exposure to sucrose.

Study Design

Tonsilloliths were extracted in atraumatic conditions during tonsillectomy from 16 adults and sent to two different laboratories for histological, bacteriological, and biofilm studies under sterile conditions.

Setting

Multicenter laboratory study.

Subjects and Methods

Multiple tonsilloliths from two patients examined by confocal microscopy and microelectrodes were used to measure aerobic/anaerobic respiration and acid production (dissolved oxygen, nitrous oxide, pH) when exposed to saliva following addition of sucrose and fluoride.

Results

Morphologically, tonsilloliths were similar to dental biofilms, containing corncob structures, filaments, and cocci. Microelectrodes showed that the microorganisms respired oxygen and nitrate. The oxygen concentration in the center of the tonsillolith was depleted to approximately one-tenth of that of the overlying fluid. The addition of sucrose resulted in acid production within the tonsillolith, dropping the pH from 7.3 to 5.8. The data showed stratification with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom. The depletion of oxygen and acid production following addition of sucrose may allow the proliferation of anaerobic/acidophilic bacteria. Fluoride suppressed acid production in the presence of sucrose.

Conclusions

Tonsilloliths exhibit biofilm structure and the formation of chemical gradients through physiological activity. Although tonsillectomy is an option for treating cryptic infections, understanding the morphology and biofilm characteristics of tonsilloliths may stimulate scientists to use limited or targeted remedies in the future.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^115MM6Mt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Carbon dioxide laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia may be an effective and less invasive alternative than dissection tonsillectomy for treatment of tonsil-related afflictions.

Objective

To compare functional recovery and symptom relief among adults undergoing tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 5 secondary and tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands from January 2018 to December 2019. Participants were 199 adult patients with an indication for surgical tonsil removal randomly assigned to either the tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy group.

Interventions

For tonsillotomy, the crypts of the palatine tonsil were evaporated using a carbon dioxide laser under local anesthesia, whereas tonsillectomy consisted of total tonsil removal performed under general anesthesia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to functional recovery measured within 2 weeks after surgery assessed for a modified intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes were time to return to work after surgery, resolution of primary symptoms, severity of remaining symptoms, surgical complications, postoperative pain and analgesics use, and overall patient satisfaction assessed for the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Of 199 patients (139 [70%] female; mean [SD] age, 29 [9] years), 98 were randomly assigned to tonsillotomy and 101 were randomly assigned to tonsillectomy. Recovery within 2 weeks after surgery was significantly shorter after tonsillotomy than after tonsillectomy (hazard ratio for recovery after tonsillectomy vs tonsillotomy, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2–0.5). Two weeks after surgery, 72 (77%) patients in the tonsillotomy group were fully recovered compared with 26 (57%) patients in the tonsillectomy group. Time until return to work within 2 weeks was also shorter after tonsillotomy (median [IQR], 4.5 [3.0–7.0] days vs 12.0 [9.0–14.0] days; hazard ratio for return after tonsillectomy vs tonsillotomy, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2–0.4.). Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients (2%) in the tonsillotomy group and 8 patients (12%) in the tonsillectomy group. At 6 months after surgery, fewer patients in the tonsillectomy group (25; 35%) than in the tonsillotomy group (54; 57%) experienced persistent symptoms (difference of 22%; 95% CI, 7%-37%). Most patients with persistent symptoms in both the tonsillotomy (32 of 54; 59%) and tonsillectomy (16 of 25; 64%) groups reported mild symptoms 6 months after surgery.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that compared with tonsillectomy performed under general anesthesia, laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia had a significantly shorter and less painful recovery period. A higher percentage of patients had persistent symptoms after tonsillotomy, although the intensity of these symptoms was lower than before surgery. These results suggest that laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia may be a feasible alternative to conventional tonsillectomy in this population.

### Why is there No statement regarding partial intracapsular tonsillectomy (tonsillotomy) in the new guidelines? [^1114Bet8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Partial intracapsular tonsillectomy (PIT) was revisited in 2003 as an alternate surgical option to total tonsillectomy for the treatment of tonsillar hypertrophy. However, evaluation of the existing literature on PIT reveals that it is largely focused on comparing perioperative outcomes after PIT and total tonsillectomy, with few data regarding long-term outcomes. The goal of this commentary is to explain why PIT was not incorporated into the 2019 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guideline for tonsillectomy, while acknowledging its use and potential advantages and disadvantages and outlining future research opportunities.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^111rcuwg]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Recurrent throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. When performed in the proper patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate always must be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

### Tonsillitis and tonsilloliths: diagnosis and management [^112BrrDu]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, makes up approximately 0.4% of outpatient visits in the United States. Tonsillitis is caused by a viral infection in 70% to 95% of cases. However, bacterial infections caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) account for tonsillitis in 5% to 15% of adults and 15% to 30% of patients five to 15 years of age. It is important to differentiate group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from other bacterial or viral causes of pharyngitis and tonsillitis because of the risk of progression to more systemic complications such as abscess, acute glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A variety of diagnostic tools are available, including symptom-based validated scoring systems (e.g. Centor score), and oropharyngeal and serum laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on supportive care, and if group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is identified, penicillin should be used as the first-line antibiotic. In cases of recurrent tonsillitis, watchful waiting is strongly recommended if there have been less than seven episodes in the past year, less than five episodes per year for the past two years, or less than three episodes per year for the past three years. Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are managed expectantly, and small tonsilloliths are common clinical findings. Rarely, surgical intervention is required if they become too large to pass on their own.

### Adenoid stones, an unknown culprit in pediatric throat pain [^115LBXdG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a 12-year-old male who presented with complaints of nasal congestion, intermittent throat pain, and odynophagia. He was taken to the operating room for inferior turbinate reduction and adenoidectomy and found to have stones within adenoid crypts. Adenoidectomy resulted in resolution of the patient's throat pain and pain with swallowing. Not previously described in the literature, adenoid stones may represent an unrecognized etiology of odynophagia and throat pain in the pediatric population. Adenoidectomy should be considered for patients symptomatic from adenoid stones.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update)-executive summary [^111JxXht]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112bfzMb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The current treatment for adult tonsil disease, tonsillectomy (TE), may involve a burdensome recovery.

Objective

To evaluate long-term efficacy (1- and 2-year efficacy) and cost-effectiveness of carbon dioxide (CO2) laser tonsillotomy (TO) vs TE.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial was conducted in 5 Dutch hospitals. Participants included adults with persistent tonsil-related symptoms enrolled from January 25, 2018, to December 17, 2019. Data analysis was performed from January 5, 2025, to April 9, 2025.

Interventions

Tonsillectomy under general anesthesia vs CO2 laser TO under local anesthesia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Intention-to-treat analysis on primary (persistent symptoms, defined as an answer of yes to the question of whether symptoms were still present, reported at 1 and 2 years) and secondary (symptom severity, patient satisfaction, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs], and cost-effectiveness) outcomes.

Results

In total, 98 patients were assigned to TO and 101 to TE; 98 were analyzed per group. The TO and TE groups were similar (69 [70%] vs 67 [68%] female; mean [SD] age, 29 [10] vs 30 [8] years). The most common symptom was sore throat with fever (34% vs 34%), with a baseline mean (SD) severity score of 57 (19) vs 59 (17) mm. At 1 year, 51.8% of patients assigned to TO had persistent symptoms vs 25.2% assigned to TE (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.4; P < .001); at 2 years, 45.2% vs 19.7% had persistent symptoms (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.7–6.7; P < .001). Symptom severity decreased significantly in both groups but was lower after TE at 1 year (14.8 vs 23.0 mm; mean difference, -8.1 mm; 95% CI, -14.8 to -1.5 mm; p = 0.02) and 2 years (10.8 vs 19.6 mm; mean difference, -8.8 mm; 95% CI, -14.7 to -2.9 mm; p = 0.001). Patient satisfaction was similar between groups; mean VAS scores were 79.0 (95% CI, 72.2–85.9) mm for TE and 69.3 (95% CI, 63.4–75.3) mm for TO at 1 year and 64.1 (95% CI, 55.7–72.5) mm and 64.4 (95% CI, 56.9–71.8) mm at 2 years. Similar proportions of participants would recommend the procedure at 1 year (79% TE vs 76% TO) and 2 years (71%, both). Both TE and TO demonstrated high cumulative QALYs at 2 years (EuroQol 5 Dimension: mean, 1.89 vs 1.84; mean difference, 0.05, P = 0.06; EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale: mean, 1.83 vs 1.81, mean difference, 0.02; p = 0.38). Tonsillotomy had lower overall costs ($869 vs $2363 for TE), with societal cost savings of $1925 (P = 0.001), and a 71% probability of cost-effectiveness at $25 907 per QALY (85%-93% in sensitivity analyses).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this trial suggest that both CO2 laser TO and TE under general anesthesia significantly reduced long-term symptoms, with greater reduction after TE. TO had lower cost and similar patient satisfaction. Based on these findings, CO2-laser TO appears to be a safe, effective, and cost-effective method for long-term relief of tonsil-related problems with excellent patient satisfaction.

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113CaQkR]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tonsillectomy (TE) is a widely performed surgery under general anesthesia for adults with tonsil-related conditions such as recurrent tonsillitis, tonsillolithiasis, and airway obstruction, particularly when conservative treatment is ineffective. While TE is effective, it is invasive and associated with complications such as postoperative bleeding, infection, and substantial pain. Given its invasive nature, there is growing interest in less-invasive alternatives, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser tonsillotomy (TO), which can be performed under local anesthesia.

Short-term studies suggest that CO 2 laser TO offers safer, faster recovery and reduced postoperative pain compared with TE. The short-term results of the TOMTOM trial suggest that 77% of patients who underwent CO 2 laser TO fully recovered within 2 weeks, compared with 57% of those who underwent TE, with a median time to return to work of 4.5 vs 12.0 days. Postoperative complications were also lower, with hemorrhage rates of 2% for CO 2 laser TO compared with 12% for TE. Although tonsil-related symptoms persisted more frequently after CO 2 laser TO (57% TO vs 35% TE), symptom severity was greatly reduced and patients report similarly high satisfaction in both study arms. Limited data on long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of CO 2 laser TO leave uncertainty about the role of CO 2 laser TO in clinical practice. This study compares the 1- and 2-year efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CO 2 laser TO and TE under general anesthesia in adults in the TOMTOM study.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children [^111t8WHa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.

Results

The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature > 38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^1139QbJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation, but the indications for surgery are controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 1999 and previously updated in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of tonsillectomy (with and without adenoidectomy) in children and adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis in reducing the number and severity of episodes of tonsillitis or sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in adults (40 participants) was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis. Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults. We combined data from five trials in children; these trials included children who were 'severely affected' (based on the specific 'Paradise' criteria) and less severely affected. Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of any severity) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period. When we analysed only episodes of moderate/severe sore throat, children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery. Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence). Data on the number of sore throat days is only available for moderately affected children and is consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence). When we pooled the data from two studies in adults (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). However, there was also significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence for adults to be of low quality. Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes, but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics. Limited data are available from the included studies to quantify the important risks of primary and secondary haemorrhage.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy leads to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in children in the first year after surgery compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment. Children who were more severely affected were more likely to benefit as they had a small reduction in moderate/severe sore throat episodes. The size of the effect is very modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of the procedure. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable. Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in adults to draw a firm conclusion. The impact of surgery, as demonstrated in the included studies, is modest. Many participants in the non-surgical group improve spontaneously (although some people randomised to this group do in fact undergo surgery). The potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115Lsdxr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Randomized trial limitations and evidence grading — when weighing tonsillectomy for recurrent infection, limitations of the evidence include small randomized samples and incomplete follow-up, prompting a downgrade in evidence level. Limitations of the available randomized controlled trials must also be considered when assessing the benefits and harms of surgery. Paradise and colleagues randomized 91 children to surgery versus observation after screening thousands, only a small percentage met strict entry criteria and only about half of eligible children agreed to randomization, and in both studies only about half (46%-62%) of enrolled children completed all 3 years of follow-up. Although these limitations did not invalidate the trials, the panel downgraded the aggregate evidence level from A (randomized trials) to B (randomized trials with limitations).

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1149vJ4W]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

To date, few studies have compared the long-term efficacy of TE and TO in adults. A review reported no significant difference in outcomes over up to 6 years in 5 of 6 studies, although variations in surgical methods, indications, and criteria complicated comparisons, and some studies lacked quality. A previous nonrandomized cohort study reported 72.5% of patients were symptom-free 1 year after CO 2 laser TO vs 97.2% after TE, with similar satisfaction. Outside the adult context, longer-term follow-up in children support the durability of TO. A 12-year follow-up study in children found no significant differences between TO and TE in disease-specific quality of life, throat infections, or satisfaction rates, with most patients free from tonsil-related issues. Similarly, a 6-year randomized study in children comparing CO 2 laser TO with TE found equally stable outcomes in snoring, apneas, and infections, with no significant differences between groups. Patient satisfaction and health improvements were high in both study arms.

### Association between the microbiomes of tonsil and saliva samples isolated from pediatric patients subjected to tonsillectomy for the treatment of tonsillar hyperplasia [^112Ybxjy]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the collective results, we have expanded our understanding of the interactions between the microbiomes of saliva and tonsils. Several factors are responsible for the loss of microbial diversity and homeostatic function, including inflammation, diet, xenobiotics, and altered host cell function. Given its critical roles in multiple diseases, the microbiome has become an extremely attractive target for therapeutic interventions. One of the biggest hurdles in microbiome research is the identification of cause-effect relationships and the design of microbiome-based therapies that are able to achieve predictable effects on the microbial community and host cell function. Further studies are required to develop strategies aimed at modulating the microbiome profile to improve host function and health.

In conclusion, the analysis of the microbiomes of paired tonsil and saliva samples from Korean pediatric patients diagnosed with hyperplasia without tonsillitis revealed that many bacterial communities are shared and show similarities in terms of diversity and composition, suggesting close interactions between the two microbial groups. Although further studies are clearly essential, we assume that the oral microbiome exerts significant effects on not only the tonsil itself but also the tonsil-derived immune or stem cells by regulating the microbial community. Our preliminary study may serve as a cornerstone in that it sheds light on the possibility of future research on novel microbiome-based therapeutic tactics using tonsil-derived cells or a tonsil-related microenvironment.

### Halitosis and the tonsils: a review of management [^117JXcSk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Halitosis secondary to pathology of the palatine tonsils is considered airway (type 2) halitosis in the etiologic classification. Reports differ as to the proportion of objective halitosis complaints that have tonsillar etiology, with some giving this figure as 3%. Due to their immunologic role, even healthy tonsils usually possess some subclinical inflammation. The tonsil crypt system is also the most ideal environment for anaerobic bacterial activity in the upper respiratory tract. Tonsillar halitosis is thought to occur mainly because of chronic caseous tonsillitis and tonsillolithiasis (tonsil stones). Tonsillectomy and various cryptolysis techniques are reported to improve halitosis in such cases. In this article, diagnostic methods and evidence for interventions are reviewed.

Data Source

Medline search.

Review Methods

Studies reporting the efficacy of any intervention (medical or surgical) on tonsillar halitosis were included, whether halitosis was the focus or one of several measures.

Conclusions

There are insufficient high-quality studies on this topic. Improved methodology, for example, use of control groups and utilization of more accurate halitosis detection/quantification techniques, are required.

Implications For Practice

Lack of evidence currently prevents firm conclusions, but the following is recommended: (1) Use reliable methods for halitosis diagnosis and confirmation of tonsillar etiology. Initial treatment such as tongue scraping is useful to rule out oral halitosis. (2) Tonsillar procedures are contraindicated in: subjective halitosis, non-tonsillar etiology, or if medical management resolves halitosis. (3) Where indicated and where facilities permit, less invasive techniques such as laser cryptolysis may be preferable to tonsillectomy in adults, potentially avoiding general anesthetic and the higher risk associated with tonsillectomy in this group.

### Indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy [^1178LwzC]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review recent clinical trials that provide a foundation on which clinicians can base decisions regarding adenotonsillar surgery for their patients.

Study Design

Review.

Methods

An evidence-based approach was used to review recent clinical trials addressing indications for adenotonsillectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy.

Results

Absolute indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy include adenotonsillar hyperplasia with obstructive sleep apnea, failure to thrive, or abnormal dentofacial growth; suspicion of malignant disease; and (for tonsillectomy) hemorrhagic tonsillitis. Relative indications for both procedures are adenotonsillar hyperplasia with upper airway obstruction, dysphagia, or speech impairment, and halitosis. Otitis media and recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis or adenoiditis are relative indications for adenoidectomy but not tonsillectomy. Recurrent or chronic pharyngotonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, and streptococcal carriage are relative indications for tonsillectomy but not adenoidectomy.

Conclusion

Good clinical evidence regarding indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is available. Clinicians should make recommendations for surgery on the basis of this evidence.

### Coblation cryptolysis method in treatment of tonsil caseum-induced halitosis [^112sdQe5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Halitosis, is a social problem affecting many patients seeking help from clinicians. Tonsil stones can cause halitosis and especially occur in crypts of palatine tonsils. Coblation cryptolysis is an alternative method for tonsil caseum treatment. The coblation technology includes passing a radiofrequency bipolar electrical current through a medium of normal saline which results in the production of a plasma field of sodium ions. In this study, our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of coblator cryptolysis treatment method in chronic caseous tonsillitis-induced halitosis.

Methods

We included in our study 28 patients who underwent coblator cryptolysis surgery for halitosis due to chronic caseous tonsillitis. The efficacy of treatment and the presence of caseoma were evaluated with the Finkelstein test, organoleptic test and VAS before the procedure and at the 6th month control after the treatment was completed.

Results

At the 6th month follow-up after the procedure (a single coblation cryptolysis) we found that 23 of the patients (82.1%) had no caseum. There was a statistically significant change in Finkelstein measurements before and after the procedure (p < 0.001). Organoleptic measurements demonstrated that 21 patients had no halitosis postoperatively and the mean organoleptic test score was calculated as 0.39 ± 0.79 after the procedure. The recovery was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean VAS score before coblation cryptolysis was 8.0 ± 1.33 (range 5–10). On the other hand 6 months after a single coblation cryptolysis session, the mean VAS score was 1.25 ± 1.78 (range: 0–6). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that coblation crptolysis is an effective, safe, minimally invasive and practical alternative method in treatment of halitosis due to tonsil caseums. We did not observe any complication after the procedure.

### Removal of stones and food for relief of pain… [^113GoEGM]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: I appreciated the article by Smith and colleagues on tonsillitis and tonsilloliths. 1 Recurrent or severe tonsillitis can be frustrating for the patient and physician. Clinical experience has led me to believe that much of the pain, recurrence of acute tonsillitis, and chronic halitosis is due to debris — stones or food — in the tonsillar crypts. Removal of stones or food is simple and results in an almost immediate decrease in tonsillar swelling, pain, and future episodes. I examined an adult patient whose tonsils were severely swollen with numerous large crypts, most with large amounts of debris. The patient was in obvious pain. I sprayed her throat with benzocaine and removed some of the debris. The patient called four hours later to thank me. She stated that she had never felt relief so quickly or thoroughly in all the years she has had sore throats. This encounter changed my approach to acute and chronic tonsillitis when cryptic debris or tonsilloliths are present.

The first step to stone or debris removal is to explain the procedure to the patient. They should be warned that the material removed from the tonsils is foul-tasting. Next, the patient is given a warm, moist washcloth to wipe the debris from their mouth should they not wish to swallow it. Benzocaine is sprayed onto the tonsils. The patient is asked not to swallow for 15 seconds. This step is repeated. The patient is placed in the sniffing position, leaning forward with their chin extended as though leaning forward to sniff a flower. A 4 × 4 inch gauze pad is used to grasp the tongue, which is pulled with slight pressure to maximally expose the oropharynx. With a light via a head mirror or lamp, an ear curette is used to remove the debris from each of the tonsillar crypts, similar to wax removal from the auditory canal. A tongue blade may be required to press the tongue down or the anterior tonsillar folds laterally to get total exposure.

It is not unusual for blood-streaked pus to drain after debris removal. With a gloved hand, the index finger can apply mild pressure to the lateral edge of the tonsil and be swept medially. After clearing both tonsils, the patient is asked to gargle with cool water and spit out the residue until there is no more blood or pus.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^114iMW13]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. One important limitation is the uneven distribution of patients between the tonsillotomy and tonsillectomy groups who received their randomized treatment. We postulate that the higher patient withdrawal rate in the tonsillectomy group reflected the real-world hesitation to undergo tonsillectomy among patients. We emphasize that this withdrawal is not outcome dependent and therefore should not bias our results unless prognosis of the withdrawn patients differs from the general population. We compared the characteristics listed in Table 1 between patients who received treatment and patients who withdrew from the randomized surgical treatment and found no significant differences between groups, except for percentage of patients who were employed (78% vs 50%; P = 0.02). Thus, we have no indication that withdrawal biased our results. We also note that our modified intention-to-treat analysis of functional recovery and our intention-to-treat analysis of long-term follow-up symptom resolution represent real-world estimates of patient burden and treatment effect on symptoms.

We found no indication that the type of tonsil concern influenced treatment success. However, our study was likely underpowered to find any difference in specific subgroups. Further research should be conducted to assess potential differences.

The incidence of postoperative hemorrhage in the tonsillectomy group was higher than previously reported from retrospective studies. We believe that part of the higher postoperative hemorrhage rate in the present study may be attributed to our strict follow-up, which included questions directly related to complications, including postoperative hemorrhage. Other prospective studies have similar unexpected high rates of postoperative hemorrhages after cold steel dissection tonsillectomy.

Finally, in the present study, patients with peritonsillar abscesses and patients with an indication for histopathologic analysis of the excised tonsil tissue (eg, to rule out malignant neoplasm) were excluded, and therefore the results of this trial do not apply to these populations. We recommend that patients with peritonsillar abscess be treated with tonsillectomy owing to the risk of recurrence of abscesses and the potentially lethal complications. Potential residual tonsil tissue after tonsillotomy in those cases is not desirable. Furthermore, when histopathologic analysis is required, laser tonsillotomy is not suitable because all of the tissue is evaporated by laser heating.

### Tonsillectomy versus tonsillotomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children [^1136dAam]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) is a condition encompassing breathing problems when asleep due to upper airway obstruction. In children, hypertrophy of the tonsils and/or adenoids is thought to be the commonest cause. As such, (adeno)tonsillectomy has long been the treatment of choice. A rise in partial removal of the tonsils over the last decade is due to the hypothesis that tonsillotomy is associated with lower postoperative morbidity and fewer complications.

Objectives

To assess whether partial removal of the tonsils (intracapsular tonsillotomy) is as effective as total removal of the tonsils (extracapsular tonsillectomy) in relieving signs and symptoms of oSDB in children, and has lower postoperative morbidity and fewer complications.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The search date was 22 July 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of (adeno)tonsillectomy with (adeno)tonsillotomy in children aged 2 to 16 years with oSDB.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods and assessed the certainty of the evidence for our pre-defined outcomes using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific quality of life, peri-operative blood loss and the proportion of children requiring postoperative medical intervention (with or without hospitalisation). Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, return to normal activity, recurrence of oSDB symptoms as a result of tonsil regrowth and reoperation rates.

Main Results

We included 22 studies (1984 children), with predominantly unclear or high risk of bias. Three studies used polysomnography as part of their inclusion criteria. Follow-up duration ranged from six days to six years. Although 19 studies reported on some of our outcomes, we could only pool the results from a few due both to the variety of outcomes and the measurement instruments used, and an absence of combinable data. Disease-specific quality of life Four studies (540 children; 484 (90%) analysed) reported this outcome; data could not be pooled due to the different outcome measurement instruments used. It is very uncertain whether there is any difference in disease-specific quality of life between the two surgical procedures in the short (0 to 6 months; 3 studies, 410 children), medium (7 to 13 months; 2 studies, 117 children) and long term (13 to 24 months; 1 study, 67 children) (very low-certainty evidence). Peri-operative blood loss We are uncertain whether tonsillotomy reduces peri-operative blood loss by a clinically meaningful amount (mean difference (MD) 14.06 mL, 95% CI 1.91 to 26.21 mL; 8 studies, 610 children; very low-certainty evidence). In sensitivity analysis (restricted to three studies with low risk of bias) there was no evidence of a difference between the groups. Postoperative complications requiring medical intervention (with or without hospitalisation) The risk of postoperative complications in the first week after surgery was probably lower in children who underwent tonsillotomy (4.9% versus 2.6%, risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.91; 16 studies, 1416 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Postoperative pain Eleven studies (1017 children) reported this outcome. Pain was measured using various scales and scored by either children, parents, clinicians or study personnel. When considering postoperative pain there was little or no difference between tonsillectomy and tonsillotomy at 24 hours (10-point scale) (MD 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.29; 4 studies, 368 children); at two to three days (MD 0.93, 95% CI -0.14 to 2.00; 3 studies, 301 children); or at four to seven days (MD 1.07, 95% CI -0.40 to 2.53; 4 studies, 370 children) (all very low-certainty evidence). In sensitivity analysis (restricted to studies with low risk of bias), we found no evidence of a difference in mean pain scores between groups. Return to normal activity Tonsillotomy probably results in a faster return to normal activity. Children who underwent tonsillotomy were able to return to normal activity four days earlier (MD 3.84 days, 95% CI 0.23 to 7.44; 3 studies, 248 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Recurrence of oSDB and reoperation rates We are uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups in the short (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.22; 3 studies, 186 children), medium (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.23; 4 studies, 206 children) or long term (RR 0.21 95% CI 0.01 to 4.13; 1 study, 65 children) (all very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For children with oSDB selected for tonsil surgery, tonsillotomy probably results in a faster return to normal activity (four days) and in a slight reduction in postoperative complications requiring medical intervention in the first week after surgery. This should be balanced against the clinical effectiveness of one operation over the other. However, this is not possible to determine in this review as data on the long-term effects of the two operations on oSDB symptoms, quality of life, oSDB recurrence and need for reoperation are limited and the evidence is of very low quality leading to a high degree of uncertainty about the results. More robust data from high-quality cohort studies, which may be more appropriate for detecting differences in less common events in the long term, are required to inform guidance on which tonsil surgery technique is best for children with oSDB requiring surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1171rkAU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Balance of benefit versus harm for tonsillectomy in severe recurrent throat infection indicates modest benefit and supports either surgery or watchful waiting with shared decision making. Caregivers and patients who meet the appropriate criteria for tonsillectomy as described here should be advised of only modest anticipated benefits of tonsillectomy, as weighed against the natural history of resolution with watchful waiting, as well as the risk of surgical morbidity and complications and the unknown risk of general anesthesia exposure in children < 4 years of age. The guideline panel agreed that there was not a clear preponderance of benefit over harm for tonsillectomy, even for children meeting the Paradise criteria, and felt there to be a balance that allows either tonsillectomy or watchful waiting as an appropriate management option that does not imply all qualifying children should have surgery; this underscores a substantial role for shared decision making with the child's caregiver and primary care clinician.

### Coblation cryptolysis to treat tonsil stones: a retrospective case series [^1111txpG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2012). Low credibility.

We introduce a novel and potentially effective approach in the treatment of tonsil stones using Coblation technology. A retrospective pilot case series was performed demonstrating the effectiveness of a technique that we call Coblation tonsil cryptolysis. This technique is unique in that it can be performed in adult patients without sedation using only local anesthesia, much like laser tonsil cryptolysis. As with laser cryptolysis, pain is significant for only a few days and most adults can resume normal diet and activity within 1 week. In contrast, tonsillectomy entails significant morbidity for several weeks. However, Coblation avoids the significant disadvantages of laser use, including the potential for airway fire, retinal damage from reflected scatter, dealing with plume from vaporized tissues, oral/facial burns, and the high cost of purchasing and maintaining laser equipment. After a single session of Coblation tonsil cryptolysis, a significant decrease and even elimination of tonsil stones can potentially be achieved.

### Laser tonsil cryptolysis: in-office 500 cases review [^114FS5K8]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Tonsilloliths, proven to be tonsillar biofilms cause symptoms of halitosis, foreign body sensation and recurrent sore throats. Laser Tonsil Cryptolysis (LTC) performed in the office may represent an alternative to tonsillectomy in selected cases of persistent tonsilloliths with cryptic infections.

Study Design

A retrospective chart analysis using CPT codes.

Setting

Office and hospital.

Methods

A retrospective complications review consisting of bleeding, the need for an additional procedure, patient satisfaction and conversion rate to complete tonsillectomy was documented.

Results

Five hundred consecutive LTCs performed in the office under local anesthesia with a CO2 or diode laser were identified. Energy delivery was in continuous mode with power settings of 18W and 10W respectively. Bleeding occurred in 6 patients requiring unscheduled return office visit for evaluation. Eighty patients required a second procedure, comprising total of 1.16 procedures per patient. Eighteen (3.6%) patients underwent complete tonsillectomy. Patient satisfaction was high with an overall incidence of 0–2 days of work absence. Follow-up was 1–8 years.

Conclusions

With a small tonsil size, controllable gag reflex and cooperative adult patient LTC allows several advantages compared to conventional tonsillectomy. Benefits of LTC include avoidance of general anesthesia and limited ablation of cryptic pockets, resulting in reduced post-operative pain, bleeding, shorter recovery time and the convenience and cost advantage of an office procedure. With 1.16 sessions required per patient, low conversion rate to standard tonsillectomy and minimal complication rate LTC can be considered an alternative option to a patient suffering from recurrent cryptic tonsillitis with or without tonsilloliths.

### Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy-pediatric clinics of north America [^1173trUs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are among the most commonly performed major pediatric operations in the United States, with more than 500,000 procedures performed annually. This procedure can be performed with or without adenoidectomy. These procedures were traditionally performed for recurrent tonsillitis; however, the vast majority of tonsillectomies are currently performed for obstructive symptoms. When performed for appropriate indications, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy can greatly improve a child's quality of life and general health. Given the prevalence of these conditions and subsequent surgical procedures, evidence-based recommendations are regularly evaluated and updated. As such, familiarity with these guidelines is necessary for pediatric practitioners. This review summarizes the indications, complications, and outcomes for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, as well as provides a brief overview of operative techniques.

### PROSPECT guideline for tonsillectomy: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^116mWfEs]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of post‐tonsillectomy pain can be challenging and often inadequate. Tonsillectomy has been identified as one of the most painful surgical procedures [1], probably because pain remains poorly managed in clinical practice [1, 2, 3]. There are many reasons for undertreating pain after tonsillectomy, including clinicians underestimating the degree of pain associated with tonsillectomy surgery due to the fact that the surgical procedure is considered to be minimally invasive [1]. Moreover, despite numerous studies comparing and combining analgesics to find the most effective postoperative regimen, there is still no consensus on the best treatment strategy. Tonsillectomy is unique for several reasons including the type of tissue trauma, the exposure of the healing wound to movement of the pharynx during ingestion, the risk of bleeding and limitations in the choice of drugs, particularly in children. Thus, the ideal regimen providing adequate analgesia with few side‐effects after tonsillectomy remains to be defined. Guidelines on pain management after tonsillectomy have previously been published [4, 5].

The PROSPECT Working Group is a collaboration of surgeons and anaesthetists working to formulate procedure‐specific recommendations for pain management after common but potentially painful operations [6]. The recommendations are based on a procedure‐specific systematic review of randomised controlled trials. The methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic techniques [7].

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on the management of pain after tonsillectomy in both adults and children. Pain scores and analgesic requirements were the primary focus, but other recovery outcomes, including adverse effects, were also assessed when reported, and the limitations of the data were reviewed. The ultimate aim was to develop recommendations for pain management after tonsillectomy.

Tonsilloliths are calcified concretions that develop in tonsillar crypts. They are usually asymptomatic; however, they may cause problems such as halitosis, dysphagia, a globus sensation, and otalgia. Tonsilloliths may be diagnosed by a simple inspection or palpation of tonsillar crypts, which can be confirmed by panoramic radiography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. We report 3 cases of tonsilloliths diagnosed by transoral sonography that was performed easily and comfortably in an office-based setting.

### A multicenter randomized controlled trial of tonsillectomy combined with steroid pulse therapy in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy [^113Yfh7Q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Second, the incidence of the disappearance of proteinuria and/or hematuria after 12 months was not significantly different between the two groups. In our study, the disappearance of proteinuria with steroid pulses alone was more frequent than that extrapolated from the results of the previous reports. This unexpectedly high incidence may have resulted in the failure to find statistical difference between the two groups. More patients should be included for a more definitive conclusion. Third, the pattern in the decrease of urinary protein excretion could not be analyzed using repeated ANOVA, because the data available at some time points were insufficient for analysis. Fourth, a few of the enrolled patients had to be excluded from the analysis, which may have reduced the effectiveness of randomization. Nevertheless, all the parameters at baseline were comparable between the two groups. This notion is supported by the results of the logistic regression analysis. Fifth, RAS inhibitors were administered only in nearly half of the patients in both groups at baseline. Therefore, some patients could show proteinuria < 1 g/day at baseline, if all the patients were given RAS inhibitors prior to the trial. The mixed effect model revealed that a significantly greater antiproteinuric effect of tonsillectomy plus steroid pulses was independent from the use of RAS inhibitors at baseline. Nevertheless, the differential use of RAS inhibitors by different investigators could have potentially biased the results. Moreover, the impact of RAS inhibitors on patients who started RAS inhibitors during the trial was not clear. Finally, the study lacks sufficient information for the removed tonsil, such as, the frequency of presence of tonsils with infection as assessed by the presence of crypt abscesses or bacterial colonies in tonsillar tissues by macroscopic or microscopic inspection. It has been reported that the efficacy of tonsillectomy is difficult to predict on the basis of the appearance of tonsils or clinical episodes of recurrent tonsillitis; thus, the relationship between the condition of removed tonsils and the outcome of proteinuria remains elusive.

In conclusion, tonsillectomy combined with steroid pulses had no additional benefit over steroid pulses alone in the disappearance of hematuria or the achievement of clinical remission. Although the antiproteinuric effect was significantly larger in the treatment with tonsillectomy plus steroid pulses than in steroid pulses alone, the difference was very subtle. Whether this marginal antiproteinuric effect improves renal outcome remains to be clarified.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^115q8DWH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillar structure, immune function, and effects of tonsillitis/tonsillectomy — The palatine tonsils are lymphoepithelial organs located at the junction of the oral cavity and oropharynx, and the greatest immunologic activity of the tonsils is found between the ages of 3 and 10 years. While all 5 immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes are produced in the palatine tonsils, IgA is arguably the most important product of the tonsillar immune system. With recurrent tonsillitis, the controlled process of antigen transport and presentation is altered due to shedding of the M cells from the tonsil epithelium; nevertheless, there are no studies to date that demonstrate a significant clinical impact of tonsillectomy on the immune system.

Tonsillectomy in children — evidence-based statement categories define three levels with corresponding implied obligations: Strong recommendation — A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation — A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as high, and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option — An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another, and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113VpBpt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Resolution of Tonsil-Related Symptoms

Six months after randomization to tonsillotomy or tonsillectomy, the chief concern persisted in 54 of 94 patients (57%) after tonsillotomy and in 25 of 71 patients (35%) after tonsillectomy (difference 95% CI, 7%-37%; P = 0.005) (Table 2). For patients with remaining concerns, the severity of the chief concern decreased significantly both in the tonsillotomy (mean [SD] baseline, 57.6 [18.1] vs follow-up, 37.6 [22.1]; effect size 0.88; P = 0.01) and tonsillectomy (mean [SD] baseline, 54.4 [13.6] vs 23.9 [11.3] follow-up; effect size 2.24; P = 0.01) groups. Most patients with persistent symptoms in both the tonsillotomy (32 of 54; 59%) and tonsillectomy (16 of 25; 64%) groups reported mild symptoms 6 months after surgery. When measured on a continuous scale of 0 to 100, patients with persistent symptoms in the tonsillotomy group reported slightly higher symptom severity compared with the tonsillectomy group (mean [SD], 38 [22] vs 26 [13] mm; effect size 0.66; P = 0.02). For patients with remaining tonsil concerns, the distribution of the chief concern leading to surgery was similar to the baseline distribution among patients in the tonsillotomy group (baseline: sore throat without fever, 31 [32%]; sore throat with fever, 33 [34%]; tonsillolithiasis, 32 [33%]; snoring, 2 [2%]; and dysphagia 0 [0%] vs persistent symptoms: sore throat without fever, 16 [30%]; sore throat with fever, 14 [26%]; tonsillolithiasis, 23 [43%]; snoring, 1 [2%]; and dysphagia, 0 [0]%; P = 0.64) and in the tonsillectomy group (baseline: sore throat without fever, 33 [33%]; sore throat with fever, 33 [33%]; tonsillolithiasis, 32 [32%]; snoring, 2 [2%]; and dysphagia, 1 [1%] vs sore throat without fever, 9 [36%]; sore throat with fever, 8 [32%]; tonsillolithiasis, 6 [24%]; snoring, 2 [8%]; and dysphagia, 0 [0%]; P = 0.52), indicating that the type of tonsil concern did not influence treatment success.

Benefits note that "Patients who proceed with the option of tonsillectomy will achieve a modest reduction in the frequency and severity of recurrent throat infection for 1 year after surgery and a modest reduction in frequency of group A streptococcal infection for 1 year after surgery", while "Risks, harms, costs" include surgical morbidity and direct and indirect costs. The "Benefits-harm assessment" is a "Balance between benefit and harm", "Role of patient preferences" is "Large role for shared decision making", and the "Policy level: Option". The group held "near consensus" but "1 member… felt that tonsillectomy should not be recommended", with some preferring to list both tonsillectomy and watchful waiting as options.

For category 1, "tonsillectomy is efficacious in reducing the number and severity of subsequent infections for at least 2 years when children fulfill stringent criteria for recurrent sore throat", and when episodes are very severe or poorly tolerated, medication allergies complicate therapy selection, or absences interfere with school performance, "surgery with its attendant reduction of episodes of illness may be recommended".

3 Results

3.1 Study Selection and Characteristics

As detailed in PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1), the initial search on databases yielded 1495 results. After the removal of duplicate records and screening of titles and abstracts, 27 studies were selected for full‐text review, while snowballing and further search resulted in the selection of four additional studies. Thus, 31 studies were fully reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of nine studies were included in this review, comprising 612 patients from six RCTs and three prospective non‐randomized cohorts. A total of 612 tonsils (50%) were removed with a laser method, and the remaining were resected by cold steel dissection.

Figure 1
PRISMA 2020 flow diagram.

Tonsil removal in the intervention arm was performed with CO 2 laser in four studies, diode contact laser in two studies, and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP)‐532 laser in another two studies. All studies included patients with a history of recurrent acute and/or chronic tonsillitis. Three included studies performed a within‐subject study design. Regarding pain scales, the most frequently used was the visual analog scale (VAS), reported by four studies. Definitions of intraoperative blood loss and operation time varied among studies (Tables S1 and S2, respectively). Further baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1.

Design and characteristics of studies included in the meta‐analysis.

3.2 Pooled Analyses of Studies

In the overall analysis with eight studies (n = 1162 tonsils), the use of laser was associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss (MD −35.89; 95% CI [−53.08, −18.71]; p < 0.01; I² = 100%; Figure 2) and shorter operation time (MD −10.46; 95% CI [−16.63, −4.29]; p < 0.01; I² = 99%; Figure 3) when compared to cold steel dissection.

### Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of laser tonsillotomy vs tonsillectomy: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117PY8qo]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

Patient Inclusion and Disposition

Of the 199 patients randomized, 98 were assigned to CO 2 laser TO and 101 to TE. After excluding 3 patients in the TE group due to informed consent discrepancies, 196 patients were included in the final analysis (Figure 1). The CO 2 laser TO and TE groups were similar (TO: 69 [70%] female, 29 [30%] male vs TE: 67 [68%] female, 31 [32%] male; mean [SD] age, 29 [10] vs 30 [8] years).

Figure 1.
Trial Flow Diagram

CO 2 indicates carbon dioxide; TE tonsillectomy; and TO, tonsillotomy.

Baseline characteristics were comparable between the TO and TE groups in terms of chief tonsil symptoms, with sore throat with (34% vs 34%) and without fever (32% vs 32%) being the most common, followed by tonsillolithiasis (33% vs 32%). The self-reported severity of tonsil symptoms (mean [SD] severity score) was similar between groups (mean [SD], 57 [19] mm for TO vs 59 [17] mm for TE), and most patients rated their symptoms as moderate or severe. Smoking status also showed a similar distribution between groups, with approximately 18% to 14% current smokers, 25% to 16% former smokers, and 58% to 47% never smokers for CO 2 laser TO vs TE (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). A total of 163 patients (82%) received their assigned treatment.

In the CO 2 laser TO group, 17 patients required a second treatment for residual symptoms, 9 switched to TE for recurrent symptoms. In the TE group, 32 did not undergo the assigned procedure, and 9 patients reported to have received TE at nonparticipating centers. The primary reason for withdrawal in the TE group was patients opting out after randomization (Figure 1). More censored patients were noted in the TE vs TO group for full recovery (35 vs 22), return to work (8 vs 5), and analgesic use (16 vs 3).

Efficacy and effectiveness of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection show short-term benefits that diminish over time. Evidence "suggest[s] a modest but statistically significant reduction in frequency of throat infection among severely affected patients undergoing tonsillectomy for 1 year but no longer". In a trial meeting strict episode criteria, "the tonsillectomy group experienced a mean rate reduction of 1.9 episodes per year in the first year of follow-up", whereas controls had "a mean rate reduction of 0.5 to 1 episodes per year". For moderate or severe episodes, controls had "1.2 episodes in the first year versus 0.1 in the surgical group".

### Oral rinses, mouthwashes and sprays for improving recovery following tonsillectomy [^116KnAbE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2010 and previously updated in 2011. Tonsillectomy is the surgical removal of lymphoid tissue, the palatine tonsil, which is located at the back of the throat. It is still commonly performed for patients who have recurrent bouts of acute tonsillitis. Although tonsillectomy is considered a fairly minor procedure, pain and bleeding are two of the most common complications; either may delay recovery and can on occasion lead to hospital readmission. Postoperative tonsillectomy medication should provide an adequate reduction in morbidity while minimising side effects, therefore topical agents would seem to be an ideal, safe option. A number of mouthwashes and topical sprays are available which offer pain relief or can help to reduce bleeding in the immediate postoperative period.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral rinses, mouthwashes and sprays in improving recovery following tonsillectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 July 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which oral rinses, mouthwashes and sprays, used pre- and postoperatively, have been compared with placebo in adults or children undergoing tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data independently.

Main Results

We included seven trials (593 participants; 397 children and 196 adults). The period of follow-up ranged from 24 hours to two weeks. Few of the trials provided reliable data for the pre-specified primary outcomes and none for the secondary outcomes. The risk of bias was high in most of the included trials. Lidocaine spray appeared to be more effective than saline spray at reducing the severity of pain until the third postoperative day. A small number of participants experienced a burning or stinging sensation with benzydamine spray but not sufficient to discontinue usage.

Authors' Conclusions

Poor reporting quality and inadequate data did not permit comprehensive and reliable conclusions to be made. Future trials should be well-constructed and pay more attention to the methods used to assess outcomes, the timing of the assessments, and the quality of reporting and subsequent analysis of the data.

### Time to functional recovery after laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia vs conventional tonsillectomy with general anesthesia among adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113XdxGT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, tonsillolithiasis, halitosis, dysphagia, and snoring are common tonsil-related conditions in adults. When conservative treatment of these conditions fails, surgery may be indicated.

Classic dissection tonsillectomy with complete tonsil removal under general anesthesia is the most used surgical technique. In the United States and Europe combined, more than 500 000 tonsillectomies are performed in adult patients every year. After tonsillectomy, recovery to normal function is typically long. Postoperative complications of tonsillectomy include bleeding, infection, and severe pain, any of which may lead to hospital readmissions and contribute to a protracted recovery. Partial removal of the tonsil, tonsillotomy, has been performed for 3000 years and is increasingly being reexplored to potentially decrease patient burden and risk. During tonsillotomy, only the cryptic lymphatic tissue is removed, and the tonsil capsule that contains larger nerves and blood vessels is left intact. This may lead to less postoperative pain and bleeding. Tonsillotomy may be performed in adults using different instruments and techniques, including the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser, diathermy, radiofrequency, microdebrider, coblation, bipolar electrosurgical device, and cold steel dissection.

The CO 2 laser is the most used laser modality in tonsillotomy and is known for its good ablation and hemorrhage-controlling characteristics. An advantage of the CO 2 laser is its ability to perform tonsillotomy under local anesthesia without sedation. General anesthesia has additional effects on postoperative and functional recovery, and obviating the need for general anesthesia may provide additional recovery benefit over tonsillectomy. However, there is a lack of evidence with sufficient quality regarding the clinical usefulness of tonsillotomy compared with tonsillectomy in adults.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial to compare CO 2 laser tonsillotomy performed under local anesthesia to tonsillectomy performed under general anesthesia for tonsil-related concerns in adults. We hypothesized that tonsillotomy would have a shorter functional recovery period. Secondary outcomes included relief 6 months after surgery of the primary concern that led to tonsil removal and tonsil symptom severity.
