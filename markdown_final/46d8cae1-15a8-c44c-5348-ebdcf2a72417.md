## Question

Acyclovir shingles

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acyclovir for shingles (herpes zoster). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and why antivirals matter. Then, I should verify acyclovir's mechanism and labeled indications. Next, I will review dosing by patient population and severity, including oral versus IV therapy. After that, I need to check timing of initiation and duration. I will then examine efficacy data and how it translates to clinical outcomes. I should also consider special populations, safety, and resistance. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach with monitoring and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and why antivirals are important. Shingles results from reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus, typically causing a painful, unilateral, dermatomal vesicular rash; complications include postherpetic neuralgia, ocular involvement, and dissemination, with risk rising with age and immunocompromise, so timely antiviral therapy aims to limit viral replication, accelerate healing, and reduce complications [^111Tmb4Z] [^113HfjAs].

> I need to verify acyclovir's mechanism and labeled indications. Acyclovir is a guanosine analog that inhibits viral DNA polymerase after phosphorylation by virus-specific thymidine kinase, thereby blocking replication; it is FDA-approved for acute treatment of herpes zoster in immunocompetent patients, with oral and IV formulations available, and IV use indicated for immunocompromised hosts with VZV infection [^111nuMED] [^114oKf8B] [^11295rkh].

> Next, I should review standard oral dosing for immunocompetent adults. The typical regimen is 800 mg orally five times daily for 7 to 10 days, ideally started within 72 hours of rash onset; I initially thought "five times daily for 7 days", but wait, let me verify — yes, 7 to 10 days is correct, and efficacy wanes if started after 72 hours, though treatment may still be reasonable in select cases with ongoing new lesions or severe pain [^1119uWwf] [^114xyKqU].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing for immunocompromised patients and when to use IV therapy. For extensive cutaneous disease or suspected visceral involvement, IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours is recommended until clinical improvement, then step down to oral therapy to complete a total of 10 to 14 days; in children with HIV, 20 mg/kg (max 800 mg) orally four times daily is standard, with IV acyclovir for severe disease or complications [^112WVpEB] [^112tqo91] [^113KzshN].

> I will now examine timing and duration more closely. Treatment within 48 hours provides the greatest benefit, with meaningful benefit up to 72 hours; beyond 72 hours, evidence is limited, but many experts still treat if new lesions are forming or complications are present, and extending therapy to 10 to 14 days is reasonable for slow healing or immunocompromise; I should double-check that no high-quality data support routine treatment beyond 14 days — none do, so I should avoid exceeding that without a compelling reason [^1119uWwf] [^112WVpEB] [^111ncV8c].

> Next, I should review efficacy data and translate it to clinical outcomes. Placebo-controlled trials show oral acyclovir shortens the time to lesion scabbing, healing, and cessation of pain, reduces viral shedding, and decreases new lesion formation; benefits are more pronounced in patients older than 50 years, and while acyclovir reduces acute zoster-associated pain, its effect on preventing postherpetic neuralgia is modest and inconsistent across studies, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^1119uWwf] [^113Pwqp8].

> But wait, what about alternatives and comparative effectiveness. Valacyclovir and famciclovir have superior oral bioavailability and simpler dosing, and head-to-head data suggest comparable or slightly faster pain resolution versus acyclovir; in immunocompromised hosts, guidelines prefer valacyclovir or famciclovir orally when appropriate, reserving IV acyclovir for severe or disseminated disease, which aligns with practical adherence considerations [^111Tmb4Z] [^112WVpEB] [^113hudYL].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and scenarios. In herpes zoster ophthalmicus, urgent systemic antivirals are indicated, and some guidelines advise IV acyclovir for severe ocular disease or acute retinal necrosis, followed by prolonged oral therapy; in pregnancy, oral acyclovir is considered acceptable when clinically indicated; in renal impairment, dose adjustment is required to mitigate neurotoxicity risk, and hydration should be emphasized [^113m9hWN] [^116jfbfd] [^114t74ys].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and resistance. Common adverse effects of oral acyclovir include malaise, nausea, and diarrhea; IV acyclovir can cause nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, particularly with rapid infusion or in renal dysfunction, and rare neurotoxicity has been reported even with normal renal function, so vigilance for confusion, tremor, or seizures is warranted; acyclovir-resistant VZV is uncommon but should be suspected if lesions persist or progress after 7 days, prompting foscarnet therapy and, when feasible, susceptibility testing [^117K3oG4] [^115soQEC] [^113JTMdT].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to reconcile any discrepancies. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on early antiviral therapy for shingles, with valacyclovir or famciclovir generally preferred for convenience, and acyclovir remaining an effective alternative; IV acyclovir is indicated for immunocompromise, dissemination, or severe complications; adjunctive corticosteroids may reduce acute pain and improve quality of life but do not consistently reduce PHN and are not routinely recommended in immunocompromised patients [^112WVpEB] [^111Fta1c] [^111ncV8c].

> Let me consider a practical, risk-stratified approach. For immunocompetent adults with localized shingles, start oral acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for 7 to 10 days if within 72 hours, or as soon as possible thereafter if new lesions or severe pain are present; for immunocompromised patients or those with extensive disease, use IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours until improvement, then complete 10 to 14 days total with oral therapy; for herpes zoster ophthalmicus, treat urgently with systemic antivirals and involve ophthalmology early; throughout, manage pain aggressively and monitor for adverse effects and response [^1119uWwf] [^112WVpEB] [^111Tmb4Z].

> I should double-check follow-up and counseling points. Advise patients that healing typically takes 2 to 4 weeks, PHN risk rises with age and acute pain severity, and vaccination after recovery reduces future shingles risk; in patients already on chronic antivirals, hold therapy around live zoster vaccination per ACIP guidance to preserve immunogenicity, and resume afterward as clinically appropriate [^111Tmb4Z] [^112TffgT].

> In summary, acyclovir remains a foundational therapy for shingles: use 800 mg orally five times daily for 7 to 10 days in immunocompetent adults when started within 72 hours, escalate to IV 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for immunocompromise or severe disease, extend total therapy to 10 to 14 days when indicated, and tailor choices to patient factors and guideline preferences for valacyclovir or famciclovir when feasible; early treatment improves acute outcomes, though prevention of PHN is modest and multifactorial, so expectations and pain management plans should be explicit [^1119uWwf] [^112WVpEB] [^111Tmb4Z].

---

Acyclovir is **first-line therapy** for shingles, with oral 800 mg five times daily for 7–10 days [^1119uWwf] as standard in immunocompetent adults [^111ncV8c], and IV 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for severe or immunocompromised cases [^112WVpEB] [^113KzshN]. Treatment within 72 hours of rash onset **reduces acute pain, accelerates healing, and lowers complications** [^1119uWwf] [^111ncV8c]; beyond 72 hours, treat if new lesions appear or the patient is high risk. Valacyclovir or famciclovir are preferred for convenience due to less frequent dosing, but acyclovir is effective and less expensive [^111Tmb4Z] [^113Pwqp8]. Monitor for renal function, especially with IV use, and adjust dosing in renal impairment [^116jfbfd] [^114t74ys].

---

## Indications and clinical use

Acyclovir is indicated for **acute treatment of herpes zoster (shingles)** in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients [^111nuMED] [^11295rkh]. It is particularly important in patients older than 50 years, those with severe pain, extensive rash, or immunocompromised states, as these factors increase the risk of complications such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) [^111Tmb4Z] [^111SYEHF].

---

## Dosage and administration

### Immunocompetent adults

The **standard oral regimen** is 800 mg five times daily (every 4 hours) for 7–10 days [^1119uWwf] [^111nuMED]. Initiate within 72 hours of rash onset for optimal efficacy [^1119uWwf] [^111ncV8c]; if new lesions continue to appear, consider extending therapy [^111ncV8c].

---

### Immunocompromised patients or severe cases

Use **intravenous acyclovir** 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7–10 days [^113KzshN] [^112WVpEB]. Switch to oral therapy (valacyclovir or famciclovir) after clinical improvement to complete a 10–14 day total course [^112WVpEB] [^117Q1196].

---

### Pediatric patients

For pediatric patients, the **oral dose** is 20 mg/kg (maximum 800 mg) four times daily for 7–10 days [^112tqo91]. Use **intravenous acyclovir** 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for severe cases or immunocompromised children [^112tqo91].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Acyclovir **significantly reduces** the duration of viral shedding, accelerates lesion healing, and decreases acute pain severity [^1119uWwf] [^111ncV8c]. It also lowers the incidence of complications such as PHN, particularly when initiated within 72 hours of rash onset [^111ncV8c] [^114UwVDB].

---

## Comparison with other antiviral agents

Valacyclovir and famciclovir are alternative antiviral agents with similar efficacy to acyclovir but offer **more convenient dosing regimens** (fewer daily doses) [^111Tmb4Z] [^113Pwqp8]. Valacyclovir 1,000 mg three times daily or famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for 7 days are commonly recommended alternatives [^112WVpEB] [^113hudYL].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Acyclovir is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include:

- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Headache
- Malaise [^117K3oG4]

Intravenous administration may cause **renal dysfunction**, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving nephrotoxic drugs [^116jfbfd] [^114t74ys]. Neurologic symptoms (e.g. confusion, tremors) have been reported, especially with high IV doses or renal impairment [^115soQEC] [^116HxDEn].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment is required based on creatinine clearance [^116jfbfd] [^114t74ys].
- **Pregnancy**: Acyclovir is considered safe during pregnancy, with no significant teratogenic risk reported [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Close monitoring for complications and response to therapy is essential [^114vCn8P].

---

## Limitations and resistance

Acyclovir resistance is rare but may occur, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Foscarnet is an alternative agent for **acyclovir-resistant cases** [^113JTMdT] [^116YQrVS].

---

Acyclovir is effective for shingles, especially when started within 72 hours [^1119uWwf]; it reduces pain, speeds healing, and lowers complications. Valacyclovir or famciclovir are often preferred for convenience, but acyclovir remains a **cost-effective option** [^111Tmb4Z] [^113Pwqp8].

14.4 Herpes Zoster (Shingles)

Two randomized, double-blind trials, 1 placebo-controlled and 1 active-controlled, were conducted in 964 immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated herpes zoster. Treatment was initiated within 72 hours of first lesion appearance and was continued for 7 days.

In the placebo-controlled trial, 419 patients were treated with either famciclovir 500 mg three times daily (n = 138), famciclovir 750 mg three times daily (n = 135) or placebo (n = 146). The median time to full crusting was 5 days among famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients as compared to 7 days in placebo-treated patients. The times to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and loss of crusts were shorter for famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients in the overall study population. The effects of famciclovir were greater when therapy was initiated within 48 hours of rash onset; it was also more profound in patients 50 years of age or older. Among the 65.2% of patients with at least 1 positive viral culture, famciclovir treated patients had a shorter median duration of viral shedding than placebo-treated patients (1 day and 2 days, respectively).

There were no overall differences in the duration of pain before rash healing between famciclovir-and placebo-treated groups. In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of pain after rash healing (postherpetic neuralgia) between the treatment groups. In the 186 patients (44.4% of total study population) who developed postherpetic neuralgia, the median duration of postherpetic neuralgia was shorter in patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg than in those treated with placebo (63 days and 119 days, respectively). No additional efficacy was demonstrated with higher dose of famciclovir.

In the active-controlled trial, 545 patients were treated with 1 of 3 doses of famciclovir three times daily or with acyclovir 800 mg five times daily. Times to full lesion crusting and times to loss of acute pain were comparable for all groups and there were no statistically significant differences in the time to loss of postherpetic neuralgia between famciclovir and acyclovir-treated groups.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^115iUfkY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^115nJNKb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with herpes zoster (HZ) that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and costs of treatment. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to the management of patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the clinical experience of the authors support the use of acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for the use of these medications are provided. In addition, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^113HfjAs]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster, or shingles, is caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. There are an estimated 1 million cases in the Unites States annually, with an individual lifetime risk of 30%. Patients with conditions that decrease cell-mediated immunity are 20 to 100 times more likely to develop herpes zoster. Patients may present with malaise, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations for two to three days before the classic maculopapular rash appears. The rash is usually unilateral, confined to a single dermatome, and typically progresses to clear vesicles that become cloudy and crust over in seven to 10 days. Herpes zoster can be treated with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, ideally within 72 hours of the development of the rash. Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication, occurring in about one in five patients. It is defined as pain in a dermatomal distribution sustained for at least 90 days after acute herpes zoster. Treatment is focused on symptom control and includes topical lidocaine or capsaicin and oral gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants. The varicella zoster virus vaccine decreases the incidence of herpes zoster and is approved for adults 50 years and older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends this vaccine for adults 60 years and older, except for certain immunosuppressed patients.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^117AgzK9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged ≥ 60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity.

### Neurologic acyclovir toxicity in the absence of kidney injury [^115soQEC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster (zoster) also commonly known as "shingles", occurs following re-activation of the varicella zoster virus. It contributes a large cost burden to the U.S. health care system, with an estimated 1 million cases costing $1 billion annually. The current gold standard treatment is acyclovir, which limits viral replication. However, acyclovir has been reported to cause neurotoxicity in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease.

Case Report

This case presents an occurrence of acyclovir-induced toxic encephalopathy in a patient with normal renal function. A 63-year-old male presented to the emergency department with ataxia, tremors, fluctuating aphasia, confusion, agitation, and fatigue. Results of imaging, lumbar puncture, and laboratory studies directed clinicians toward acyclovir toxicity, despite a normal creatinine level. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians will likely be the first point of contact in the health care system following the onset of acyclovir toxicity. With an increasing incidence of zoster disease, such atypical toxic manifestations may increase. Early recognition is important to avoid permanent neurologic compromise.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^111ncV8c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment and nonspecific management of zoster and PHN — antivirals and corticosteroids: Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are approved by the FDA for zoster in immunocompetent patients, and trials indicate that when taken orally they reduce viral shedding and lesion formation, shorten time to rash healing, and decrease acute zoster pain and the risk for progression to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Many experts recommend that treatment should be considered for all eligible patients with zoster and specifically recommend treatment for persons aged ≥ 50 years who have moderate or severe pain, moderate or severe rash, or involvement of noncranial dermatomes. In clinical trials, treatment has been initiated within 72 hours of rash onset and the benefits of later treatment have not been studied; if treatment cannot be initiated within 72 hours, experts recommend that it should be initiated as soon as possible, particularly in the presence of new vesicle formation or of complications. Two clinical trials assessed corticosteroids with acyclovir; a 3-week tapering course diminished acute zoster pain and decreased time to cutaneous healing, cessation of analgesic therapy, and return of uninterrupted sleep and normal daily activities, but no evidence indicated that use of corticosteroids prevented development of PHN; combinations with valacyclovir or famciclovir have not been studied in clinical trials. No evidence indicates that topical antiviral therapy or corticosteroids without systemic antiviral therapy have a role in treatment of zoster.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia now and in the future [^113FJTFL]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Herpes Simplex

Short-Term Administration

The most frequent adverse events reported during clinical trials of treatment of genital herpes with acyclovir 200 mg administered orally 5 times daily every 4 hours for 10 days were nausea and/or vomiting in 8 of 298 patient treatments (2.7%). Nausea and/or vomiting occurred in 2 of 287 (0.7%) patients who received placebo.

Long-Term Administration

The most frequent adverse events reported in a clinical trial for the prevention of recurrences with continuous administration of 400 mg (two 200-mg capsules) 2 times daily for 1 year in 586 patients treated with acyclovir were nausea (4.8%) and diarrhea (2.4%). The 589 control patients receiving intermittent treatment of recurrences with acyclovir for 1 year reported diarrhea (2.7%), nausea (2.4%), and headache (2.2%).

Herpes Zoster

The most frequent adverse event reported during 3 clinical trials of treatment of herpes zoster (shingles) with 800 mg of oral acyclovir 5 times daily for 7 to 10 days in 323 patients was malaise (11.5%). The 323 placebo recipients reported malaise (11.1%).

### Treatment of herpes zoster… [^114UwVDB]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

TREATMENT OF ACUTE HERPES ZOSTER A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials considered the time to complete resolution of acute herpes zoster pain. 1 When treatment was initiated within 48 hours, complete resolution of pain occurred sooner than with placebo. This also was true when treatment was initiated between 48 and 72 hours. A single RCT 2 compared valacyclovir with acyclovir. This study found that the mean times to complete resolution of pain were 44 days for valacyclovir and 51 days for acyclovir when treated within 48 hours. 2 When treatment was initiated between 48 and 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, the mean times to complete resolution of pain were 36 days for valacyclovir and 48 days for acyclovir.

In a single RCT 4 with 55 patients, famciclovir was shown to have equal effectiveness to acyclovir. This small and possibly underpowered study found that there was no significant difference regarding the median time to full lesion crusting, the rate of full crusting at day 28, the median time to resolution of acute pain, or the rate of acute pain at 28 days. Three different dosage regimens of famciclovir and one regimen for acyclovir were compared in another RCT. 5 with 559 patients presenting within 72 hours of onset. The time to full crusting was similar for all four dosage regimens.

There was no significant difference in time to acute pain resolution: 14 days for the acyclovir regimen, 17 days for famciclovir 250 mg three times daily, and 19 days for famciclovir 500 mg twice daily and 750 mg once daily).

Research Hotspots and Fronts

Based on the analysis of co-cited references, high-frequency keywords, keyword clusters and keyword burst, we believe that the research hotspots in the HZ field are mainly focused on: (1) Drug Therapy; (2) Immunoprophylaxis; (3) Complications. In this study, the top four keywords were counted according to the frequency of research in each hotspot and displayed in Table 6. Acyclovir, vaccine, and PHN were the most important research items in each research hotspot.

Table 6
The Top Four Keywords in Three Research Hotspots

Drug Therapy

Prompt administration of antiviral drugs within 72 hours of the onset of the rash can reduce viral replication, shorten the duration of symptoms, and prevent complications. Studies have shown that the main antiviral drugs currently used in clinical practice for HZ are valacyclovir and famciclovir, while the frequency of acyclovir use is gradually decreasing. Acyclovir was first mentioned in 1974 by Nick Oliverand then its antiviral properties were first discovered by Peter Collins and John Bauer of Wellcome Laboratories in Beckenham, the UK. The anti-herpetic activity of acyclovir is achieved by inhibition of herpes-specific replicative DNA polymorphases. Acyclovir has been shown to be significantly more effective against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 than against varicella virus. The duration of maximum drug concentration for intravenous acyclovir and initial oral doses is approximately one hour and two hours, respectively. Compared with placebo, oral administration of aciclovir within 47 hours after the onset of the disease reduced the average time to the last day of new lesion formation by 0.5 days, 1.8 days, and 2.2 days. In some studies, Famciclovir has been shown to be superior to aciclovir in reducing shingles-related pain. Timely initiation of treatment with high-dose acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir may limit the severity, duration, and complications of the disease outbreak.

### Herpes zoster guideline of the German dermatology society (DDG) [^111SYEHF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), remains dormant in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia and can be reactivated as a consequence of declining VZV-specific cellular immunity leading to herpes zoster (shingles). Patients older than 50 years of age affected by herpes zoster may suffer a significant decrease of quality of life. These patients and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risks for severe complications, involving the eye, the peripheral and the central nervous system (prolonged pain, postherpetic neuralgia). Such complications occur with and without cutaneous symptoms. The German Dermatology Society (DDG) has released guidelines in order to guarantee updated management to anyone affected by herpes zoster. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. The gold standard of laboratory diagnosis comprises PCR and direct identification of VZV in cell cultures. Detection of IgM- and IgA-anti VZV antibodies may be helpful in immunocompromised patients. Therapy has become very effective in the last years. Systemic antiviral therapy is able to shorten the healing process of acute herpes zoster, to prevent or to alleviate pain and other acute and chronic complications, particularly, when given within 48 h to a maximum of 72 h after onset of the rash. Systemic antiviral therapy is urgently indicated in patients beyond the age of 50 years and in patients at any age with herpes zoster in the head and neck area, especially in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Further urgent indications are severe herpes zoster on the trunk and on the extremities, herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients and in patients with severe atopic dermatitis and severe ekzema. Only relative indications for antiviral therapy exist in patients younger than 50 years with zoster on the trunk and on the extremities. In Germany acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir and brivudin are approved for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster. These compounds are all well tolerated by the patients and do not differ with regard to efficacy and safety. Brivudin has a markedly higher anti-VZV potency than oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir and thus offers a simpler dosing regimen. It must be given only once daily during 7 days in comparison to three and five times dosing per day of valacyclovir, famciclovir and acyclovir, respectively. Brivudin is an antiviral agent with no nephrotoxic properties, which is an advantage when compared to acyclovir. The most important aim of therapy of herpes zoster is to achieve painlessness. Appropriately dosed analgesics in combination with a neuroactive agent (i.e. amitriptylin) are very helpful when given together with antiviral therapy. The additive therapy with corticosteroids may shorten the degree and duration of acute zoster pain, but has no essential effect on the development of postherpetic neuralgia, which is a very difficult condition to treat. Thus early presentation to a pain therapist is recommended in specific cases.

Recurrent Genital Herpes

Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with frequent recurrences (6 or more episodes per year) have shown that orally administered acyclovir given daily for 4 months to 10 years prevented or reduced the frequency and/or severity of recurrences in greater than 95% of patients.

In a study of patients who received acyclovir400 mg twice daily for 3 years, 45%, 52%, and 63% of patients remained free of recurrences in the first, second, and third years, respectively. Serial analyses of the 3-month recurrence rates for the patients showed that 71% to 87% were recurrence free in each quarter.

Herpes Zoster Infections

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of immunocompetent patients with localized cutaneous zoster infection, acyclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 10 days) shortened the times to lesion scabbing, healing, and complete cessation of pain, and reduced the duration of viral shedding and the duration of new lesion formation.

In a similar double-blind, placebo-controlled study, acyclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) shortened the times to complete lesion scabbing, healing, and cessation of pain; reduced the duration of new lesion formation; and reduced the prevalence of localized zoster-associated neurologic symptoms (paresthesia, dysesthesia, or hyperesthesia).

Treatment was begun within 72 hours of rash onset and was most effective if started within the first 48 hours.

Adults greater than 50 years of age showed greater benefit.

Chickenpox

Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in 993 pediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years with chickenpox. All patients were treated within 24 hours after the onset of rash. In 2 trials, acyclovir was administered at 20 mg/kg 4 times daily (up to 3,200 mg per day) for 5 days. In the third trial, doses of 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg were administered 4 times daily for 5 to 7 days. Treatment with acyclovir shortened the time to 50% healing; reduced the maximum number of lesions; reduced the median number of vesicles; decreased the median number of residual lesions on day 28; and decreased the proportion of patients with fever, anorexia, and lethargy by day 2. Treatment with acyclovir did not affect varicella-zoster virus-specific humoral or cellular immune responses at 1 month or 1 year following treatment.

### Viral infections in critical care: a narrative review [^113cb2wz]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus

Similar to HSV, CMV often causes an asymptomatic primary infection in immunocompetent individuals but can cause disease on primary infection or reactivation following drug or infection‐induced immunosuppression and in older patients with immunosenescence. Cytomegalovirus colitis, retinitis, hepatitis and pneumonitis are all reported and, while most common in immunocompromised patients, can occur in the apparently immunocompetent who are immunonaïve or immunosenescent. In mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients, CMV reactivation in respiratory secretions is common. It is not clear, however, that the associations with prolonged length of ICU stay and mortality are causal and randomised trials of CMV treatment have not demonstrated benefit. As with HSV, this lack of benefit may reflect a failure to identify patients with genuine CMV pneumonitis rather than incidental reactivation. Where patients are at high risk of CMV reactivation, such as solid organ transplantation from a CMV‐positive donor to a CMV‐negative recipient, antiviral prophylaxis with ganciclovir is indicated. The presence of CMV viraemia or convincing evidence of CMV tissue pathology may require biopsy to distinguish from incidental reactivation and should prompt treatment. Ophthalmology review for CMV retinitis should be undertaken in patients with evidence of disseminated CMV infection, including CMV viraemia.

Varicella zoster virus

Varicella zoster virus causes chicken pox as primary infection, and reactivation leads to shingles in the immunosuppressed and immunosenescent. While neither of these are likely to result in ICU admission, shingles can develop as a painful and distressing consequence of critical illness and may benefit from early antiviral treatment. Shingles can transmit infection to the immunonaïve or immunocompromised and careful attention to infection control is required. In immunocompetent but varicella zoster virus‐naïve adults, varicella zoster virus can cause a severe pneumonitis with consequent respiratory failure. Acyclovir is used and prompt treatment may reduce severity of symptoms. The use of steroids remains uncertain and not backed by strong evidence. Varicella zoster virus can also cause encephalitis and should be looked for in patients without other identified pathogens.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) disease — primary varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster therapy indicates that for uncomplicated primary varicella, initiate as soon as possible after symptom onset and continue for 5–7 days with valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII) or famciclovir 500 mg PO three times a day (AII); for severe or complicated cases, use acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days (AIII), with the option to switch to oral valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir after defervescence if no evidence of visceral involvement (BIII). Alternative therapy for uncomplicated chickenpox is acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII) for 5–7 days. For herpes zoster (shingles) acute localized dermatomal disease, treat for 7–10 days and consider longer duration if lesions are slow to resolve, with acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII). In managing ocular disease, consultation with an ophthalmologist experienced in VZV retinitis is strongly recommended; duration of therapy for VZV retinitis is not well defined and should be determined based on clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses and ophthalmologic responses; optimization of ART is recommended for severe and difficult-to-treat VZV infections (e.g., retinitis, encephalitis) (AIII).

### Oral antivirals revisited in the treatment of herpes zoster: what do they accomplish? [^113Pwqp8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral antiviral agents currently represent the most important therapeutic keystone in the treatment of herpes zoster. Three oral antiviral agents are available for the treatment of herpes zoster: acyclovir, its derivative valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Meta-analysis of published data has shown that oral acyclovir significantly reduces various herpes zoster-related symptoms as well as the duration, intensity and prevalence of zoster-associated pain (ZAP). However, this drug does not influence postherpetic neuralgia. The newer agents famciclovir and valacyclovir exhibit a better oral bioavailability than acyclovir. These agents have demonstrated similar efficacy to acyclovir with ZAP and they require less frequent administration. When initiated within 72 hours, oral antiviral therapy of herpes zoster is beneficial in selected, elderly immunocompetent patients, reducing the duration and intensity of ZAP and providing more rapid skin lesion healing. Oral antivirals are also of benefit in immunocompromised patients with uncomplicated herpes zoster. However, signs of cutaneous and visceral dissemination should be monitored; if signs occur, intravenous antiviral therapy is indicated.

Seasonal variations and clustering in close communities suggest an infectious agent as the inciting factor for PR. Although human herpesviruses (HHVs) (HHV-6 and HHV-7) have often been implicated in a causal relationship with PR, the exact cause remains unknown. Additionally, PR-like eruptions have been reported with COVID-19, vaccinations (ie, bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, influenza, diphtheria, smallpox, hepatitis B, and COVID-19), and medications (ie, gold, barbiturates, captopril, and clonidine).

There are case reports of successful treatment of PR with acyclovir based on the theory of the pathogenic involvement of HHV-6 and HHV-7, particularly when administered within the first week of symptom onset. There are additional but fewer reports of using valacyclovir (known pharmaceutically as Valacyclovir), which is the prodrug of acyclovir. The efficacy of valacyclovir as treatment for PR has so far been reported in 1 case series of 3 patients: while watchful waiting led to worsening symptoms, treatment with valacyclovir 1 g 3 times daily for 1 week led to resolution of the condition within 2 to 3 weeks. The authors have proposed valacyclovir as an alternative therapeutic option due to its less frequent dosing and a more favorable safety profile when compared with those of acyclovir. The dosing schedule of valacyclovir used in this series was adapted from the established treatment regimen for herpes zoster infection (shingles), which consists of oral valacyclovir 1 g 3 times daily for 7 days, which is the standard dose without renal adjustment.

1 BACKGROUND

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles. 1

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. 2, 3 The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal; however, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster‐associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. 4, 5

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ‐related burden of illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. 10 Current interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti‐epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. 8 This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning. 11

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine has reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN, 12 a large percentage (∼90% in the US) of the at‐risk population does not receive the vaccine. 13 About half of people, 60 years of age or older who have had the shingles vaccine, fail to respond (eg, primary failure meaning they failed to seroconvert after vaccination) and may go on to develop HZ. 12, 14 In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to decline over time (eg, secondary vaccine failure). 15, 16

### Herpes zoster-induced urologic and gastrointestinal dysfunction with residual neurogenic detrusor underactivity [^113npfCb]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

VZV is managed with antiviral agents such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. VZV-associated urinary retention can be managed with urethral catheterization in the acute setting and intermittent self-catheterization in the outpatient setting. An α-adrenergic blocker specific to α-1a in the smooth muscle of the genitourinary tract, bladder neck, and various regions of the pelvic floor may be trialed to shorten the duration. Urodynamic investigations are recommended, if symptoms fail to improve within 6–8 weeks from onset. Since antiviral therapy has no ability to prevent long-term sequelae, two doses of the recombinant zoster vaccine are recommended to prevent disease and related complications in adults' ≥ 50 years of age, whether or not a previous episode is reported. There is no formal recommendation on the wait period, though the consensus is to wait for the acute episode and symptoms to resolve. Fortunately, shingles vaccination among adults ≥ 60 years of age has increased from 6.7% in 2008 to 34.5% in 2018. Our elderly patient had not received the shingles vaccine due to lack of regular medical care prior to this presentation. Although dermatologists have not played a central role in the recommendation and administration of vaccines historically, a more active role has been encouraged to improve patient education and access to herpes zoster vaccination.

In conclusion, this case highlights rare and notable herpes zoster-related urologic and gastrointestinal complications. Sacral dermatome involvement should raise suspicion for these potential complications with a thorough assessment of gastrointestinal/genitourinary systems and prompt treatment to prevent long-term sequelae.

Third, to investigate whether antiviral treatment during a shingles episode was associated with a reduction in the risk of dementia relative to not receiving treatment during a shingles episode, we restricted our study population to those individuals who received a diagnosis of shingles at any time after 1 January 2000 and had not received a diagnosis of dementia before 1 January 2000. Our exposure of interest in this analysis was whether or not an individual received a prescription of antiviral medication (acyclovir, famcyclovir, valacyclovir or inosine pranobex) within three months of the first shingles diagnosis. Individuals were followed up from the date of first shingles diagnosis until either the date of death, moving out of Wales, GP deregistration or end of data availability (1 March 2022). We then used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to regress diagnoses of dementia made after the date of the first recorded shingles episode onto whether or not the patient received an antiviral medication prescription for the first shingles episode. In a robustness check, we required that a new diagnosis of dementia must have been made at least 12 months after the date of the first shingles diagnosis. We adjusted our regressions for gender, restricted cubic splines (with three knots) of age at the first shingles infection, and the 12 variables in Supplementary Fig. 1 (excluding past breast and prostate cancer diagnoses).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114vCn8P]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunocompromised hosts — Herpes zoster dermatomal pain often precedes the eruption by 24–72 hours; in otherwise healthy hosts, lesions continue to erupt for at least 4–6 days with the entire disease duration being approximately 2 weeks, whereas in immunocompromised hosts lesions may continue to develop over a longer period (7–14 days) and heal more slowly. High-dose IV acyclovir remains the treatment of choice for VZV infections in compromised hosts, and oral acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are beneficial but oral therapy should be reserved for mild cases with transient immune suppression or to complete therapy after a clinical response to IV acyclovir. Recipients of allogeneic blood and bone marrow transplants routinely take acyclovir (800 mg bid) or valacyclovir (500 mg bid) during the first year following transplant for prevention of VZV and HSV reactivation. For HSV, suppression of reactivation or continued treatment until ulcerated lesions have totally healed may decrease the incidence of acyclovir-resistant infections; acyclovir-resistant HSV isolates require a prolonged course of intravenous foscarnet, although continuous infusion of high-doses of acyclovir has been reported to be successful in HSCT patients, and surgery should be avoided unless a documented bacterial or fungal abscess is identified.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of valacyclovir prophylaxis to prevent zoster recurrence from months 4 to 24 after BMT [^111a3477]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Reactivation of latent VZV remains a significant cause of morbidity after SCT. Twenty-five percent or more of patients undergoing SCT will experience zoster within the first year after transplant. Short-course (< 1 year) prophylaxis with acyclovir has been shown to be effective, but compliance with five times daily dosing may be problematic. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of valacyclovir (VACV) 1000mg twice daily from 4 through 24 months after SCT for the prevention of VZV. Fifty-three VZV-seropositive transplant recipients (17 auto-SCT, 36 allo-SCT) were randomized at a median of 163 days after SCT. In a modified intent-to-treat analysis of 49 patients who took study drug, 0 of 22 in the VACV arm experienced zoster reactivation, compared with 6 of 26 (23%) in the placebo arm (P = 0.025). Thirty-two subjects completed therapy through the second year post transplant or first episode of zoster. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation were more frequent in the placebo group (5 of 26 vs 3 of 27 for placebo and study drug, respectively). VACV at a dose of 1000mg twice daily through 24 months after transplant is well tolerated and effective in suppressing shingles after SCT.

Acyclovir-resistant varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in children with HIV — testing and foscarnet therapy: When acyclovir resistance is considered, if possible, virus isolation should be attempted for susceptibility testing, and children in whom lesions continue to develop, fail to heal, or continue to progress after 7 days of treatment may have acyclovir-resistant VZV. VZV infections caused by acyclovir-resistant VZV strains should be treated with parenteral foscarnet, and all acyclovir-resistant VZV strains are resistant to valacyclovir, famciclovir, and ganciclovir. VZV infections caused by acyclovir-resistant VZV strains should be treated with parenteral foscarnet. (strong, very low) Foscarnet (40–60 mg/kg/dose IV every 8 hours) is administered for 7 days to 10 days or until no new lesions appear.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^112AYUJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) -3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.91 to -0.54; I² = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first-episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies. There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD -0.61 days, 95% CI -2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I² statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application. Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta-analyse.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection — treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is recommended as follows: We recommend that treatment be continued at least until all lesions have scabbed. (1D) We recommend that uncomplicated herpes zoster (shingles) be treated (1B) with oral acyclovir or valacyclovir (1B), at least until all lesions have scabbed. (1D) We recommend that disseminated or invasive herpes zoster be treated (1B) with intravenous acyclovir and a temporary reduction in the amount of immunosuppressive medication (1C), at least until all lesions have scabbed. (1D) We recommend that prevention of primary varicella zoster be instituted in varicella-susceptible patients after exposure to individuals with active varicella zoster infection (1D) using varicella zoster immunoglobulin (or intravenous immunoglobulin) within 96 h of exposure (1D); if immunoglobulin is not available or more than 96 h have passed, a 7-day course of oral acyclovir begun 7–10 days after varicella exposure.

### New treatments for genital herpes [^1167PwQY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease that has been widely investigated from both an epidemiological and a diagnostic viewpoint. Better knowledge of the disease has pointed to the important role of asymptomatic herpes simplex virus type 2 shedding as a major culprit for the spread of the virus in the world, the latest statistics showing that the incidence of genital herpes is constantly increasing. The reference compound for the treatment and prophylaxis of genital herpes is acyclovir. Recently, two drugs with better oral bioavailability, valaciclovir, the oral prodrug of acyclovir, and famciclovir, the oral prodrug of penciclovir, have been made available. Nevertheless, there is a need to develop additional approaches, to extend the therapeutic possibilities and to face the problem of emerging resistant viruses, mostly in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, efforts have been made in different directions including the exploration of new targets for antiviral chemotherapy, the use of immunomodulators and the development of specific vaccines.

### Acyclovir prophylaxis reduces the incidence of herpes zoster among HIV-infected individuals: results of a randomized clinical trial [^116vvy49]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons have higher rates of herpes zoster than HIV-uninfected individuals. We assessed whether twice daily treatment with 400 mg of oral acyclovir reduces the incidence of herpes zoster in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 3408 persons coinfected with HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2. During 5175 person-years of follow-up, 26 cases of herpes zoster occurred among those assigned acyclovir, compared with 69 cases among those assigned placebo (rates, 1.00 and 2.68/100 person-years, respectively), a relative decrease of 62% (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, .24-.67; P < .001). Daily acyclovir prophylaxis significantly reduced herpes zoster incidence among HIV-infected persons.

### Issues in the treatment of neurological conditions caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) [^113YdepC]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous neurotropic human herpesvirus. Primary infection usually causes varicella (chicken pox), after which virus becomes latent in ganglia along the entire neuraxis. Decades later, virus reactivates to produce herpes zoster (shingles), a painful dermatomally distributed vesicular eruption. Zoster may be further complicated by postherpetic neuralgia, VZV vasculopathy, myelitis, and segmental motor weakness. VZV reactivation has also been associated with giant cell arteritis. This overview discusses treatment of various conditions that often require both corticosteroids and antiviral drugs. Treatment for VZV-associated disease is often based on case reports and small studies rather than large-scale clinical trials. Issues that require resolution include the optimal duration of such combined therapy, more effective treatment for postherpetic neuralgia, whether some treatments should be given orally or intravenously, the widening spectrum of zoster sine herpete, and the role of antiviral therapy in giant cell arteritis.

This is a case report of a 69-year-old morbidly obese woman who presented with mental status changes after she was treated with acyclovir for shingles. The predominant symptoms were word-finding difficulties and visual hallucinations. Complicating her presentation was acyclovir-induced acute renal injury causing her creatinine level to rise up to 7.4 mg/dL. Acyclovir was discontinued on the suspicion of acyclovir neurotoxicity. Even though PCR for varicella zoster virus in the cerebrospinal fluid was positive, acyclovir was not restarted and the patient continued to improve and returned to her baseline.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^117S5dFj]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

2 STUDY DESIGN

This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel‐group, comparative study of FV‐100 versus valacyclovir in patients with HZ conducted at 90 centers in the United States between May 2009 and December 2010. Patients who presented within 72 h of zoster rash and met all eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups: 1) FV‐100 200 mg QD; 2) FV‐100 400 mg QD; or 3) valacyclovir 3000 mg (1000 mg TID). Patients were centrally randomized by an interactive web response system and stratified by 1) age category (< 65 vs. ≥ 65); and 2) Visit 1/Day 1 ZBPI worst pain in the last 24 h score (< 6 vs. > 6). Sites were blinded to all ZBPI subset pain scores throughout the study.

The primary endpoint was the reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC, a standardized score measuring the overall severity of pain experienced by study subjects during the 30 days after the first dose of study drug (see section 2.3). A sample size of at least 333 patients (111 per arm) was calculated to achieve 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC in the FV‐100 treated group compared to the valacyclovir‐treated group. Estimates of BOI‐30 AUC and SD (constant SD across treatment arms) were extrapolated from the Zostavax Shingles Prevention Study and the ZBPI validation study. 21, 24, 25

All eligible patients were treated for 7 days and followed through Day 30. Patients who continued to have HZ‐associated pain or whose rashes had not healed by Day 30 were followed through Day 90 or until their rash healed and they had two documented Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) worst pain scores of 0, whichever occurred first.

The study was approved by a central institutional review board (IRB) or local IRBs and conducted in accordance with the International Committee on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. 26, 27 This study was registered on(NCT00900783).

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^116xxFpD]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 8.4 – KTR: Varicella Zoster Virus infection

Guideline 8.4.1 – KTR: VZV infection

We recommend:
Primary infection (chickenpox) should be treated with intravenous aciclovir or oral valaciclovir until the lesions scab over (1C)
Uncomplicated shingles should be treated with oral acyclovir or valaciclovir until the lesions scab over (1D)
Disseminated (> 2 dermatomes), ocular or invasive shingles should be treated with intravenous aciclovir until the lesions scab over, together with a reduction in immunosuppression (1B)
Varicella-susceptible KTRs (i.e. VZV IgG negative) with primary exposure to VZV should receive intravenous immunoglobulins, ideally within 96 h, but up to a maximum of 10 days following exposure. If unavailable or after 10 days, oral aciclovir should be administered for seven days (1D)

Guideline 8.4.2 – KTR: VZV infection

We suggest:
Patients on the waiting list who are VZV IgG seronegative should be vaccinated prior to transplantation (2D)
Immunosuppression should be reduced during primary infection (2D)

Audit Measures

Annual rates of primary VZV and shingles infection
Completeness of records for VZV recipient serology in KTRs

Rationale

Acquired by 90% of the population before adulthood, primary infection with VZV causes chickenpox. Thereafter the virus remains latent in the cranial nerve and dorsal root ganglia. Secondary reactivation results in shingles and typical dermatomal blistering skin lesions. Primary infection can be acquired by direct skin contact and by airborne droplet transmission. Primary disease in KTRs can be devastating with severe skin lesions, widespread visceral involvement and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In immune naïve and immunosuppressed individuals, treatment with pooled varicella zoster immunoglobulin has been shown to prevent or ameliorate VZV infection. It seems sensible to vaccinate VZV naïve patients on the waiting list since the vaccine has been shown to be safe. As a live attenuated vaccine, VZV vaccine should not be administered post transplant.

### Valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients [^116cwQXB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus affects the eye and vision, and is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus in the distribution of the first division of the trigeminal nerve. An aggressive management of acute herpes zoster ophthalmicus with systemic antiviral medication is generally recommended as the standard first-line treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus infections. Both acyclovir and its prodrug valacyclovir are medications that are approved for the systemic treatment of herpes zoster. Although it is known that valacyclovir has an improved bioavailability and steadier plasma concentration, it is currently unclear as to whether this leads to better treatment results and less ocular complications.

Objectives

To assess the effects of valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S; January 1990 to June 2016), BIOSIS Previews (January 1969 to June 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 13 June 2016.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which systemic valacyclovir was compared to systemic acyclovir medication for treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, evaluated the risk of bias in included trials, and extracted and analysed data. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, as only one study was included. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the selected outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

One study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In this multicentre, randomised double-masked study carried out in France, 110 immunocompetent people with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, diagnosed within 72 hours of skin eruption, were treated, with 56 participants allocated to the valacyclovir group and 54 to the acyclovir group. The study was poorly reported and we judged it to be unclear risk of bias for most domains. Persistent ocular lesions after 6 months were observed in 2/56 people in the valacyclovir group compared with 1/54 people in the acyclovir group (risk ratio (RR) 1.93 (95% CI 0.18 to 20.65); very low certainty evidence. Dendritic ulcer appeared in 3/56 patients treated with valacyclovir, while 1/54 suffered in the acyclovir group (RR 2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 26.96); very low certainty evidence), uveitis in 7/56 people in the valacyclovir group compared with 9/54 in the acyclovir group (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.57); very low certainty evidence). Similarly, there was uncertainty as to the comparative effects of these two treatments on post-herpetic pain, and side effects (vomiting, eyelid or facial edema, disseminated zoster). Due to concerns about imprecision (small number of events and large confidence intervals) and study limitations, the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach was rated as low to very low for the use of valacyclovir compared to acyclovir.

Authors' Conclusions

This review included data from only one study, which had methodological limitations. As such, our results indicated uncertainty of the relative benefits and harms of valacyclovir over acyclovir in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, despite its widespread use for this condition. Further well-designed and adequately powered trials are needed. These trials should include outcomes important to patients, including compliance.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^1167J5Yx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

This prospective, parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of FV‐100 with valacyclovir for reducing pain associated with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Patients, ≥ 50 years of age, diagnosed with HZ within 72 h of lesion appearance who had HZ‐associated pain, were randomized 1:1:1 to a 7‐day course of either FV‐100 200 mg QD (n = 117), FV‐100 400 mg QD (n = 116), or valacyclovir 1000 mg TID (n = 117). Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the burden of illness (BOI; Zoster Brief Pain Inventory scores); incidence and duration of clinically significant pain (CSP); pain scores; incidence and severity of post‐herpetic neuralgia (PHN); and times to full lesion crusting and to lesion healing. Safety was evaluated on the basis of adverse event (AE)/SAE profiles, changes in laboratory and vital signs values, and results of electrocardiograms. The burden of illness scores for pain through 30 days were 114.5, 110.3, and 118.0 for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg, respectively. The incidences of PHN at 90 days for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg were 17.8%, 12.4%, and 20.2%, respectively. Adverse event and SAE profiles of the two FV‐100 and the valacyclovir groups were similar and no untoward signals or trends were evident. These results demonstrate a potential for FV‐100 as an antiviral for the treatment of shingles that could both reduce the pain burden of the acute episode and reduce the incidence of PHN compared with available treatments.

Herpes zoster reactivation prophylaxis in HIV — long-term administration of anti-VZV drugs to prevent episodes of herpes zoster is not routinely recommended (AII). In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in Africa evaluating daily acyclovir prophylaxis, acyclovir 400 mg orally [PO] twice a day given to people with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection not taking antiretroviral therapy reduced the rate of herpes zoster by 62%. Acyclovir did not prevent recurrent zoster episodes in patients with prior history of herpes zoster. People with HIV taking suppressive acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for other indications may receive some additional reduction in risk of herpes zoster, but the relative risk reduction in people receiving ART is unknown.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent primary varicella — HIV-susceptible individuals: Long-term prophylaxis with anti-VZV drugs, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, to prevent varicella is not recommended (AIII). For persons with HIV who are susceptible to VZV, post-exposure prophylaxis following known or suspected VZV exposure is recommended (AII), and after close contact with a person who has active varicella or herpes zoster, adolescents and adults with HIV who are susceptible to VZV (particularly those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm³) should receive VariZIG as soon as possible (preferably within 96 hours), but up to 10 days after exposure (AIII). Given the cost of obtaining VariZIG, it is reasonable to check VZV serology before administering VariZIG to persons who do not have a clinical history of chickenpox or shingles and no documentation of varicella vaccination (AIII). The duration of protection from VariZIG is at least 3 weeks, and patients receiving monthly infusions of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG < 400 mg/kg) are likely to be protected and probably do not require VariZIG if they received a dose of IVIG 3 weeks before VZV exposure. A 5 day to 7 day course of post-exposure acyclovir or valacyclovir beginning 7 days to 10 days after exposure is recommended by some experts to prevent varicella among VZV-susceptible children, adolescents or adults with HIV, but this intervention has not been studied in these populations (BIII); among patients with HIV, post-exposure varicella vaccination has not been studied and is not recommended.

Biology of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) — VZV is an exclusively human pathogen that infects approximately 98% of the adult population in the United States; latent VZV is present in approximately 1%–7% of sensory ganglion neurons, with 49–190 genomic copies per infected cell; primary infection typically occurs during childhood and causes varicella, after which the virus enters sensory nerves and establishes permanent latency in neuronal cell bodies; in its full clinical expression, zoster causes pain followed by a vesicular rash across closely overlapping dermatomes; the triggers for reactivation have not been identified, and specific components of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) play an important role and are believed to be maintained by periodic immunologic boosting.

### An overview of viral infections of the nervous system in the immunosuppressed [^1128UmPt]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV)

Reactivation of latent VZV from human ganglia is a well-recognised complication of immunsuppression resulting in a variety of neurological complications, due, as indicated above, to symptomatic impairment of cell-mediated immunity to the virus. Indeed VZV infections are among the most important of all viral infections that affect the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in immunocompromised individuals. The protean manifestations of VZV-induced neurological disease have been described in detail elsewhere, but the main complications include herpes zoster (shingles) followed by post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in some cases the incidence of which rises with increasing age, VZV vasculopathy, myelitis, and zoster sine herpete where VZV reactivates in the absence of the typical zosteriform rash. In chronic graft versus host disease following bone marrow transplantation VZV reactivation is also a recognised opportunistic viral infection that may mimic lymphoma. Treatment should be given to immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster consisting of intravenous acyclovir (in adults 10–15 mg/Kg 8 hrly for 10–14 days and in children 500 mg/m² for 7–10 days) (Class IV). The role of acylcovir in imunocompetent individuals below 50 years is less clear. In patients with VZV-induced myelitis and vasculopathy it has been suggested that treatment should be with intravenous acyclovir for 14 days in combination with oral prednisolone for 5–7 days but this is based on experience with only a small number of patients (Class IV). The diagnosis of an opportunistic VZV infection, including zoster sine herpete can be obtained using PCR to detect VZV DNA in the CSF (Class III, Level C), though detection of anti-VZV IgG in the CSF has a higher sensitivity for correctly diagnosing VZV vasculitis than does PCR. The importance of host immunogenetics in determining VZV infection of the nervous system has recently been demonstrated. Thus it was shown that defects in the DNA sensor RNA polymerase III (POL III) confer selective increased susceptibility to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) causing encephalitis and such hereditary immune defects may result in reduced production of Type 1 Interferon which reduces the host's anti-viral capacity. The role of zoster vaccination for the immunocompromised patient is currently not established.

Herpes zoster treatment — acyclovir in children with HIV: Oral therapy with acyclovir for 7 days to 10 days is recommended for children with HIV with HZ, although longer therapy duration should be considered when lesions are slow to resolve; initial IV administration is recommended for children with HIV with severe vesicular eruptions or clinical complications, including disseminated infection, visceral involvement, or otherwise complicated HZ, and IV acyclovir should be continued until cutaneous lesions and visceral disease are clearly resolving, after which oral administration can be considered to complete therapy; the recommendation is rated (strong, moderate).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116doe4c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella post-exposure prophylaxis in adults and adolescents with HIV — post-exposure prophylaxis following known or suspected varicella-zoster virus (VZV) exposure is recommended (AII). After close contact with a person with active varicella or herpes zoster, VZV-susceptible adolescents and adults with HIV, particularly those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm³, should receive VariZIG as soon as possible, preferably within 96 hours, but up to 10 days after exposure (AIII). It is reasonable to check VZV serology before administering VariZIG to people without a clinical history of chickenpox or shingles and no documentation of varicella vaccination (AIII). The risk of VZV transmission is greater with exposure to varicella than localized herpes zoster. The duration of protection from VariZIG is at least 3 weeks, and patients receiving monthly infusions of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG > 400 mg/kg) are likely to be protected and probably do not require VariZIG if they received a dose of IVIG < 3 weeks before VZV exposure. A 5- to 7-day course of post-exposure acyclovir or valacyclovir beginning 7 to 10 days after exposure is recommended by some experts for VZV-susceptible adolescents or adults with HIV, but this intervention has not been studied (BIII). The efficacy of post-exposure varicella vaccination for people with HIV has not been studied and is not recommended.

Herpes zoster antiviral prophylaxis and vaccination schedules in patients with hematologic diseases or submitted to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

Secondary objectives of observational studies on AVP have included comparisons of different doses of acyclovir and comparisons of different drugs. Lin et al. reported that the delivery of different dosages and types of anti-HZ drugs resulted in equivalent protective effects. Zheng et al. documented that the rate of HZ infection was similar between AVP with intermittent oral famciclovir at a dose of 250 mg twice daily for 9 days, and continuous oral acyclovir (8.4% vs. 7.9%; P = 0.835). Kawamura et al. found that the number of patients who developed HZ before day 100 after HSCT was not different between a group treated with acyclovir 1,000 mg/day and another treated with acyclovir 200 mg/day. Mascarenhas et al. documented that the use of low-dose acyclovir prophylaxis was associated with a low rate of VZV reactivation in the first year after HSCT, with no evidence of clinically significant rebound at 2 years after transplant.

Two doses of aRZV are necessary regardless of a prior history of shingles or previous receipt of live zoster vaccine. The second dose of aRZV should typically be given 2–6 months after the first. However, for people who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from completing the course in a more condensed period of time, the second dose can be administered 1–2 months after the first. If a supplementary dose of aRZV is given sooner than 4 weeks after the first, a second valid dose should be repeated at least 4 weeks after the dose that was given early. The vaccine course should not be resumed if more than 6 months have elapsed since the first dose.

When possible, patients should be vaccinated before becoming immunosuppressed. If vaccination before immunosuppression is not possible, physicians should consider timing vaccination when the immune response is likely to be most robust.

Vaccination deferral in immunodeficient patients should be carefully weighed against the potential decline of response to aRZV, occurring during the most aggressive phases of immunosuppression, which could result in missing a "window of opportunity".

In theory, laboratory tests to measure vaccine immunoprotection elicited in both B- and T-cell compartments might be exploited to guide post-vaccination AVP; however, at present the few literature data do not enable definition of a post-vaccination AVP strategy based on immunological monitoring.

### Evidence of varicella zoster virus reactivation in children with arterial ischemic stroke: results of the VIPS II study [^117Dp3p4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its limitations, the VIPS II study provides evidence that VZV continues to play a role in a subset of childhood AIS cases in the modern, postvaccination era. Just as shingles may trigger ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction in adults, asymptomatic VZV reactivation (perhaps after breakthrough infection with wild‐type VZV) may be a trigger for AIS in children with waning immunity. Current antivirals like acyclovir are unlikely to have a role in stroke prevention because they suppress but do not eliminate the virus. Limited evidence suggests they did not improve FCA outcomes in Swiss children, who are not routinely vaccinated against VZV. Could additional doses of the VZV vaccine in later childhood help protect against childhood AIS? A 2013 report described the effectiveness of the VZV vaccine in 7585 children at 14‐year follow‐up. While long‐term protection against chickenpox did not appear to wane, protection against shingles (ie, symptomatic VZV reactivation) did wane, with no apparent protection after age 5 years. The study did not perform antibody testing and therefore could not assess the incidence of asymptomatic VZV reactivation. Our VZV IgM positive stroke cases could be the "canary in the coal mine", indicating that VZV reactivation without cutaneous manifestations not only occurs but can, very rarely, have negative sequelae. Further long‐term studies of childhood VZV vaccines should include antibody studies; a better understanding of the clinical significance of asymptomatic VZV reactivation is needed to guide public health decisions.

We recommend:
Primary infection (chickenpox) should be treated with intravenous aciclovir or oral valaciclovir until the lesions scab over (1C)
Uncomplicated shingles should be treated with oral acyclovir or valaciclovir until the lesions scab over (1D)
Disseminated (> 2 dermatomes), ocular or invasive shingles should be treated with intravenous aciclovir until the lesions scab over, together with a reduction in immunosuppression (1B)
Varicella-susceptible KTRs (i.e. VZV IgG negative) with primary exposure to VZV should receive intravenous immunoglobulin, ideally within 96 hours, but up to a maximum of 10 days following exposure. If unavailable or after 10 days, oral aciclovir should be prescribed for seven days (1D)

### Acyclovir (acyclovir suspension) [^114t74ys]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Dosage adjustment is recommended when administering acyclovir to patients with renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Caution should also be exercised when administering acyclovir to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic agents since this may increase the risk of renal dysfunction and/or the risk of reversible central nervous system symptoms such as those that have been reported in patients treated with intravenous acyclovir. Adequate hydration should be maintained.

Information for Patients

Patients are instructed to consult with their physician if they experience severe or troublesome adverse reactions, they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant, they intend to breastfeed while taking orally administered acyclovir, or they have any other questions.

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

Herpes Zoster

There are no data on treatment initiated more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Patients should be advised to initiate treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster.

Genital Herpes Infections

Patients should be informed that acyclovir is not a cure for genital herpes. There are no data evaluating whether acyclovir will prevent transmission of infection to others. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes can also be transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

Chickenpox

Chickenpox in otherwise healthy children is usually a self-limited disease of mild to moderate severity. Adolescents and adults tend to have more severe disease. Treatment was initiated within 24 hours of the typical chickenpox rash in the controlled studies, and there is no information regarding the effects of treatment begun later in the disease course.

Herpes zoster — antiviral management in patients with HIV states that antiviral therapy should be initiated as soon as possible for all patients with HIV with herpes zoster diagnosed within 1 week of rash onset (or any time prior to full crusting of lesions). For acute localized dermatomal disease, oral valacyclovir (AII), famciclovir (AII), or acyclovir (BII) (doses as above) are used for 7 to 10 days, with longer duration considered when lesions resolve slowly, and valacyclovir or famciclovir are preferred. If cutaneous lesions are extensive or if visceral involvement is suspected, IV acyclovir should be initiated and continued until clinical improvement is evident (AII); a switch to oral therapy to complete a 10- to 14-day course is reasonable when new lesions have ceased and signs and symptoms of visceral VZV infection are improving (BIII). Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for herpes zoster in people with HIV is not recommended because there is no data supporting its benefit (AIII).

Herpes zoster (HZ) or 'shingles' is a painful vesicular rash resulting from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that also causes chickenpox. The incidence of HZ infection (HZI) increases with age and the degree of immunosuppresssion. Post herpetic neuralgia, the most common complication of HZ, occurs after the zoster rash has resolved. Conventional therapies include antivirals, corticosteroids and analgesics, both oral and topical. Here we report a case of HZ in an 80-year-old woman involving maxillary nerve and the article also reviews various treatment modalities available for the management of HZI.

### Evaluation and treatment of patients with herpes zoster… [^111Tmb4Z]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing age is a key risk factor for virus reactivation. The incidence of shingles increases fivefold in persons 75 years and older compared with the general population. Reactivation is also more common among immunosuppressed persons. Shingles usually begins with paresthesias that can vary from mild itching to severe pain. A maculopapular rash appears in a dermatome that progresses over days to clusters of clear vesicles and then crusted lesions. Healing typically occurs over two to four weeks and can permanently scar the affected area. PHN is defined as pain persisting for more than 30 days after the onset of the rash. The reported rates vary widely; from 8 to 70 percent of patients with shingles are affected.

Increasing age also is associated with higher rates of PHN, with one study quoting a pain prevalence 27-fold higher in patients 50 years and older compared with younger patients, at 60 days post-rash. Severe complications associated with shingles include disseminated disease and acute retinal necrosis. Although more common in immunocompromised persons, severe complications also may occur in patients with normal immune systems. It has been well established in placebo-controlled trials that antiviral therapy with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir decreases the number of skin lesions and the pain experienced with shingles. Valacyclovir and famciclovir are preferred over acyclovir in the treatment of herpes zoster because they have better pharmacokinetic properties and simpler dosing regimens.

The two largest controlled trials of steroids used concomitantly with antiviral therapy for herpes zoster demonstrated faster rates of cutaneous healing and a reduction in acute pain, but no benefit in the incidence or duration of PHN. Although treatment for shingles is sometimes believed to be optional in younger patients who have uncomplicated shingles, the authors recommend treatment in all older and immunocompromised patients and those with eye involvement. Patients with a larger area of skin involvement and more severe pain at presentation have a higher risk for PHN and also should be considered for treatment.

This was preceded by 4 days of pain and itch over vaginal and anal region. She had one dose of varicella vaccination at 18 months old and developed mild primary varicella infection around 5 years of age. Varicella zoster virus DNA was detected both in cerebrospinal fluid and in vesicles over her right labial majora. While there is no international consensus on the recommended duration of treatment for zoster with neurological complications, she was treated with intravenous acyclovir for 10 days with good clinical response. Her fever, headache and neck stiffness resolved after 2 days and genital lesions resolved after 9 days of antiviral therapy.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?
A. Reassurance and supportive garments
B. Surgical referral
C. Antiviral therapy
D. Oral corticosteroids
E. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation

Answers:
A. Reassurance and supportive garments – Correct. The prognosis for postherpetic pseudohernia is good with a mean recovery time of 4.9 months with conservative management. Management should include supportive garments and analgesia if required.
B. Surgical referral – Incorrect. A pseudohernia lacks a fascial defect and results from muscle weakness due to nerve dysfunction. Therefore it does not require surgical intervention. Enhanced recognition of this rare complication amongst dermatologists can prevent unnecessary investigations and surgical referral.
C. Antiviral therapy – Incorrect. Antiviral therapy for herpes zoster is most effective if started within 72 hours after the onset of acute cutaneous eruption. In our case, the patient had already been promptly treated with famciclovir by his family physician at the onset of the shingles rash. If a patient were to present acutely with cutaneous herpes zoster accompanied by pseudohernia, then there would be a role for antiviral therapy.
D. Oral corticosteroids – Incorrect. There is no evidence that oral corticosteroids improve outcomes or reduce symptom duration in postherpetic pseudohernia.
E. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation – Incorrect. While there are case reports of electrical stimulation used in herpes zoster radiculopathy, it is most helpful in managing sensory disturbance, as seen in postherpetic neuralgia rather than the motor weakness itself.

### Improvement of postherpetic neuralgia after treatment with intravenous acyclovir followed by oral valacyclovir… [^113pk4E2]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background Postherpetic neuralgia is a complication of shingles, a painful rash due to varicella-zoster virus reactivation. Studies of patients with PHN and zoster sine herpete support the notion that low-grade viral ganglionitis contributes to pain. If chronic pain reflects active infection, then antiviral therapy may help patients with PHN. Primary infection with varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox, after which the virus becomes latent in cranial nerve, dorsal root, and autonomic ganglia along the entire neuraxis. Decades later, virus reactivation produces shingles, characterized by pain and rash restricted to 1 to 3 dermatomes. Although pain usually resolves within 4 to 6 weeks, more than 40% of patients with zoster who are older than 70 years experience postherpetic neuralgia, pain that persists for months to years. As many as 1 million Americans are affected.

1 Although the cause of PHN is unknown, 2 non–mutually exclusive theories are that the excitability of ganglionic or spinal cord neurons is altered or that low-grade virus infection persists in ganglia. Pathological analysis of ganglia from patients with PHN has revealed diffuse and focal infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells, raising the possibility of prolonged viral infection. 2, 3 The detection of varicella-zoster virus DNA and proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with PHN4, 5 and studies of patients with zoster sine herpete 6, 7 further support the notion that low-grade viral ganglionitis contributes to PHN. If chronic pain reflects active infection, then antiviral therapy may help patients with PHN. Although a large double-blind study using intravenous antiviral drug has been recommended, 8 such a trial is time-consuming and expensive.

Thus, before undertaking a major study, we first conducted an uncontrolled phase I/II trial to see whether IV acyclovir helped patients with PHN. Correlation of clinical with virological data in the future may help to clarify the role of persistent viral ganglionitis in the pathogenesis of disease and ultimately provide a means of identifying patients likely to respond to antiviral treatment. Based on our findings, we now believe that a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is warranted.

Acyclovir-resistant HSV in people with HIV — management guidance: People with HIV are less likely to experience acyclovir-resistant HSV than hematopoietic stem cell recipients, and the risk of developing acyclovir-resistant HSV was lower with daily suppressive acyclovir therapy than with episodic therapy. Recurrences following acyclovir-resistant herpes can be caused by either acyclovir-resistant or acyclovir-sensitive strains. Even in people with prior acyclovir resistance, suppressive acyclovir therapy should be offered after resolution of the episode (CIII); acyclovir resistance is not expected to wane during a clinical episode and acyclovir should not be used as therapy until resolution of the episode in this setting, and if recurrence develops while taking suppressive therapy, susceptibility testing should be done.

### European consensus-based (S2k) guideline on the management of herpes zoster-guided by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) in cooperation with the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), part 2: treatment [^111koGQA]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to patients with impaired renal function, EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend to consider assessing creatinine levels in patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency at the time of initiation of antiviral therapy with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir.
