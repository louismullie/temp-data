## Question

Bursitis of the elbow

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing elbow (olecranon) bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the clinical diagnosis and distinguishing aseptic from septic bursitis. Then, I should verify when to aspirate and how to analyze the fluid. Next, I will review imaging indications and what they can and cannot tell us. After that, I need to outline evidence-based treatment for aseptic bursitis, including whether NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections help. Then, I will examine management of septic bursitis, including when aspiration is needed and antibiotic choices. I will then consider chronic or refractory disease, including bursectomy and emerging options. Finally, I should address prognosis, recurrence, and return-to-activity planning, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and key bedside discriminators between aseptic and septic olecranon bursitis. Posterior elbow swelling over the olecranon is typical, with erythema, warmth, marked tenderness, and fever favoring infection, whereas a painless or mildly tender swelling with minimal erythema suggests aseptic bursitis, though overlap is substantial and cannot be relied upon alone, so I need to ensure objective evaluation rather than jumping to conclusions based on exam alone [^113XnmfY].

> Wait, let me verify when aspiration is mandatory and when it is reasonable to observe. I should confirm that any suspicion of infection warrants diagnostic aspiration for Gram stain, cell count, glucose, crystals, and culture, ideally before antibiotics if the patient is stable, because septic bursitis is commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and delays in diagnosis risk chronic drainage or osteomyelitis, while empiric treatment without aspiration may be considered in select, low-risk ED patients with reliable follow-up, though that approach carries stewardship and diagnostic trade-offs that I need to discuss with the patient [^112EJvpa] [^1121WXML] [^112qd9GH] [^1154jqqf].

> I will now examine how to interpret bursal fluid, but hold on, I should verify that my thresholds align with the literature. A white blood cell count above about 3,000 cells/mm³ supports infection, although ranges vary and inflammatory conditions can confound interpretation; crystals indicate gout or CPPD; and cultures must be held long enough to detect indolent organisms like Propionibacterium acnes, which may require 9–14 days and anaerobic broth, or they will be missed, potentially leading to treatment failure and undertreatment of osteomyelitis [^114WErpg] [^112EJvpa] [^112UhT6x] [^1179vLyw].

> Next, I should review imaging indications and what they add. Ultrasound helps differentiate bursal effusion from cellulitis, guides aspiration, and can detect bursal wall thickening or debris; radiographs are reasonable when trauma is suspected or to exclude bony pathology; MRI is reserved for complications such as suspected osteomyelitis, persistent symptoms despite appropriate care, or when alternative diagnoses are being considered, so I need to ensure I do not over-order advanced imaging when ultrasound suffices [^112EJvpa] [^117KmBAm] [^113V6wwL] [^115oXFwB].

> For aseptic bursitis, let me think about conservative care first, but wait, I should double-check the evidence base for NSAIDs. Guidelines suggest activity modification with strict avoidance of direct pressure on the olecranon, soft padding, and a short course of NSAIDs if tolerated, while noting that evidence for NSAIDs in olecranon bursitis is limited; many cases are self-limited, and the focus should be on reducing mechanical irritation and protecting the bursa rather than aggressive pharmacotherapy [^1116PzVn] [^112wUjt6] [^116mKaCA] [^112EJvpa].

> Now, I need to check the role of aspiration and corticosteroid injection for aseptic bursitis, because guidance conflicts. The ACOEM guideline panel concluded there is no recommendation for NSAIDs and that glucocorticosteroid injections are not recommended for aseptic olecranon bursitis, citing insufficient evidence and potential harm; however, a randomized trial found aspiration with steroid led to earlier resolution than aspiration alone or compression with NSAIDs, albeit with no significant difference in overall success by 4 weeks, and a recent multisociety guidance suggests aspiration with corticosteroid may be offered with low certainty for faster symptom relief; reconciling this, I should counsel that conservative measures are first-line, and if persistent, aspiration with or without steroid may be considered after discussing uncertain benefits and small risks of infection or skin changes [^1116PzVn] [^112wUjt6] [^116LWq3d] [^114ZfAdJ].

> Let me verify injection technique and safety, since I should not gloss over procedural details. If an injection is pursued, use sterile technique, aspirate bursal fluid first when possible, and inject a small volume of corticosteroid; FDA labeling for methylprednisolone acetate describes the bursal injection method and cautions that failure to enter the bursal space reduces benefit, and repeated injections are often futile if correctly placed but ineffective, reinforcing a minimalist approach [^111YddGZ] [^1131kENU] [^113gyoBD].

> For septic bursitis, I need to ensure prompt antibiotics and address source control. Empiric therapy should target methicillin-sensitive or resistant Staphylococcus aureus depending on risk and local resistance patterns, with adjustments to culture results; case series and reports emphasize that many patients improve with oral therapy if systemically well, whereas some clinicians and studies have explored empiric antibiotics without aspiration in select ED patients with reliable follow-up, but I should caution that this risks misclassification and undertreatment and that aspiration remains the diagnostic standard when feasible [^112EJvpa] [^112qd9GH] [^113sGu7w] [^1154jqqf].

> Hold on, I should verify indications for surgical intervention in septic disease. Indications include failure of antibiotics, spreading cellulitis, suspected osteomyelitis, or recurrent/chronic infected bursa; when performed, incision and drainage with debridement and, if necessary, bursectomy are appropriate, with attention to wound complications and the potential need for flap coverage in complex cases, which I should anticipate in shared decision-making and postoperative planning [^112EJvpa] [^1121WXML] [^114yTadv].

> I will now examine chronic or recurrent aseptic bursitis, where conservative measures fail. Bursectomy is the traditional surgical option, but I need to inform patients about meaningful complication and revision rates, including delayed healing and osteomyelitis; emerging data suggest hydrothermal ablation of the bursal lining may achieve high rates of symptom resolution with fewer complications than open bursectomy in selected refractory cases, though this remains investigational and should be framed as such [^114yTadv] [^116gLLd4].

> But wait, what about prognosis and recurrence, and how should I counsel on activity and work. Many cases of aseptic olecranon bursitis resolve with pressure avoidance and time, though recurrence is common if mechanical triggers persist; for return-to-work, I should emphasize avoiding direct olecranon pressure, using protective padding, and modifying tasks, consistent with activity-first principles that show better outcomes than prolonged rest, and I should set expectations that symptom duration may extend beyond a month even with appropriate care [^1116PzVn] [^115YUeX1] [^116mKaCA].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency and alignment with evidence. Start with clinical diagnosis and risk stratification for infection; if infection is suspected, aspirate and treat with appropriate antibiotics and source control as needed; if aseptic, prioritize activity modification and pressure avoidance with optional NSAIDs; reserve aspiration with or without steroid for persistent cases after counseling on uncertain benefit; escalate to bursectomy or consider hydrothermal ablation for refractory disease; throughout, use ultrasound judiciously for diagnosis and procedural guidance, and tailor imaging to complications or alternative diagnoses, documenting shared decision-making at each step [^112EJvpa] [^114ZfAdJ] [^115oXFwB] [^117KmBAm].

Elbow bursitis (olecranon bursitis) is inflammation of the olecranon bursa, typically from **repetitive trauma or pressure** [^112EJvpa], and presents as a **painless swelling over the olecranon** [^115Pp1rg]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with aspiration indicated if infection is suspected to obtain fluid for Gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis [^112EJvpa]. Most cases resolve with **conservative care** (rest, ice, NSAIDs, padding, activity modification) [^1116PzVn] [^116mKaCA]; aspiration with or without corticosteroid may speed resolution in persistent cases [^116LWq3d] [^114ZfAdJ], and surgery is reserved for refractory or septic cases [^1116PzVn] [^112EJvpa]. Prognosis is **generally excellent**, but recurrence is common without ongoing pressure avoidance [^116mKaCA].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Elbow bursitis is classified as **aseptic or septic**; aseptic cases are more common and usually result from **repetitive microtrauma or prolonged pressure** (e.g. leaning on the elbow) [^112EJvpa] [^116mKaCA]. Septic bursitis is less common but more serious, most often due to **Staphylococcus aureus** [^1121WXML], and is associated with immunocompromised states, diabetes, alcoholism, or corticosteroid use [^116rJkpV].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include a **painless swelling over the olecranon** [^notfound]; erythema, warmth, and tenderness suggest infection [^113XnmfY]. Systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) may occur in septic cases but are uncommon [^113XnmfY].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical examination**: Usually sufficient; look for swelling, erythema, warmth, and tenderness [^112EJvpa].
- **Aspiration**: Indicated if infection is suspected; analyze fluid for Gram stain, culture, cell count, and crystals [^112EJvpa].
- **Imaging**: Not routine; ultrasound can distinguish bursitis from cellulitis or abscess [^112EJvpa]; MRI reserved for suspected osteomyelitis or deep infection [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Septic arthritis**: Pain with passive and active motion, systemic symptoms [^notfound].
- **Gout or pseudogout**: Crystal-induced inflammation, confirmed by synovial fluid analysis [^notfound].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Polyarticular involvement, systemic symptoms [^notfound].
- **Olecranon fracture or osteophytes**: Traumatic history or radiographic evidence [^115Pp1rg].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Conservative management

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid pressure on the elbow; use padding [^1116PzVn].
- **Ice and NSAIDs**: Reduce inflammation and pain [^114WQg7M].
- **Compression and elevation**: Minimize swelling [^112EJvpa].

---

### Aspiration and corticosteroid injection

Aspiration alone can relieve discomfort and speed resolution; adding corticosteroid may further accelerate symptom relief, though **evidence is mixed** and recurrence is common [^116LWq3d] [^114ZfAdJ].

---

### Surgical intervention

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases, chronic bursitis, or septic bursitis unresponsive to antibiotics** [^1116PzVn]. Options include open or arthroscopic bursectomy; recurrence and complications (wound healing issues, infection) can occur [^114yTadv].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally excellent** with conservative care, but recurrence is common without ongoing pressure avoidance [^116mKaCA]. Chronic bursitis may develop if repetitive trauma continues [^112EJvpa].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **avoiding repetitive pressure or trauma** to the olecranon — using elbow pads during activities and modifying ergonomics at work or during sports — and educating patients to recognize early symptoms and seek prompt care [^1116PzVn] [^112wUjt6].

---

Elbow bursitis is a common, usually aseptic condition that presents as **painless swelling over the olecranon** [^115Pp1rg]. Most cases resolve with conservative measures; aspiration with or without corticosteroid may help persistent cases, and surgery is reserved for refractory or septic bursitis [^1116PzVn] [^114ZfAdJ]. Recurrence is common without pressure avoidance, so patient education and ergonomics are key to prevention [^1116PzVn].

Joint injection of the elbow is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedures for the elbow joint, medial and lateral epicondylitis, and olecranon bursitis are reviewed. Persistent pain related to inflammatory conditions responds well to injection in the region. Indications for elbow joint injection include osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Corticosteroid injection is an accepted treatment option for medial and lateral epicondylitis. Olecranon bursa aspiration and injection are useful when that bursa is inflamed. The proper techniques, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up essential for effective outcomes are discussed.

### A randomized trial among compression plus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection for nonseptic olecranon bursitis [^116LWq3d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods

We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results

There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27–1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98–4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22–1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1–4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2–9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4–6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions

With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.

### Olecranon bursitis [^113XnmfY]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bursitis is a common medical condition, and of all the bursae in the body, the olecranon bursa is one of the most frequently affected. Bursitis at this location can be acute or chronic in timing and septic or aseptic. Distinguishing between septic and aseptic bursitis can be difficult, and the current literature is not clear on the optimum length or route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases. The current literature was reviewed to clarify these points.

Methods

The reported data for olecranon bursitis were compiled from the current literature.

Results

The most common physical examination findings were tenderness (88% septic, 36% aseptic), erythema/cellulitis (83% septic, 27% aseptic), warmth (84% septic, 56% aseptic), report of trauma or evidence of a skin lesion (50% septic, 25% aseptic), and fever (38% septic, 0% aseptic). General laboratory data ranges were also summarized.

Conclusions

Distinguishing between septic and aseptic olecranon bursitis can be difficult because the physical and laboratory data overlap. Evidence for the optimum length and route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases also differs. In this review we have presented the current data of offending bacteria, frequency of key physical examination findings, ranges of reported laboratory data, and treatment practices so that clinicians might have a better guide for treatment.

### Evaluation of elbow pain in adults [^115Pp1rg]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

The elbow is a complex joint designed to withstand a wide range of dynamic exertional forces. The location and quality of elbow pain can generally localize the injury to one of the four anatomic regions: anterior, medial, lateral, or posterior. The history should include questions about the onset of pain, what the patient was doing when the pain started, and the type and frequency of athletic and occupational activities. Lateral and medial epicondylitis are two of the more common diagnoses and often occur as a result of occupational activities. Patients have pain and tenderness over the affected tendinous insertion that are accentuated with specific movements. If lateral and medial epicondylitis treatments are unsuccessful, ulnar neuropathy and radial tunnel syndrome should be considered. Ulnar collateral ligament injuries occur in athletes participating in sports that involve overhead throwing. Biceps tendinopathy is a relatively common source of pain in the anterior elbow; history often includes repeated elbow flexion with forearm supination and pronation. Olecranon bursitis is a common cause of posterior elbow pain and swelling. It can be septic or aseptic, and is diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and bursal fluid analysis if necessary. Plain radiography is the initial choice for the evaluation of acute injuries and is best for showing bony injuries, soft tissue swelling, and joint effusions. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for chronic elbow pain. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for an inexpensive dynamic evaluation of commonly injured structures.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: elbow disorders [^117LGch2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine has updated the treatment guidelines in its Elbow Disorders chapter through revision processes begun in 2006. This abbreviated version of that chapter highlights some of the evidence and recommendations developed.

Methods

Comprehensive systematic literature reviews were accomplished with article abstraction, critiquing, grading, evidence table compilation, and guideline finalization by a multidisciplinary expert panel and extensive peer-review to develop evidence-based guidance. Consensus recommendations were formulated when evidence was lacking and often relied on analogy to other disorders for which evidence exists. A total of 108 high- or moderate-quality trials were identified for elbow disorders.

Results

Guidance has been developed for 13 major diagnoses and includes 270 specific recommendations.

Conclusion

Quality evidence is now available to guide treatment for elbow disorders, particularly for lateral epicondylalgia.

### Septic bursitis: a case report and primer for the emergency clinician [^114WErpg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 44-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of pain and swelling over the left elbow of 1-week duration. After olecranon bursal aspiration, synovial fluid analysis yielded an increased white blood cell count (3040 cells/mm³) and the presence of bacteria. Culture of the fluid later grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics for septic bursitis and returned to the orthopedics clinic for follow-up 2 days later with interval worsening of symptoms. He was subsequently admitted for parenteral antibiotics and surgical wash-out of the affected bursa. This report briefly discusses the clinical history and appropriate diagnostic evaluation for septic olecranon bursitis, as well as the shortcomings of existing treatment guidelines.

### Clinical management of olecranon bursitis: a review [^116mKaCA]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Olecranon bursitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the olecranon bursa, most often due to microtrauma. Although it is a common condition, there is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. The condition is often self-limited and resolves with conservative methods such as rest, ice, compression, orthosis wear, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Older studies have shown resolution of symptoms with intrabursal corticosteroid injections and surgical bursectomy. More recent literature has demonstrated adverse effects of intrabursal injections and surgery compared with noninvasive management for initial treatment of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. In order to better tailor decision-making, it is important that hand surgeons understand the comparative efficacies of each option for management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^116FvxTA]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

On an individual level, a steady half-life means that the duration of symptoms or length of follow-up could be largely irrelevant and provides little prognostic value. It also means that the future course is completely unpredictable. Recovery seems to be a random process akin to the biological half-life of drugs. A molecule lasting several half-lives is no different from a molecule that is eliminated first. This does not mean that a patient should expect their symptoms to halve every four months, but rather that the probability of recovery in future persists irrespective of the time passed.

While the underlying mechanisms for the half-life pattern are unclear, these findings have relevance for everyday clinical practice and future research. In this annotation we discuss what the findings mean for the usual practice of operating on patients whose symptoms fail to settle with nonoperative treatment. Second, we consider how the findings influence the interpretation of other studies. Finally, we discuss what our advice should be to patients who are frustrated by long-standing symptoms and seek advice about whether surgery should be undertaken.

### Epicondylitis: pathogenesis, imaging, and treatment [^113hs4ME]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Epicondylitis commonly affects the elbow medially or laterally, typically in the 4th or 5th decade of life and without predilection with regard to sex. Epicondylitis is an inflammatory process that may be more accurately described as tendinosis. In the lateral epicondylar region, this process affects the common extensor tendon; in the medial epicondylar region, the common flexor tendon is affected. The condition is widely believed to originate from repetitive overuse with resultant microtearing and progressive degeneration due to an immature reparative response. Advances in understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of epicondylitis have shaped current treatment practices. Conservative measures are undertaken initially, because symptoms in most patients improve with time and rest. Those who fail to respond to conservative therapy are considered for surgical treatment. When surgery is contemplated, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography is useful for evaluating the extent of disease, detecting associated pathologic processes, excluding other primary sources of elbow pain, and planning the surgical approach. Familiarity with the normal anatomy, the pathophysiology of epicondylitis and its mimics, and diagnostic imaging techniques and findings allows more accurate diagnosis and helps establish an appropriate treatment plan.

### Lateral epicondylitis: a review of pathology and management [^111EwuPk]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis, or 'tennis elbow', is a common condition that usually affects patients between 35 and 55 years of age. It is generally self-limiting, but in some patients it may continue to cause persistent symptoms, which can be refractory to treatment. This review discusses the mechanism of disease, symptoms and signs, investigations, current management protocols and potential new treatments.

### Persistent tennis elbow symptoms have little prognostic value: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qYj8j]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tennis elbow is a common painful enthesopathy of the lateral elbow that limits upper limb function and frequently results in lost time at work. Surgeons often recommend surgery if symptoms persist despite nonsurgical management, but operations for tennis elbow are inconsistent in their efficacy, and what we know about those operations often derives from observational studies that assume the condition does not continue to improve over time. This assumption is largely untested, and it may not be true; meta-analyzing results from the control arms of tennis elbow studies can help us to evaluate this premise, but to our knowledge, this has not been done.

Questions/Purposes

The aims of this systematic review were to describe the course of (1) global improvement, (2) pain, and (3) disability in participants who received no active treatment (placebo or no treatment) in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on tennis elbow. We also assessed (4) whether the duration of symptoms or placebo effect is associated with differences in symptom trajectories.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to August 12, 2019, for trials including participants with tennis elbow and a placebo or a no-treatment arm and a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. There were no language restrictions or exclusion criteria. We extracted global improvement, pain, and disability outcomes. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the risk of bias of included trials. To estimate the typical course of tennis elbow without active treatment, we pooled global improvement (the proportion of participants who reported feeling much better or completely recovered), mean pain, and mean disability using baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up data. We transformed pain and disability data from the original papers so that at each timepoint the relevant outcome was expressed as change relative to baseline to account for different baseline values. We used meta-regression to assess whether the placebo effect or duration of symptoms before enrollment was associated with differences in symptom trajectories. We included 24 trials with 1085 participants who received no active treatment.

Results

The number of patients who were not improved decreased exponentially over time. The half-life of global improvement was between 2.5 and 3 months (that is, every 2.5 to 3 months, 50% of the remaining symptomatic patients reported complete recovery or greatly improved symptoms). At 1 year, 89% (189 of 213; 95% CI 80% to 97%) of patients experienced global improvement. The mean pain and disability followed a similar pattern, halving every 3 to 4 months. Eighty-eight percent of pain (95% CI 70% to 100%) and 85% of disability (95% CI 60% to 100%) had resolved by 1 year. The mean duration of symptoms before trial enrollment was not associated with differences in symptom trajectories. The trajectories of the no-treatment and placebo arms were similar, indicating that the placebo effect of the studied active treatments likely is negligible.

Conclusion

Based on the placebo or no-treatment control arms of randomized trials, about 90% of people with untreated tennis elbow achieve symptom resolution at 1 year. The probability of resolution appears to remain constant throughout the first year of follow-up and does not depend on previous symptom duration, undermining the rationale that surgery is appropriate if symptoms persist beyond a certain point of time. We recommend that clinicians inform people who are frustrated with persisting symptoms that this is not a cause for apprehension, given that spontaneous improvement is about as likely during the subsequent few months as it was early after the symptoms first appeared. Because of the high likelihood of spontaneous recovery, any active intervention needs to be justified by high levels of early efficacy and little or no risk to outperform watchful waiting.

Introduction

Tennis elbow (or lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy) is a common condition causing lateral elbow pain and disability in middle-aged adults. Its prevalence is strongly associated with age, rising sharply after the age of 30 years, peaking between the ages of 45 and 65 years, and being rare after the age of 65 years.

Indirect evidence suggests that tennis elbow has a benign clinical course. A screening study found that between 1% and 2% of people between the ages of 35 and 55 years have typical clinical findings of tennis elbow, but the reported incidence in the same age group is less than half of that. - ⁠ This suggests that many patients with tennis elbow never see a doctor. Furthermore, about half of those who are diagnosed with tennis elbow only visit a doctor once or twice, and three-quarters are no longer seeking care three months after their initial visit. Another indicator of its excellent long-term prognosis is that despite the lack of a specific cure, the condition is rare in people aged > 65 years.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^116pAfB4]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy) is a self-limiting condition in most patients. Surgery is often offered to patients who fail to improve with conservative treatment. However, there is no evidence to support the superiority of surgery over continued nonoperative care or no treatment. New evidence also suggests that the prognosis of tennis elbow is not influenced by the duration of symptoms, and that there is a 50% probability of recovery every three to four months. This finding challenges the belief that failed nonoperative care is an indication for surgery. In this annotation, we discuss the clinical and research implications of the benign clinical course of tennis elbow.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute elbow and forearm pain [^117KmBAm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute elbow pain can be the result of traumatic and atraumatic processes. Pathologic processes include osseous, ligamentous, and tendinous etiologies. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^114WQg7M]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

### Common superficial bursitis [^112EJvpa]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Superficial bursitis most often occurs in the olecranon and prepatellar bursae. Less common locations are the superficial infrapatellar and subcutaneous (superficial) calcaneal bursae. Chronic microtrauma (e.g., kneeling on the prepatellar bursa) is the most common cause of superficial bursitis. Other causes include acute trauma/hemorrhage, inflammatory disorders such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, and infection (septic bursitis). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, with a particular focus on signs of septic bursitis. Ultrasonography can help distinguish bursitis from cellulitis. Blood testing (white blood cell count, inflammatory markers) and magnetic resonance imaging can help distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes. If infection is suspected, bursal aspiration should be performed and fluid examined using Gram stain, crystal analysis, glucose measurement, blood cell count, and culture. Management depends on the type of bursitis. Acute traumatic/hemorrhagic bursitis is treated conservatively with ice, elevation, rest, and analgesics; aspiration may shorten the duration of symptoms. Chronic microtraumatic bursitis should be treated conservatively, and the underlying cause addressed. Bursal aspiration of microtraumatic bursitis is generally not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic septic bursitis. Although intrabursal corticosteroid injections are sometimes used to treat microtraumatic bursitis, high-quality evidence demonstrating any benefit is unavailable. Chronic inflammatory bursitis (e.g., gout, rheumatoid arthritis) is treated by addressing the underlying condition, and intrabursal corticosteroid injections are often used. For septic bursitis, antibiotics effective against Staphylococcus aureus are generally the initial treatment, with surgery reserved for bursitis not responsive to antibiotics or for recurrent cases. Outpatient antibiotics may be considered in those who are not acutely ill; patients who are acutely ill should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics.

### Methylprednisolone acetate [^111YddGZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by aspiration of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile.

If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.

A 20 to 24 gauge needle attached to a dry syringe is inserted into the bursa and the fluid aspirated. The needle is left in place and the aspirating syringe changed for a small syringe containing the desired dose. After injection, the needle is withdrawn and a small dressing applied.

### Elbow arthritis [^11445oaX]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Elbow arthritis is an uncommon condition that can cause debilitating pain, stiffness, or instability. The most common etiologies include rheumatoid arthritis, posttraumatic arthritis, and primary osteoarthritis. Treatment begins with nonsurgical modalities, including activity modification, anti-inflammatories, hand therapy, and corticosteroids. Operative intervention may be considered once nonsurgical management has failed. Surgical treatment depends on the underlying etiology, chief complaint, patient age, and functional demand. Advances in technology, especially arthroscopic techniques, have expanded the treatment options available to surgeons. The goals of treatment include pain relief and restoration of functional range of motion. The purpose of this article is to review the pertinent soft tissue and osseous anatomy, discuss the etiologies, review the principles of diagnosis and evaluation, and finally, study the treatment options for elbow arthritis.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^115Ps7x1]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge this is the first reported case of infected olecranon bursitis with the causal organisms being S. epidermidis and P. acnes, as shown in cultures from a tissue specimen. The association with P. acnes is the most unusual aspect of this case. Despite the shortcomings of the initial aspects of treatment for this case, including the initial courses of inadequate antibiotic treatments (eg, the primary care physician's use of low dose ceftriaxone and the surgeon's use of vancomycin instead of a beta-lactam antibiotic for P. acnes), this case is reported in order to help other medical doctors and surgeons avoid these pitfalls. Additionally, at the time when these decisions were made our literature searches (PubMed and Google) of 'P. acnes' and 'olecranon' and 'olecranon bursitis' failed to reveal any cases.

P. acnes is found in hair follicles (pilosebaceous glands) especially around the shoulder area, and is more commonly found in men than women. P. acnes are small-to-medium Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria that exhibit facultative anaerobic metabolism. This organism is primarily known for being involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory acne and other chronic conditions or infections such as prosthetic shoulder and hip infections, silicone breast prosthetic infections, endocarditis of prosthetic and native aortic valves, corneal infections, postoperative endophthalmitis, focal intracranial infections, cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections and sarcoidosis.

In orthopaedics, P. acnes has become notorious as an indolent and often difficult to diagnose opportunistic pathogen in spine and shoulder infections. This likely reflects the proximity of these sites to areas where there are relatively high concentrations of pilosebaceous glands. For example, Propionibacterium have become the most common bacteria to be recovered at surgical revision of a failed shoulder arthroplasty. P. acnes are a much less common cause of infection in elbow prosthetic arthroplasty, likely reflecting the very low prevalence of this organism in the cutaneous tissues of the elbow. Somerson et al reviewed 20 studies that reported deep infection rates after total elbow replacement. Of the six studies that reported organisms grown on culture (1667 cases), P. acnes only represented 0.7% of the infected cases (11 of 1667 cases).

### Hydrothermal ablation in recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis: a prospective study [^116gLLd4]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis can be difficult to treat, resulting in persistent or recurrent symptoms. Bursectomy is a frequently applied treatment option for refractory cases but has high complication rates. This is the first in vivo study to investigate the safety and efficacy of hydrothermal ablation, a new treatment modality for recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis that aims to cause thermal obliteration of the bursal lining by irrigation with heated saline.

Methods

First, a pilot animal trial was set up to determine a safe irrigation temperature window. Second, in a human trial the bursae of patients with chronic, recurrent, or refractory olecranon bursitis were irrigated with a 3-mL/s flow of physiological saline for a duration of 180 seconds at temperatures between 50°C and 52°C. Patients were followed up for 6 months, allowing for assessment of the surgical site to screen for adverse events, volumetric ultrasonographic assessment of the bursae, and collection of the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), Patient Global Impression Score, and Clinical Global Impression Score, as well as data on return to activities or work.

Results

Twenty-four elbows were prospectively included and underwent a full cycle of hydrothermal ablation. The mean age was 58.4 years (range 40.5–81.5), including 20 male and 4 female patients. None had clinical signs of septic bursitis. Bursal fluid cultures were positive in only 1 case. The average preoperative bursal volume was 11.18 mL (range 4.13–30.75). Eighteen of 24 elbows (75%) were successfully treated, showing a complete remission of symptoms or decided improvement within 6 weeks and without any signs of recurrence during the entire follow-up period of 6 months. The average reduction of ultrasonography-measured bursal volume was 91.9% in the group of patients who responded to treatment. In patients without recurrence, the mean QuickDASH scores before and after treatment were 13.6 (range 0–50) and 3.1 (range 0–27.5), respectively, showing a statistically significant improvement. All patients were able to fully return to work within 6 weeks after the index procedure. No serious adverse events were encountered. Moderate local adverse events were found in 2 patients. Increasing temperatures of irrigation did not result in a higher treatment efficacy.

Conclusion

Hydrothermal ablation at temperatures between 50°C and 52°C is a safe treatment option for recurrent or chronic olecranon bursitis with fewer complications than open bursectomy and a comparable efficacy.

### Local perforator flap for reconstruction of deep tissue defects in the elbow area [^111iVZfP]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Limited deep tissue defects in the elbow area can occur after burns, advanced bursitis, and inflammatory processes, to name a few. Reconstruction is complicated because sufficient tissue with adequate elasticity and strength has to be transferred. Often major surgical procedures such as free tissue transfer are considered. A novel method for reconstruction of deep tissue defects in the elbow area, based on a single perforator artery and vein, is described. Perforator vessels are identified preoperatively using color Doppler ultrasonography, and a flap from the upper arm is rotated 180 degrees. The authors describe the successful treatment of two patients. The surgical technique is comparatively simple and can be performed with regional anesthesia. Postoperative recovery is short and skin sensibility is retained. The authors suggest that local, single perforator flaps can be considered as a first alternative in treatment of limited, deep tissue defects in the elbow area, especially for elderly or severely ill patients.

This report presents my guidelines for surgeon training and development of skills in the art of elbow arthroscopy. As elbow arthroscopy becomes more common, it is important to achieve greater levels of experience that will minimize the risk of complications because indications and techniques are growing in number and complexity. Indications for elbow arthroscopy that require diagnosis before open surgery include evaluation of instability; removal of loose bodies, spurs, and plica; irrigation and debridement of infection or open joints; evaluation for arthrofibrosis (with open nerve protection), lateral epicondylitis, arthritis, osteochondritis dissecans, fracture, bursectomy, synovectomy, stabilization, tendon repair, and nerve release or decompression.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^111B9w6a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with symptomatic olecranon bursitis commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation. Up to 50% of all olecranon bursitis cases in the ED are septic in nature. It is important to recognize and appropriately treat these cases to prevent complications including septic arthritis and sepsis.

The ED evaluation and diagnosis of septic bursitis is widely variable and often based on anecdotal evidence. Diagnostic aspiration of the olecranon bursa to assess for septic bursitis is commonly recommended and performed, despite the paucity of evidence to support this practice. Aspiration may increase the risk for complications including chronic fistula formation, infection, and need for a future bursectomy.

There are only limited studies focused on ED evaluation and management of septic bursitis. Additionally, the efficacy of conservative management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis with empiric antibiotic therapy is unknown. The objective of our study was to describe outcomes associated with empiric antibiotic therapy without bursal aspiration among ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

Case presentation

In February 2015, a 63-year-old man (height: 178 cm; weight: 82 kg; body mass index: 26) sustained a punctate laceration on the posterior aspect of his left elbow. At that time he was otherwise healthy and was not taking any medications. He had a medical history of poliomyelitis as an adolescent with mild residual elbow contractures as a result. He was an avid swimmer and swam for exercise three to four times each week at a public pool. He noticed the left elbow laceration after striking the posterior aspect of his left elbow on a metal railing while swimming in a public pool. Two days later erythema and oedema developed around the wound. Five days later he saw his primary care physician who diagnosed this as cellulitis with infected olecranon bursitis. The bursa was lanced to allow it to drain and one culture was obtained from the scant fluid.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^1121WXML]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The olecranon bursa is thought to be at increased risk for infection due to its superficial location. Septic olecranon bursitis is most commonly caused by bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Ho et al found S. aureus to be the predominant cause of infection in 72%–92% of cases that they studied.

Here we report a unique case of a 63-year-old man who sustained a punctate laceration on the posterior aspect of his left elbow and acquired a rare polymicrobial infection (Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in his olecranon bursa. There was also the possibility of concurrent olecranon osteomyelitis as seen on MRI. The infection was treated successfully with intravenous antibiotics and soft-tissue debridements.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^116rJkpV]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Predisposing factors that increase the risk of acquired septic olecranon bursitis are persistent pressure on the bursa (eg, due to work demands), corticosteroid therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, gout and other conditions that reduce immunity. As a child our patient had poliomyelitis, which could increase the potential for opportunistic infections due to an 'immunocompromised cutaneous district' because the virus has been shown to result in regional impairments in nerve conduction that could lead to decreased peptidergic stimulation of immunocompetent cells. Although poliomyelitis primarily affects motor neurons, there is evidence that sensory neurons are also impaired. The novel concept of a selectively diminished cutaneous and subcutaneous inflammatory response due to regional poliomyelitis-related nerve damage is further supported by case reports that detail the sparing of a poliomyelitis affected limb from psoriasis, joint sparing in a patient with unilateral psoriatic arthritis with a history of hemiplegia, and sparing of limbs affected by past infection with poliomyelitis in patients with systemic sclerosis. However, although our patient's poliomyelitis infection did permanently affect the joints of his upper extremities (primarily with mild elbow contractures), there is no clear evidence that his chronologically remote polio infection contributed to his P. acnes olecranon bursitis. A link between his P. acnes olecranon bursitis/osteomyelitis also seems unlikely because he did not have any prior history of atypical or unusual infections.

Patient's perspective

I am pleased with the final outcome, but in the first 3–4 weeks it was clear that the antibiotics choices were not working. I am grateful to return to swimming and all work-related activities.

Learning points

Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be rare pathogenic causes of olecranon bursitis and osteomyelitis due to their ubiquitous presence on the skin.
Wound cultures taken in these conditions must be held for adequate time to detect growth of these organisms and guide appropriate treatment decisions.
Penicillin-based antibiotics with a beta-lactamase inhibitor provide coverage for P. acnes and is a viable treatment option for bone and soft tissue infections with this pathogen.

### Management of lateral elbow tendinopathy: one size does not fit all [^117HgU3V]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Synopsis Clear guidelines for the clinical management of individuals with lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET) are hampered by many proposed interventions and the condition's prognosis, ranging from immediate resolution of symptoms following simple advice in some patients to long-lasting problems, regardless of treatment, in others. This is compounded by our lack of understanding of the complexity of the underlying pathophysiology of LET. In this article, we collate evidence and expert opinion on the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and differential diagnosis of LET. Factors that might provide prognostic value or direction for physical rehabilitation, such as the presence of neck pain, tendon tears, or central sensitization, are canvassed. Clinical recommendations for physical rehabilitation are provided, including the prescription of exercise and adjunctive physical therapy and pharmacotherapy. A preliminary algorithm, including targeted interventions, for the management of subgroups of patients with LET based on identified prognostic factors is proposed. Further research is needed to evaluate whether such an approach may lead to improved outcomes and more efficient resource allocation. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2015;45(11):938–949.

### Sonography of cubital bursitis [^1143i9xv]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to describe the sonographic appearance of cubital bursitis in three patients and to illustrate the use of sonographic guidance for therapeutic injections.

Conclusion

Cubital bursitis, a rare but painful condition of the elbow, can be diagnosed with sonography. Cubital bursitis is seen as distention of the bicipitoradial bursa in the proximal forearm, occasionally with fluid or complex synovial debris in more severe cases. Power Doppler imaging can aid in providing information about active inflammation. Two patients in our series were treated using sonographically guided decompression of the bursa and steroid injection with good clinical results.

### Randomised, prospective, non-blinded pilot study comparing the effect of intramuscular steroid injections and intralesional steroid injections in the management of tennis elbow [^116soEZR]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Key messages

What is already known on this topic?

Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory and pain-modulating drugs and may act through both local and systemic mechanisms.
Multiple studies and a systematic review suggest that a steroid injection for tennis elbow improves many short-term (6-week) outcome measures including pain and disability.
Pain and disability associated with tennis elbow typically follows a self-limiting course of 12 months but this may pose a potentially significant socioeconomic impact on individuals.

What this study adds?

Both intralesional and intramuscular corticosteroid injections have been shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of tennis elbow.
Non-inferiority of the intramuscular steroid injection compared with the intralesional steroid injection could not be inferred.
Intramuscular steroid injection was shown to be less painful at the site and time of injection compared with an intralesional injection.
This study did not include a sham group, so whether either treatment is superior to placebo could not be determined.

### Peripheral joint injections [^111aB38L]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral joint injections are a common interventional treatment of peripheral joint-mediated pain, including arthritis, tendinopathy, and bursitis that are not responsive to conservative management. Degenerative changes of articular joints are often related to these symptoms through chronic inflammatory changes, which typically arise due to repetitive trauma, autoimmune disease, or metabolic abnormalities. The primary diagnosis for degenerative disease in the peripheral joints is osteoarthritis but can also include rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and other less common etiologies. Chronic inflammatory damage to the articular surfaces and joint capsules can lead to pain and functional decline. As such, the use of peripheral joint injections after the failure of typical conservative treatment, including physical therapy and oral medications, is common. Although these injections are typically not curative in nature, their primary objective is to decrease pain to allow functional improvement concurrently with physical and pharmaceutical modalities. Common injectates used for peripheral joint injections include local anesthetic, corticosteroid, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, and mesenchymal stromal cells.

Introduction

Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a common shoulder concern manifesting in progressive loss of glenohumeral movements coupled with pain. It is a fibroproliferative tissue fibrosis, and although the immunobiological advances in other diseases have helped dissect the pathophysiology of this condition, overall, the molecular mechanisms underpinning it remain poorly understood.,

Frozen shoulder manifests clinically as shoulder pain with progressive restricted movement, both active and passive, along with normal radiographic scans of the glenohumeral joint. It classically progresses prognostically through 3 overlapping stages of pain (stage 1, lasting 2–9 months), stiffness (stage 2, lasting 4–12 months), and recovery (stage 3, lasting 5–24 months). However, this is an estimated time frame, and many patients can still experience symptoms at 6 years. A primary care–based observational study estimated its incidence as 2.4 per 100 000 individuals per year, with prevalence varying from less than 1% to 2% of the population.

A true evidence-based model for its medical management has not been defined, with a wide spectrum of operative and nonoperative treatments available. From the international to departmental level, management strategies vary widely, reflecting the lack of good-quality evidence. The British Elbow and Shoulder Society/British Orthopaedic Association (BESS/BOA) has published recommendations in a patient care pathway for frozen shoulder, with a step-up approach in terms of invasiveness advised. The UK Frozen Shoulder Trial, a randomized parallel trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early structured physiotherapy, manipulation under anesthetic (MUA), and arthroscopic capsular release (ACR) is currently under way. The aim of this systematic review is to present the available evidence relevant to treatment and outcomes for frozen shoulder with the ultimate objective of guiding clinical practice, both in primary and secondary care.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^1179vLyw]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

This report describes a 63-year-old generally healthy male with septic olecranon bursitis caused by Propionibacterium acnes The patient sustained a small laceration after striking the posterior aspect of his left elbow on a metal railing when he was at a public swimming pool. We concluded that P. acnes was not initially detected because cultures were only kept for 5days. Consequently, initial antibiotic treatment failed. P. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis grew in a subsequent tissue culture. The infection did not respond to intravenous vancomycin although soft-tissue debridements were done. This likely reflected the presence of olecranon osteomyelitis (seen on MRI scans) in addition to inadequate treatment with this antibiotic in the setting of a polymicrobial infection. Eventually, the infection was eradicated with multiple soft-tissue debridements in addition to the continuation of vancomycin with daily intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam that was added for the final 4weeks of antibiotic treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic elbow pain [^113V6wwL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic elbow pain can be osseous, soft tissue, cartilaginous, and nerve related in etiology. Imaging plays an important role in differentiating between these causes of chronic elbow pain. This document provides recommendations for imaging of chronic elbow pain in adult patients. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

The initial culture showed no growth on anaerobic media but it was held for only 5 days, which is not sufficient for detecting P. acnes; growth of this organism usually requires 9–14 days. The patient's primary care physician prescribed a 5-day course of intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone 1.0 g daily and a 10-day course of doxycycline 100 mg orally two times per day. The rationale given for its combination was 'for broad antibacterial coverage'.

The patient was referred to our clinic to take over the management of his septic left olecranon bursitis because of the clear failure of his initial treatment regimen. At that time, he was applying small gauze dressings two times per day to cover and collect the drainage from the 1-centimetre diameter open wound over the olecranon. MR images of the left elbow suggested mild acute osteomyelitis of the olecranon. At this clinic visit, one culture of the tissue that was cut with a scalpel from the open wound of the left olecranon bursa was obtained. The methodology for the anaerobic culture included cooked meat glucose liquid broth, plating on anaerobic blood agar and anaerobic blood agar containing phenyl ethyl alcohol which selects for Gram-positive organisms. P. acnes grew only in cooked meat glucose liquid broth under anaerobic conditions with no colonies observed on solid medium. Cultures were kept for 14 days. P. acnes was identified by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. Analysis for P. acnes phylotypes was not done although this information can be clinically important in some situations. S. epidermidis was also detected from the same culture when plated on aerobic blood agar. Antibiotic sensitivities were not done on either organism, which was an error because the laboratory failed to recognise that the sample was bursa tissue.

Similar to our patient's case, the onset of infection with P. acnes is usually insidious and of low virulence, and once established it persists due to the tendency of these organisms to form a biofilm. For this reason, antibiofilm antibiotics, such as rifampicin (rifampin), are often necessary for successful treatment. However, rifampicin-resistant P. acnes have been known to appear as a result of this treatment. High dose intravenous penicillin is usually the drug of choice for treating P. acnes infections and rifampin is often used in combination with this antibiotic or others (eg, vancomycin or daptomycin). A main reason that we did not use penicillin and rifampin is that during the final phase of our patient's treatment we were primarily concerned for Gram-positive coverage and a polymicrobial infection. It is for this reason that we used piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.

Improvements in isolating P. acnes can be achieved when employing the advanced methods. For example, in a prospective multicentre study of prosthetic joint infections, Bémer et al showed that P. acnes infections were most reliably detected using Schaedler broth (up to 14 days incubation time). ESR and CRP levels are also known to have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis and monitoring of the progress of the treatment for infected shoulder prosthetic arthroplasties. This is consistent with the variable ESR and CRP levels in our patient throughout the course of his illness and the failure of these markers to completely normalise by the end of his treatment.

P. acnes can remain viable on inanimate object surfaces for at least 17 days. While it might be conceivable that the organism was present on the metal rail at the time the patient struck it with his left elbow, it is more likely that this organism was present on his skin, especially given the presence of S. epidermidis in the same culture. Nevertheless, P. acnes are rarely the cause, or detected as a contaminant, in cases of infected olecranon bursitis. This is supported by our failure to find any reported cases of these associations in our literature searches.

### Case report: olecranon bursitis due toin an immunocompromised patient [^113QJJBD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Human protothecosis is a rare algal infection caused by Prototheca; it is a ubiquitous achlorophyllic alga, which rarely causes human disease. Currently, the pathogenesis remains unclear and no treatment options have been elucidated. We present a case of olecranon bursitis caused by Prototheca wickerhamii in an immunocompromised patient. A 45-year-old man presented with left elbow pain after scraping his elbow on a tree. He reported significant pain and swelling of the elbow after injury, which resolved without intervention. He was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS infection and started on antiretroviral therapy. Afterward, he experienced recurrent elbow swelling and pain; an incision and drainage was performed and cultures demonstrated P. wickerhamii. Unsuccessful treatment with oral voriconazole led to an attempt at therapy with parental amphotericin and oral doxycycline; however the patient left against medical advice. He presented to our facility and both parental amphotericin and doxycycline were initiated with planned outpatient bursectomy. He clinically improved on that regimen but left against medical advice before completing his recommended course of IV amphotericin and oral doxycycline. Patients diagnosed with disseminated protothecosis can have a mortality rate upward of 67%. Given the rarity of this pathogen, no official treatment guidelines exist and there are few studies analyzing the antimicrobial susceptibility of Prototheca. Management is challenging because of slow-growing nature of the algae, paucity of research studies, and limited susceptibility of this pathogen. This case adds to the limited body of literature by demonstrating the clinical presentation of protothecosis and highlighting the pathology and current treatment options.

### Elbow artery embolization for lateral epicondylitis [^112L3P4s]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is characterized by a low-grade inflammatory process in the lateral aspect of the elbow. Symptoms are typically treated conservatively, and most patients show resolution or improvement of symptoms within a few months. For those with refractory symptoms, treatment options are limited with questionable benefit. Embolization of the arteries supplying the elbow decreases the neo-vascularity seen in epicondylitis. The procedure may result in marked improvement in pain and function, which has shown to be durable.

After piperacillin/tazobactam was started, the wound started to granulate well and was closed after 18 days of treatment with this antibiotic. Closure included a Z-plasty and retention stitches with bolsters which enabled closure of the retracted skin margins (figure 2). After closure, the patient's left upper extremity was placed in long-arm cylinder cast at 30° of elbow flexion. The cast was changed every 2 weeks and the elbow flexion angle was increased 30° each time. This regimen was done to allow wound healing without excessive skin tension. The wound healed uneventfully (figure 3).

Figure 2
Photograph of the patient's left elbow showing the lesion closed with retention stitches. The stitches are passed through 0.5 cm segments that were cut from a narrow rubber tube, which are bolsters that serve to distribute stress so that the stitches do not cut through the skin.

Photograph taken 4 months after the elbow wound was closed. The wound had healed well and without any problems at final follow-up, which was 14 months after this photograph was taken.

The patient's C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results are shown in figure 4. These values were never within normal limits during the course of treatment, which we attributed to inflammation associated with osteoarthritis of his elbows.

Question 4: What is the Evidence for Treatment of Tendinopathies Using Injectable Biologics?

In the current and subsequent sections of the guideline, we summarize evidence for injectable biologics for specific painful indications. Study data are also summarized in–.

Lateral Epicondylitis

Lateral epicondylitis (LE), or tennis elbow, describes an overuse injury of the extensor tendons attaching to the lateral humerus. While typically self-limited, injuries failing the initial healing response can lead to chronic, degenerative tendinopathy. Consequently, the focus of treatment may shift from anti-inflammatory medication to regenerative approaches. Corticosteroid injections (CSI) have traditionally been used in LE refractory to conservative management. While they can provide short-term symptomatic relief, their use is increasingly discouraged due to questionable efficacy, high rates of recurrence, and risk of further tissue damage. Dextrose prolotherapy has yielded outcomes comparable or superior to CSI and placebo. A meta-analysis of nine trials demonstrated positive outcomes with dextrose prolotherapy, although there was a moderate risk of bias.

The use of autologous blood products has gained interest as an alternative intervention for recalcitrant LE. RCTs comparing either leukocyte-rich PRP (LR-PRP) or leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP) to placebo demonstrated significant improvements in pain and function with both types over a year of follow-up.RCTs also reported superiority of PRP injections to CSI at 3 months to 2 years. Some trials reported that CSI may be equivalent or more effective for pain relief in the short-term, but this effect declined over time. Meta-analyses have reiterated this association: CSI demonstrates efficacy for 2 to 8 weeks, while PRP remains superior in the longer term (3 months to 2 years).PRP injections also yielded similar benefits to surgical intervention in multiple studies. However, they have not demonstrated efficacy as an adjuvant to surgery or tenotomy. Unlike PRP, autologous conditioned plasma (ACP) injections failed to show significant improvements versus placebo over 6 months in small RCTs. However, they were superior to CSI in a larger RCT with 1-year follow-up.

### Prevention and treatment of elbow stiffness [^1112E6Y1]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The elbow is as prone to stiffness as it is essential for upper-extremity function. The elbow is a highly constrained synovial hinge joint that frequently becomes stiff after injury. Elbow contracture is challenging to treat, and therefore prevention is of paramount importance. When this approach fails, nonoperative followed by operative treatment modalities can be pursued. In the future, efforts to prevent and treat elbow stiffness may target the basic science mechanisms involved.

### Methylprednisolone acetate, bupivacaine hydrochloride, povidone-iodine (physicians EZ use M-pred) [^113gyoBD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by aspiration of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile.

If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.

### Empirical treatment of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis without aspiration [^112qd9GH]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although aspiration of septic olecranon bursitis is recommended in the literature, no high-level evidence exists to support this practice. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the results of traditional bursal aspiration (TBA) with empirical management without aspiration (EM). We hypothesized that EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis results in resolution, with fewer chronic draining sinuses and less progression to bursectomy.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all cases of septic olecranon bursitis seen by the orthopedic surgery department at a single tertiary referral center over a 5-year period. Cases were manually reviewed to determine patient demographics, management, and treatment results. The primary outcome was success of nonsurgical management versus requirement for surgical bursectomy.

Results

Thirty cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis were identified within the study period. Eleven patients were initially managed with TBA (performed by an emergency or primary care physician prior to orthopedic consultation), resulting in 11 positive cultures. Only 1 of these prompted a change of antibiotic management, and despite this information, 5 patients required a second course of antibiotics for incomplete resolution. Eight of the TBA cases went on to bursectomy. Nineteen patients underwent EM. Sixteen of these cases resolved with a single course of empirical antibiotics, and 3 (16%) cases required a second antibiotic course. One patient had a recurrence of symptoms 2 months after resolution with a single course of empirical antibiotics. This resolved with a second course of oral antibiotics. No patients who underwent EM went on to require bursectomy. The number needed to harm when aspiration was performed was 1.46.

Conclusions

We found EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis to be effective. Although 1 recurrence did occur in the EM group, no other complications occurred. Empirical management without aspiration may be considered in cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis.

### Tennis elbow: what is It? How Do I get back to my regular activities? [^113o6Cfg]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

You do not have to play tennis to get tennis elbow-a very common problem for people who do lots of repetitive movements of the wrist, forearm and elbow, such as carpentry, painting or racquet sports. Most people with tennis elbow feel pain on the outside of their elbow and upper forearm. Experts in managing elbow pain developed a guideline for rehabilitation clinicians to use to help you understand more about tennis elbow. Here, we explain what the guidelines say about how to diagnose tennis elbow (sometimes called lateral elbow pain or lateral elbow tendinopathy), the specific treatments your physical therapist might offer you to help manage pain and improve the mobility of your elbow, and the types of exercises you could do to strengthen the muscles in your wrist and forearm.

### Optimal case definitions of upper extremity disorder for use in the clinical treatment and referral of patients [^113rV4qz]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Experts disagree about the optimal classification of upper extremity disorders. To explore whether differential response to treatments offers a basis for choosing between case definitions, we analyzed previously published research.

Methods

We screened 183 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for upper extremity disorders identified from the bibliographies of 10 Cochrane reviews and 4 other systematic reviews, and a search in Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar to June 2010. From these, we selected RCTs that allowed estimates of benefit (expressed as relative risks [RRs]) for > 1 case definition to be compared when other variables (treatment, comparison group, followup time, outcome measure) were effectively held constant. Comparisons of RRs for paired case definitions were summarized by their ratios, with the RR for the simpler and broader definition as the denominator.

Results

Two RCT reports allowed within-trial comparison of RRs and 13 others allowed between-trial comparisons. Together these provided 17 ratios of RRs (5 for shoulder treatments, 12 for elbow treatments, and none for wrist/hand treatments). The median ratio of RRs was 1.0 (range 0.3–1.7, interquartile range 0.6–1.3).

Conclusion

Although the evidence base is limited, our findings suggest that for musculoskeletal disorders of the shoulder and elbow, clinicians in primary care will often do best to apply simpler and broader case definitions. Researchers should routinely publish secondary analyses for subgroups of patients by different diagnostic features at trial entry to expand the evidence base on optimal case definitions for patient management.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^113ivFJn]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Empiric antibiotic management has been criticized as possibly leading to lowered diagnostic accuracy and poor antibiotic stewardship. Eight patients who were initially dismissed from the ED on empiric antibiotics in our study for suspected septic bursitis did not have resolution with empiric antibiotic therapy and underwent a subsequent aspiration. Five of these patients were found to have nonseptic bursitis. These patients as well as some patients who did have resolution after empiric antibiotics may have received antibiotics unnecessarily, placing them at unnecessary risk for antibiotic complications. With increasing antibiotic resistance and complications such as C. difficile colitis, these risks are important to consider when assessing the benefits of empiric antibiotic management.

Among patients who were dismissed home on empiric antibiotic coverage, 33% received MRSA coverage, in contrast to 77% of patients who were admitted to the hospital. This is likely because admitted patients were more systemically ill as demonstrated by higher rates of associated fever, cellulitis, and elevated CRP.

Only three patients in our cohort underwent arthrocentesis to assess for possible concomitant septic arthritis and none had septic arthritis. Rates of concomitant presentations of septic bursitis with septic arthritis have not been described, to our knowledge, likely because the presence of septic arthritis is often an exclusion criterion for studies of bursitis. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there have been no studies evaluating the reliability of physical examination for distinguishing septic bursitis from septic arthritis. However, anecdotally, septic arthritis is typically suspected in the presence of substantial pain throughout range of motion while allowing for discomfort due to tension on the bursa with maximal flexion.

The elbow has been referred to as the unforgiving joint. Arthroscopy for treating elbow arthritis is both challenging and rewarding. Most joints require arthroplasty for treatment of arthritis, but the elbow is amenable to osteocapsular debridement. This is especially beneficial when elbow arthroplasty options have high complication rates and the need for permanent physical limitations. Thus, when treating arthritis, the elbow is more forgiving than once thought.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^1154jqqf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Eighty‐eight percent of ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis treated with empiric outpatient antibiotics without aspiration had resolution without need for subsequent bursal aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery. Eighty‐nine percent of patients admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic management for whom follow‐up was available did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED or after admission and 100% of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution. Our findings suggest that empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration is a reasonable initial approach to ED management of select patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who have adequate access to follow‐up care, are immunocompetent, are able to tolerate oral antibiotics, and are at low risk for antibiotic complications.

### Factors associated with revision surgery for olecranon bursitis after bursectomy [^114yTadv]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The primary aim of our study was to identify the factors associated with revision surgery after bursal excision in patients with olecranon bursitis. The secondary aims were to describe the revision rate after bursectomy and to assess which factors are associated with flap surgery after bursectomy and describe the most common complications after bursectomy of the olecranon bursa.

Methods

We included 191 adult patients with olecranon bursitis who underwent olecranon bursa excision between January 2002 and October 2018. Patients who were pregnant, patients with incomplete records of the primary surgical procedure, and patients who underwent bursectomy during elbow arthroplasty were excluded. After manual chart review, we found that 22 patients had undergone revision surgery. Bivariate analysis was performed to assess the association between revision surgery and patient characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical characteristics. Additionally, we collected data regarding postoperative complications and intraoperative variables such as the use of drains, vacuum assisted closure therapy, and flap surgery.

Results

The overall revision rate in our cohort was 11.5% (22 of 191 patients). Bivariate analysis showed that patients who underwent revision surgery were more frequently women (P = 0.004), more often had a history of ipsilateral (P = 0.020) or contralateral (P = 0.012) olecranon bursitis, and more often received a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (P = 0.001) or diabetes mellitus (P = 0.019). The most common complications were delayed wound healing (n = 8, 4.2%) and osteomyelitis (n = 8, 4.2%). Flap surgery was performed in 5 patients (2.6%). Bivariate analysis showed that patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent flap surgery more frequently (P = 0.011).

Conclusion

The revision rate after bursectomy for olecranon bursitis was 11.5% (22 of 191 patients). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, or a history of ipsilateral and contralateral olecranon bursitis and female patients underwent revision surgery after bursectomy for olecranon bursitis more frequently. In addition, patients with rheumatoid arthritis underwent flap surgery after bursectomy more frequently.

### Spondyloarthritis: a gouty display [^116VmEy2]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Gout is a systemic, metabolic disease that typically affects the peripheral joints. We describe an unusual presentation of gout affecting the facet joints and costovertebral joints in the thoracic and lumbar spine. A 54-year old man presents to the emergency department with increasing swelling and pain at the left elbow for one week and difficulty ambulating. The imaging work-up included plain radiographs of the left elbow, left wrist, and chest with subsequent admission for possible septic arthritis. MRI of the elbow showed olecranon bursitis and an erosion of the lateral epicondyle. CT scan demonstrated lytic cloud-like lesions localized to the facet joints and costovertebral joints of the thoracic and lumbar spine as well as bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. Possible hyperparathyroidism manifestations (including Brown tumors and medullary nephrocalcinosis) were evaluated with plains films of the hands; x-rays instead showed classic gouty arthritis. Our report reviews the disease, epidemiology, classic radiologic findings, and treatment of gout.

Upper Extremity

Shoulder/Elbow

Clinical manifestations of gout in the shoulder and elbow are rare, possibly due to increased solubility of urate in warmer joint compared with the cooler, peripheral joints of the hand and foot. Case reports of gout involving the rotator cuff describe patients with examination findings resembling calcific tendinitis and rotator cuff impingement that were treated surgically with open or arthroscopic subacromial decompression and débridement and found on laboratory analysis to have tophaceous gout. Gouty tophi have also been described in the olecranon bursa and may be treated with surgical excision in cases of severe limitation of function.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^113sGu7w]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We studied the management of ED patients presenting with acute olecranon bursitis and found that among 266 patients included in our study only four (1.5%) underwent bursal aspiration at the time of their initial ED visit. To our knowledge, this represents the largest study of ED patients with olecranon bursitis. Among patients who did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED and were dismissed home on oral antibiotics for suspected septic olecranon bursitis, 88% had an uncomplicated resolution, 7% were subsequently hospitalized, and 6% subsequently underwent bursal aspiration, including two patients with confirmation of septic bursitis and five patients with septic bursitis ruled out. In addition, among patients admitted for suspected septic bursitis, 89% did not undergo bursal aspiration at any point and all of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution on antibiotics. Among patients dismissed without antibiotics, only two patients (3%) required subsequent hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics for a possible, although unconfirmed, septic bursitis. None of the patients in our cohort with confirmed or suspected septic bursitis went on to develop a chronic wound or require operative management. Taken together, these findings suggest that empiric antibiotic administration for suspected septic bursitis without bursal aspiration may be an appropriate first‐line management strategy among select ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who are reliable, understand return precautions, and are at low risk of antibiotic complications and treatment failure.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for lateral elbow tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to heat or ice, APTA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering cryotherapy combined with burst transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain in the short term in patients with symptoms of LET lasting > 30 days.

### Rehabilitation of the painful elbow [^114hjzKL]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Although lateral elbow pain and medial ulnar collateral ligament injury are common musculoskeletal pathologies in overhead athletes, the evidence supporting specific interventions for managing these conditions is scarce. Management of these conditions has been guided mostly by expert opinion rather than empirical evidence, yet the lack of comparative data in the literature has not negatively affected return-to-play rates following surgery. However, an understanding of what is known regarding unimodal and multimodal treatments for lateral elbow pain and medial ulnar collateral ligament injury is needed for clinicians to select evidence-based treatment pathways and highlight what is not known to develop future high-quality investigations.

LIMITATIONS

Our study has several limitations. All patients were included retrospectively and the data quality is dependent on the accuracy of the medical records. To mitigate these limitations, we adhered to standardized guidelines for observational studies and used a data abstraction form that was designed to optimize precision and accuracy of collected variables and minimize random and systematic errors. Abstractors were not blinded to the study objectives. We conducted our study in a single quaternary care ED and most of our visits were covered by medical doctors. Practice patterns and provider distribution may vary at other institutions. Our ED has a robust follow‐up system and a high percentage of patients who have a primary care provider. This is not the case for all EDs. Because most patients did not undergo an aspiration of the bursa, some nonseptic cases could have been included in the cohort of suspected septic bursitis. An additional limitation was the lack of diversity in our patient population, which was predominantly white, limiting generalizability; however, 85% were males with a median age of 57 years, which is similar to prior studies. Finally, 24 patients were lost to follow‐up and therefore outcomes for these patients are unknown.
