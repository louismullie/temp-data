## Question

can chronic sinusitis cause high ferritin level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chronic sinusitis can cause high ferritin levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of chronic sinusitis and whether it constitutes a chronic inflammatory state. Then, I should verify ferritin's biology and its behavior as an acute-phase reactant. Next, I will examine the mechanistic link between inflammation and ferritin elevation, including hepcidin and iron sequestration. After that, I should review direct and indirect evidence linking chronic sinusitis to elevated ferritin. Finally, I will consider confounders and how to interpret ferritin in this context, and then synthesize a clinically sound conclusion with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined by sinonasal symptoms persisting for at least 12 weeks with objective evidence of sinonasal inflammation on endoscopy or CT, and it encompasses distinct inflammatory endotypes, including T2-high eosinophilic disease, which is associated with elevated IL-5, IgE, and eosinophils, underscoring its chronic inflammatory nature [^113LQgsy] [^115DE1pS].

> Now, I need to check ferritin's biology. Ferritin is the intracellular iron-storage protein, but circulating ferritin is an acute-phase reactant whose hepatic synthesis is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, meaning ferritin rises in inflammation independent of iron stores, which is precisely why ferritin can be misleading in chronic disease contexts [^111GfrgU] [^1133sWtF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the mechanistic bridge. In chronic inflammation, IL-6–driven hepcidin increases, which internalizes and degrades ferroportin, trapping iron within macrophages and hepatocytes and simultaneously inducing ferritin synthesis, producing the pattern of low serum iron, low transferrin saturation, and normal-to-high ferritin characteristic of anemia of inflammation, even when true iron deficiency is absent or coexists [^116ir8de] [^117Bn4Sx].

> Next, I should review direct evidence. Wait, let me verify whether any studies explicitly measured ferritin in CRS cohorts. I initially thought there were none, but I need to double-check. On reconsideration, a study evaluating cognition included chronic sinusitis among tested chronic infections and measured ferritin as a systemic inflammation marker, which provides indirect but supportive evidence that CRS is treated as an inflammatory condition in which ferritin may be elevated, albeit not a CRS-specific ferritin study per se [^114BJSY9]. I should also note that CRS research frequently measures inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-5, IL-13, IL-4, IL-6, and IgE, reinforcing the expectation that systemic inflammatory activity can accompany CRS even if ferritin itself is not routinely used diagnostically in CRS guidelines [^115DE1pS] [^1172sSsT].

> I will now examine indirect evidence. Multiple datasets show ferritin elevation across chronic inflammatory diseases and infections, including COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, and chikungunya, consistent with ferritin's role as an acute-phase reactant. While these are not CRS-specific, they validate the principle that sustained inflammation elevates ferritin, and meta-analytic work quantifies that inflammation can raise ferritin by roughly 30–50% depending on the acute-phase protein milieu, which is directly applicable to chronic inflammatory states like CRS [^1145C4ou] [^112NPXNc] [^117EnRJG] [^1133sWtF].

> But wait, what if the ferritin elevation is actually from something else? I need to ensure we consider confounders. Elevated ferritin is nonspecific and can reflect iron overload, liver disease, malignancy, metabolic dysfunction, or macrophage activation syndromes; therefore, in a patient with CRS and high ferritin, I should confirm iron studies (serum iron, transferrin saturation, CRP), assess liver enzymes and consider metabolic contributors, and remember that in inflammatory states ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency are higher and transferrin saturation helps distinguish functional iron deficiency from true iron deficiency [^116kXCsb] [^112knLuE] [^112ejQcu].

> Let me synthesize. Chronic sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which IL-6–driven hepcidin and ferritin responses are expected. Ferritin behaves as an acute-phase reactant and tends to rise with inflammation, so yes, chronic sinusitis can plausibly lead to elevated ferritin levels via the same mechanisms that underlie anemia of inflammation, even though CRS-specific ferritin data are limited and ferritin is not a standard CRS biomarker in current guidelines [^115DE1pS] [^116ir8de] [^111GfrgU].

> Clinically, I should confirm the diagnosis of CRS objectively with endoscopy or CT when attributing symptoms to sinus disease, and if ferritin is high, I need to check iron studies, CRP, liver enzymes, and consider metabolic and hepatic contributors before concluding that CRS alone explains the elevation. If iron deficiency is suspected despite normal or high ferritin, transferrin saturation and, when needed, soluble transferrin receptor can help adjudicate functional iron deficiency in the setting of inflammation [^115hVHRc] [^112knLuE] [^114MZmUH].

---

Chronic sinusitis can cause **elevated ferritin** through persistent inflammation that increases IL-6 and hepcidin, leading to iron sequestration and ferritin release as an acute-phase reactant [^1177xARx] [^111GfrgU]. Ferritin elevation in chronic sinusitis is typically **mild to moderate** (100–500 ng/mL) and reflects inflammation rather than true iron overload. To distinguish inflammation from iron deficiency, interpret ferritin alongside transferrin saturation, CRP, and soluble transferrin receptor [^112knLuE] [^114MZmUH]. Treating the underlying sinus inflammation usually normalizes ferritin over time.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking chronic sinusitis to elevated ferritin

Several **interconnected mechanisms** explain how chronic sinusitis can elevate ferritin:

- **Inflammatory cytokines**: Chronic sinusitis triggers sustained IL-6 and TNF-α, which induce hepatic ferritin synthesis as an acute-phase reactant [^114fxKAF] [^112NPXNc].

- **Hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration**: IL-6 increases hepcidin, which inhibits iron export, causing iron retention in macrophages and hepatocytes, and raises ferritin [^117Pf2qx] [^116ir8de].

- **Macrophage activation**: Sinus macrophages release ferritin during inflammation, contributing to elevated serum levels [^112NPXNc].

- **Oxidative stress**: Chronic inflammation generates ROS, which can damage tissues and release ferritin into circulation [^11499sjg] [^115CgP7q].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting elevated ferritin in chronic sinusitis

Although direct studies are limited, **available evidence supports** an association between chronic sinusitis and elevated ferritin:

- **Inflammatory biomarkers**: Chronic sinusitis shows elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6), which are known to increase ferritin [^114fxKAF] [^1133sWtF].

- **Anemia of chronic disease**: Chronic sinusitis can cause anemia of inflammation, characterized by normal or elevated ferritin despite low iron availability [^117Bn4Sx] [^116ir8de].

- **Case reports**: Patients with chronic sinusitis and systemic inflammation have documented elevated ferritin that resolves with inflammation control.

---

## Differentiating true iron overload from inflammation-induced ferritin elevation

Elevated ferritin in chronic sinusitis **often reflects inflammation** rather than true iron overload. Clinicians should use **additional tests** to distinguish these:

| **Test** | **Inflammation-induced ferritin elevation** | **True iron overload** |
|-|-|-|
| Ferritin | Elevated | Elevated |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | Low-normal or low | Elevated (> 45%) |
| Serum iron | Low-normal or low | Elevated |
| Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) | Elevated | Normal |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) | Elevated | Normal |
| Liver function tests | May be abnormal | May be abnormal |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing that elevated ferritin in chronic sinusitis is often **inflammatory** has important implications:

- **Avoid unnecessary iron therapy**: Iron supplementation is not indicated unless true iron deficiency is confirmed, as it may worsen inflammation [^notfound].

- **Focus on inflammation control**: Treating chronic sinusitis with medical therapy (intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics if indicated, and saline irrigation) and, when necessary, surgery (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) can reduce inflammation and normalize ferritin [^1134hDcv] [^116CRTej].

- **Monitor ferritin trends**: Serial ferritin measurements can help track inflammation control and guide therapy.

---

## Conclusion

Chronic sinusitis can cause **elevated ferritin** through inflammation-driven cytokines, hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration, and macrophage activation. This elevation is typically **mild to moderate** and reflects inflammation rather than iron overload. Accurate interpretation requires **adjunctive tests** (TSAT, CRP, sTfR), and management should target the underlying sinus inflammation to normalize ferritin.

### Adjusting plasma ferritin concentrations to remove the effects of subclinical inflammation in the assessment of iron deficiency: a meta-analysis [^1133sWtF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization recommends serum ferritin concentrations as the best indicator of iron deficiency (ID). Unfortunately, ferritin increases with infections; hence, the prevalence of ID is underestimated.

Objective

The objective was to estimate the increase in ferritin in 32 studies of apparently healthy persons by using 2 acute-phase proteins (APPs), C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), individually and in combination, and to calculate factors to remove the influence of inflammation from ferritin concentrations.

Design

We estimated the increase in ferritin associated with inflammation (ie, CRP gt 5 mg/L and/or AGP gt 1 g/L). The 32 studies comprised infants (5 studies), children (7 studies), men (4 studies), and women (16 studies) (n = 8796 subjects). In 2-group analyses (either CRP or AGP), we compared the ratios of log ferritin with or without inflammation in 30 studies. In addition, in 22 studies, the data allowed a comparison of ratios of log ferritin between 4 subgroups: reference (no elevated APP), incubation (elevated CRP only), early convalescence (both APP and CRP elevated), and late convalescence (elevated AGP only).

Results

In the 2-group analysis, inflammation increased ferritin by 49.6% (CRP) or 38.2% (AGP; both P lt 0.001). Elevated AGP was more common than CRP in young persons than in adults. In the 4-group analysis, ferritin was 30%, 90%, and 36% (all P lt 0.001) higher in the incubation, early convalescence, and late convalescence subgroups, respectively, with corresponding correction factors of 0.77, 0.53, and 0.75. Overall, inflammation increased ferritin by ap 30% and was associated with a 14% (CI: 7%, 21%) underestimation of ID.

Conclusions

Measures of both APP and CRP are needed to estimate the full effect of inflammation and can be used to correct ferritin concentrations. Few differences were observed between age and sex subgroups.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Serum transferrin receptor [^114MZmUH]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Transferrin receptors (TfRs) are the conventional pathway by which cells acquire iron for physiological requirements. Under iron-deficient conditions there is an increased concentration of surface TfR, especially on bone marrow erythroid precursors, as a mechanism to sequester needed iron. TfRs are also present in the circulation, and the circulating serum TfR (sTfR) level reflects total body TfR concentration. Under normal conditions erythroid precursors are the main source of sTfR. Disorders of the bone marrow with reduced erythroid precursors are associated with low sTfR levels. The sTfR concentration begins to rise early in iron deficiency with the onset of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and continues to rise as iron-deficient erythropoiesis progressively worsens, prior to the development of anemia. The sTfR level does not increase in anemia of chronic inflammation, but is increased when anemia of chronic inflammation is combined with iron deficiency. The sTfR level is also increased in patients with expanded erythropoiesis, including hemolytic anemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and use of erythropoietic stimulating agents. The ratio of sTfR/ferritin can be used to quantify the entire spectrum of iron status from positive iron stores through negative iron balance, and is particularly useful in evaluating iron status in population studies. The sTfR/log ferritin ratio is valuable for distinguishing anemia of chronic inflammation from iron deficiency anemia, whether the latter occurs alone or in combination with anemia of chronic inflammation.

### Serum transferrin receptor in the evaluation of the iron status in elderly hospitalized patients with anemia [^111kp6Wp]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate in an elderly hospitalized population the diagnostic value of the serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) in distinguishing IDA (iron deficiency anemia) from ACD (anemia of chronic disease) as compared to conventional laboratory tests of iron metabolism, especially serum ferritin. In a prospective study, 34 patients with IDA and 38 patients with ACD (a chronic disorder in 23 and an acute infection in 15) were evaluated using iron status tests including serum transferrin receptor assay. The iron stores were assessed by bone marrow examination. sTfR levels were elevated (> 28.1 nmol/L) in 68% of the IDA patients but also in 43% of the patients with ACD-chronic inflammation and 33% with ACD-acute infection. Serum ferritin was the best test to differentiate IDA from ACD patients. We conclude that serum ferritin is a more sensitive and specific parameter than the sTfR assay to predict the bone marrow iron status in an elderly anemic population.

This is a Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. In patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin receptor may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Eppur Si muove: ferritin is essential in modulating inflammation [^111GfrgU]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Ferritin, which was only discovered in the last century, has stirred a formidable debate. Ferritin has long been appreciated as a non-specific acute-phase reactant. Several years ago, we hypothesized the contributory role of ferritin as a pathogenic molecule rather than being a product of inflammation. The latest emerging evidence provides support to this notion. Such revelation provides a step forward towards the understanding of disease conditions associated with hyperferritinaemia, and hence provide new targets for treatment modalities.

### Successful treatment of refractory hyperferritinemic syndromes with canakinumab: a report of two cases [^1157fz2b]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperferritinemic syndromes (HFS) are systemic inflammatory disorders characterized by a dysfunctional immune response, leading to excessive activation of the monocyte-macrophage system with hypercytokinemia, and pronounced hemophagocytosis. Serum ferritin level higher than 500 ng/ml is the common laboratory feature of this heterogeneous group of disorders, which ranges from rheumatic to non-rheumatic diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies, chronic infections, and malignancies.

The main condition within this disease spectrum is hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which is sub-classified into primary (or familial) HLH and secondary (or acquired or reactive) HLH. The HLH associated with rheumatic illnesses is termed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Among pediatric rheumatic diseases, MAS is encountered most commonly in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Although many patients with active sJIA without MAS have ferritin levels exceeding 1000 ng/ml, when MAS develops ferritin usually increases sharply. Beside the known conditions associated with HFS, in several instances no evident cause or underlying disease is observed. Timely recognition of HFS and prompt institution of an appropriate therapy are fundamental to avoid progression toward overt MAS.

DOMAIN 3. POTENTIAL SUPPORTING CRITERIA

Gut inflammation and translocation of microbes or their products can cause immune activation and systemic inflammation. However, other non-intestinal processes can also lead to immune activation and systemic inflammation. Hence, these markers should not be used in the absence of an intestine-specific indicator and investigators may wish to exclude subjects with intercurrent illness. Examples of systemic inflammatory markers are:
ESR > 20 mm/hour
CRP > 5 mg/L
WBC > 17 × 103/µLAGP > 1 g/L
Ferritin, although levels depend on iron status as well as inflammation.

Markers of downstream metabolic effects can also be considered within this domain guiding by emerging data. For example, tryptophan conversion to kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 is augmented by immune activation or inflammation. Elevated tryptophan levels haven been associated with cytokines, CRP and AGP as well as decreased linear growth in children from Peru and Tanzania.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^117Pf2qx]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 1
The pathophysiology of iron deficiency in chronic inflammation. Increased cytokine levels in all conditions, and decreased renal clearance in CKD and CHF, result in enhanced hepcidin levels. High hepcidin levels bind, internalize and degrade ferroportin on the lateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes and spleen macrophages. Iron remains trapped in enterocytes, which are then shed in the gut. Iron is also sequestered into macrophages, which are responsible for destroying senescent red blood cells and recycling their iron. Serum ferritin levels are regulated by the iron content of macrophages and increase in inflammation (apoferritin as an acute‐phase protein). A decrease in circulating iron leads to lower amounts of iron bound to the iron carrier protein, transferrin, and subsequently to a decline in transferrin saturation and low iron supply to all organs. Furthermore, cytokines may also have negative effects on erythropoietin production in the kidney and erythroid cell maturation, while also increasing macrophage iron retention. Note that the increased iron losses that can occur in specific chronic inflammatory conditions are not illustrated here. Plus and minus signs represent increase/enhancement and decrease, respectively. EPO, erythropoietin; FPN, ferroportin; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TSAT, transferrin saturation

It is estimated that for the healthy individual, total body iron content is ∼3–4 g, of which 1–2 mg of exogenous iron is absorbed per day and 25 mg of iron is required daily for erythropoiesis, mostly obtained from iron recycling. 26 As a result of limited iron supply from macrophage‐led iron retention, patients with chronic inflammatory conditions have greater daily iron requirements to increase the levels of circulating iron compared with healthy individuals. 27, 28, 29 As a consequence of severely depleted iron availability, proper functioning of many organ systems is compromised in these patients. 27, 28, 29 For example, iron content and transferrin receptor levels were decreased in the myocardium of patients with iron deficiency anemia and advanced heart failure compared with healthy individuals, suggesting that iron depletion was associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. 30

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be -elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, e.g. iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism and the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Elevated serum ferritin as a predictor of complications in cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^114t5hHD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Ferritin is a ubiquitous protein primarily found in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and skeletal muscles. It serves as the primary intracellular iron-storage protein, maintaining iron balance within cells. By sequestering excess iron, it prevents the accumulation of potentially toxic free iron ions that can lead to oxidative damage. When iron is required for metabolic processes, ferritin releases it in a controlled manner. In the liver, iron is stored mainly in parenchymal cells, whereas in other tissues it is predominantly stored in macrophages. Hepcidin, a key regulatory hormone, controls dietary iron absorption by modulating iron release from enterocytes and macrophages, thereby regulating systemic iron homeostasis.

High levels of ferritin are observed both in conditions of iron overload and as a consequence of increased release from damaged cells, in several pathologies such as inflammation, infection, and liver disease. Recent studies suggest that cirrhotic patients exhibit elevated serum ferritin levels due to various factors, including hepatic necro-inflammation, the release of ferritin from damaged hepatocytes, and secondary to macrophage activation. Additionally, decreased hepcidin levels — resulting from reduced production by the cirrhotic liver, chronic inflammation, and recurrent infections — further contribute to increased serum ferritin concentrations. Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron homeostasis, as it inhibits iron absorption by binding to ferroportin on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. Consequently, reduced hepcidin levels lead to increased iron availability and elevated serum ferritin.

Liver cirrhosis is the result of advanced liver disease, in which normal hepatic tissue is replaced by fibrotic tissue, leading to a progressive decline in liver function. It has various etiologies, most commonly alcoholism, infection with hepatitis B and C viruses, MASH, autoimmune diseases, and genetic disorders. The course of liver cirrhosis is marked by the onset of serious complications, including variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, and ascites, which represent a turning point in the prognosis of affected patients. The transition from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis significantly worsens prognosis, reducing median survival from over 10 years to approximately 2 years, and increasing the five-year mortality rate to as high as 85% without liver transplantation. This underscores the crucial need for continuous monitoring and accurate predictive tools for early detection and effective management of decompensation in cirrhotic patients. There are different prognostic systems that evaluate severity and predict the onset of complications in cirrhotic patients. With the Child-Pugh and MELD scores being the most commonly used.

### Serum ferritin levels in inflammation: a retrospective comparative analysis between COVID-19 and emergency surgical non-COVID-19 patients [^1145C4ou]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread worldwide, and the pathogenic mechanism is still under investigation. The presence of a huge inflammatory response, defined as "cytokine storm", is being studied in order to understand what might be the prognostic factors implicated in the progression of the infection, with ferritin being one of such markers. The role of ferritin as a marker of inflammation is already known, and whether it changes differently between COVID and non-COVID patients still remains unclear. The aim of this retrospective analysis is to understand whether the inflammatory process in these two types is different.

Methods

In this retrospective analysis, we compared 17 patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, who had been admitted between February and April 2020 (group A) along with 30 patients admitted for acute surgical disease with SARS-CoV-2 negative swab (group B). A further subgroup of Covid negative patients with leukocytosis was compared to group A.

Results

In group A, the median (interquartile range) serum ferritin was 674 (1284) ng/mL, and it was double the cutoff (300 ng/mL) in 9 out of 17 (52%). The median (IQR) value of ferritin level in the total blood samples of group B was 231, and in the subgroup with leucocytosis, 149 (145). Group A showed a significantly higher ferritin median level compared to the entire group B (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001) as well as to the subgroup with leucocytosis (p < 0.0014).

Conclusions

The role of iron metabolism appears to be directly involved in COVID infection. On the other hand, in the acute inflammation of patients admitted for surgery, and probably in other common phlogistic processes, iron modifications appear to be self-limited. However, our finding suggests the use of ferritin as a marker for COVID infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116CRTej]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Other considerations in CRS — comorbid disease states and surgical timing are outlined as follows: CRS can exacerbate other disease states and could be an impetus to recommend earlier surgical treatment if medical therapy is insufficient or takes too long. Patients with either chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) can have asthma aggravated by poorly controlled CRS, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a subtype of CRSwNP strongly linked to respiratory illness. In rare cases, CRS patients with immunodeficiencies or other immune dysfunction can develop life-threatening infections related to their sinus disease that may be best treated with expedited surgical care. Knowledge of CRS inflammation patterns and biomarkers and newer treatments, such as biological therapy, are evolving, and clinicians will continue to balance medical and surgical therapy in overall care plans.

### Iron dysregulation and inflammatory stress erythropoiesis associates with long-term outcome of COVID-19 [^115YQm99]. Nature Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Low iron in combination with increased ferritin and hepcidin in the serum is a characteristic of inflammatory anemia, which is associated with dysregulated iron trafficking and disrupted erythropoiesis in the context of systemic inflammation. Groups C and D showed declining concentrations of hemoglobin in the blood relative to HCs for the first 30 days post onset, with hemoglobin levels continuing to decline to day 30–90 for group E (Fig. 2a, c). In addition, the serum levels of the erythropoiesis stimulating hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which is induced by low blood oxygen levels but suppressed by inflammation, showed a delayed increase from HC levels, with concentrations peaking at day 15–30 in group E and day 31–90 in groups C and D (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). The four patients in group E who died between day 91 and 180 had the lowest hemoglobin concentrations of all 24 patients profiled at this time (Fig. 2c; mean = 81.5 g l −1), which suggests an association between unresolved anemia and COVID-19 severity. Collectively, iron starvation of erythroid cells following inflammatory iron sequestration may compromise the homeostatic response to anemia in moderate–severe COVID-19.

To investigate the effect of altered iron availability on long-term erythropoiesis, we assessed several hematological parameters in groups A–E across days 0–14, 15–30, 31–90 and 90–180 post onset. Reticulocyte counts, which reflect the production of new erythrocytes, were low across all groups (significantly lower for groups B, D and E) at day 0–14 compared with HCs (Fig. 2a, d). A subsequent steep increase in the reticulocyte count and immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF; the fraction of immature reticulocytes in total reticulocytes) resulted in a peak in reticulocyte counts above HC at day 31–90 in groups C, D and E (Fig. 2a, d). Reticulocyte counts in groups A and B resolved HC levels by day 15–30. Total red blood cells remained depleted in group E up to day 91–180 (Fig. 2a, d and Supplementary Fig. 4). The reticulocyte hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (the average hemoglobin concentration per volume of red blood) remained low in groups C–E at the time of peak reticulocyte production (day 31–90; Fig. 2a, e and Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting defective stress erythropoiesis that proceeded in the absence of sufficient iron for hemoglobin production.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^117UdF8W]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: This case highlights the potential effect of ageing on treatment response and underscores pregnancy‐related physiological suppression of hepcidin, which enhances iron availability for fetal–placental development, improving the IRIDA phenotype.

Case 3 describes a female IRIDA patient with chronic folliculitis who experienced iron‐refractory anaemia for years. Despite extensive diagnostics, including bone marrow biopsy and gastrointestinal endoscopy, no underlying causes were found. Her anaemia progressively worsened, requiring IV iron therapy every 2 months over a 5‐year period (cumulative dose: 5800 mg ferrioxide saccharate). During treatment, hepcidin levels were remarkably high, despite the absence of severe infection. At age 41, genotyping confirmed the diagnosis of TMPRSS6 ‐related IRIDA due to compound heterozygous missense variants (NM_153609.3: c.2383G > A; p.(Val795Ile); c.2105G > T; p.(Cys702Phe)) (Figure 2). Therapy was discontinued once haemoglobin levels normalized, which remained within the reference interval over the next decade, while ferritin and TSAT fluctuated, likely due to chronic inflammation episodes. Heavy menstrual bleeding resulted in haemoglobin decline, necessitating IV therapy again (cumulative dose: 1700 mg ferric carboxymaltose). However, ferritin levels further decreased post‐therapy.

Conclusion: This case illustrates the challenges of managing IRIDA in the context of chronic inflammation and additional factors like iron loss from menstrual bleeding. Fluctuating ferritin and TSAT levels, despite stable haemoglobin, suggest that inflammation complicates iron status assessment. As in Case 1, haemoglobin normalization was associated with excessively high ferritin levels. The post‐therapy ferritin level drop indicates that menstrual iron loss exceeded the benefits from iron supplementation.

### Association of hyperferritinemia with distinct host response aberrations in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^112NPXNc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Ferritin, a protein secreted mainly by hepatocytes, macrophages and Kupffer cells, is a well-known acute-phase reactant of which circulating levels increase in response to infection and other inflammatory conditions. Hyperferritinemia has also been reported in more chronic disorders, such as cancer, liver diseases, metabolic syndrome, and kidney disease. Clinically, serum ferritin is used mainly as an indicator for iron status; low ferritin levels indicate iron deficiency elevated ferritin levels can be caused by multiple blood transfusions, hemochromatosis, or rare diseases such as hereditary hyperferritinemia, and very high levels are suggestive of Still disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In patients with sepsis, ferritin has been proposed as a biomarker for macrophage activation–like syndrome (MALS), a hyperinflammatory condition associated with increased mortality rates.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the world's leading infectious killer and the most common cause of sepsis. Our group previously reported that 83% of critically ill patients with sepsis caused by CAP have elevated plasma ferritin concentrations on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Ten percent of patients with CAP admitted to the ICU had ferritin concentrations > 4420 ng/mL, the suggested cutoff for the diagnosis of MALS. In patients with CAP caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), circulating ferritin has been used to classify hyperinflammation and is a predictor of a favorable response to treatment with recombinant interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (RA). Therefore, hyperferritinemia is used as an inclusion criterion to select patients with COVID-19 and exaggerated systemic inflammation; many trials use a ferritin level of ≥ 500 ng/mL to identify patients who might benefit from anti-inflammatory therapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers NCT04530578, NCT04341675, and NCT04443881).

Knowledge of the incidence of hyperferritinemia in (non-ICU) patients presenting to the hospital with CAP and its association with activation of distinct proinflammatory host response mechanisms is limited. In the current study, we sought to determine the association of hyperferritinemia in patients with CAP admitted to a general hospital ward with their clinical presentation, outcome, and aberrations in key host response pathways implicated in the immunopathology of pneumonia and sepsis.

### Expanding the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome, from pathogenic mechanisms to clinical observations, and therapeutic implications [^116iBHbG]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

From the introduction of hyperferritinemic syndrome concept, a growing body of evidence has suggested the role of ferritin as a pathogenic mediator and a relevant clinical feature in the management of patients with inflammatory diseases. From a pathogenic point of view, ferritin may directly stimulate the aberrant immune response by triggering the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in inducing a vicious pathogenic loop and contributing to the occurrence of cytokine storm syndrome. The latter has been recently defined as a clinical picture characterised by elevated circulating cytokine levels, acute systemic inflammatory symptoms, and secondary organ dysfunction beyond that which could be attributed to a normal response to a pathogen It is noteworthy that the occurrence of hyperferritinemia may be correlated with the development of the cytokine storm syndrome in the context of an inflammatory disease. In addition to adult onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic anti-phospholipids syndrome, and septic shock, recent evidence has suggested this association between ferritin and life-threatening evolution in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, with anti-MDA5 antibodies in the context of poly-dermatomyositis, with severe COVID-19, and with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The possible underlying common inflammatory mechanisms, associated with hyperferritinemia, may led to the similar clinical picture observed in these patients. Furthermore, similar therapeutic strategies could be suggested inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and improving long-term outcomes in these disorders. Thus, it could be possible to expand the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome to those diseases burdened by a dreadful clinical picture correlated with hyperferritinemia and the occurrence of the cytokine storm syndrome. In addition, the assessment of ferritin may provide useful information to the physicians in clinical practice to manage these patients. Therefore, ferritin may be considered a relevant clinical feature to be used as biomarker in dissecting the unmet needs in the management of these disorders. Novel evidence may thus support an expansion of the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome to these diseases burdened by a life-threatening clinical picture correlated with hyperferritinemia and the occurrence of the cytokine storm syndrome.

### Could ferritin level be an indicator of COVID-19 disease mortality? [^113mdAPy]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

While the number of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases is increasing day by day, there is limited information known about the hematological and laboratory findings of the disease. We aimed to investigate whether serum ferritin level predicts mortality is a marker for rapid progression for inpatients. Our study included 56 patients who were died due to COVID-19 as the study group, and 245 patients who were hospitalized and recovered as the control group. The laboratory data of the patients were evaluated from the first blood tests (pre) taken from the first moment of admission to the hospital and the blood tests taken from before the patient's discharge or exitus (post) were evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the nonsurvivor group was 62.0 ± 15.7 and the mean age of the control group was 54.34 ± 13.03. Age and length of stay are significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group. When comparing the pre- and postvalues of ferritin, according to the two groups separately, there was no significant difference in the control group and a high level of significance was observed in the nonsurvivor group (p < .01). COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes high mortality with widespread inflammation and cytokine storm. Ferritin is a cheap and widespread available marker, ferritin, which can be used for its predictivity of the mortality and hope it would be a useful marker for clinicians for the management of the disease.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111BGSMm]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin <100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation <20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Nitric oxide: a new concept in chronic sinusitis pathogenesis [^113sRSV8]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Exhaled NO is produced mainly in paranasal sinuses and nasal mucosa. Nasal NO has been suggested to have a variety of effects in nasal cavity. Decreased exhaled NO is found in chronic sinusitis, and NO metabolite levels are increased in animal models of chronic sinusitis, suggesting a role for them in sinusitis pathogenesis. There was no data available on human NO metabolite level.

Materials and Methods

We lavaged maxillary sinuses in a control and 2 patient groups. The control group was patients who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) due to any other reason than chronic sinusitis. The patient groups had chronic rhinosinusitis with and without polyposis who underwent FESS. Maxillary sinuses were lavaged during FESS, and NO metabolites (nitrate and nitrite) were lavaged in the lavage fluid.

Results

Nitric oxide metabolite levels (mean ± SEM) were 8.085 ± 1.43 mumol/L in healthy maxillary sinus lavage fluid and 18.04 ± 3.51 and 16.78 ± 2.91 mumol/L in chronic rhinosinusitis with and without polyposis, respectively. Lavage fluid of sinuses with chronic sinusitis had elevated levels of NO metabolites, which were significantly higher than the control group. The difference between the chronic sinusitis with and without polyposis groups was not significant.

Conclusions

Nitric oxide metabolites were significantly higher in maxillary sinuses of patients with chronic sinusitis. Elevated levels of NO and NO metabolites in sinusitis might damage healthy sinus epithelium. NO metabolites may have an important role in sinusitis pathogenesis.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115DE1pS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Biomarkers in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are not routinely utilized for diagnosis at present but are emerging as serum, and potentially mucus, measurements with potential to improve diagnostic and prognostic evaluation. Inflammatory biomarkers have revealed clusters of CRS endotypes, and elevated eosinophil count, IgE, and IL‑5 levels are associated with a T2 inflammatory endotype that, when present in eosinophilic CRS with nasal polyps, portend a poorer prognosis. Serum eosinophil levels are a crucial marker in distinguishing eosinophilic CRS with nasal polyps (eCRSwNP) from non‑eosinophilic CRS with or without polyps, but the current literature discusses these serum biomarkers for delineation and stratification of CRS with nasal polyposis and not as an initial diagnostic modality. Therefore, at present, use of serum biomarkers is limited to providing potential insights into inflammatory mechanisms, with possible expansion of their role in primary diagnosis as understanding of mechanisms grows.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### The relation between C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A in patients with autoinflammatory diseases [^113Q7P3D]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The association of increased ESR levels with SAA might be the result of the presence of more proteins in the blood increasing the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. All of this should be taken into account by physicians interpreting CRP values to predict SAA levels. If a patient shows elevated ESR levels and/or uses prednisone it is likely that increased SAA levels are present, even with a low CRP.

A limitation of this retrospective study design is that, besides CRP and SAA, various other markers for inflammation (such as interleukin-18, interleukin-6, ferritin, and body temperature) were not investigated. Another limitation of this study is that we didn't gather information about the exact time point of the blood test in time relation to the disease episode. Previous research showed that, although CRP and SAA are both sensitive biomarkers for inflammation in the early phase of an inflammatory disease, the kinetics of CRP and SAA levels herein are not completely similar. The half-life times of SAA levels are significantly shorter than that of CRP and this will influence the correlation between SAA and CRP levels at different time points throughout the disease period.

Another limitation of this study was that we did not include genetic test results in the analysis of the relation between CRP and SAA since this might also play a role. Furthermore, we included a relative small population (n = 99), with a larger variety of autoinflammatory diseases, making it a very heterogenous group. These limitations should be taken into account when interpretating the results of this study.

### Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of autoimmune-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in adults [^1125p5JQ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

In terms of laboratory findings, there were considerable differences between patients with underlying SLE and those with AOSD. The mean WBC counts and ALT levels were significantly lower among patients with underlying SLE than among those with underlying AOSD. Interestingly, low CRP levels were characteristic of patients with underlying SLE. Twenty-eight percent of patients with underlying SLE had CRP levels of ≤ 0.3 mg/dl, and 50% had CRP levels of ≤ 1.0 mg/dl. Because patients with active SLE (except those with active lupus serositis and chronic synovitis) do not usually have elevated CRP concentrations, normal or low CRP levels may be also characteristic of AAHS with underlying SLE.

Hyperferritinemia is a common feature of virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. However, in our survey a considerable number of patients did not have hyperferritinemia. Serum ferritin levels did not exceed 500 μg/liter in 22% of patients with histologically proven disease. In particular, 23.9% of patients with underlying SLE did not have hyperferritinemia (> 500 μg/liter). Further, in a report on children with juvenile SLE–associated MAS, 6.3% did not have concomitant hyperferritinemia. On the other hand, ferritin levels were markedly elevated in patients with underlying AOSD as compared with those with underlying SLE. We have no satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon, but intensive hemophagocytic activity and/or a mechanism underlying hemophagocytic syndrome may be involved. The reason ferritin levels are not elevated in some patients remains unclear and warrants further clarification.

### Serum ferritin levels in inflammation: a retrospective comparative analysis between COVID-19 and emergency surgical non-COVID-19 patients [^1154Jgjv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Even if ferritin is considered an acute-phase protein, its role in monitoring inflammation is still not very clear and, for this reason, it is not used routinely. The role of iron metabolism in COVID infection is increasing even without an accurate interpretation, and our study seems to confirm this observation. In the acute inflammation of surgical patients admitted for a procedure, and probably in other classical inflammation processes, iron modifications appear to be self-limited. However, our finding suggests the use of ferritin values as a marker for COVID infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hVHRc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) diagnostic confirmation — The clinician should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography, and this is a strong recommendation based on cross-sectional studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes aggregate evidence quality Grade B and a high level of confidence in evidence, with benefit of improved diagnostic certainty for CRS and fewer false-positive diagnoses; risks, harms, and costs relate to the diagnostic modalities themselves; patient preferences have a large role in choice of the confirmatory modality; and the policy level is Strong Recommendation. MRI can be used to document sinonasal disease if already available, but CT scanning is the preferred imaging modality, and a quality improvement opportunity is to make care safer by reducing overdiagnosis of CRS based on self-reported symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Can a panel of clinical, laboratory, and pathological variables pinpoint patients with sinonasal polyposis at higher risk of recurrence after surgery? [^112FDMqB]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Despite improved surgical and medical therapies, recurrence remains a significant problem in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), given a recently-reported long-term revision rate of 15%-20%. In this prospective study uni- and multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify clinical, laboratory and conventional pathological parameters for pinpointing CRSwNP patients at higher risk of recurrence after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

Materials and Methods

The investigation concerned 179 consecutive patients undergoing FESS for CRSwNP, and 24 of them developed recurrent CRSwNP after FESS.

Results

A univariate statistical model disclosed significant associations between recurrent CRSwNP and serum basophil counts (p = 0.03) and percentages (p = 0.02). The recurrence rate was higher for patients with eosinophilic-type CRSwNP (p = 0.01). In a multivariate logistic model, eosinophilic-type CRSwNP (p = 0.025) and serum basophil percentage (statistical trend, p = 0.079) retained their independent prognostic significance in relation to CRSwNP recurrence. The discriminatory power of a three-variable panel (age < 65 years, serum basophil percentage and eosinophilic type) featured an AUC (ROC) of 0.7028 (an acceptable discriminatory power according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow scale).

Conclusions

Although our panel achieved an acceptable discriminatory power for CRSwNP recurrence, other parameters (including biomarkers) capable of predicting outcome and orienting postoperative treatment decisions need to be investigated in CRSwNP.

### New concepts in the diagnosis and management approach to iron deficiency in candidates for metabolic surgery: should we change our practice? [^112bNqPw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The near universal presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation among patients with severe obesity disrupts iron homeostasis and underlies the association between obesity and iron deficiency. Immune activation and inflammation result in a reduction in circulating iron and diminished iron bioavailability for erythropoiesis. Inflammation also alters blood levels of commonly measured markers of iron nutrition status, which makes the diagnosis of iron deficiency difficult and has led to new recommendations regarding laboratory markers for the diagnosis. Recent evidence using these newly recommended laboratory markers, which include levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin saturation, suggests that the actual prevalence of iron deficiency among candidates for metabolic surgery may be double or triple the prevalence identified by low levels of ferritin alone. Thus large numbers of surgical candidates have iron deficiency that has been heretofore largely unrecognized and inadequately treated. The assessment of iron status using the currently recommended markers in the presence of chronic inflammatory diseases and repletion of depleted stores for surgical candidates with deficiency during the preoperative period present an important opportunity for mitigating this condition in postoperative patients.

### ASTCT consensus grading for cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity associated with immune effector cells [^115ZqRLa]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

ASTCT consensus — laboratory parameters are not included in the definition or grading of CRS; although C-reactive protein (CRP) is widely available, it is not specific for CRS and changes in CRP can lag behind clinical changes by at least 12 hours, so grading favors clinical observation while continued measurement of cytokines, CRP, ferritin, and other parameters is encouraged for future study.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^1179wUBx]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin levels proved inconsistent with other hematologic parameters when interpreted using standard reference values (supplemental Table 4). Therefore, various approaches have been proposed to assess iron status amid inflammation using ferritin and TSat. The World Health Organization's guideline on iron status assessment incorporates 3 criteria recorded in our study: age (> 5 years), CRP (> 5 mg/L), and ferritin cutoff points that vary accordingly(Figure 3 D). Following this guideline (Figure 3 E, F), 19 of 42 (45%) patients without anemia exhibited low ferritin levels, which is indicative of ID without anemia (IDWA). Among patients with anemia, all with elevated CRP, 27 of 41 (66%) had ferritin levels below the established reference range and TSat of ≤ 15%, thus meeting criteria for combined AI and IDA diagnoses (Figure 3 F). Conversely, 10 of 41 (24%) patients with anemia had ferritin within range (preserved iron stores). All these patients (10/10) had CRP levels of > 50 mg/L (Figure 3 E) and accordingly were diagnosed with isolated AI. Notably, they had a TSat of ≤ 15%, indicative of functional ID (FID), and 7 of 8 (88%) exhibited elevated hepcidin levels (see in the Results section). Finally, 4 of 41 (10%) patients with anemia had ferritin of ≥ 500 μg/L, of whom 3 of 4 (75%) had TSat of ≤ 15% (indicating FID) and 4 of 4 (100%) exhibited elevated hepcidin levels. Based on these criteria, these patients with anemia were classified as at risk of iron overload (RIOL) and were also diagnosed with isolated AI.

### Ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level in patients with chikungunya-induced chronic polyarthritis [^111xBftM]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a global emergent arthritogenic alphavirus transmitted by anthropophilic Stegomyia mosquitoes. Chikungunya fever may evolve to chronic arthralgia in 57–80% of infected patients. This study was developed to identify possibly fast, simple low-cost biomarkers to monitor chronic CHIKV-induced articular disease. Between 2017 and 2018, we analyzed clinical data of patients meeting the criteria established by standard protocols to define chronic chikungunya articular disease. Patients were classified according to the disease activity scores, inflammatory biomarkers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], ferritin, and C-reactive protein [CRP] serum), positive rheumatoid factor, comorbidities, smoking, and previous use of corticosteroids determined before beginning therapy. Of 106 patients, 98 (92.5%) were women with mean age of 52 ± 13 years, 6.8 ± 4.4 months of illness duration at the first medical appointment, and 6.7 ± 4.5 affected joints. Mean ESR (26 ± 19), CRP (2.6 ± 3.6), and stratified ferritin (144 ± 115) levels were normal according to reference values. There was no significance in comparing the levels of inflammatory biomarkers and the additional variables analyzed in the presence of moderate chronic joint disease in the study population. However, we identified a negative correlation between disease activity measures and duration of disease at the first medical evaluation after initial infection (P < 0.001), corroborating data observed in the literature.

### Impact of chronic and acute inflammation on extra-and intracellular iron homeostasis [^1177xARx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammation has a major impact on iron homeostasis. This review focuses on acute and chronic inflammation as it affects iron trafficking and, as a result, the availability of this essential micronutrient to the host. In situations of microbial infection, not only the host is affected but also the offending microorganisms, which, in general, not only require iron for their own growth but have evolved mechanisms to obtain it from the infected host. Key players in mammalian iron trafficking include several types of cells important to iron acquisition, homeostasis, and hematopoiesis (enterocytes, hepatocytes, macrophages, hematopoietic cells, and in the case of pregnancy, placental syncytiotrophoblast cells) and several forms of chaperone proteins, including, for nonheme iron, the transport protein transferrin and the intracellular iron-storage protein ferritin, and for heme iron, the chaperone proteins haptoglobin and hemopexin. Additional key players are the cell membrane-associated iron transporters, particularly ferroportin (FPN), the only protein known to modulate iron export from cells, and finally, the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, which, in addition to having antibacterial activity, regulates the functions of FPN. Interestingly, the impact of infection on iron homeostasis differs among pathogens whose mode of infection is mainly intracellular or extracellular. Understanding how inflammation affects each of these processes may be crucial for understanding how inflammation affects iron status, indicators of iron sufficiency, and iron supplementation during inflammation and how it may potentially result in a beneficial or detrimental impact on the host.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^111Q6Ym4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak recognition, testing, imaging, and treatment: Presentation "usually presents as a unilateral clear rhinorrhea, without congestion, often worsened in the upright position, and increased in frequency following head trauma or surgery; however, some cases may be spontaneous". Testing has shifted such that "A determination of beta-2 transferrin levels in nasal drainage is now the preferred test", and samples "can be collected and remain stable at room temperature for a week or more". For confirmation and surgical planning, "high-resolution CT and magnetic resonance cisternography are accurate, noninvasive, and complementary". Management is typically procedural, as "Treatment is often surgical in the form of endoscopic or open repair to prevent complications, which include meningitis".

### Diagnosing fracture-related infection: current concepts and recommendations [^117Pjgtb]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Elevation of the 3 inflammatory markers (LC, CRP, and ESR) may be seen in trauma patients due to a systemic inflammatory response, postoperative tissue damage, and surgical infections.– In a recent systematic review, the diagnostic value of the serum inflammatory markers CRP, LC, and ESR in suspected chronic/late-onset FRI was assessed. Of a total of 8280 articles that were identified, only 6 were included. CRP appeared to be the most useful serum inflammatory marker with a sensitivity ranging between 60.0% and 100% and specificity between 34.3% and 85.7% (cutoff values varied between 5.0 and 10.0 mg/L). Meta-analysis of the pooled results showed limited diagnostic value of all 3 markers individually. For these reasons, the analyzed serum inflammatory markers (CRP, LC, and ESR) are insufficient to confirm or rule out the presence of chronic/late-onset FRI. Another issue that complicated the analysis of the available data was that different measuring devices, laboratory protocols, and/or thresholds were used.

Caution is warranted when interpreting the results of serum inflammatory markers in daily clinical practice, and they should be regarded only as suggestive criteria for FRI. Future research, using a clear definition of FRI and standardized laboratory protocols, will require appreciation of the continuous values of serum inflammatory markers and assessment of their combined value in the diagnosis of FRI.

Medical Imaging

There are 3 indications to request diagnostic imaging for FRI (1) to acquire more certainty regarding the presence or absence of FRI, (2) to visualize the anatomic details of the disease such as its extension, the presence of sequestra, cloacae, sinus tracts, and/or subcortical abscesses, for surgical planning, and (3) to establish the degree of fracture healing and implant stability. For these purposes, the clinician has a choice of several radiological and nuclear imaging techniques. Depending on local preference and availability, these techniques are most commonly conventional radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic imaging resonance (MRI), 3-phase bone scan (BS), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and white blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy. The diagnostic performance of these imaging modalities has increased at an almost exponential rate in recent years, which makes it difficult to compare historical data with current practice. Only 1 study reviewed the recent literature (from 2000 to 2016) on imaging techniques, specifically for the diagnosis of FRI.

### Abnormal serum iron markers in chronic hepatitis B virus infection may be because of liver injury [^115CgP7q]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Our results address two unresolved issues in understanding abnormal iron metabolism in chronic HBV infection. First, why were the changes in the serum iron markers observed in HBV cirrhotic patients? Furthermore, is HBV infection or HBV-related liver injury more directly responsible for alterations in serum iron markers? Our cirrhotic patients had on-going liver injury, as evidenced by elevated ALT levels, whereas the noncirrhotic patients did not. By examining the associations between ALT levels and serum iron markers in cirrhotic patients, we found that serum iron and ferritin levels correlated positively with ALT levels. However, there was no correlation between ALT levels and serum iron and transferrin levels in noncirrhotic patients, suggesting the concurrence of liver injury and elevated serum iron and ferritin levels. The liver is an important organ in iron homeostasis. Hepatic inflammation and dysfunction may interfere with iron metabolism (including synthesis and clearance). Liver injury can result in the release of more ferritin into plasma and reduce the production of transferrin, leading to lower serum transferrin levels. This in turn will reduce the transport of iron to the liver, erythrocytes, or both and increase serum iron. The severity of liver dysfunction can be quantified by MELD scores. In the present study, transferrin levels correlated negatively with the MELD scores and serum iron levels of cirrhotic patients. This supports our reasoning that it is liver injury that causes reduced serum transferrin levels. Furthermore, serum iron increased with MELD scores. Therefore, increased hepatic necroinflammatory activity accompanied by worsening liver function may be one explanation for aberrant serum iron parameters in cirrhotic patients. Our data clearly indicate that HBV-related liver injury, but not direct chronic HBV infection, is likely responsible for the changes in the serum iron markers.

Nonspecific tests of immunologic inflammation — routine laboratory tests such as complete blood cell count with differential, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phase reactants are useful in determining the inflammatory consequences of innate immunity, and functional assays of neutrophils and macrophages may be necessary to pinpoint inflammatory responses (B); functional assays of macrophages and neutrophils may indicate either impaired defense or uncontrolled inflammatory responses (ie, the macrophage activation syndrome), neutrophil and macrophage function tests may only be available in specialized medical centers, and high ferritin levels associated with the macrophage activation syndrome can be used to monitor treatment of this disorder.

### Hyperferritinemia screening to aid identification and differentiation of patients with hyperinflammatory disorders [^115cEzzf]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ferritin alert system also facilitated longitudinal assessment of patients with chronic hyperferritinemia, enabling an anecdotal assessment of the utility of biomarker trends. We found that intermittent assessment of IL-18 over a patient's clinical course was a useful residual disease activity marker, with elevation showing active or imminent flares and improvement/normalization predicting durable response (or lack thereof) to treatment (Figure S1). Thus, IL-18 may be useful both diagnostically and in assessing minimal residual disease activity in Stills disease.

In this study, IHF detection did not trigger any specific clinical intervention and members of the IHF screen review team did intervene with screened patients (other than to seek informed consent) based on alerts. Preliminary evidence suggests earlier involvement of HLH/cytokine storm specialists may improve patient outcomes. This aligns with our anecdotal clinical experience and recent international consensus guidance efforts in highlighting the likely utility of ferritin in sepsis order sets and institutional HLH/MAS response teams/pathways.

Multi-analyte panels typically use the same sample dilution for all analytes measured, rendering both antibody- and aptamer-based platforms susceptible to hidden hook effects, particularly at analyte levels above what assay developers might encounter in healthy and common disease controls. In a 96-plex "immuno-oncology" assay of 80 curated serum samples, our "positive control" analyte (IL-18) failed to distinguish Stills patients. Given prior experience, we suspected and subsequently identified a strong hook effect at high total IL-18 concentrations. We found similar hook effects for very high total IL-18 and CXCL9 levels in separate cohorts containing Stills and HLH patients. Though we did not observe a "hook effect" for CXCL9 or IL-18BP in an aptamer-based assay, the scarcity of very high CXCL9 or IL-18BP levels in that cohort precludes making any generalizations. These observations suggest that "proteomic" multi-analyte panels carry significant Type II error, and investigators should be cautious making any "failure to detect" conclusions from such data without proper controls.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^116rfLva]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, since low ferritin level was associated with higher incidence of decompensation, it might seem controversial that mortality was associated with higher ferritin levels in the compensated population. As discussed, elevated ferritin level indicates either iron overload, which is toxic to cells, or increased inflammation, caused by either bacterial translocation or a subclinical starting infection. These last two, in return, can lead to overt infections, while inflammation in general and iron-induced toxicity can trigger the progression of HCC and comorbidities ultimately leading to increased overall mortality. Indeed, as Fig. 6 shows, almost every patient with high ferritin level who developed decompensated clinical stage died, and some deceased even without having an AD episode. In contrast, as Fig. 3 demonstrates, no patient with low ferritin level who did not develop decompensated clinical stage died during follow up. Furthermore, approximately 40% of those with low ferritin levels who did decompensate, also survived. The explanation for this difference is not clear, but the decompensation of non-inflammatory mechanisms, indicated by lower ferritin levels, might represent a less severe/more manageable type of AD.

In group A, ferritin levels were over the cutoff value in 12 out of 17 (70.5%), whereas in group B, it occurred only in 27% of cases and in 18% of cases when leucocytosis was also present. Moreover, an extreme discrepancy in ferritin values was present between the two groups. In group B, when ferritin was increased, it exceeded two times the cutoff only in 3 out of 48 samples (6%), compared to 9 out of 17 patients (56%) in group A.

Finally, incredibly high ferritin levels were present in group A, with up to 24 times (7438) or 7 times (2181) the cutoff.

### Anaemia and iron dysregulation: untapped therapeutic targets in chronic lung disease? [^112v6N8a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

The clinical relevance of anaemia, inflammation and dysregulated iron metabolism

Many chronic diseases have been shown to impact haematopoiesis and this is especially relevant in chronic lung disease. Polycythaemia has traditionally been considered an indication for venesection in COPD given the potential risks of hypercoagulability; however, this erythropoietic response is driven by tissue hypoxia and following the institution of LTOT as a standard of care, polycythaemia is now three times less prevalent than anaemia. In cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and COPD, a significant number of subjects have anaemia and or iron deficiency (circa 20%–40%), although this area is poorly studied and the incidence may be significantly underestimated, since establishing iron deficiency is complicated because of the effects of inflammation on serum iron, transferrin and ferritin. Contextually, a role for functional iron deficiency may be equally relevant as may be disease-specific considerations including propensity to infection. Although not currently part of routine clinical assessment, serum transferrin receptor levels appear to be unaffected by inflammation and may more accurately reflect iron status in chronic lung disease; circulating levels in the normal range reflect erythropoietic activity and levels are disproportionately elevated in iron deficiency.

In a series that considered this complexity, anaemia of chronic disease or 'anaemia of inflammation', was observed in 10% of patients with stable COPD. Congruent with the pathophysiological relevance of inflammation, the prevalence of anaemia in COPD has been observed to be up to 44% among patients admitted with acute exacerbationand the presence of anaemia in this scenario is independently associated with mortality. In fact, anaemia and/or iron deficiency have been consistently shown to have a strong correlation with morbidityand mortality across several lung diseases, the reported prevalence has been widely variable due to the different characteristics of study populations and the lack of a consensus definition of anaemia in the context of chronic lung disease. While most authors use the WHO definition (< 13 g/dL for males and 12 g/dL females), some use the same Hb level for both men and women (since most women are postmenopausal in these populations), while others have used haematocrit as the identifying factor. Although the prevalence also varies across the various respiratory populations, the impact of anaemia in the setting of impaired physiology and symptomatic limitation is expected to be common to a range of respiratory diseases.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Extreme hyperferritinemia: causes and impact on diagnostic reasoning [^114FZow6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyperferritinemia can be a result of inflammation, infection, chronic iron overload, or other uncommon pathologies including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). There is a historical association between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, but in reality HLH is associated with a minority of hyperferritinemic states.

Methods

We identified conditions most associated with hyperferritinemia by identifying 65,536 serum ferritin levels at the University of Minnesota Hospital over a five-year period, with 86 values higher than 10,000ng/mL. Pediatric patients comprised 22% of this population, and adults, 78%.

Results

The majority of cases in both populations with hyperferritinemia were due to chronic transfusion (35%), followed by liver disease (27%), and hematologic malignancy (16%). Solid malignancies, infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and primary and secondary HLH comprised the remaining (22%).

Conclusions

Although this supports the relationship between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, it maintains that the positive predictive value of hyperferritinemia for HLH is quite low, and one should consider more common explanations before suspecting HLH.

### Serum ferritin levels in inflammation: a retrospective comparative analysis between COVID-19 and emergency surgical non-COVID-19 patients [^111uy8ts]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The hyperactivation of this process causes cell death by so-called ferroptosis. This latter becomes one of the mechanisms described in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), quite similar to COVID pneumonia.

Following these observations, we might suggest that the usual inflammatory process starts with the classical SIRS-SEPSIS and subsequently affects iron metabolism. In contrast, in COVID patients, iron modifications occur as a first step, followed by SIRS, and likely resulting in a sort of severe sepsis. Furthermore, ferritin could be evaluated in surgical patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 swab as an indirect marker, in order to verify if they have been affected by COVID disease during their hospitalization, and as an indicator of severe sepsis at the same time.

Considering the lack of data presented in our study in the Group of COVID patients, we cannot confirm with statistical significance a direct correlation between COVID severity and ferritin levels, even though we could suggest it as supported by most recent literature data. On the contrary, we may confirm the absence of hyperferritinemic syndrome at the beginning of the usual inflammatory process and assess which values could be related to this phlogistic reaction phase.

Recent literature advocates hyperferritinemic syndrome as one of the main modifications in COVID infection, suggesting evaluation of ferritin levels as a parameter of infection. Presently, excluding reviews and metanalysis, only ten papers have been published with the contemporary topic of "ferritin" and "COVID". Moreover, we have suggested the evaluation of ferritin in COVID infection in our previous reports. This lack of literature reflects the low usage of iron parameters in common practice as revealed from our analysis in group A, which occurred at the beginning of the pandemic spread in Italy. Also, as Bataille presented on 22 patients, this parameter can become useful in asymptomatic patients, and be used as a possible discriminant between COVID and non-COVID pneumonia, as posted by Garanti.

This study has several limitations, in particular, the narrow number of patients enrolled mainly due to an unusual serum ferritin testing in the initial period as well as its retrospective nature. Therefore, a wider analysis would be necessary in order to prove our outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1134hDcv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are commonly used to manage uncontrolled symptoms, and in CRS with polyps short-term oral corticosteroids have been shown to improve symptoms and reduce polyp burden within 2 to 3 weeks of treatment; preoperative oral corticosteroids for CRS with polyposis have been shown to decrease polyp burden and improve visualization during sinus surgery and thus can be considered perioperatively or in patients with uncontrolled symptoms related to CRS with polyps. Evidence is even more limited for oral corticosteroids use in CRSsNP, and caution should be used because of potential significant side effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, elevated blood glucose levels in diabetics, adrenal suppression, and bone loss; the use of and duration of topical therapies should be documented in the medical record, and nasal saline irrigations and topical steroids may be continued long term if found beneficial in the absence of side effects.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) diagnostic confirmation — objective evidence and modality selection is emphasized by stating that a diagnosis of CRS cannot be based on signs and symptoms alone and requires objective evidence of sinonasal inflammation; objective confirmation may be by direct visualization or by CT scanning, with direct visualization best accomplished with nasal endoscopy though anterior rhinoscopy may suffice in some patients; anterior rhinoscopy has the least cost and procedural risk but is less sensitive than endoscopy and increases the chance of misdiagnosis; nasal endoscopy and CT scanning both have higher diagnostic accuracy, but CT scanning includes the small associated risk of radiation exposure and both include added cost; serum biomarkers such as IL-5, IL-13, IL-4, serum IgE, IL-6, and IFN-gamma have been suggested as playing a potential role in CRS diagnosis and prognosis.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111Q2E5c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Cytokine correlation between sinus tissue and nasal secretions among chronic rhinosinusitis and controls [^114fxKAF]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Compare cytokine levels in sinus tissue to sinus secretions from controls and chronic rhinosinusitis patients.

Study Design

In vitro.

Methods

Polyurethane foam sponges were placed into middle meati of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), with polyps (CRSwNP), and controls. Sinus biopsies were then taken from the same location. Protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and interleukins (IL) 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 17A were measured via cytometric bead assay for each sample. Protein values from sinus tissue and secretions were compared with Pearson's correlation between samples as well as one-way ANOVA with posthoc t test between groups.

Results

Samples from 43 patients in total were examined. Mucus was measured from 10 controls, 11 CRSsNP and 10 CRSwNP, and sinus tissue was measured from 10 controls, 15 CRSsNP and 10 CRSwNP. IL-8 and IFN-γ levels were outside of the detectable range of the assay. Levels of secreted IL-2, 4, 6, 10, and 17A correlated with tissue levels (P < 0.05 for all, r > 0.49) while TNF-α did not (P = 0.71). CRSsNP had elevated mucus levels of IL-2, 4, 6, 10, and 17A compared to controls. CRSwNP had elevated mucus levels of IL-4, 6, 10, 17A, and TNF-α compared to controls.

Conclusions

Cytokine levels in sinus secretions correlate with levels in sinus tissue and are elevated in CRS versus control based on Th1/Th2 skewing.

### Assessment of the serum ferritin level in patients with different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and its association with disease activity [^111ZXnqF]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common juvenile rheumatic illnesses and is characterized by chronic inflammation of joints in children and adolescents. It is a diverse and complex autoimmune disease. The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) defines JIA as definite arthritis of undetermined origin that begins before the 16th year of age and persists for at least 6 weeks. The incidence rates vary from 1.6 to 23/100,000, and the prevalence rates range from 3.8 to 400/100,000 in developed countries. In a semiurban area of Bangladesh, the estimated point prevalence of JIA was 60.5 per 100,000 children.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an intricate autoimmune disorder characterized by a multifactorial immunological etiology, wherein genetic predisposition and environmental factors contribute to a chronic inflammatory response involving the dysregulated activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Infection acts as a trigger in the development of JIA. The subsequent autoimmune damage largely, but not exclusively, targets the synovial membrane of the joint, resulting in persistent joint inflammation.

Ferritin, an iron storage protein, is an acute-phase reactant involved in inflammation, preventing free iron-mediated oxidative damage and immune dysregulation, making it a potential biomarker for disease activity in JIA. Studies have demonstrated that ferritin levels correlate with systemic inflammation, particularly in systemic JIA (sJIA), where hyperferritinemia is a characteristic feature. Additionally, serum ferritin levels have been found to be significantly elevated in other autoimmune & inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, further supporting its relevance as a disease activity marker. Elevated ferritin in these conditions indicates increased iron storage, but the iron remains sequestered and unavailable for hematopoiesis, contributing to anemia of inflammation. This relative iron deficiency via stimulation of hepcidin production is thought to be a defense mechanism to limit iron availability to pathogens and tumors. Iron is vital for immune cell function and survival, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages. Its homeostasis regulates the immune system, which is crucial in arthritis. Recent research suggests that ferritin can distinguish between active and inactive disease states in JIA, making it a valuable marker for disease monitoring.

### Is obesity associated with anemia of chronic disease? A population-based study [^115rAxKV]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Obesity is characterized by chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation, which, in turn, has been associated with anemia of chronic disease. We hypothesized that obesity may be associated with the features of anemia of chronic disease, including low hemoglobin concentration, low serum iron and transferrin saturation (TS), and elevated serum ferritin. We compared normal-weight to overweight and obese adult participants of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with respect to hemoglobin concentration and levels of serum iron, TS, and ferritin. Measured BMI was used to categorize participants into normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m(2), n = 6,059), overweight (BMI 25 to < 30 kg/m(2), n = 5,108), mildly obese (BMI 30 to < 35 kg/m(2), n = 2,366), moderately obese (BMI 35 to < 40 kg/m(2), n = 850), and severely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2), n = 465). After adjustment for age, gender, menstruation, race/ethnicity, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, blood donation, and dietary iron intake, serum ferritin was progressively higher with increasing BMI category, whereas serum iron and TS were progressively lower. However, compared to normal-weight persons, those in all other higher BMI categories did not have a significant change in hemoglobin concentration after adjustment for the above-mentioned confounders. Overweight and obesity were associated with changes in serum iron, TS, and ferritin that would be expected to occur in the setting of chronic, systemic inflammation. However, overweight and obese persons were not more likely to be anemic compared with normal-weight persons.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^113LQgsy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis classification — definitions and required findings are as follows: Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is defined by symptoms for shorter than 12 weeks and may include persistent symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI), purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, anosmia, nasal congestion, facial pain, headache, fever, cough, and purulent discharge; recurrent ARS is at least 3 episodes of ABRS in a year; and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) involves symptoms for at least 12 weeks with abnormal findings at endoscopy or on a sinus CT scan and can be classified further as CRSwNP or CRSsNP.

### The long-term impact of ferritin level on treatment and complications of type 2 diabetes [^1178Q4yx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate if high-serum ferritin has long-term impact on response to treatment and the development of diabetic complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We analysed the record of 90 consecutive type 2 diabetic subjects who had serum ferritin level determined soon after diagnosis of diabetes and who also had long-term follow-up data.

Results

Patients with higher serum ferritin level had slightly worse triglyceride, blood pressure and liver enzyme levels at the end of follow up. However, ferritin level had no impact on the initial or final requirements for diabetic medication and the development of diabetic complications.

Conclusions

Although elevated serum ferritin is a marker of insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, it is not necessarily a bad prognostic indicator that should affect the clinician's approach to management.

### Observed improvement in cognition during a personalized lifestyle intervention in people with cognitive decline [^114BJSY9]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Laboratory evaluation

To support diagnosis and the development of an individual treatment plan, extensive analysis of blood, urine, hair, and stool samples were performed through commercial clinical laboratory services. These included biomarkers of environmental toxicant exposure, blood sugar dysregulation, gastrointestinal health, nutrient status, cardiovascular disease, systemic inflammation, chronic infection, and hormone dysregulation (see list in Supplementary Table 1). Environmental exposures assessed included metals (e.g. mercury, lead, arsenic, and cadmium), chemical pollutants (e.g. petrol chemicals, phthalates, herbicides, pesticides, and glyphosate), and biotoxins (ochratoxin, gliotoxin, trichothecenes, zearalenone, and aflatoxin). Stool analysis at baseline included markers for impaired digestion and absorption, dysbiotic flora, gut specific inflammation, impaired gut immune function, or infection. Systemic inflammation was assessed using hs-CRP, ferritin, and LpPla2. Chronic infections associated with cognitive decline — including Herpes simplex, P. gingivalis, Borrelia, Babesia, Bartonella or chronic sinusitis — were tested for. Laboratory provided reference ranges were applied to CBC, CMP, HgA1c, mycotoxin testing, chemical toxicants, stool testing, nutrient testing, chronic infections, and other laboratories. Personalized interpretation was applied to blood hormone levels, thyroid panels, homocysteine, lipid levels, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and lead (see reference ranges in Supplementary Table 1). Abnormal results were re-tested every 4–12 weeks, per an individualized treatment plan, to track changes and adjust treatment throughout the trial.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial, given the initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider obtaining it in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

### Serum ferritin levels in inflammation: a retrospective comparative analysis between COVID-19 and emergency surgical non-COVID-19 patients [^114kmMxj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread worldwide, and the pathogenic mechanism is still under investigation. The presence of a huge inflammatory response, defined as "cytokine storm", is being studied in order to understand what might be the prognostic factors implicated in the progression of the infection, with ferritin being one of such markers. The role of ferritin as a marker of inflammation is already known, and whether it changes differently between COVID and non-COVID patients still remains unclear. The aim of this retrospective analysis is to understand whether the inflammatory process in these two types is different.

Methods

In this retrospective analysis, we compared 17 patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, who had been admitted between February and April 2020 (group A) along with 30 patients admitted for acute surgical disease with SARS-CoV-2 negative swab (group B). A further subgroup of Covid negative patients with leukocytosis was compared to group A.

Results

In group A, the median (interquartile range) serum ferritin was 674 (1284) ng/mL, and it was double the cutoff (300ng/mL) in 9 out of 17 (52%). The median (IQR) value of ferritin level in the total blood samples of group B was 231, and in the subgroup with leucocytosis, 149 (145). Group A showed a significantly higher ferritin median level compared to the entire group B (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001) as well as to the subgroup with leucocytosis (p < 0.0014).

Conclusions

The role of iron metabolism appears to be directly involved in COVID infection. On the other hand, in the acute inflammation of patients admitted for surgery, and probably in other common phlogistic processes, iron modifications appear to be self-limited. However, our finding suggests the use of ferritin as a marker for COVID infection.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Hyperferritinemia is a potential marker of chronic chikungunya: a retrospective study on the island of curaçao during the 2014–2015 outbreak [^117EnRJG]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recently Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreaks have been reported in the Carribean. There is no data regarding the outbreak in Curaçao. In addition, to date there is no biomarker that could be used to predict chronic infection.

Objectives

To characterize the first CHIKV outbreak in Curaçao and to identify potential biomarkers for chronic infection.

Study Design

A serological test and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used on samples collected in Curaçao to confirm infection. Subsequently, six samples with high viral load were selected for phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore we investigated the association of macrophage-related biomarkers during CHIKV infection with chronic arthralgia/arthritis.

Results

116 patients in Curacao were diagnosed with CHIKV infection based on ELISA and 77% were tested positive for CHIKV by qPCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that an Asian genotype was the cause of the outbreak. Elevated levels of ferritin and CRP were significantly associated with viraemia. In addition, elevated ferritin levels were significantly associated with chronic arthralgia.

Conclusions

The results showed that the presence of an Asian genotype of CHIKV in Curaçao for the first time. Moreover, we found an association between ferritin levels with chronic arthralgia.

### Mosunetuzumab (Lunsumio) [^112MoQVb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3	Infections

LUNSUMIO can cause serious or fatal infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Among patients who received LUNSUMIO at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, serious infections, including opportunistic infections, occurred in 17%, with Grade 3 or 4 infections in 14%, and fatal infections in 0.9% of patients. The most common Grade 3 or greater infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with LUNSUMIO and treat appropriately. LUNSUMIO should not be administered in the presence of active infection. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LUNSUMIO in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections (e.g., chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus), with underlying conditions that may predispose to infections or who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to guidelines.

Withhold LUNSUMIO or consider permanent discontinuation of LUNSUMIO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.4	Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

LUNSUMIO can cause fatal or serious hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is a potentially life-threatening, hyperinflammatory syndrome that is independent of CRS. Common manifestations include fever, elevated ferritin, hemophagocytosis, cytopenias, coagulopathy, hepatitis, and splenomegaly.

Across a broader clinical trial population, HLH occurred in 0.5% (7/1536) of patients. Most cases (5/7) were identified within the first 28 days following initiation of LUNSUMIO, with 3 cases preceded by diagnosed or suspected CRS. Of the 7 cases of HLH, 6 had fatal outcomes, with 2 deaths from HLH alone and 4 deaths with concurrent unresolved HLH. Of the 7 cases of HLH, 4 occurred in the context of concurrent EBV and/or CMV infection.

Monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of HLH. Consider HLH when the presentation of CRS is atypical or prolonged, or when there are features of macrophage activation. For suspected HLH, interrupt LUNSUMIO and evaluate and treat promptly for HLH per current practice guidelines.

It is relatively uncommon to document sinusitis as a cause of fever with much certainty. Therefore, investigation for sinusitis should be undertaken only after more likely causes have been excluded. and the actions taken should reflect the individual patient's circumstances. Aggressive evaluation and treatment should be geared to minimizing the patient's overall morbidity and to identifying the more aggressive forms of sinusitis and their potential complications.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^117Uffh4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies assessed the efficiency of Ret-He in diagnosing ID. The suggested cutoff values for Ret-He range from 25.7 pg with an AUC of 0.931 (71.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity), 28.5 pg with an AUC of 0.902 (68% sensitivity and 90% specificity), 32.4 pg with an AUC of 0.753 (72.5% sensitivity and 70% specificity), to 35.5 pg with an AUC of 0.881 (100% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity). This variability is likely due to the use of different ferritin thresholds to diagnose ID. A higher ferritin cutoff might lead to capturing more mild cases of ID, which can cause the Ret-He cutoff to shift to maintain a balance between correctly identifying iron deficiency (sensitivity) and avoiding false positives (specificity).

Three hundred seventy patients had anemia but no ID according to the definition we used in this study. Of these, 131 patients had Ret-He levels below 33.5 pg. The combination of low transferrin saturation, high ferritin, normal transferrin receptor levels, and elevated CRP in these patients suggests anemia of chronic disease rather than classic IDA. Anemia of chronic disease is common in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or malignancies, where iron metabolism is disrupted due to the inflammatory response. In these cases, iron becomes sequestered in storage sites, leading to reduced availability for red blood cell production, despite overall iron stores being sufficient or even elevated. The normal MCV and MCH further support the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease. Additionally, there may be some degree of functional ID, where iron is present but not readily available for use by the bone marrow. This may explain the low Ret-He and transferrin saturation, despite adequate or elevated ferritin levels.

### Manifestations of mucormycosis and its complications in COVID-19 patients: a case series study [^111finGT]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Indicates the Frequency of Paranasal Sinus Involvement.

As illustrated in Table 2, most cases had bilateral ethmoidal involvement. 91% of cases experienced ethmoidal involvement, which was mostly bilateral. In addition, 14.9% of cases had pansinusitis.

Brain complications including infarction and ischemic events (17%), brain involvement (29.8%), and brain abscess (2.1%) were also reported.

Various laboratory investigations were performed for all cases, including cell blood count (CBC) ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

HbA1c more than 7 was considered high and a sign of uncontrolled diabetes. Although nearly 70% of patients had diabetes as their underlying disease, all cases had HbA1c more than 7, indicating that the blood glucose level was high and uncontrolled in all cases through the past three months. The mean HbA1c was 11.24 ± 1.44. All inflammatory markers measured in this survey were high (Table 3).

Table 3.
Illustrates the Laboratory Data of Included Individuals.

All cases were treated with systemic corticosteroids, liposomal Amphotericin B, and antibiotics. The average dexamethasone dose administered during hospitalization was 121.7 ± 79.7 milligrams. Minimum and maximum doses administered were 30.0 and 576.0 milligrams, respectively.

Sinus debridement (endoscopic sinus surgery was used to removed crust and debris) was performed for all patients since none responded solely to antifungal treatment. In addition, orbital exenteration was performed on 14 cases (29.8%).

All patients received oxygen via mask or mechanical ventilation. In addition, 10 patients (21.3%) were mechanically ventilated. Twenty-two (47%) cases were admitted to the ICU.

Chi-square test and binominal logistic regression were conducted to determine if the variables and symptoms listed previously could predict the likelihood of ICU admission as an indicator of disease severity (Table 4).

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Ferritin in autoimmune diseases [^11499sjg]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Iron, an essential element for many important cellular functions in all living organisms, can catalyze the formation of potentially toxic free radicals. Excessive iron is sequestered by ferritin in a nontoxic and readily available form in a cell. Ferritin is composed of 24 subunits of different proportions of two functionally distinct subunits: ferritin H and L. The expression of ferritin is under delicate control and is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by iron, cytokines, hormones, and oxidative stress. Mutations in the ferritin gene cause the hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome and neuroferritinopathy. Hyperferritinemia is associated with inflammation, infections, and malignancies. While elevated levels of ferritin are characteristic of adult-onset Still's disease and hemophagocytic syndrome, both associated with inflammation, it has scantly been evaluated in other autoimmune diseases. In this review, we describe ferritin structure and function, hyperferritinemia in disease states and in autoimmune diseases.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^115GBasg]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

3. CRP and ESR should always be performed in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection. A normal value does not rule out PJI.

Level of evidence: 2.

Patients presenting with clinical signs of prosthetic joint infection (i.e. fever, unexplained pain at the site of arthroplasty, prosthetic loosening, or a sinus tract) should be subjected to screening for inflammatory markers in serum. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are good preliminary tests. Screening of these markers can be performed rapidly, inexpensively, and with minimal inconvenience. Although there is considerable variation in sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for both CRP (SE 21–100%, SP 20–96%) and ESR (SE 58–97%, SP 33–90.9%), in general they show good diagnostic value, and are of relevance particularly for therapy follow-up. A threshold of 10 mg/l for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR of is recommended for diagnostic purposes. One level 1 study and 32 level 2 studies addressed the diagnostic efficacy of CRP and ESR in serum. However, when testing for CRP and ESR, one should keep in mind that both markers can be influenced by numerous factors (i.e. neoplastic and inflammatory conditions, age, and technical details). Furthermore, CRP is produced in the liver, and especially in low-grade chronic PJI, levels may not be elevated. Therefore, a careful history and physical examination are mandatory. Several studies suggest using the combination of ESR and CRP. In any case, if one of these markers is above the threshold, further diagnostic tests should be performed. Low CRP and ESR do not rule out PJI.

### Tryptase reference values in a Swedish middle-aged general population and association with diabetes mellitus [^115j4EqD]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Another new finding is the association of higher tryptase levels and chronic sinusitis. MC involvement was described in endotype T2 of chronic sinusitis. However, our finding was weaker and not consistent after adjustment for multiple testing (p value.07). Asthma, which is frequently associated with a T2 response, and atopy alike did not affect tryptase levels in our cohort, in line with reports from other cohort studies.

As expected from previous literature reports, tryptase levels were higher in smokers, in obese participants and in people with elevated creatinine levels. Our results on the association of diabetes and higher tryptase levels were however consistent after adjusting for current smoking, elevated creatinine and obesity.

The strengths of our study comprise the assessment of a large sample of general population with in‐depth clinical characterization, focusing on a middle‐age interval (50–64 years), performed within a short time frame (32 months between 2015 and 2018), and relying on the same, most recent tryptase assay version. The main weakness is the lack of screening for primary MC‐related conditions, above all hereditary α‐tryptasemia, which can be diagnosed using a digital droplet PCR method, as published in 2016, when the SCAPIS study had already been designed and the sampling was ongoing. Finally, the Scandinavian make‐up of the SCAPIS cohort can be viewed as a strength since it allows comparison with data from other national cohorts.
