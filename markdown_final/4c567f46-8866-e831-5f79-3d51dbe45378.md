Answer Choices:
A. Food production
B. Population patterns
C. Wildlife conservation efforts
D. Tourism

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option — food production, population patterns, wildlife conservation, or tourism — is most significantly and negatively affected by the irregularity of the wet monsoon in South Asia in recent years. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanism by which monsoon irregularity impacts each domain. Then, I should verify which option has the most direct, immediate, and well-documented vulnerability to monsoon variability. Next, I will examine indirect or secondary effects to ensure I'm not missing a stronger candidate. Finally, I will cross-check with authoritative sources and conclude with the most defensible answer.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of harm from an irregular wet monsoon. Irregular timing, intensity, or distribution of rainfall disrupts agricultural calendars, soil moisture, and hydrology, which in turn affects crop yields, food security, and livelihoods dependent on rain-fed agriculture; this is a classic, direct climate–agriculture linkage in South Asia [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine food production specifically. South Asian agriculture is predominantly monsoon-dependent, so erratic rainfall directly reduces yields, increases crop failure risk, and undermines food security; this is precisely why climate assessments highlight agriculture as a key vulnerability in the region, and why monsoon variability is repeatedly linked to economic and health system stresses that cascade from food insecurity [^notfound].

> Next, I should review population patterns. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while climate stress can drive migration, that tends to be a slower, multi-causal process rather than a direct, immediate consequence of a single monsoon season's irregularity; I need to ensure I'm not overstating a secondary effect when a more direct impact exists elsewhere [^notfound].

> I will now examine wildlife conservation. Hmm, wait a minute — monsoon shifts can alter habitats and stress species, but the provided materials do not offer South Asia–specific evidence that monsoon irregularity is a primary driver of conservation setbacks; without direct data, this remains plausible but unsupported relative to the stronger, documentable impact on agriculture [^notfound].

> Let me consider tourism. I should double-check whether monsoon irregularity meaningfully suppresses demand or safety in South Asian tourism. The CDC notes increased illness risk during the monsoon and advises travelers accordingly, but this reflects seasonal risk rather than documented, large-scale demand destruction from monsoon irregularity; moreover, global tourism emissions analyses emphasize climate change impacts like heatwaves and wildfires, not monsoon variability, as the dominant drivers of tourism vulnerability, so monsoon irregularity's effect on South Asian tourism appears indirect and comparatively modest here [^8e3dd866] [^e8fac16a].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the hierarchy of impacts is clear. The most direct, immediate, and well-supported effect of an irregular wet monsoon in South Asia is on food production via disrupted rain-fed agriculture; population patterns may shift over time, wildlife impacts are plausible but not substantiated in the provided sources, and tourism faces seasonal health risks but lacks evidence of outsized, irregular-monsoon–driven declines in this context [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The correct answer is A. Food production, because South Asian agriculture's dependence on the monsoon makes crop yields and food security uniquely sensitive to monsoon irregularity, whereas the other options either reflect indirect or less well-supported impacts in the materials provided [^notfound].

---

The irregularity of the wet monsoon in South Asia most significantly and negatively affects **food production** [^notfound] due to its heavy reliance on consistent rainfall for crop yields. Erratic monsoons cause droughts, floods, and delayed planting, leading to reduced agricultural output, higher food prices, and increased food insecurity [^notfound]. While population patterns, wildlife conservation, and tourism can be impacted, the **most direct and severe consequence is on agriculture**, making food production the primary affected sector.

---

## Impact on food production

South Asian agriculture is **highly dependent on monsoon rainfall**, with over 60% of cultivated land rain-fed and monsoon rains accounting for 70–90% of annual precipitation. Irregular monsoons — marked by delayed onset, early withdrawal, or uneven spatial distribution — cause:

- **Droughts and water scarcity**: Reduced rainfall leads to crop failure, particularly for rice, wheat, and pulses, which are sensitive to moisture stress.

- **Floods and waterlogging**: Excessive rainfall damages crops, erodes soil, and disrupts planting and harvesting schedules.

- **Delayed planting seasons**: Irregular rainfall forces farmers to delay planting, reducing yields and causing harvest losses.

- **Increased pest and disease incidence**: Fluctuating moisture levels promote pests and diseases, further reducing yields.

These impacts collectively **reduce agricultural productivity**, increase food prices, and exacerbate food insecurity, particularly for smallholder farmers and low-income households [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other options

While irregular monsoons also affect population patterns, wildlife conservation, and tourism, the **impact on food production is the most direct and severe**:

| **Option** | **Impact of irregular monsoon** |
|-|-|
| Population patterns | Indirect; migration may occur due to agricultural distress, but this is a secondary effect. |
| Wildlife conservation | Indirect; habitat disruption and water scarcity affect wildlife, but the impact is less immediate than on agriculture. |
| Tourism | Indirect; adverse weather may reduce tourist arrivals, but the economic impact is less significant than on food production. |

---

## Conclusion

The irregularity of the wet monsoon in South Asia **most significantly and negatively affects food production**, given agriculture's dependence on consistent rainfall. This leads to reduced crop yields, increased food prices, and heightened food insecurity, making it the primary affected sector compared to population patterns, wildlife conservation, and tourism.

### Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions [^4352bc8a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Tourism has a critical role to play in global carbon emissions pathway. This study estimates the global tourism carbon footprint and identifies the key drivers using environmentally extended input-output modelling. The results indicate that global tourism emissions grew 3.5% p.a. between 2009–2019, double that of the worldwide economy, reaching 5.2 Gt CO 2 -e or 8.8% of total global GHG emissions in 2019. The primary drivers of emissions growth are slow technology efficiency gains (0.3% p.a.) combined with sustained high growth in tourism demand (3.8% p.a. in constant 2009 prices). Tourism emissions are associated with alarming distributional inequalities. Under both destination- and resident-based accounting, the twenty highest-emitting countries contribute three-quarters of the global footprint. The disparity in per-capita tourism emissions between high- and low-income nations now exceeds two orders of magnitude. National tourism decarbonisation strategies will require demand volume thresholds to be defined to align global tourism with the Paris Agreement.

### A complication of cosmetic medical tourism [^5b054c9e]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Regarding cosmetic medical tourism – which of the next sentences is true?
A: It refers to the practice of individuals traveling to locations outside the country of residence to undergo cosmetic procedures or surgeries
B: Injection of fillers is the primary source for cosmetic medical tourism related M abscessus infections
C: Cosmetic medical tourism has almost no drawbacks
D: Careful use of disinfecting agents such as chlorhexidine will be sufficed for M abscessus prevention
E: Medical tourism in general, should be discouraged, since it is unsafe practice

Answers:
A: It refers to the practice of individuals traveling to locations outside the country of residence to undergo cosmetic procedures or surgeries – Correct. Factors that contribute to the appeal to cosmetic medical tourism include cost saving, maintaining a level of privacy, and the allure of combining travel with treatment.
B: Injection of fillers is the primary source for cosmetic medical tourism related M abscessus infections – Incorrect. Mesotherapy is the most common procedure linked to M abscessus infections, followed by abdominoplasty, breast augmentation, liposuction, and filler injections.
C: Cosmetic medical tourism has almost no drawbacks – Incorrect. This phenomenon has questionable quality assurance and lack of comprehensive postoperative care. Moreover, if complications occur after injection of a cosmetic product, no adequate information is usually available regarding the brand of the product and the injection technique that was applied.
D: Careful use of disinfecting agents such as chlorhexidine will be sufficed for M abscessus prevention – Incorrect. M abscessus possess a hydrophobic and lipid-rich cell, which facilitates biofilm formation on solid surfaces such as water pipes and medical implants. This attribute confers a degree of resistance to standard disinfectants including chlorine, organomercurials, alkaline glutaraldehyde, and 2% formaldehyde.
E: Medical tourism in general, should be discouraged, since it is unsafe practice – Incorrect. Although traveling to "top of its kind" medical centers to treat severe or rare medical conditions or diseases is safely practiced for years, costs-driven cosmetic tourism is associated with increased health risks.

### Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions [^b49e9d9c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Rapid demand growth and slow technology efficiency gains are the fundamental drivers of high growth in tourism carbon emissions. Demand for tourism is driven by multiple factors, most notably rising income levels especially among the emerging economic powerhouses of China and India. High growth tourism carbon emissions are also driven by countries that view tourism as an economic engine and aggressively pursue national tourism economic growth strategies –.

Accelerating tourism demand growth clearly presents an impossible emissions challenge in the absence of much greater technology and supply chain efficiencies. This echoes the degrowth research findings that technology improvements that could cancel out demand growth would be extremely unrealistic. Defining 'tourism volume thresholds' to manage demand growth is ultimately required to curb rising tourism emissions.

A simple universal reduction of tourism volume across countries (e.g. all countries reduce their tourism demand by 5%) however is not an ideal approach as this procedure does not represent a fair and just mitigation approach. The IPCCsuggests that a "fair contribution" in emissions mitigation needs to acknowledge four components: equality, responsibility, capability, and cost-effectiveness. Based on this, we support the view that tourism demand volume controls must consider historical and cumulative tourism emissions, while also being cognizant of the varied financial and technical capacities of individual countries to mitigate, and responsibilities to support low-income and small island economies.

### Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions [^2ac0290e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we present an analysis of global and national tourism carbon footprints between 2009 and 2020. Using environmentally extended input-output modelling we investigate how tourism emissions increase or decrease in relation to technology and demand drivers, and the similarities or differences within and between countries in terms of tourism emissions. To comprehensively answer these research questions, we identify and analyse five key factors that influence tourism emissions: 1. Technology improvements regarding energy efficiency gains; 2. The supply chain concerning the production structure among suppliers; 3. Population growth relating to changes in the volume of tourists; 4. Tourism consumption for the evolving patterns of tourist expenditure; and 5. The use of private vehicles regarding direct emissions generated by internal combustion vehicles used by tourists.

This study uses tourism expenditure profiles from 175 countries, including the tourism satellite accounts of 62 countries and tourism consumption data of 113 countries, which are combined with multipliers from the GLORIA database to estimate macro-level tourism emissions from 2009–2020, (see Method). Drawing these sources together allows the development of a comprehensive global database from which tourism carbon footprints can be estimated through input-output analysis. This high-resolution database affords unprecedented analytical depth. Carbon footprints were estimated for inbound, outbound and domestic travel for 175 countries, distinguished by source including those produced by local businesses, foreign producers, international flights, and private vehicle use. Tourism carbon footprints were calculated using both residence-based accounting (RBA) to attribute emissions to the countries of visitor origin and destination-based accounting (DBA) for countries where tourism expenditures takes place(Supplementary Method 1).

Drivers of tourism emissions: technology vs consumption

Using structural decomposition analysis (see Method), the net increase of 1.5 Gt CO 2 -e tourism emissions between 2009 and 2019 can be broken down into five components. At the global level, growth in tourism consumption is the largest factor driving tourism emissions. The amount of money spent on accommodation, gastronomy and transport has constantly increased over time. Per capita tourism expenditure increased from US$536 per capita in 2009 to US$672 in 2019 (constant price 2009), and this caused tourism emissions to rise by 1.4 Gt CO 2 -e (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Decomposition result of the tourism carbon footprints, 2009–2019.

Tourism carbon footprints increased from 3.7 GtCO 2 -e to 5.2 Gt from 2009 to 2019. The net changes, 1.5 Gt CO 2 -e, were broken down into five components to highlight relative contribution of individual factors.

Global population growth from 6.9 billion to 7.8 billion over the decade is an important factor behind changes in tourism consumption that is responsible for 0.3 Gt CO 2 -e. As people travel more frequently, the use of private internal combustion vehicles by tourists accounted for 0.3 Gt CO 2 -e whereas two thirds of the increase in emissions resulted from domestic travel.

Technology improvements simultaneously led to a decline in emissions of 0.5 Gt CO 2 -e. Emissions intensities, defined as emissions per dollar economic output, improved by 0.3% per annum over the period 2009–2019 (Table 1). In comparison, tourism expenditure growth was 3.8% per year, confirming that emissions intensity improvements were heavily outweighed by consumption growth. These findings are corroborated by airlines, cruise lines and hotel chains that report efficiency gains of 1–2.6% per annum, and sales increases of 3–7%.

Overall, production factors (technology and the supply chain) only offset around 25% of the tourism emissions growth that was driven by consumption factors (expenditure per capita, population and private car use). The global tourism carbon footprint has expanded at approximately two-thirds of the speed of tourism consumption in nominal price.

### Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions [^3dc986f9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Travel plays a significant role in contemporary society. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, global tourism contributed US$ 6 trillion in annual economic output and was one of the fastest-growing sectors in the world for ten consecutive years –. The post-pandemic tourism rebound has been rapid and global tourism is likely to again surpass 20 billion trips in 2024. This sector is pivotal to global emissions trajectories and must be aligned with the Paris Agreement.

UN Tourism (World Tourism Organization) is leading the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action, in collaboration with the UN Environment Programme, to mobilize tourism stakeholders to support the global goals of cutting emissions in half by 2030 and achieving Net Zero at the latest. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) aims to reach carbon-neutral growth of international aviation emissions from 2020 onwards. The World Travel and Tourism Council, a representative body for major tourism firms, has put forward a proactive roadmap for private tourism businesses, including accommodation, aviation, cruise, tour operators and travel agents, with the aim to reach net-zero by 2050.

Mitigating tourism's carbon footprint however is an imposing task. In 2013, global tourism contributed 8% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its carbon intensity, defined as emissions per dollar sales, was 20% higher than the average for the global economy. Historically, most destinations have demonstrated an inability to decouple growth in tourist demand from increasing tourism emissions.

A rising emissions pathway is determined by multiple factors, such as demand growth and consumption of carbon-intensive tourism products and services. A critical understanding of these drivers is crucial for assessing and informing effective policy responses. Such an analysis requires a comprehensive tourism footprint database to track both the direct and indirect emissions arising from domestic and international travel over an extended timeframe. Lenzen et al.evaluated global tourism emissions over a five-year period (2009–2013) but did not perform a formal analysis to quantify the drivers of emissions growth. National data on the drivers of tourism emissions is now available for individual countries such as Australia, Austria, China, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Iceland –. However limited insights are available for other countries where substantial variations exist in tourism demand patterns, technology progress and international trade across destinations.

### World committee on tourism ethics (WCTE) recommendation on COVID-19 certificates for international travel [^f19456d6]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Summary box

WHO has not yet endorsed the COVID-19 certificates. However, the European Union, nation states and the airline companies recently introduced, or will soon introduce COVID-19 certificates to open their borders to vaccinated visitors.

The World Committee on Tourism Ethics, an independent and impartial body under the aegis of the World Tourism Organization, issued a Recommendation, requesting governments and other entities to implement COVID-19 certificates for international travel in free, universally available and non-discriminatory manner.
The recommendation also limits its use and time as well as the provision of vaccines and certificates as a part of international holiday packages.

Restarting tourism is a priority for many countries, especially those whose economies rely heavily on revenues generated by international tourism. As the pandemic is still ongoing, vaccine certificates are, so far, the only way to revive international travel and other activities. However, there remain considerable ethical and practical challenges facing their implementation.

WHO is reluctant to endorse COVID-19 certificates. Following the most recent meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee explicitly stated its opposition to international travellers being required to provide proof of vaccination. The committee urged member states to 'acknowledge the potential for requiring such certificates' may 'deepen inequities and promote differential freedom of movement'.
However, as summer tourist season is approaching in the Northern Hemisphere, there is an urgent need to restart tourism in order to mitigate further harm to the tourism sector, which has been devastated by the pandemic. On 4 May, the G20 Tourism Ministers met and expressed support for using vaccine certificates to boost travel and tourism, stressing that such resumptions are crucial for global economic recovery. Israel and the State of New York have already introduced vaccine certificates primarily for domestic purposes (but also for international travel). More recently, the European Parliament and member states reached a provisional agreement on the Digital COVID-19 Certificate, confirming that the certificate will go live on 1 July. Many other vaccine certificate programmes are in development. As of 3 June, 36 airline companies have already started trialling the International Air Transport Association Digital Travel Pass.

### Latest revisions to the international health regulations will fail to prevent future travel chaos [^8aa495ed]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

With international tourism fully recovered and growing in 2024, after several years of pandemic disruption, the chaos associated with travel measures used during the COVID-19 pandemic may also be receding in the rearview mirrors of policymakers. On the one hand, there is now substantial genomic, epidemiological and other evidence that, soon after the spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into human populations in late 2019, the virus rapidly spread worldwide through travel. On the other hand, the most effective ways to reduce pathogen introduction and spread in a highly globalised world remain unclear. During the evolving pandemic, the assessment of travel measure effectiveness was heavily clouded by the uncoordinated, frequently changing and poorly evidenced ways that travel measures were used by most governments. Travel continued to introduce and spread the virus and variants of concern across most jurisdictions worldwide. The result was a prolonged and devastating pandemic and the global endemicity of SARS-COV-2. In addition, travel measures were applied in ways that caused profound, and often inequitably distributed, social and economic impacts. These widespread secondary impacts are not yet well understood. The severe disruptions caused to individual lives, major economic sectors and whole societies contributed to a concerning decline in public trust in science, public health and government.

Despite the failure of governments to coordinate travel measure use, and the wide-ranging and devastating harms resulting from this failure, the adopted revisions to the WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR) in May 2024 have left existing global governance of this domain virtually unchanged. Nor has the use of travel measures been included in negotiations to adopt a WHO pandemic agreement. This may be due to uncertainty on what constitutes effective use of such measures, and thus what role travel measures can and should play in global responses to public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC). Yet, without political commitment among WHO member states, and the global health community more broadly, to advance understanding of collective action needs within this complex policy area, chaos is highly likely to ensue during any future pandemic event. Left unaddressed, this status quo not only undermines global public health objectives of pandemic prevention and response but also risks reproducing related, inequitably harmful, disruptions to international trade, global mobility and certain human rights.

Tourist flow

The Tourism Satellite Account and international tourism expenditure provide detailed spending patterns for domestic and inbound tourism in a given country. However, they do not account for outbound tourism spending. To estimate how much residents spend abroad per country, we rely on international bilateral travel flows. These flows facilitate the allocation of international tourism spending to each destination from their respective origins, and vice versa (inbound spending from country A to country B = outbound spending from country B to country A). By mapping out bilateral travel patterns and expenditures for each origin-destination pair, we can estimate outbound tourism spending per country.

The UNWTO data provides bilateral travel volume between countries. In instances where tourist flow information is absent from the UNWTO dataset (around 30% of the bilateral travel data), we resort to a modelling approach, namely the gravity model. This model considers factors that influence tourist movements, including the population size of both the visitor and the destination countries, and the physical distance between countries. The complete picture of tourist flows subsequently determines how each country is responsible for consuming inbound and outbound tourism.

These strategies are most urgent in the case of the world's twenty highest-emitting tourism destinations, especially the United States, China, and India. These countries have developed large domestic and inbound tourism markets with high demand growth over differing timeframes. Our scenario analysis indicates that if the top 20 destinations had reduced their tourism growth rate by 1% per annum from 2009 to 2019 (from 5.9% to 4.9% annual growth in current prices), they could have achieved a reduction of 0.38 Gt CO2-e emissions in 2019. This alone would have represented a 7% reduction of global tourism emissions.

Our findings indicate that aviation, utilities, and private internal combustion vehicle use are major hotspots of high growth tourism emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has evaluated the corresponding alternatives to mitigate emissions for these three areas. The IEA describes a fully decarbonized electricity grid as 'moving in a positive direction but requiring more effort', and the transition to electric vehicles as 'on track' in progress toward the 2050 Net Zero Emissions goal. This offers some reason for optimism that tourism emissions growth from utilities and private vehicle use can be mitigated over the course of future years.

By contrast, air transport remains the Achilles heel of global tourism emissions. Critical barriers in management, technology and fuel transition, finance, and governance continue to make progress on aviation emissions mitigation 'substantially insufficient' in terms of 2030 and 2050 emissions trajectories based on the IEA assessment. Limiting continued growth in demand for air transportation, especially in long-haul international travel, would achieve outcomes that are climatically and socially desirable. Targeted measures such as CO 2 taxes, carbon budgets, and alternative fuel obligations must be urgently considered in an effort to rein in future air travel emissions.

Carbon inequality is an inescapable and increasingly entrenched feature of global tourism. Substantial disparities exist in total tourism carbon footprints between countries, and in per-capita tourism carbon footprints within countries. These inequalities need to be considered within the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'to assign mitigation responsibilities to both countries and individuals. The inequality in carbon emissions from travel stems from the gap between those who can and those who cannot afford international travel. Focusing on limiting continuing growth in international air travel rather than domestic tourism would offer a more socially equitable approach to addressing this challenge.

The aggregated internal tourism expenditure data must be allocated to different tourism sub-sectors. To disaggregate tourism expenditure into sectors for each countries, the following procedure is used. We first choose 31 goods and services in the GLORIA that tourists may purchase. Domestic household and government consumption data across 31 goods and services is then used to disaggregate domestic tourism expenditure into sectors. Total household and government consumption (domestic + exports) is chosen to disaggregate inbound tourism expenditure — this proxy considers export values consumed by overseas households, in this case, inbound tourists. This approach provides valuable insights into the interaction between tourism spending and various sectors of domestic economies, as well as international consumption patterns. The procedure also captures the dynamics of a country's economic conditions, including large-scale downturns such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Box 8.3.1 Voluntourism — short-term volunteer travel — describes tourists volunteering for a charity or development organization, usually for short periods, in low- and middle-income countries, and notes that the impact of short-term visits not coordinated with local and international response mechanisms is variable and might be harmful in certain settings. Voluntourism in humanitarian emergencies can be particularly problematic given dynamic and often dangerous humanitarian environments that require professional knowledge, organizational infrastructure, and understanding of the humanitarian response coordination system; without necessary competencies and organizational support, voluntourists in these settings expose themselves to unnecessary personal risks, often undermine local capacities, and can create a burden on the broader humanitarian response operations. Encourage individuals considering such trips to support local humanitarian and disaster responses in other ways.

### Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions [^e8fac16a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Sustained high growth emissions undermine the future viability of global tourism. Destinations are witnessing the accelerating impact of climate change which is altering patterns of tourism demand. Reduced snow volume at ski resorts, increasing fire risks and heatwave exposure are vivid examples of these climate impacts. Global destinations face varying levels of climate change vulnerability. Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Small Island Developing States are among the most affected, with projections indicating tourism demand will be negatively influenced due to climate change. Overall, tourism emissions that are primarily driven by high-income countries contribute to suppressing tourism demand for destinations in more vulnerable poorer regions. With the intensified effects of climate change expected in the coming decades, further study is needed to understand the extent to which regional tourism demand will be impacted by changing seasonality and weather patterns. Such information is crucial for addressing the many inequality issues that may arise in climate justice discussion.

Global tourism governance bodies including the UN Tourism and the World Travel and Tourism Council, have long based their climate ambitions on technology efficiency gains and infrastructure improvements. Our findings provide concrete evidence that focusing alone on technology and efficiency gains is insufficient for achieving net-zero milestones. Strong measures to reduce travel demand are urgently required. The urgency of such measures is particularly acute among high-emitting countries and in relation to long-haul air travel. The definition and implementation of tourism volume thresholds will be inevitable under the current emissions trajectory if tourism is to be aligned with global net-zero goals.

Structural Decomposition Analysis

Building upon the input-output framework, our study further explores the factors driving the increase in global tourism carbon footprints from 2009 to 2019, using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). In this analysis, we first focus on four key determinants: technology improvement, the supply chain, tourism consumption, and population growth. To integrate the population effectinto SDA, tourism expenditure has to be transformed into per capita values.

Additionally, we incorporate the carbon footprints from the use of private vehicleas an extra factor due to its computation being conducted outside the input-output model. Letrepresent the change values from 2009 to 2019, then the increase of the carbon footprints from the use of private vehicle is denoted as. The drivers of tourism carbon footprints are, with each factor's SDA formula as follow:

Technology improvement:

The supply chain:

Tourism consumption:

Population growth:

Tourism expenditure

Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) is the primary data source to capture tourism-related expenditure, which specifies all expenditure relating to domestic and inbound trips spent on businesses registered within the territory. TSAs are only available for 62 countries, and the data is re-categorized based on the Tourism Satellite Account 39 sectors classification system (Supplementary Method 6).

For the 113 countries that do not report TSA, we resort to alternative sources. Inbound tourism expenditure data is obtained from the UN Tourism (World Tourism Organization), and domestic tourism expenditure data is sourced from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). These sources are used to compile the total tourism expenditure, referred to as internal tourism expenditure, for each country.

New and emerging diseases present a constant challenge. Globalization of business, international adoption, immigration, and tourism have contributed to the rapid spread of diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Infectious diseases that emerge in Africa or Asia may arrive on US shores within days. This article reviews the new and emerging pathogens important to dermatologists.

### Transplant tourism: a growing phenomenon [^2bd3c8c8]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Medical tourism is increasing owing to high costs of care, lack of availability or long waits for procedures, and improvements in technology and standards of care in many countries. Transplant tourism is one example of medical tourism that has been attracting increasing attention because of concerns over poor treatment and outcomes of both donors and recipients. Most such cases involve vended kidneys obtained from vulnerable populations, and both donors and recipients receive inferior care by US standards. This commentary discusses a paper by Gill et al. that compared outcomes of 33 transplant tourists with those of patients transplanted at a US center. Fewer complications and better outcomes were seen in patients transplanted in the US center than among transplant tourists. Large transplant centers with long waiting times are increasingly likely to see patients return newly transplanted from overseas; such patients require urgent attention, with particular consideration to infectious complications.

### Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions [^21afe326]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Tourism carbon emissions vary considerably by country. RBA analysis reveals that visitors from the United States produced 1.0 Gt CO 2 -e, accounting for 19% of the total global tourism footprint in 2019. In that year three countries, the United States, China (0.8 Gt CO 2 -e, or 15%) and India (0.3 Gt CO 2 -e, or 6%), produced 39% of global tourism CO 2 -e. The top twenty countries, predominantly highly developed countries with large populations, contributed 3.9 Gt CO 2 -e in total, or three quarters of the total tourism footprint (Fig. 1, left). A substantial inequality in emissions contributions by countries is observed (SI 3–5). DBA analysis again highlights the significance of the United States (19%), China (15%) and India (6%), while several Middle East countries including Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, have emerged in the twenty highest emitting countries due to substantial increases in inbound tourism over the past decade (Fig. 1, right).

### Reproductive tourism as moral pluralism in motion [^4b7bf4b6]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

Reproductive tourism is the travelling by candidate service recipients from one institution, jurisdiction, or country where treatment is not available to another institution, jurisdiction, or country where they can obtain the kind of medically assisted reproduction they desire. The more widespread this phenomenon, the louder the call for international measures to stop these movements. Three possible solutions are discussed: internal moral pluralism, coerced conformity, and international harmonisation. The position is defended that allowing reproductive tourism is a form of tolerance that prevents the frontal clash between the majority who imposes its view and the minority who claim to have a moral right to some medical service. Reproductive tourism is moral pluralism realised by moving across legal borders. As such, this pragmatic solution presupposes legal diversity.

### Label: HAILEY 24 FE-norethindrone acetate and ethinyl… [^c6a84c6a]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
- The most common adverse reactions were: headache, vaginal candidiasis, nausea, menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, mood changes, bacterial vaginitis, acne, and weight gain. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc, USA at 1 721–7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www. fda. gov/medwatch. DRUG INTERACTIONS
- Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
- Lactation: Advise use of another contraceptive method. Hailey 24 Fe can decrease milk production. See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. Revised: 2/2023 Table of Contents.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hailey 24 Fe is contraindicated in females who are known to have or develop the following conditions:

- If feasible, stop Hailey 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during the following prolonged immobilization.
- Start Hailey 24 Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.
- The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10, 000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COCs and when restarting oral contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer.

The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.
5. 5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.
5. 6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Hailey 24 Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.
5.

8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In a clinical trial of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 743 women. A total of 10 subjects discontinued norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

### Medical tourism in plastic surgery: ethical guidelines and practice standards for perioperative care [^7248ed75]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this review was to identify the safety and medical care issues that surround the management of patients who had previously undergone medical care through tourism medicine. Medical tourism in plastic surgery occurs via three main referral patterns: macrotourism, in which a patient receives treatments abroad; microtourism, in which a patient undergoes a procedure by a distant plastic surgeon but requires postoperative and/or long-term management by a local plastic surgeon; and specialty tourism, in which a patient receives plastic surgery from a non-plastic surgeon.

Methods

The ethical practice guidelines of the American Medical Association, International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and American Board of Plastic Surgeons were reviewed with respect to patient care and the practice of medical tourism.

Conclusions

Safe and responsible care should start prior to surgery, with communication and postoperative planning between the treating physician and the accepting physician. Complications can arise at any time; however, it is the duty and ethical responsibility of plastic surgeons to prevent unnecessary complications following tourism medicine by adequately counseling patients, defining perioperative treatment protocols, and reporting complications to regional and specialty-specific governing bodies.

### Transplant tourism or international transplant medicine? A case for making the distinction [^84260577]. American Journal of Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Transplant tourism is routinely denounced by influential voices such as the World Health Organization, the Declaration of Istanbul and the Madrid Resolution as an unethical solution to worldwide organ shortages. Instead, it is suggested that national deceased donor schemes and multinational organ-sharing programs are the only acceptable avenues for addressing the organ shortage crisis. The present demand for self-sufficiency in organ supply responds to risks such as poor clinical outcomes, and exploitation of the poor through the various commercial practices of transplant tourism. However, opponents of transplant tourism say little about what governments should do to ensure that their citizens have real and comprehensive access to all forms of transplantation. To address this complex question, we describe a current practice of international transplant medicine in Singapore. It addresses salient concerns with transplant tourism and supports the principle of national self-sufficiency in organ supply, even as its health care system thrives and expands comprehensive transplant services to its citizens by catering to international patients. We offer a critical appraisal of the Singaporean system, and some suggestions to minimize the risk of abuse by international patients or operatives of illegal organ markets.

### Drivers of global tourism carbon emissions [^f16e3527]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

"Very good" applies to countries that produce their own tourism satellite accounts and national input-output tables. Tourism satellite accounts provide detailed spending breakdowns by sector, allowing for an accurate match of consumption (tourism expenditure) to the MRIO sectors. Additionally, having a national input-output table ensures that local economic information is directly embedded into GLORIA, accurately representing the economic structure of an economy, which is essential for deriving emissions multipliers.

The second grade, "good", includes countries where either the official tourism satellite account or the national input-output table is missing. In such cases, a disaggregation procedure is required to develop a comprehensive tourism spending profile, or trade data is used to estimate the economic multipliers of a given economy.

"Fair" applies to countries lacking both official tourism satellite accounts and input-output tables. In these instances, a higher level of uncertainty in the results is expected, as these two key parameters are based on estimation.

Our model currently includes 62 countries with TSA and IO tables, classified as 'very good', covering 92% of global tourism expenditure (see Supplementary Method 6). The 'good' group comprises 81 countries, while the 'fair' group includes 32 countries — most of which are small countries with a limited scale of tourism activities.

Modelling aviation emissions remains a key challenge in mapping out the global tourism carbon footprint. This study relies on ForwardKeys data to assign passenger emissions (based on a weight-per-passenger estimation, including luggage) to individual countries using CO 2 emissions on a per-route and per-aircraft basis. Our analysis shows that tourism air transport contributed 1.1 Gt CO2 in 2019, including direct emission (passenger transport, 0.96 Gt) and indirect emissions (freight transport due to supply chain activities, 0.14 Gt). While our results on aviation are slightly larger than existing references, it is unclear what is summarized under "aviation" and whether freight aviation emissions are included in these reports.

Overall, the high coverage rate of 92% global tourism expenditure data based on 62 TSA data in the model enables us to model global tourism emissions with a high level of reliability. A Monte Carlo simulation indicated that tourism carbon emissions in 2019 were between 5.1 and 5.5 Gt CO2-e, with a 99% likelihood range (Supplementary Method 2).

### Understanding the complex interplay between tourism, disability and environmental contexts [^0c7cd7dc]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore and describe the complex issues and factors related to participation in tourism as perceived by people with disabilities in Hong Kong.

Method

Naturalistic inquiry using key informant interviews and focus groups with 86 people with disabilities. Interviews were transcribed, translated and coded to develop themes and relationships. Triangulation of three investigators from different backgrounds occurred.

Results

The Process of Becoming Travel Active emerged as a six-stage process, intricately related to the personal/disability context and the environmental/travel context. Personal and environmental factors contribute to the six-stage model explaining the complex interplay between tourism, disability and environmental context.

Conclusion

Understanding the complexity provides insight into ways to increase active participation in tourism. Health, tourism and disability sectors have a role to play in the development of accessible tourism.

### First national consensus on the safe practice of medical tourism for bariatric surgery in Mexico [^9163fe84]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Medical tourism is increasing every year, especially in fields such as bariatric surgery. Global concerns rely on the fact of its safety, mainly because of a lack of standardization, unknown number of cases, and the type of specialists performing such procedures. Mexico continues to be among the top countries receiving patients from abroad, but there is no national consensus, guidelines, or recommendations about the practice in such fields.

Methods

A group of 32 bariatric surgeons with an accumulated experience of 25,196 procedures in the medical tourism modality were gathered to perform a national consensus in bariatric surgery tourism. The Delphi methodology was used for this project, with a total of 52 items applied. A consensus was reached when the experts' position was ≥ 70% for each statement. The items included pre- and postoperative phases, patient selection, follow-up, and ethical and legal considerations.

Results

Of the 52 statements, 40 (76.9%) reached a consensus of ≥ 70%; 36 in favor, 5 against, and 11 with indeterminate responses.

Conclusions

Although more than two-thirds of the statements related to high standard practice reached a consensus, weak points in the medical tourism modality were identified. This first consensus serves to establish the basis of safe practices, eventually reach national guidelines, and define the top standards of care when performing bariatric surgery tourism.

### The 'patient's physician one-step removed': the evolving roles of medical tourism facilitators [^be9af93c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Medical tourism involves patients travelling internationally to receive medical services. This practice raises a range of ethical issues, including potential harms to the patient's home and destination country and risks to the patient's own health. Medical tourists often engage the services of a facilitator who may book travel and accommodation and link the patient with a hospital abroad. Facilitators have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate the ethical concerns associated with medical tourism, but their roles are poorly understood.

Methods

12 facilitators were interviewed from 10 Canadian medical tourism companies.

Results

Three themes were identified: facilitators' roles towards the patient, health system and medical tourism industry. Facilitators' roles towards the patient were typically described in terms of advocacy and the provision of information, but limited by facilitators' legal liability. Facilitators felt they played a positive role in the lives of their patients and the Canadian health system and served as catalysts for reform, although they noted an adversarial relationship with some Canadian physicians. Many facilitators described personally visiting medical tourism sites and forming personal relationships with surgeons abroad, but noted the need for greater regulation of their industry.

Conclusion

Facilitators play a substantial and evolving role in the practice of medical tourism and may be entering a period of professionalisation. Because of the key role of facilitators in determining the effects of medical tourism on patients and public health, this paper recommends a planned conversation between medical tourism stakeholders to define and shape facilitators' roles.

Mexico — availability and quality of medical care and medical tourism considerations include access, payment, insurance acceptance, pretravel consultation timing, documented outbreaks, and medicine purchasing advice. Good health care is available in most cities in Mexico, and tourist hotels and resorts usually have physicians available. Payment (cash or credit card) might be required before any care is given, and most providers do not accept US health insurance or Medicare/Medicaid plans. People considering travel to Mexico for medical procedures are advised to consult with a US healthcare professional ≥ 1 month before departure and to verify healthcare professional qualifications and facility credentials in Mexico. Reported events associated with medical tourism in Mexico include an outbreak of fungal meningitis caused by Fusarium solani associated with epidural anesthesia in cosmetic procedures, Legionella infection associated with dental procedures, nontuberculous skin infections associated with stem cell injections, and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa acquired during bariatric surgery. For purchasing medicines, the FDA recommends only purchasing medications from legal sources in the United States to ensure safety and effectiveness.

### Complications of medical tourism in aesthetic surgery: a systematic review [^5524d58f]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As medical cost continues to rise, so has the use of medical tourism by patients as a more cost-effective alternative. While the upfront cost savings attract many unsuspecting patients from their country of origin, there are significant patient safety issues surrounding short- and long-term follow-up, as well as the management and cost of complications.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses on complications that presented after cosmetic surgeries performed abroad. The literature search was performed on October 18, 2022, using the databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase.

Results

From the 44 studies that were included, 589 patients were identified who presented with complications after having a cosmetic procedure abroad. Infection was the most prevalent complication in this study followed by wound dehiscence, seroma/hematoma, and tissue necrosis. Ninety-eight percent of the infectious organisms were bacterial, and 81% of them were from the Mycobacterium genus.

Conclusions

Cosmetic tourism is a global phenomenon. This systematic review highlights the nature of complications following cosmetic tourism, the surgeries that resulted in complications, the countries that the primary procedures took place in, and the countries of origin of the patients. To aid in reducing morbidity and mortality from cosmetic tourism, regulatory bodies should educate and empower the public to aid them in making educated medical conditions when seeking care.

### Complications associated with medical tourism for facial rejuvenation: a systematic review [^fc5bb6e3]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Medical tourism for cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular in recent years. The existing literature has identified poor outcomes associated with general cosmetic tourism; however, the complications associated with cosmetic tourism for facial rejuvenation remain poorly understood. The aims of this study are to delineate the risk profile associated with medical tourism for facial rejuvenation.

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase was performed through January 2019 using the PRISMA guidelines. Search terms included combinations of keywords including medical tourism and plastic surgery and other related nomenclature. Articles published in English relevant to medical tourism for facial rejuvenation and its associated complications were examined.

Results

We identified six retrospective studies including 31 patients who had obtained facial rejuvenation procedures abroad and experienced treatment-associated complications. Twenty-five of 26 listed patients (96%) were female (age range 33–62 years). Departure nations included the USA, Switzerland, England, Ireland, Australia, and Thailand. Destination nations included the Dominican Republic, Cyprus, the USA, Colombia, Thailand, India, and China. Procedures included blepharoplasty, facelift, rhinoplasty, chin lift, and injections with botulinum toxin and dermal fillers. Complications included abscess, poor cosmesis, facial nerve palsy, and death.

Conclusions

We present the first study to systematically review the complications associated with medical tourism for facial rejuvenation. No definitive conclusions can be made given the paucity of relevant data, its clinical and statistical heterogeneity, and small sample size. Additional research is warranted to help inform patients who seek facial rejuvenation procedures abroad and to better understand the health system implications associated with cosmetic tourism for facial rejuvenation.

Peru — health care access and medical tourism guidance notes that health care outside Lima is not as good and travelers with complex problems need to be evacuated to Lima or to their home country, and that some hotels associated with private hospitals may help contact a physician to evaluate travelers. Language may be a barrier to care, especially in public hospitals, but the US Embassy in Peru has a list of hospitals and physicians that can provide care in English. Purchasing medication in Peru can be challenging because counterfeit medications are present and some medicines might not be available or could have different names, and travelers visiting friends or relatives could identify healthcare sources through local acquaintances. Peru is not a common destination for medical tourism, and medical tourism is not recognized or regulated by the local medical college, which makes it both dangerous and illegal.

### Opportunities to deter transplant tourism exist before referral for transplantation and during the workup and management of transplant candidates [^b79b6805]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Transplant tourism is a global issue, and physicians in the developed world may be in a position to actively deter this practice. To examine such opportunities, we identified 93 residents of British Columbia, Canada who had a kidney graft through tourism and determined their previous interactions with our transplant programs. These patients were mainly ethnic minorities (90%) who traveled to their country of origin for transplantation. Many tourists were transplanted early in their disease course, with 27 having a preemptive transplant. Among the 65 tourists referred for transplant, 33 failed to complete the evaluation. All tourists who completed an evaluation were placed on a waiting list in British Columbia and, after waiting a median of 2 years, pursued tourism. Most of these patients (62%) had a potential living donor, but none had an approved donor, with 13 donors found medically unsuitable, 8 ABO incompatible, and 12 who did not complete their evaluation. Thus, strategies to deter tourism should start before the development of end-stage renal disease and should be part of pretransplant workup and wait-list management, focusing on patients not progressing through their evaluation, those with a declined living donor, and those facing longer wait times, as these groups appear to be at higher risks for transplant tourism. Further studies are needed to identify individuals at risk for transplant tourism and to define effective strategies to deter these individuals.

### Medical tourism in aesthetic breast surgery: a systematic review [^0457839a]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medical tourism is expanding on a global basis, with patients seeking cosmetic surgery in countries abroad. Little information is known regarding the risks and outcomes of cosmetic tourism, in particular, for aesthetic breast surgery. The majority of the literature involves retrospective case series with no defined comparator. We aimed to amalgamate the published data to date to ascertain the risks involved and the outcomes of cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery on a global basis.

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and OVID Medline was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. Keywords such as "medical tourism", "cosmetic tourism", "tourism", "tourist", "surgery", "breast" and "outcomes" were used. Seven hundred and seventy-one titles were screened, and 86 abstracts were reviewed leaving 35 full texts. Twenty-four of these met the inclusion criteria and were used to extract data for this systematic review.

Results

One hundred and seventy-one patients partook in cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery. Forty-nine percent of patients had an implant-based procedure. Other procedures included: mastopexy (n = 4), bilateral breast reduction (n = 11) and silicone injections (n = 2). Two-hundred and twenty-two complications were recorded, common complications included: wound infection in 39% (n = 67), breast abscess/ collection in 12% (n = 21), wound dehiscence in 12% (n = 20) and ruptured implant in 8% (n = 13). Clavien-Dindo classification of the complications includes 88 (51%) IIIb complications with 103 returns to theatre, 2 class IV complications (ICU stay) and one class V death of a patient. Explantation occurred in 39% (n = 32) of implant-based augmentation patients.

Conclusions

Aesthetic breast surgery tourism is popular within the cosmetic tourism industry. However, with infective complications (39%) and return to theatre rates (51%) significantly higher than expected, it is clear that having these procedures abroad significantly increases the risks involved. The high complication rate not only impacts individual patients, but also the home country healthcare systems. Professional bodies for cosmetic surgery in each country must highlight and educate patients how to lower this risk if they do choose to have cosmetic surgery abroad. In this current era of an intra-pandemic world where health care is already stretched, the burden from cosmetic tourism complications must be minimised.

Purchasing medication in Peru can be challenging; counterfeit medications are present, and some medicines might not be available or could have different names, so travelers visiting friends or relatives could identify healthcare sources through their local acquaintances. Peru is not a common destination for medical tourism, and medical tourism is not recognized or regulated by the local medical college, which makes it both dangerous and illegal.

### Population-based surveillance of medical tourism among US residents from 11 States and territories: findings from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system [^63b366b2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe medical tourism among a subset of US residents; identify possible indicators for medical tourism.

Methods

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with 11 states and territories to ask 6 questions about medical tourism, using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Data collected from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, included whether respondents traveled internationally for preplanned care, travel reasons and destinations, procedures received, and occurrence and treatment of complications. A descriptive analysis of demographics, socioeconomic status and health access variables was performed, and a regression model with a log-link function and Poisson distribution was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) for medical tourism.

Results

Of 93,492 respondents, 517 (0.55%) traveled internationally during the previous year for care. Mexico was the most common destination (41% of trips). Dentistry accounted for 55% of treatments. Complications from care received abroad were reported by 5% of medical tourists; 67% sought care upon returning to the United States. The prevalence of medical tourism was 1.32% (95% CI, 1.00–1.64). The prevalence of medical tourism was higher in Hispanics and non-whites (PR, 3.97; 95% CI, 2.48–6.32) and higher among those without current health insurance (PR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.69–4.34).

Conclusions

This is the largest collection of population-based surveillance data describing medical tourism among US residents from multiple states and territories. Understanding the demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with medical tourism can inform evidence-based recommendations for travelers and clinicians who may advise or care for these individuals before, during, or after travel.

### Estimating economic losses to tourism in Africa from the illegal killing of elephants [^e2ad067f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Although the value of ivory from poached elephants on Chinese black markets swamps that of the resulting losses in tourism, ivory benefits are not realized by governments or the people of African range states, apart from the few that are involved in the illegal killing. In contrast, tourism benefits from elephant conservation have the potential to reach a much broader cross-section of Africans, although financial considerations, such as the profit margins of tourism operators and the ability of policy makers to channel revenues from tourism to key stakeholder groups, are obviously critical to ensuring these net benefits are translated into effective conservation action. In particular, it will be fundamental to ensure that local communities and landholders are sufficiently incentivized to embrace living alongside elephants, or at minimum, are sufficiently compensated so as to not collaborate with poaching syndicates (for example, see). Although there is a long history of nature-based tourism benefits not reaching local communities, recent experiences in African elephant range countries have demonstrated some successes in the devolution and capture of benefits from local natural resource management. Ensuring that those who live with elephants are sufficiently compensated and motivated to do so, whether via tourism or other avenues, will play a central role in the success or failure of Africa's elephant conservation efforts.

### Relationship between preoperative surgical fear, anxiety, and satisfaction levels in individuals choosing bariatric surgery tourism: a descriptive, cross-sectional study [^0aad94c4]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this study, conducted to evaluate the levels of preoperative surgical fear, anxiety, and satisfaction with bariatric medical tourism processes among individuals who chose Turkey for bariatric surgery within the scope of medical tourism, as well as to examine the relationships between these variables, it was observed that the vast majority of bariatric medical tourism patients had a high level of knowledge in the preoperative period. Participants reported being highly satisfied with the information provided and stated that they had received detailed explanations regarding bariatric surgery tourism, the importance of routine postoperative follow-ups, postoperative risks, and complication management. The study found that patient satisfaction levels with bariatric surgery tourism were notably high, while fear and anxiety levels related to surgical tourism were moderate. Statistically significant relationships were identified between fear, anxiety, and satisfaction levels. Additionally, patients who had sufficient knowledge about bariatric surgery tourism in the preoperative period demonstrated significantly lower levels of surgical fear and anxiety. The most significant independent predictive variables affecting patient satisfaction were identified as age, the total score on the surgical anxiety scale, and levels of fear and anxiety experienced due to undergoing surgery in a foreign country.

In the context of bariatric medical tourism, these findings highlight the critical role of preoperative education and counseling services in reducing surgical fear and anxiety levels and enhancing patient satisfaction. Specifically, increasing patients' knowledge about postoperative processes, raising awareness regarding complication management, and emphasizing the importance of routine follow-up care can improve both individual and systemic patient outcomes. Surgical nurses should develop tailored educational programs designed to address the specific needs of bariatric surgery tourism patients, monitor their implementation, and ensure the continuity of these programs. Moreover, to address the fear and anxiety associated with undergoing surgery in a foreign country, nurses should adopt a culturally sensitive and empathetic care approach. Such an approach can enhance patient trust, strengthen the nurse-patient relationship, and improve the overall healthcare tourism experience. Randomized controlled trials could be conducted to evaluate the effects of individualized, culturally tailored educational plans or psychoeducation programs implemented by surgical nurses during the preoperative period on surgical fear, anxiety, and patient satisfaction in bariatric surgical tourism patients. Additionally, interventional studies could be carried out to investigate the impact of surgical team members' communication skills on patient satisfaction, as well as levels of fear and anxiety.

### Global supply chains amplify economic costs of future extreme heat risk [^5d094c82]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

In contrast to the Indian food production industry, the Dominican Republic's tourism industry is more constrained by downstream demands. Under the SSP 585 scenario, the wealth generated by tourism in the Dominican Republic could drop substantially, as the largest source of foreign visitors, the USA, is likely to reduce annual demand for tourism in the Dominican Republic on average by around 5.5%. Demand from Malaysia and Indonesia is likely to fall by 6.1% and 8.1%. A drop in tourism output, the backbone of the Dominican Republic's economy, is likely to reduce demand for upstream business services and manufacturing industries by approximately 4.5–4.7%, causing an extra impact on the Dominican national economy. The decline in the tourism sector is also likely to lead to a 4.7% and 4.3% drop in the Dominican Republic's demand for insurance and financial services from the USA, as well as 4.2% and 4.5% drop in the demand for electronic equipment and chemical products from China (Extended Data Fig. 7). Furthermore, a smaller tourism sector leads to the slowdown in the construction of tourism infrastructure and the supply of tourism supporting products, posing considerable risks for tourism investment.

### The economic impact of international travel measures used during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review [^652b483a]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Narrative summary of findings

Generally, these papers found that ITMs negatively affect 'real' economic outcomes — the production and exchange of goods and services. Specifically, the research indicated that industries related to tourism and international trades experienced significant setbacks, resulting in reductions in income and employment. However, the studies found little to no effect, or even a positive impact, of ITMs on financial market indicators, such as the stock market index, abnormal returns, liquidityand volatility. This could be because financial market data immediately take into account expectations of future profits. Strict ITMs create expectations for ending the pandemic sooner, and this positive expectation was revealed by financial market performance.

The effects of ITMs varied widely across countries. For example, a study that investigated abnormal stock returns in 25 countries found a negative effect of international travel restrictions in China, Canada and Russia, a positive effect in Germany, the UK, Turkey, South Korea and Poland, and no effect in the remaining countries. The included studies suggest several potential mechanisms behind the observed heterogeneity. First, the significance of the tourism industry in a country: for instance, the international tourism sectors of Australia and Thailand experienced significant losses, while the US's hospitality industry witnessed a smaller reduction. Second, a country's level of industrialisation and technology stock: one study across Thailand, Singapore and Kenya reported that Thailand's stock index decreased the most after the ITMs, while Singapore was affected the least. The authors argue that businesses in Singapore quickly pivoted to digitalisation, offering products and services suited to pandemic times, while Kenya and Thailand heavily depend on agriculture and manufacturing, which are more challenging to digitalise.

### Relationship between preoperative surgical fear, anxiety, and satisfaction levels in individuals choosing bariatric surgery tourism: a descriptive, cross-sectional study [^adff51a3]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bariatric surgical tourism is a rapidly growing sector. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preoperative surgical fear, anxiety, and satisfaction levels regarding bariatric surgery tourism processes and to examine the relationships between these variables.

Methods

This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted between July and November 2024 with foreign patients who visited the general surgery clinic of a healthcare institution for bariatric surgery within the scope of health tourism. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using the Patient Information Form, Surgical Fear Scale, and Surgical Anxiety Scale. All results were evaluated within a 95% confidence interval, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 39.39 ± 9.35 years, and 88.5% were from the UK. Additionally, 88.5% reported choosing bariatric surgery tourism due to high surgical costs in their home country. The mean score for surgical fear was 37.68 ± 20.58, while the mean score for surgical anxiety was 19.53 ± 12.90. Patients who lacked prior knowledge about bariatric surgery tourism had significantly higher surgical fear and anxiety scores (p < 0.05). Age, fear and anxiety associated with undergoing surgery in a foreign country, and total surgical anxiety scale score were identified as independent predictors of patients' satisfaction with their bariatric surgery tourism experience (R² = 0.130; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Preoperative knowledge levels and satisfaction with the information provided significantly impacted surgical fear and anxiety levels among bariatric surgery tourism patients.

### COVID-19 and cosmetic tourism: a google trends analysis of public interests and the experience from a tertiary plastic surgery centre [^3025a0f1]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

The primary aim of this study was to highlight the burden of cosmetic tourism on the Irish healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our secondary aim was to examine the popularity of cosmetic tourism currently through Google Trends data analysis.

Methods

Data on all patients presenting to our unit with complications of cosmetic tourism were retrospectively reviewed to determine the level of care and resources used for each case. The 'Google Trends' data analysis tool was accessed and the popularity of common plastic surgery topics was analysed over the last two years.

Results

Eight patients were referred for treatment after experiencing complications following elective cosmetic surgery overseas. Complications included seroma 1, infected collection 3, wound dehiscence 5 and implant extrusion. 2 Length of stay ranged from 1 to 18 days with 63% of patients requiring invasive intervention. Google trends revealed that popularity for plastic surgery topics initially decreased at each lockdown date but increased to pre-pandemic interests after a short period. Related search topics for procedures including the terms, "Turkey" and "Lithuania" increasing in popularity by more than 5000%.

Conclusions

This case series shows that despite the current pandemic cosmetic tourism is imposing a significant cost on healthcare resources. Analysis of Google Trends has shown that interest in these procedures is increasing despite travel restrictions and risks associated with the pandemic. The public need to be informed of the potentially negative consequences of cosmetic tourism and be discouraged from undertaking surgery overseas during the current crisis.

Leptospirosis — epidemiology and traveler risk highlights global burden, high-risk regions, activities, and outbreak settings. Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution; however, incidence is greater in tropical climates, and regions with the highest estimated morbidity and mortality include parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Latin America, the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Travelers to endemic areas are at increased risk when participating in recreational freshwater activities, particularly after heavy rainfall or flooding, and prolonged exposure to contaminated water or activities that involve head immersion or swallowing water increase the risk for infection. Participating in activities involving mud and working directly with animals in endemic areas, as well as visiting or residing in areas with rodent infestation, also increases risk, and leptospirosis occurs most commonly in adult males. The estimated worldwide annual incidence is > 1 million cases, including approximately 59,000 deaths. Outbreaks can occur after heavy rainfall or flooding in endemic areas and have occurred after flooding in popular US travel destinations including Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands; most US cases are reported outside the continental United States in the domestic travel destinations of Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

### The 2024 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: facing record-breaking threats from delayed action [^e1c7b1b0]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Section 4: economics and finance

Climate change is profoundly affecting the global economy. Recent data suggest that the world economy is on track to an income reduction of 11–29% by 2050, threatening the social and economic systems on which human health and wellbeing often depend. The damages expected within the next 26 years vastly outweigh the mitigation costs required to limit global heating to 2°C (by a factor of six, according to a recent study). The health impacts of climate change contribute to economic losses, increase health system costs, limit labour productivity, and threaten important economic sectors, including tourism. The resulting deterioration of the socioeconomic conditions that support good health can aggravate health impacts and overburden the most vulnerable countries, widening global inequities.

A swift and just transition to a net zero greenhouse gas economy is, therefore, crucial to limit economic and health-related losses and damages but requires profound structural and economic changes and substantial capital investment. Years of delay in delivering the $100 billion promised annually to support the most vulnerable countries in a just transition have hampered progress and further exacerbated global inequities.

COP28 saw the long-awaited operationalisation of the Loss and Damage fund, an important milestone for a just transition; additionally, $1 billion was committed to climate change and health. Details on how these funds will be disbursed and who will contribute to the Loss and Damage fund will be negotiated at COP29. COP29 will also be the stage for the negotiation of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, setting a new financial goal for supporting countries classified as developing in the context of UNFCCC, in excess of $100 billion.

This section is presented with a new structure, to better reflect the different dimensions of these policy processes. The first set of indicators tracks the economic losses and damages associated with the health impacts of climate change; the second set monitors the extent to which countries are delivering a just, health-promoting restructuring of their economies; and the third set monitors the shift of financial systems away from fossil fuels and towards a health-supporting economy. This year, two new indicators highlight countries' preparedness for such a transition and call out potential losses through stranded assets.

4.1 The economic impact of climate change and its mitigation

As the impacts of climate change grow, so do the associated economic losses. This set of indicators monitors the economic losses resulting from the health impacts of climate change.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rapid increase in international travel. Travel medicine is a branch of preventive medicine focusing on risk assessment pre-travel, during travel and post-travel with the aim of promoting health and preventing adverse health outcomes. Travel medicine specialists inform travelers about potential health risks and mitigate infectious disease risks such as travelers' diarrhea, yellow fever, and malaria. Travel medicine topics were popular in the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conferences between 2016 and 2020, and now comprise approximately 2% of all presentations. Most topics related to the post-travel assessment (50%), followed by diseases contracted during travel (26%), and pre-travel assessment and consultation (24%). Our analysis of the 10 sub-domains of travel medicine issues found that malaria (26%) and immunization (12%) were represented to the greatest extent. We anticipate that both travel and tropical medicine fields will regain their popularity after recovery from the pandemic.

Introduction

From the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been concerns that states are violating their obligations under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR (2005))by imposing restrictions on international travel. These concerns are justified, but in this unprecedented situation, there are few clear answers. What is evident from the unfolding of events is that either the WHO's guidance on travel was wrong and had a serious negative impact on the spread of disease, or states' actions to prevent the spread of disease through travel restrictions have unnecessarily had a serious negative impact on the global economy. We expect the answer is somewhere in between, but it appears that the IHR (2005) framework to prevent unnecessary interference with international travel and trade is not succeeding as intended.

If feasible, stop norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Start norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10, 000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. Unscheduled bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg tablets, 24% to 35% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. A total of 10 subjects out of 743 discontinued due to bleeding or spotting. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets may experience amenorrhea. In the clinical trial with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, 22% to 36% of the women using norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets experienced amenorrhea in at least one of 6 cycles of use. Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets if pregnancy is confirmed. %), vaginal candidiasis, nausea (4.

Cholera transmission — environmental reservoirs, exposure routes, and risk mitigation are summarized as follows: Toxigenic V. cholerae O1 and O139 are free-living bacterial organisms found in fresh and brackish water, often with copepods or other zooplankton, shellfish, and aquatic plants, and infections are acquired most often from untreated drinking water in which toxigenic V cholerae occurs or has been introduced from feces of an infected person. In developing countries, warmer air temperatures coupled with heavy rainfall can overwhelm sanitary infrastructure and drive epidemic cholera, while common vehicles include raw or undercooked food, especially fish and shellfish, with other foods less commonly implicated. Direct person-to-person transmission, including to healthcare professionals during epidemics, has been reported and may be important in some settings, and travelers who consistently observe recommendations regarding safe water, food preparation and consumption, handwashing, and sanitation have virtually no risk of acquiring the disease.

Summary box

Concerns that have been raised about states violating the International Health Regulations (2005) by imposing travel restrictions are valid, and some states have not complied with their obligations under those Regulations.
Given the unprecedented situation and uncertainty about the best course of action, we should not assume that all travel restrictions violate international law, even though they were not recommended by the WHO.
Some travel restrictions are more likely to be justified than others, depending on a number of factors, including how they are designed and local capacity to implement less restrictive measures.
The WHO still has an important role to play in providing guidance to states as they modify or lift travel restrictions.
In order for the international framework to be more effective, the WHO should have more flexibility to make early travel recommendations and develop protocols to facilitate the reopening of borders.

India — Influenza seasonality and vaccination for travelers: Influenza virus circulation in India is almost year-round, with the north peaking after monsoon (July–November) and again in winter (December–February), the south peaking during monsoon (November–February), and the rest post-monsoon (July–November). The World Health Organization recommends the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine for all of India, while India's national policy recommends either the Northern or Southern Hemisphere vaccines and individual states determine which to use. Short-term travelers (< 6 months) are recommended to be up to date using the influenza vaccination offered in their home country; for long-term travelers, determining the state policy and obtaining the vaccine in India may be preferred. Even when vaccinated, travelers should continue behavioral precautions including frequent hand washing and respiratory etiquette.

Enteric fever antimicrobial resistance — multidrug-resistant patterns and fluoroquinolone susceptibility: Established resistance to older antibiotics has led to these agents being recommended only as alternative antibiotics for infections with known susceptibility, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Typhi with resistance to all 3 agents has been present for decades. Regional estimates for MDR enteric fever range from 9% of isolates in South Asia (2015–2018) to 36%–59% in parts of Africa (2010–2014). Fluoroquinolones are still considered the treatment of choice for fluoroquinolone-susceptible infections in adults, but most Typhi and Paratyphi A infections in the United States are fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible, and most (> 85%) fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible infections have occurred among travelers returning from South Asia with associated treatment failure or delayed clinical response.

India — chikungunya, dengue, and Zika for travelers: India has experienced chikungunya outbreaks transmitted by infected Aedes species (Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus); symptoms are similar to dengue and malaria but often with severe and persistent arthralgia, and a vaccine is now available for adults. Dengue, transmitted by Aedes (Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus), is endemic in most parts of India with large outbreaks including urban areas; incidence is greatest during the wet summer season, which includes the monsoon season (June–September). Aedes mosquitoes bite both indoors and outdoors, and travelers to India should take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites. Zika is a risk in India, and women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should review the most recent Zika travel recommendations.

India — vector-borne diseases (chikungunya, dengue, and Zika) — during the last several years, India has experienced outbreaks of chikungunya transmitted by infected Aedes species (Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus) mosquitoes, and a vaccine is now available for adults. Dengue is transmitted by infected Aedes species and is endemic in most parts of India, with large outbreaks including in many urban areas; incidence is greatest during the wet summer season, which includes the monsoon season (June–September). Aedes mosquitoes bite both indoors and outdoors, and travelers to India should take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites. Zika is a risk in India, and because of the possibility for birth defects in infants born to mothers infected with Zika during pregnancy, women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should review the most recent Zika travel recommendations.

Travelers' diarrhea — South Africa: As with most destinations, the risk for travelers' diarrhea in South Africa depends on style of travel and travelers' food choices. In the past, tap water was safe to drink in most major cities; however, frequent nationwide rolling electricity blackouts ("load shedding") in recent years have affected operation of drinking water systems, and water quality is now more variable, so travelers could consider treating tap water or drinking bottled water in cities. In more rural areas, travelers should consume only bottled water. The usual spectrum of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections exists in South Africa. Educate travelers about the prevention and self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Food allergy, stinging insect allergy, and risk for anaphylaxis — pre-travel planning and epinephrine access should include medication review, documentation, and language preparation. The pre-travel appointments for a traveler with food allergy, stinging insect allergy, and others at risk for anaphylaxis should include a review of their current allergens and medication regimen. Provide sufficient prescriptions for the duration of the trip and instruct travelers to purchase sufficient over-the-counter medications in the United States prior to departure. Provide an updated anaphylaxis action plan, review the proper use of their injectable epinephrine device, and ensure that expiration date exceeds period of travel. Instruct travelers to maintain original packaging with identifying information linking them to their injectable epinephrine, and although not required by TSA or airlines, provide a physician's note outlining the medical condition and requirement for injectable epinephrine to prevent concerns arising at security or customs abroad. Injectable epinephrine is generally available by prescription or over the counter in most of North America, Europe, and Australia; however, over half the countries of the world (concentrated in Africa, Central America, South America, and Asia) do not have injectable epinephrine easily available, so prescribe extra injectable epinephrine devices if there is uncertainty regarding the availability of injectable epinephrine, availability of medical care, or language barriers that might limit access in areas of travel. Advise all travelers at risk for anaphylaxis to obtain wallet cards with common emergency medical phrases in the language(s) where traveling and learn key medical phrases and allergen names in the language(s) where traveling.

India — Typhoid and paratyphoid fever prevention — In the United States, approximately 85% of cases of typhoid fever are in people who traveled to India or other countries in South Asia; thus, even for short-term travel, typhoid vaccine is recommended. Patients hesitant to be vaccinated might be persuaded by learning that typhoid fever acquired in South Asia is typically multidrug-resistant and, in a growing number of instances, extensively drug-resistant. Remind all travelers to India to also practice good hand hygiene and to follow safe food and water precautions. Paratyphoid fever, a clinically similar disease caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Paratyphi A, B, and C, has become increasingly prevalent in South Asia, but typhoid vaccines are not protective against this infection.

### Financial implications of atypical mycobacterial infections after cosmetic tourism: is It worth the risk? [^0373909d]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cosmetic tourism has become increasingly popular despite many associated risks. The economic impact of atypical mycobacterial infections in cosmetic tourism is poorly defined in the literature. We sought to investigate the costs and clinical course of patients with these infections.

Methods

A retrospective review of all patients managed by the Plastic Surgery Division at Columbia University Medical Center from 2013 to 2014 with atypical mycobacterial surgical site infections after cosmetic surgery outside the United States was performed. Data including patient demographics, procedure costs, clinical course, impact on daily life, and costs associated with complications were collected using hospital billing information, patient questionnaires, telephone interviews, and clinical charts. Cost analysis was done to identify the personal and societal costs of these complications.

Results

Data from 10 patients were collected and analyzed. Management of mycobacterial infections cost an average of $98,835.09 in medical charges. The indirect cost of these infections was $24,401 with a mean return to work time of 6.7 months. Total patient savings from cosmetic tourism was $3419. The total cost of a mycobacterial infection was greater than $123,236.47. Although the incidence of mycobacterial infection abroad is unknown, the potential cost of an infection alone outweighs the financial benefits of cosmetic tourism if the risk exceeds 2.77%.

Conclusions

Atypical mycobacterial infections as a result of cosmetic tourism come at considerable cost to patients and the health care system. When our results are taken into consideration with other risks of cosmetic tourism, the financial risks likely far outweigh the benefits.

India — Natural disasters and preparedness — "Natural disasters, including cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, and landslides, are not uncommon in India". Travelers "should become aware of the natural disaster risks at their destination". The guidance is to "Encourage US citizens and nationals traveling and living in India to enroll in the US Department of State's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (https://step.state.gov/step) to receive information on safety conditions and to help the US Embassy in India contact them in an emergency, including during natural disasters".

India — leptospirosis risk and precautions: Leptospirosis is endemic with regular outbreaks reported across many states. Travelers should be advised to limit exposure to freshwater, particularly after heavy rainfall or flooding, and drink only potable water. Diagnostic capacity is limited and the disease is often misdiagnosed because symptoms resemble malaria, dengue, hepatitis, and other endemic infections.

Dominican Republic — crime risk and precautions: The risk for crime in the Dominican Republic is like that of major cities in the United States. Although most crime affecting tourists involves robbery or pickpocketing, more serious assaults occasionally occur, and perpetrators might react violently if resisted. Visitors to the Dominican Republic should follow normal safety precautions (e.g., going out in groups, especially at night; using only licensed taxi drivers; drinking alcohol in moderation; and being cautious of strangers). Criminal activity often is higher during the Christmas and New Year season, and additional caution during that time is warranted.
