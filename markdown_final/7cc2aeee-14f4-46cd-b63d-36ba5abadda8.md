## Question

What is the recommended vitamin E dose to cure measles?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended vitamin E dose to cure measles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether vitamin E has any evidence-based role in measles treatment. Then, I should verify what the established measles adjunct therapy actually is and its dosing. Next, I will check for any data linking vitamin E to measles outcomes and assess safety risks. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, direct answer and outline the appropriate, guideline-supported management path, including dosing details and safety considerations.

> Wait, let me verify the core confusion: the evidence base for measles management consistently highlights vitamin A — not vitamin E — as the adjunctive therapy that improves outcomes in measles, and I do not see any documents recommending vitamin E to treat or cure measles. In fact, WHO-aligned case series and reviews emphasize vitamin A supplementation during measles illness, whereas vitamin E is only mentioned peripherally in the context of coexisting deficiencies in marginalized populations, without any treatment recommendation or dosing for measles [^115FPF9Q] [^113HQxxw] [^112XiDZy].

> I need to check the measles-specific vitamin A regimen and be precise about dosing. The WHO-referenced regimen described in hospitalized measles cases is vitamin A 200,000 IU administered intramuscularly and repeated the next day, with recovery reported in that case series; this aligns with the broader statement that measles management includes provision of vitamin A, and reminds me to interpret serum retinol cautiously because circulating levels do not directly reflect liver stores when deciding when to discontinue therapy or in the setting of acute illness and protein-energy malnutrition [^115FPF9Q] [^113HQxxw] [^1127drto].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vitamin E; I should double-check safety data because even if efficacy were unproven, harm would matter. A large meta-analysis found that high-dose vitamin E supplementation (≥ 400 IU/day) was associated with increased all-cause mortality, and FDA labeling warns that vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K–dependent clotting, increasing bleeding risk when total daily intake exceeds recommended limits; a small study in healthy volunteers did not show changes in bleeding time with 800 IU/day over 14 days, but that does not establish safety for ill, hospitalized patients, nor does it support use in measles. Neonatal literature also flags toxicity concerns with excessive intravenous vitamin E dosing in very low birth weight infants, underscoring a narrow therapeutic window in vulnerable populations [^1128mA5B] [^116pYd6u] [^117EZwn6] [^115WWn2U].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if antioxidant rationale might support vitamin E in viral infections; let me reconsider in light of the corpus. The supplied materials show no clinical trials, guidelines, or mechanistic recommendations endorsing vitamin E for measles treatment, whereas multiple sources explicitly recommend vitamin A in measles care, including in severe disease and in hospitalized settings. Given this, I should correct that initial thought: there is no evidence-based vitamin E dose to treat measles, and the appropriate micronutrient therapy is vitamin A, not vitamin E [^113HQxxw] [^115FPF9Q] [^114hP7Aw].

> I should now formulate the direct, clinically actionable answer: there is no recommended vitamin E dose to cure measles because vitamin E is not indicated for measles management in the provided evidence, and high-dose vitamin E may increase harm. For patients with measles — particularly severe cases or those hospitalized — the evidence-supported adjunct is vitamin A, with a regimen of 200,000 IU intramuscularly on day 1 and repeated on day 2 as described in WHO-aligned reports; broader guidance affirms that vitamin A should be provided as part of measles management, while vaccination remains the cornerstone of prevention. Avoid initiating high-dose vitamin E for measles, and be mindful of bleeding risk if a patient's total vitamin E exposure is elevated from drugs or supplements [^115FPF9Q] [^113HQxxw] [^1128mA5B] [^116pYd6u].

> Next, I should review supportive and preventive context to ensure completeness. Measles complications are frequent and severe, and supportive care plus vitamin A can mitigate morbidity; pneumonia is a major driver of poor outcomes, and pediatric reviews underscore vitamin A's role in measles-associated pneumonia, whereas other micronutrients (outside zinc in malnourished children) lack evidence for acute pneumonia care in well-nourished children. Prevention is through routine MMR vaccination at 12–15 months with a second dose at 4–6 years, and post-exposure MMR within 72 hours may be considered in eligible children, all of which reduce the chance that adjunctive therapies would be needed at all [^1177PU96] [^116pnfmG] [^117CXYb7] [^116n9heJ].

Vitamin E is **not recommended** for treating measles. There is **no evidence** that vitamin E cures measles or reduces its complications. The standard of care is **supportive care plus vitamin A supplementation** [^113HQxxw], which reduces measles morbidity and mortality [^114hP7Aw]. High-dose vitamin E may increase bleeding risk [^116pYd6u] and all-cause mortality [^1128mA5B] and therefore should not be used for measles.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for measles management

Measles management is primarily supportive, including hydration, antipyretics, and monitoring for complications. Vitamin A supplementation is **recommended**, especially in children, to reduce morbidity and mortality [^113HQxxw] [^116pnfmG]. Current guidelines do not recommend vitamin E supplementation for measles.

---

## Evidence regarding vitamin E supplementation in measles

No clinical trials have evaluated vitamin E supplementation specifically for measles treatment. The available evidence **does not support** its therapeutic use for measles.

---

## Recommended vitamin E dosing guidelines

Vitamin E supplementation is **primarily recommended for individuals with documented vitamin E deficiency**, such as those with fat malabsorption syndromes or specific genetic disorders [^1133qAn6]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E is:

- **Infants 0–6 months**: 4 mg/day (6 IU/day)
- **Infants 7–12 months**: 5 mg/day (7.5 IU/day)
- **Children 1–3 years**: 6 mg/day (9 IU/day)
- **Children 4–8 years**: 7 mg/day (10.4 IU/day)
- **Children 9–13 years**: 11 mg/day (16.4 IU/day)
- **Adolescents and adults**: 15 mg/day (22.4 IU/day)
- **Pregnant women**: 15 mg/day (22.4 IU/day)
- **Lactating women**: 19 mg/day (28.4 IU/day)

High-dose vitamin E supplementation (≥ 400 IU/day) is associated with **increased all-cause mortality** [^1128mA5B] and **bleeding risk** [^116pYd6u], especially in those with underlying health conditions or taking anticoagulant medications [^111mXcxB].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of vitamin E supplementation

Vitamin E supplementation, particularly at high doses, carries potential risks and side effects, including:

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors [^116pYd6u], increasing the risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications [^111mXcxB].
- **Increased all-cause mortality**: High-dose vitamin E supplementation (≥ 400 IU/day) has been associated with increased all-cause mortality in clinical trials [^1128mA5B].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps may occur with high-dose supplementation.
- **Potential drug interactions**: Vitamin E supplementation may interact with medications such as warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding complications [^116pYd6u].

---

## Comparison of vitamin E supplementation with other treatments

Vitamin E supplementation **has not been shown to be effective** for treating measles or reducing its complications. In contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vitamin A supplementation for measles — particularly in children — given its proven benefits in reducing morbidity and mortality [^111Xz9tx].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no scientific evidence** supporting the use of vitamin E supplementation for treating measles or reducing its complications, and current clinical guidelines do not recommend it for measles management. Instead, **supportive care and vitamin A supplementation remain the standard of care**. High-dose vitamin E supplementation carries potential risks, including increased bleeding [^116pYd6u] and mortality [^1128mA5B], and should not be used to treat measles.

### Low use of vitamin A in children hospitalized for measles in the United States [^114hP7Aw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin A reduces measles morbidity and mortality and is recommended for its management. We studied 142 patients hospitalized at U.S. children's hospitals for measles between January 1, 2004, and March 31, 2019, and found that only 47 (33%) received vitamin A. Patients with complex chronic conditions were less likely to be treated. This study highlights a concerning gap between recommendations and practice for hospital management of measles.

### Measles [^113HQxxw]. The Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Measles is a highly contagious disease resulting from infection with the measles virus. It is still responsible for more than 100,000 deaths every year, down from more than 2 million deaths annually before the introduction and widespread use of the measles vaccine. The measles virus is transmitted via the respiratory route, and the illness begins with fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a characteristic rash. Complications of measles affect most organ systems, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with measles includes the provision of vitamin A.

Measles is best prevented through vaccination. Major reductions in measles incidence and mortality have renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication. However, urgent efforts are needed to increase global coverage with two doses of the measles vaccine through advocacy, education, and strengthening of routine immunization systems. The use of combined measles-rubella vaccines provides an opportunity to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. Ongoing research efforts, including the development of point-of-care diagnostics and microneedle patches, will facilitate progress towards measles elimination and eradication.

### Meta-analysis: High-dose vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality [^1128mA5B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Experimental models and observational studies suggest that vitamin E supplementation may prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, several trials of high-dose vitamin E supplementation showed non-statistically significant increases in total mortality.

- **Purpose**: To perform a meta-analysis of the dose-response relationship between vitamin E supplementation and total mortality by using data from randomized, controlled trials.

- **Patients**: 135,967 participants in 19 clinical trials. Of these trials, 9 tested vitamin E alone and 10 tested vitamin E combined with other vitamins or minerals. The dosages of vitamin E ranged from 16.5 to 2000 IU/d (median, 400 IU/d).

- **Data sources**: PubMed search from 1966 through August 2004, complemented by a search of the Cochrane Clinical Trials Database and a review of citations of published reviews and meta-analyses. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Data extraction**: Three investigators independently abstracted study reports. The investigators of the original publications were contacted if required information was not available.

- **Data synthesis**: Nine of the eleven trials testing high-dose vitamin E (≥ 400 IU/d) showed increased risk (risk difference > 0) for all-cause mortality in comparisons of vitamin E versus control. The pooled all-cause mortality risk difference in high-dose vitamin E trials was 39 per 10,000 persons (95% CI, 3 to 74 per 10,000 persons; P = 0.035). For low-dose vitamin E trials, the risk difference was -16 per 10,000 persons (CI, -41 to 10 per 10,000 persons; P > 0.2). A dose-response analysis showed a. [text is incomplete].

### Koselugo [^116pYd6u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Increased levels of vitamin E and risk of bleeding**: Koselugo capsules contain vitamin E. Specifically, the 10 mg capsules contain 32 mg vitamin E as the excipient, D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS); while the 25 mg capsules contain 36 mg vitamin E as TPGS. Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Daily vitamin E intake that exceeds the recommended or safe limits may increase the risk of bleeding. Supplemental vitamin E is not recommended if the daily vitamin E intake, including the amount in Koselugo and supplements, will exceed the recommended or safe limits.

	- An increased risk of bleeding may occur in patients who are coadministered vitamin-K antagonists or anti-platelet antagonists with Koselugo. Monitoring for bleeding in these patients is advised. Increase international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring as appropriate in patients taking a vitamin-K antagonist. Perform anticoagulant assessments, including INR or prothrombin time, more frequently and adjust the dose of vitamin K antagonists or anti-platelet agents as appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Koselugo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of selumetinib to mice during organogenesis caused reduced fetal weight, adverse structural defects, and effects on embryo-fetal survival at approximate exposures greater than five times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 25 mg/m² twice daily.

### Aquasol A [^1127drto]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Precautions**:

- **General**: Protect from light. Prolonged daily administration of vitamin A doses over 25,000 Units should be under close supervision. Blood level assays are not a direct measure of liver storage, which should be adequate before discontinuing therapy. Single vitamin A deficiency is rare, and multiple vitamin deficiencies are expected in any dietary deficiency.

- **Drug interactions**: Women on oral contraceptives have shown a significant increase in plasma vitamin A levels.

- **Carcinogenesis**: There are no studies showing that administration of vitamin A will cause or prevent cancer.

- **Pregnancy**: See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.

- **Nursing mothers**: The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A, which is 5,000 Units, is recommended for nursing mothers.

### Koselugo [^111mXcxB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Increased Vitamin E Levels and Risk of Bleeding: Advise patients and caregivers to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking a supplement containing vitamin E, a vitamin-K antagonist, or an anti-platelet agent [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:

- Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.
- Advise females of reproductive potential to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
- Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Koselugo and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
- Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Koselugo and for at least 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Koselugo and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Drug Interactions: Advise patients and caregivers to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal products. Inform patients to avoid St. John's wort, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice while taking Koselugo [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Dosing and Administration: Inform patients and caregivers on how to take Koselugo and what to do for missed or vomited doses [see Dosage].

### Tegsedi [^115rVt7s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tegsedi treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised for patients taking Tegsedi. Higher doses than the recommended daily allowance should not be administered to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels, as these levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body.

Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, such as night blindness.

### Vitamin A supplementation and risk of atopy: Long-term follow-up of a randomized trial of vitamin A supplementation at six and nine months of age [^114ELifL]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends high-dose vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children above six months of age in low-income countries. VAS has been associated with up-regulation of the Th2 response. We aimed to determine if VAS is associated with atopy in childhood.

- **Methods**: Infants in Guinea-Bissau were randomly allocated VAS or placebo, either at six and nine months of age, or only at nine months of age. At six months of age, children were furthermore randomized to measles vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine. At nine months of age all children received the measles vaccine. Children were revisited seven years later and skin prick testing was performed. Atopy was defined as a skin prick reaction ≥ 3 mm.

- **Results**: Forty of 263 children (15%) were atopic. Overall, VAS had no significant effect on the risk of atopy (Prevalence Ratio 1.23; 95% CI 0.69–2.18). The Prevalence Ratio was 1.60 (0.66–3.90) for males and 1.00 (0.46–2.15) for females.

- **Conclusions**: There was no significant effect of VAS in infancy on atopy later in childhood. The role of infant VAS in the development of atopy is still unclear.

### Vitamin E supplements in asthma: a parallel group randomised placebo controlled trial [^113A1fBf]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Increased dietary vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced incidence of asthma, and combinations of antioxidant supplements, including vitamin E, are effective in reducing ozone-induced bronchoconstriction. A study was undertaken to investigate the effect of supplementation with vitamin E for 6 weeks on bronchial hyperresponsiveness in atopic adults with asthma.

- **Methods**: 72 participants from a clinical trial register of adults with asthma were randomized to receive 500 mg natural vitamin E or matched placebo for 6 weeks in a placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel group clinical trial. Inclusion criteria included age 18–60 years, maintenance treatment of at least one dose of inhaled corticosteroid per day, a positive skin prick test to one of three common allergens, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (defined as a dose provoking a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) (PD(20)) of 12.25 micromol). Secondary outcomes were FEV(1), forced vital capacity, mean morning and evening peak flow, symptom scores, bronchodilator use, and serum immunoglobulin E levels.

- **Results**: In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, the change in PD(20) was similar in the vitamin E and placebo groups with a mean difference of +0.25 doubling doses of methacholine (95% confidence interval -0.67 to +1.16 greater with vitamin E). There was no effect of vitamin E supplementation on any other measure of asthma control, either in the intention-to-treat or per protocol analysis. There was also no effect of vitamin E supplementation on serum immunoglobulin.

### Measles vaccination in the presence or absence of maternal measles antibody: impact on child survival [^1123yqPT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

Trial diagrams for Trial I and Trial II are shown.

- **Trial I: Early 2-dose MV and vitamin A trial, 1993–1995**:
	- Twenty-seven of 150 (18%) children who received MV at 6 months had detectable measles antibody. Between 6 months and 5 years of age, 16 children died, all of whom had undetectable measles antibody levels at 6 months of age; 13 died after the second dose of MV at 9 months of age and before 5 years of age. Among early MV recipients, vaccination in the presence of measles antibody versus vaccination in the absence of measles antibody was associated with significant survival benefits (MRR, 0 [95% CI, 0–.52]; p = 0.048, log-rank test). No child died of measles infection. The effect was similar for children receiving VAS or placebo with MV. In contrast, among IPV recipients, vaccination in the presence of measles antibody was not associated with benefits (MRR, 1.74 [95% CI, .57–5.34]).

	- **Table 1**: Mortality until 60 months of age in relation to the presence of maternal measles antibody at the time of measles vaccination.

	- **Table 2**: Mortality between 6 months and 5 years of age according to the presence of maternal measles antibodies at time of randomization to measles vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine at 6 months of age (Trial I a).

- **Trial II: Early 2-dose trial, 2003–2007**:
	- Among 450 children given MV at 4.5 months of age, 249 (55%) had measles antibody. Controlled for age, children with measles antibody at measles vaccination had significantly lower mortality until 5 years of age than children without measurable measles antibody.

### Vitamin E in the treatment of uveitis-associated macular edema [^112SYKFi]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether high-dose alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) could reduce vision loss and retinal thickening associated with uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema.

- **Design**: A double-masked, randomized study.

- **Methods**: Uveitis patients with macular edema seen at the NIH were randomized to receive either 1600 IU/day of vitamin E or a placebo for 4 months. Visual acuity and retinal thickening were assessed for efficacy and safety of the high dose of vitamin E.

- **Results**: Changes in visual acuity and retinal thickening were noted.

- **Conclusions**: A four-month oral supplementation with 1600 IU/day of vitamin E had no apparent effect on uveitis-associated macular edema or visual acuity in this small study.

### Variability in the dose of intravenous vitamin E given to very low birth weight infants [^115WWn2U]. Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Vitamin E is required by very low birth weight (VLBW) infants to prevent vitamin E deficiency. However, prolonged intravenous intakes of vitamin E greater than 4 international units (IU)/kg/day often yield potentially toxic serum tocopherol levels. This study was designed to assess the frequency of potentially inadequate or excessive doses of intravenous vitamin E in parenteral nutrition for VLBW infants in the US.

- **Study design**: A questionnaire was sent to the 100 neonatal-perinatal training program centers listed in the 2003 directory of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Using the information provided for each neonatal unit, we calculated the doses of vitamin E (IU/kg/day) that would have been given to infants with body weights of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kg in that unit. The doses were then recoded as inadequate if less than recommended (2.8 IU/kg/day, maximum 7 IU/day) by the American Society for Clinical Nutrition and the AAP. They were considered excessive if greater than 4 IU/kg/day, and frequencies were compared using chi-square analysis.

- **Results**: The 65 centers that responded were predominantly among those that offered the highest level of subspecialty neonatal intensive care (Level IIID). The predicted dose of vitamin E had a median value of 2.8 IU/kg/day for all three weights and was not significantly different among the three weights. VLBW infants with weights of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 kg were predicted to receive doses greater than 4 IU/kg/day in 40%, 31%, and 10% of the NICUs, respectively.

### Amvuttra [^1138ev9k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Reduced serum vitamin A levels and recommended supplementation. Supplement with the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. If ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur, refer to an ophthalmologist.

- **Reduced serum vitamin A levels and recommended supplementation**: Amvuttra treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised for patients taking Amvuttra. Higher doses than the recommended daily allowance should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment, as serum vitamin A levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body. Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, such as night blindness.

### Short-term, moderate dosage vitamin E supplementation may have no effect on platelet aggregation, coagulation profile, and bleeding time in healthy individuals [^117EZwn6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of short-term, moderate dosage synthetic dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate supplementation on platelet aggregation, coagulation profile, and simulated bleeding time in healthy individuals. Alpha-tocopherol is the most biologically active isomer of vitamin E and is traditionally promoted as an antioxidant and therapeutic agent in cardiovascular disease. In vitro studies have suggested that alpha-tocopherol plays a role in the inhibition of platelet aggregation; however, further investigations into the effect of alpha-tocopherol on bleeding in vivo have not duplicated these findings.

A total of 42 healthy volunteers complied with a two-week abstinence period from the use of anti-platelet agents, followed by determination of baseline platelet aggregation properties and coagulation studies using citrated whole blood. Moderate dosage vitamin E (800 IU of dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate) was then self-administered for 14 days with reevaluation of platelet aggregation and coagulation profile, and simulated bleeding time after 14 days of vitamin E supplementation.

Forty subjects completed the four-week study period. All 40 subjects demonstrated normal baseline coagulation studies, and all had collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation assessment performed in triplicate. After vitamin E supplementation, no significant difference was demonstrated in any study parameter.

Dietary supplementation with moderate dosage synthetic dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate did not significantly prolong bleeding or platelet aggregation in the subjects.

### Refocusing vitamin A supplementation programmes to reach the most vulnerable [^116s9yKJ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

Criteria to assess the need for national preventive VAS programmes: U5MR is both an indication of the possible scale of impact for this intervention, given its impact on mortality reduction, and also can be a proxy for VAD in countries where data do not exist.

As an indication of scale of impact, it is well known that at higher rates of U5MR, there are more deaths from infectious causes. So, in populations with a higher U5MR, the impact of VAS on mortality would be likely greater, if all other things are equal. Employing the same logic, in a population with a lower U5MR (i.e. < 25 per 1000 births), the potential for VAS to impact on mortality would be less. Because of this, there is value in identifying a threshold or "cut-off" to reconsider the significance of a VAS programme in that setting.

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on healthy lives has a target for reducing preventable deaths to a U5MR less than 25, in part because this is expected when infectious causes are greatly reduced. Analyses of U5MR over time have revealed that infectious causes have decreased not just in numbers, but also proportionally over time in all countries.

The largest reductions in deaths between 2006 and 2016 were those from various infectious causes. Specifically, measles saw the largest reduction as a cause of death in both the postneonatal period and in children 1–4 years. We also reviewed the Global Burden of Disease data by region, looking at postneonatal and deaths in children 1–4 years in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, and noted the reduction in proportion of infectious causes of deaths.

### Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: Randomised controlled trial [^116zrXZm]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

This is one of the first trials of childhood vaccination with individual randomisation to measure the effect of a vaccine on all-cause mortality. We hypothesised a 25% reduction in mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age but observed only a 22% (95% confidence interval −5% to 41%) reduction, which was not statistically significant in the intention-to-treat analysis. The per protocol analysis suggested a 30% (6% to 48%) reduction in mortality. Among the secondary outcomes, the reduction in mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age was statistically significant for girls in both the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses. We did not find this effect for boys, but the difference in effect between girls and boys was not statistically significant. The study was not powered to test significant differential effects between subgroups in the secondary analyses. The analysis of possible interactions with other trials and campaigns suggested that vitamin A supplementation at birth may have a negative influence on the effect of early measles vaccination.

- **Strengths and weaknesses**: This is the first trial designed to test a non-specific beneficial effect of measles vaccine that may provide some support for such effects, at least for girls. We have conducted one previous trial of a two-dose measles vaccine with the same objective, but it did not yield similar results; this lack of effect was probably due to not controlling for the effect of subsequent DTP vaccinations. To prevent this problem in this trial, we stipulated that the children should have received the…

### Recommendations from meeting on strategies for improving global measles control, May 11–12, 2000 [^1179wCWd]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2000). Low credibility.

During May 11–12, 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and CDC co-sponsored a technical working group meeting. The purpose of this meeting was to review the status of global measles control and regional elimination efforts. They aimed to formulate recommendations to accelerate control activities, particularly in countries and regions with a high disease burden.

### Effect of early two-dose measles vaccination on childhood mortality and modification by maternal measles antibody in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa: A single-centre open-label randomised controlled trial [^114PhMzN]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Block randomisation was conducted using a ratio of 2:1 to assign children to receive early measles vaccination (MV) or no early MV, with 24 envelopes per bag prepared separately for males and females. Same-sex twins drew one envelope and received the same treatment to prevent confusion about which twin received what.

The enrolment team and mothers were not blinded regarding treatment. Mothers in the two-dose group were informed that their child would receive early MV now and would be invited back for MV at 9 months of age. Mothers in the one-dose group were told that their child did not receive MV now but would be invited to receive MV at age 9 months.

A control vaccine could not be used due to the intention to measure the non-specific effects (NSEs) of MV. If placebo had been used, some mothers might have incorrectly believed their child had received MV and might not have sought MV if they moved.

The four-month MV was not recorded on the vaccination card. Consequently, field assistants and staff at health centres and paediatric wards were blinded.

- **Procedures**: Standard Edmonston-Zagreb MV from the Serum Institute of India was used. Quality tests indicated that the mean virus concentration for trial batches ranged from log10 3.67 (95% CI: 3.38 to 3.95) to 3.93 (3.79 to 4.08) CCID50/0.5 ml. A 0.5 mL vaccine injection was administered subcutaneously in the scapular region.

Children were followed at scheduled health centre visits at 9, 36, and 60 months of age. If children were travelling at 9 months, visits continued until they were 18 months old. In addition, children were visited at home every 6 months.

### PediaPred [^115kKTdV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Infections (viral): Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered.

- **Ophthalmic**: Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.

- **Special pathogens**: Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Candida, Mycobacterium, Ameba, Toxoplasma, Pneumocystis, Cryptococcus, Nocardia, etc.

### Vitamin A supplementation among 9–59 month old children in India: Geospatial perspectives and implications for targeted coverage [^113jMZ1C]. BMJ Global Health (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins belonging to the retinoid family and their derivatives (viz, retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, retinyl esters). It mediates important cellular processes in the human body (e.g. phototransduction, cell proliferation, differentiation, signalling) that are critical for vision, growth and development, wound healing, reproduction, and immunity, among other biological functions. Due to the absence of de novo synthesis in humans, vitamin A is an essential micronutrient whose physiological requirement is met by its dietary intake, directly or through its precursor (β-carotene). Thus, poor nutrition and inadequate reserves may lead to vitamin A deficiency (VAD), a condition often exacerbated by infective episodes (e.g. measles, diarrhoea) and common in children under five from developing countries. Globally, an estimated 190 million (or one in three) children below the age of 5 years are afflicted by VAD. Though frequently subclinical, VAD often leads to clinically significant manifestations in children (such as xerophthalmia, keratomalacia, blindness, impaired growth and development, vulnerability to infections, poor wound healing) with far-reaching consequences in terms of both morbidity and mortality.

In view of the above, the WHO endorses the practice of periodically providing prophylactic vitamin A supplementation (VAS) in high doses to children under five in settings where VAD is a public health problem. Childhood VAD has long been recognized as an important but controllable public health problem in India. In fact, recent e

### Chinese medicinal herbs for measles [^114Wa3r4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Measles is an infectious disease caused by the Morbilli virus. Chinese physicians believe that medicinal herbs are effective in alleviating symptoms and preventing complications. Chinese herbal medicines are dispensed according to the particular symptoms. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and possible adverse effects of Chinese medicinal herbs in treating measles.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to March 2009); EMBASE (1980 to March 2009); the Chinese Biomedical Database (1976 to March 2009); VIP Information (1989 to March 2009); and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to March 2009). We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which patients with measles without complications were treated with Chinese medicinal herbs.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We interviewed the study authors by telephone for missing information regarding participant allocation. Some trials allocated participants according to the sequence they were admitted to the trials, using a pseudo-random allocation method; none of the trials concealed the allocation or blinding method.

### Vitamin E supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants [^113pQKfy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Treating very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, excessive doses of vitamin E may result in side effects.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (October 2002), EMBASE (March 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library, 2003, Issue 1, and personal files for clinical trials assessing vitamin E in preterm infants.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected trials analyzing primary outcomes (mortality or combined long-term morbidity) or secondary outcomes (other morbidity) in infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams. The intervention was allocation to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus placebo, no treatment, or another type, dose, or route of administration of vitamin E.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

- **Main results**: Twenty-six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long-term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly reduced the risk of germinal/intraventricular hemorrhage (typical relative risk [RR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73, 0.99), increased the…

### Causes of severe visual impairment and blindness in students in schools for the blind in Northwest Ethiopia [^112by9ZC]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Corneal blindness, primarily due to measles and vitamin A deficiency, remains a significant public health issue in Northwest Ethiopia. This challenge persists, unlike in other low-income countries where improvements have been made. More than three-quarters of the causes of severe visual impairment and blindness (SVI/BL) are potentially avoidable, with measles, vitamin A deficiency, and cataracts being the leading causes.

Concerted and integrated efforts are required by the Ministry of Health and other authorities, primary healthcare workers, eye care professionals, and educators. These efforts should focus on implementing primary healthcare strategies to prevent corneal blindness from vitamin A deficiency and measles, as well as improving the detection, referral, and management of cataracts and refractive errors. Urgent initiatives to enhance measles immunization coverage and vitamin A supplementation are also essential. These initiatives are crucial to reducing under-5 mortality rates and reducing vision loss and blindness in children. The WHO recommends one tertiary-level child eye health facility per 10 million population. Currently, Ethiopia, with a population of over 90 million, has only three such facilities. Strengthening existing facilities and establishing new centers in each region of the country is highly recommended to address treatable causes of childhood blindness.

### Randomized trial of 2 versus 1 dose of measles vaccine: Effect on hospital admission of children after 9 months of age [^117B8HER]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Two doses of measles vaccine (MV) might reduce the non-measles mortality rate more than one dose of MV does. The effect of two versus one dose on morbidity has not been examined. Within a randomized trial of the effect of two doses versus one dose of MV on mortality in Guinea-Bissau, we investigated the effect on hospital admissions.

- **Methods**: Children were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive MV at 4.5 and 9 months of age or the currently recommended dose at 9 months. We compared hospital admission rates among children between 9 and 18 months of age using a Cox regression model with age as the underlying time scale. Half of the children had received neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS) in another trial. The beneficial effect of MV at 4.5 and 9 months on mortality was limited to children who had not received NVAS; therefore, we investigated the interaction of MV with NVAS on admission rates.

- **Results**: Among 5,626 children (2 doses of MV, 1,960 children; 1 dose of MV, 3,666 children), we identified 311 hospital admissions of children between 9 and 18 months of age. Overall, compared to one dose of MV, two doses reduced the risk of hospital admission for children who had not received NVAS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47–0.93]), but we found no effect among NVAS recipients (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.82–1.63]) [P = 0.02 for interaction].

- **Conclusions**: The benefit of two doses of MV was limited to children who had not received NVAS. NVAS is not generally recommended; hence, an early two-dose measles vaccination policy might reduce hospital admissions more than the current policy.

### Why we need to know whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce measles-related morbidity [^1131BWG6]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

In some parts of the world, measles vaccination has resulted in very substantial reductions in measles-related morbidity and mortality. Even so, it has been estimated that 30 million people still contract the disease every year, that nearly 1 million of these die, and that measles-related deaths account for about 10% of all deaths in children under the age of 5 in developing countries. Existing evidence from controlled trials suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis in measles can result in important reductions in measles-related morbidity, and, at a World Health Organization meeting convened in 1993 to decide on research priorities for the treatment of measles, the highest priority was accorded to additional controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotics. As controlled trials of vitamin A in measles have made clear, such trials are feasible. Continued acquiescence in uncertainties about the effects of prophylactic antibiotics in a disease that continues to afflict so many children worldwide is unacceptable.

### Asmanex [^111iXc9c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Immunosuppression and risk of infections**: Persons using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or who are not properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.

### Protective efficacy of standard Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccination in infants aged 4.5 months: Interim analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^116uXJ3F]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

Changes in the epidemiology of measles infection have been notable. A major outbreak of measles occurred in an area that has experienced intense vaccination activities for many years. Despite maintaining over 90% coverage, high mobility in this urban area means that many children move away, and unvaccinated older children may move in. There was an attempt to prevent an outbreak by recommending more general vaccination in conjunction with a vitamin A and missing vaccination campaign carried out by local health authorities in November 2003. International organizations emphasized that the international policy for measles vaccination involves vaccinating before 12 months of age, with infants under 12 months receiving the vaccine.

The epidemiology of measles may have fundamentally changed in recent years. To our knowledge, no study has documented an incidence of 18.6% before 9 months of age in an area with high vaccination coverage. Measles remains a severe disease; the case fatality was high despite intensive surveillance, home visits, doctor follow-ups, and free treatment at the hospital. Many low-income countries have achieved high coverage for measles vaccination over the past 20 years since the universal childhood immunization activities of the mid-1980s reached even the most remote parts of Africa. Increasing numbers of mothers have been immunized in childhood, and re-exposure to the virus may have been limited. Thus, newborn infants may have lower antibody levels, making them more susceptible to measles infection and responsive to measles vaccination.

### Severe measles, vitamin A deficiency, and the Roma community in Europe [^115FPF9Q]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Case-patients 1 and 2 had vitamin A deficiency with values of 0.31 mg/L and 0.2 mg/L, respectively (reference range 0.5–0.8 mg/L). We measured vitamin A levels in blood samples from the next 4 consecutive hospitalized patients with measles, all from the Roma community. They did not have complications of measles but were hospitalized for infection-control reasons. All 4 patients had low levels of vitamin A (0.16–0.34 mg/L).

In case-patient 4, the blood level of retinol-binding protein was 0.026 g/L (normal range 0.02–0.05 g/L), confirming vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A supplementation was administered intramuscularly as recommended by the World Health Organization (200,000 IU followed by a second dose the next day) to each patient. The 6 patients progressed to recovery.

Low levels of vitamin A (0.36–0.46 mg/L) were also found for 2 other patients from the Roma community who did not have measles.

### Severe measles, vitamin A deficiency, and the Roma community in Europe [^112jM3EF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Serum vitamin A concentrations do not always reflect total vitamin A stores. In severe protein–calorie malnutrition and during interinfection, serum retinol levels could be artificially low due to a decrease in retinol-binding protein level. However, the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency is usually supported by low levels of serum vitamin A and levels of retinol-binding protein within the reference range, as described for at least one of the case-patients reported here.

Vitamin A deficiency affects the severity of illness and the rate of deaths associated with measles, and it is known to induce severe measles-related complications in children. These complications include delaying recovery while promoting xerophthalmia, corneal ulcer, and blindness. Acute measles precipitates vitamin A deficiency by depleting vitamin A stores and increasing its utilization, leading to more severe ocular injury. Vitamin A supplementation given to children with measles has been associated with better outcomes. Although it is too early to strongly associate vitamin A deficiency with severe measles in adult patients, such an association is possible. Adults with low levels of vitamin A who are not infected with measles could be at higher risk for more severe disease if they become infected with the virus.

We conclude that all adults who have measles should be assessed for vitamin A and retinol-binding protein concentrations to better understand potential risks and guide treatment strategies.

### What is the appropriate intravenous dose of vitamin E for very-low-birth-weight infants [^115yimHP]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

The Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has endorsed 1 to 2 mg/dl as the normal range of serum tocopherol level. Our Cochrane review has shown that vitamin E supplementation resulting in levels > 3.5 mg/dl, but not 1 week. A fixed daily intravenous dose of vitamin E results in an inverse relationship between serum level and birth weight and poses a risk for both low and high serum tocopherol levels. Therefore, a dose adjusted for weight appears more judicious than a fixed dose per day. Based on currently available data, the AAP and the American Society for Clinical Nutrition currently recommend a routine intake of 2 ml/kg/day of MVI Pediatric (2.8 IU/kg/day) in VLBW infants, with a maximum of 5 ml/day or 7 IU/day.

### Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: Randomised controlled trial [^111Rs3vR]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has declared that it will keep a watch on the non-specific effects of vaccines and has supported the proposition that only randomised studies will provide convincing evidence for, or against non-specific effects of vaccines on mortality. This posed a dilemma, as randomising children to vaccines that are already in the routine schedule is not usually considered acceptable. However, by studying the early administration of the measles vaccine, we have been able to test the possible non-specific effects of the measles vaccine in a randomised trial. The measles vaccine tended to be associated with a beneficial non-specific effect, as we had hypothesised, but the overall result did not reach statistical significance and should be interpreted with caution. However, we had also hypothesised that the effects would be strongest for girls, and the trial suggests that beneficial non-specific effects of the measles vaccine are likely for girls.

Surprisingly, we found an interaction between vitamin A supplementation at birth and the effect of early measles vaccination on mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age; the beneficial effect was much stronger among children who had not received vitamin A at birth. As vitamin A at birth is not WHO policy, further studies are needed to examine the possibility that we may achieve substantial reductions in childhood mortality in low-income countries by giving an additional dose of the measles vaccine before 9 months of age to children who have not received vitamin A at birth.

### Betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate [^116Pr9SA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered.

- **Neurologic**: Reports of severe medical events have been associated with the intrathecal route of administration (see adverse reactions, gastrointestinal, and neurologic/psychiatric sections). Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an intravenous corticosteroid, showed an increase in early mortality (at 2 weeks) and late mortality (at 6 months) in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of corticosteroids, including betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate injectable suspension, should not be used for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.

- **Ophthalmic**: Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, and glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves.

The study covered six contiguous districts in Bissau, and participants were enrolled by the same team at the three health centres covering these districts. The beneficial effect of early measles vaccination tended to be largest in Cuntum, which had not taken part in the first trial of vitamin A supplementation at birth (see below). We adjusted the main results for district by stratification; web table D shows unadjusted estimates. Little difference existed between adjusted and unadjusted estimates.

### Effects of vitamin E administration on serum lipid profile in diabetic patients: a grade-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of RCTs [^117FnTJL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

Linear regression analysis revealed no statistically significant associations between vitamin E dose or duration and any serum lipid outcomes in patients with diabetes. Specifically, changes in triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were not significantly influenced by vitamin E dosage (all p > 0.05) or supplementation duration (all p > 0.05).

- **Non-linear dose–response analysis**: A statistically significant inverse association was found between vitamin E dose and TC levels (coefficient = −18.54, p = 0.008), suggesting that higher doses of vitamin E may reduce TC. However, no significant non-linear relationships were observed for TG, LDL-C, or HDL-C in relation to either dose or duration of supplementation (all p > 0.05).

### Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: Randomised controlled trial [^116YCZa6]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

From the perspective of a randomised trial, this study had several limitations, the most important of which was the lack of blinding of the vaccination status. Mothers bring children's vaccination cards to consultations within the study area to facilitate identification and because it entitles their children to free consultations and essential drugs. However, the health workers, doctors, and nurses in the paediatric ward and at the health centres do not inspect the vaccination cards of sick children to guide the treatment, and they were not aware of the purpose of the study. Their clinical decisions are thus unlikely to have affected survival in a systematic way to the benefit of children who had received the measles vaccine early. If vaccination status had affected treatment practice, it should also have affected the survival of children who had received the measles vaccine at 4.5 months of age and vitamin A supplementation at birth, as the randomisation to vitamin A supplementation or placebo was blind. As this was not the case, we have no reason to think that biased clinical decisions affected the outcome of the trial.

### The clinical significance of measles: A review [^1177PU96]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Forty years after effective vaccines were licensed, measles continues to cause death and severe disease in children worldwide. Complications from measles can occur in almost every organ system. Pneumonia, croup, and encephalitis are common causes of death; encephalitis is the most common cause of long-term sequelae. Measles remains a common cause of blindness in developing countries. Complication rates are higher in individuals over 20 years old, although croup and otitis media are more common in those under 2 years old, and encephalitis is more frequent in older children and adults. Complication rates are increased by immune deficiency disorders, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, intense exposures to measles, and lack of previous measles vaccination. Case-fatality rates have decreased with improvements in socioeconomic status in many countries but remain high in developing countries.

### Mega doses of retinol: A possible immunomodulation in Covid-19 illness in resource-limited settings [^116wRZ9B]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Of all the nutrients, vitamin A has been the most extensively evaluated for its impact on immunity. There are three main forms of vitamin A: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid (RA), with the latter being the most biologically active and all-trans-RA (ATRA) its main derivative. Vitamin A is a key regulator of the functions of various innate and adaptive immune cells and promotes immune homeostasis. Importantly, it augments the interferon-based innate immune response to RNA viruses, decreasing RNA virus replication. Several clinical trials report decreased mortality in measles and Ebola with vitamin A supplementation.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, interventions such as convalescent plasma, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulator drugs have been tried, but most of them are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. The review explores the possibility of mega dose vitamin A as an affordable adjunct therapy for Covid-19 illness with minimal reversible side effects. Insight is provided into the effect of vitamin A on ACE-2 expression in the respiratory tract and its association with the prognosis of Covid-19 patients. Vitamin A supplementation may aid the generation of protective immune response to Covid-19 vaccines. An overview of the dosage and safety profile of vitamin A is presented along with recommended doses for prophylactic/therapeutic use in randomized controlled trials in Covid-19 patients.

### Vitamin A supplementation and BCG vaccination at birth in low birthweight neonates: Two by two factorial randomised controlled trial [^116WJDqw]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Determinants suggested by previous studies

We conducted stratified analyses by season, vaccination status, age at enrolment, and weight group.

Owing to the special policy on BCG vaccination for low birthweight neonates — that is, children should receive a BCG vaccination at a local health center when they have gained weight or are due to receive the DTP vaccine and the oral polio vaccine at 6 weeks of age — there was a large variation in the timing and sequence of vaccinations. The children in our study had 20 different vaccination statuses during 12 months of follow-up. Although many children received the vaccines in the recommended sequence — that is, BCG before DTP vaccine — many also received vaccines out of sequence, such as BCG with DTP vaccine or DTP vaccine before BCG. Deviations from the recommended schedule were more frequent in children outside the Bandim Health Project study area, where health centers are not covered by the Bandim Health Project staff. All analyses of vaccine status were, therefore, adjusted for the Bandim Health Project study area.

At 4 weeks of age, only 11% of the children in the control group had received the BCG vaccination; therefore, we undertook an analysis of the effect of vitamin A supplementation by randomization to "early BCG" or "no early BCG" at birth in children between 0 and 4 weeks of age. The effect of vitamin A supplementation after DTP vaccination was studied by following up the children from the date of the first registered DTP vaccination until death, migration, measles vaccination, or 12 months.

Recommended vitamin A supplementation: Inform patients that Amvuttra treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Instruct patients to take the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g. night blindness) and refer them to an ophthalmologist if they develop these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Pregnancy: Instruct patients that if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking Amvuttra, they should inform their healthcare provider. Inform patients of the potential risk to the fetus, including that Amvuttra treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Effect of an early dose of measles vaccine on morbidity between 18 weeks and 9 months of age: A randomized, controlled trial in Guinea-Bissau [^113Nu9fN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Vaccines are designed to induce immunity to specific diseases, but research has shown that vaccines may yield so-called nonspecific effects (NSEs) involving altered susceptibility to a variety of infectious diseases other than those targeted by the vaccine. Live vaccines, such as the measles vaccine (MV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV), may have beneficial NSEs and reduce overall mortality beyond what is expected from protection against their target diseases. In contrast, inactivated vaccines, such as the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, despite providing protection against the target diseases, have been associated with increased overall mortality.

The beneficial NSEs of MV have been tested in a randomized trial in Guinea-Bissau. In low-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends receiving MV at 9 months of age. This guideline is a compromise between avoiding interference with maternal antibodies, which reduce the antibody response to MV, and minimizing the risk of acquiring early measles virus infection. The Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau conducted a randomized trial (during 2003–2007) to test the NSEs of early MV receipt. Children aged 4.5 months were enrolled and followed until 36 months of age. The intervention group received 2 doses of MV (an early dose at 4.5 months of age and the recommended dose at 9 months of age). The control group received only the recommended dose at 9 months of age. The study showed a 22% reduction (95% confidence interval, −5%–41%) in mortality.

### Diet management in congenital diarrheas and enteropathies - general concepts and disease-specific approach, a narrative review [^1133qAn6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

Dietary management involves recommending a minimal-fat diet for patients with abetalipoproteinemia (ABL), maintaining dietary fat at 30% of the lower limits of normal. Early initiation of vitamin E therapy, preferably before 16 months of age, may prevent neurologic and retinal consequences. However, improvement in neurologic dysfunction can be observed even in those diagnosed as young adults. Orally administered high-dose vitamins are designed to bypass the intestinal chylomicron assembly pathway via the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) pathway through portal circulation. High doses of oral vitamin E are typically given as α-tocopherol supplementation at 50–200 mg/kg/d. Plasma vitamin E concentrations might not accurately reflect the whole-body content of vitamin E; thus, vitamin replacement is essential.

### Childhood pneumonia in low-and-middle-income countries: An update [^116pnfmG]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Micronutrients

Vitamin A is effective for measles-associated pneumonia. When given as an adjunct to the treatment of severe pneumonia in children, zinc significantly reduces mortality. There is no evidence to support the use of other micronutrients in the treatment of acute pneumonia in well-nourished children. However, nutritional support, including vitamins and zinc, should be provided to malnourished children.

### Effect of vitamin A supplementation on measles-specific antibody levels in Guinea-Bissau [^116GSGEz]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

We have previously reported that vitamin A supplementation with the measles vaccine at age 9 months increases measles-specific antibody concentrations in children at age 18 months compared with placebo. We examined these children when they reached ages 6–8 years. Fewer vitamin A-supplemented children had non-protective antibody concentrations (p = 0.0095); among children with protective antibody levels, vitamin A-supplemented children tended to have higher geometric mean antibody titers (p = 0.09). Thus, simultaneous administration of vitamin A and the measles vaccine at age 9 months had a long-term effect on measles-specific antibody levels and may contribute to improved measles control in less-developed countries.

### Nascobal [^116PAaeS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Prior to treatment, obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate diagnostic blood assays [see Drug Interactions (7)].

In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 prior to use of Nascobal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended initial dose of Nascobal is one spray (500 mcg) administered in one nostril once weekly. Administer Nascobal at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids since hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer use of Nascobal in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until after symptoms have subsided.

- **Monitoring, dosage modifications, and treatment duration**:
	- **Monitoring for response and safety**: Monitor serum B12 levels periodically during therapy to establish adequacy of therapy. Obtain a serum B12 level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

	- **Dosage modifications**: If serum levels of B12 decline after one month of treatment with Nascobal, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12 level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12 levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy.

### The role of vitamin E in thermal burn injuries, infection, and sepsis: A review [^1131fmv3]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2022). Low credibility.

The benefits of vitamin E for regulating infection have been demonstrated in clinical human studies, including those involving pneumonia. Shen et al. studied 183 patients with stroke-associated pneumonia who were either untreated or treated with low-dose (50 mg/day) or high-dose (100 mg/day) vitamin E. CD47 and CD55 levels, markers for neutrophil migration and activation, were measured in whole blood on the second day after admission and the day before patient discharge. Although CD55 levels did not differ between groups, CD47 levels increased after the administration of vitamin E compared to patients receiving no treatment, with the highest levels observed in those treated with high-dose vitamin E. The hospitalization time was also shorter for patients treated with vitamin E, leading to better clinical outcomes.

Vitamin E has also been shown to lower pneumonia rates in smoking adults. In a study by Hemila et al, male smokers aged 50 to 69 years were administered 50 mg of vitamin E per day for 5 to 8 years, and the incidence of hospital-treated, community-acquired pneumonia was measured at the end of the study. Among 2,216 patients who smoked 5 to 19 cigarettes a day, the incidence of pneumonia was reduced by 69% in patients receiving vitamin E, preventing pneumonia in 12.9% of these patients. Among 5,253 patients who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day, the incidence of pneumonia in patients taking vitamin E supplements was lowered by 14%, indicating that vitamin E may lower infection rates. In two different studies, smokers, who are known to have an increase in oxidative stress, had better infectious outcomes with the use of vitamin E.

### Severe measles, vitamin A deficiency, and the Roma community in Europe [^112XiDZy]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: The Roma community in Europe is a subgroup of the Romani people, whose origins are in northern India and who have been known in English-speaking countries as "gypsies". Measles outbreaks, including severe cases, were reported in the European Roma community during 2008–2010. We describe the potential roles of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency as risk factors for severe measles in adults from this community.

In Europe, more than 25,000 cases of measles, more than half of which occurred in France, were reported during a 2011 outbreak. The exact proportion of measles cases occurring among the Roma community in France during the outbreak is not available. Measles epidemiology has changed; the disease now mainly affects children under 1 year old and young adults, the latter of whom are mostly unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Roma people in Europe experience some of the worst health conditions in the industrialized world: they live in overcrowded conditions and have limited access to prevention programs and healthcare services. In such populations, deficiencies of vitamins, such as A, C, and E, have been reported. Vitamin A deficiency has been associated with severe cases of measles in children in developing countries. At the time of writing, we did not find published data associating vitamin A deficiency with severe measles among adults. We describe six adults from the Roma community in Marseille, France, who had measles and low levels of vitamin A; two of these individuals had severe measles.

Case-patients 1 and 2 were men who were 21 and 25 years of age, respectively.

### Aquasol A [^116i1n9V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: The intravenous administration of Aquasol A may lead to adverse effects in specific conditions, such as hypervitaminosis A and sensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.

- **Use in pregnancy**: Safety of amounts exceeding 6,000 units of vitamin A daily during pregnancy has not been established at this time. The use of vitamin A in excess of the recommended dietary allowance may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have shown fetal abnormalities associated with overdosage in several species. Malformations of the central nervous system, the eye, the palate, and the urogenital tract are recorded. Vitamin A in excess of the recommended dietary allowance is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If vitamin A is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking vitamin A, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

### Effects of evolocumab on vitamin E and steroid hormone levels: Results from the 52-week, phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled DESCARTES study [^115RT5qN]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

- **Rationale**: Vitamin E transport and steroidogenesis are closely associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism, and evolocumab can lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to low levels.

- **Objective**: The study aimed to determine the effects of evolocumab on vitamin E and steroid hormone levels.

- **Methods and results**: After titration of background lipid-lowering therapy according to cardiovascular risk, 901 patients with an LDL-C ≥ 2.0 mmol/L were randomized to 52 weeks of monthly, subcutaneous evolocumab or placebo. Vitamin E, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and gonadal hormones were analyzed at baseline and week 52. In a substudy (n = 100), vitamin E levels were also measured in serum, LDL, high-density lipoprotein, and red blood cell membranes at baseline and week 52. Absolute vitamin E decreased in evolocumab-treated patients from baseline to week 52 by 16% but increased by 19% when normalized for cholesterol. In the substudy, vitamin E level changes from baseline to week 52 mirrored the changes in the lipid fraction, and red blood cell membrane vitamin E levels did not change. Cortisol in evolocumab-treated patients increased slightly from baseline to week 52, but adrenocorticotropic hormone and the cortisol:adrenocorticotropic hormone ratio did not change. No patient had a cortisol:adrenocorticotropic hormone ratio < 3.0 (nmol/pmol). Among evolocumab-treated patients, gonadal hormones did not change from baseline to week 52. Vitamin E and steroid changes were consistent across subgroups by minimum postbaseline LDL-C < 0.4 and < 0.6 mmol/L.

- **Conclusions**: As expected, vitamin E levels showed significant changes in response to evolocumab treatment.

### Vitamin e supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants [^111JrfZS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Treating very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, excessive doses of vitamin E may result in side effects.

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We searched MEDLINE (October 2002), EMBASE (March 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library 2003, Issue 1, and personal files for clinical trials assessing vitamin E in preterm infants.

We selected trials analyzing primary outcomes (mortality or combined long-term morbidity) or secondary outcomes (other morbidity) in infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams. The intervention was the allocation to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus placebo, no treatment, or another type, dose, or route of administration of vitamin E.

We used standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long-term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin concentration by a small amount and significantly reduced the risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage.

### Wainua [^111cqoBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Supplement with the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Refer to an ophthalmologist if ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur [5.1].

5.1 Reduced serum vitamin A levels and recommended supplementation:

Wainua treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised for patients taking Wainua. Higher doses than the recommended daily allowance should not be administered to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment, as serum levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body.

Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g. night blindness, dry eyes).

### Vitamin A in children hospitalized for measles in a high-income country [^116jW8gP]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Worldwide medical authorities recommend vitamin A supplementation for severe measles requiring hospitalization; however, evidence supporting its use in high-income countries is lacking. A nationwide vitamin A shortage, reported concomitantly with a recent measles outbreak in Italy, provided an opportunity to test the effectiveness of vitamin A in a high-income setting, approximating an unbiased allocation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective controlled cohort study involving children admitted for measles to a tertiary-care hospital in Southern Italy. The primary outcome was the duration of fever. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospitalization, rate of complications, need for antibiotic treatment, and body temperature.

- **Results**: A total of 108 inpatient children (36% female, median age 16.3 months) were enrolled. Thirty-six received 2 doses of oil-based vitamin A according to age, and 72 matched controls received standard care. There were no significant differences between the study groups in the duration of fever (7.03 ± 2.67 vs. 6.82 ± 3.27, P = 0.72), length of hospitalization (median, 5.0 vs. 5.0 days, P = 0.50), maximum body temperature (median, 39°C in both groups, P = 0.23), rate of organ (69.4% vs. 63.9%, P = 0.72) and hematologic complications (41.7% vs. 59.7%, P = 0.12), or need for antibiotic treatment (66.7% vs. 61.1%, P = 0.72). Overall, vitamin A supplementation did not reduce the risk of any complications (relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence intervals: 0.59–2.96).

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin A does not change the clinical course of measles infection.

### The impact of different doses of vitamin A supplementation on male and female mortality. A randomised trial from Guinea-Bissau [^117Fct3r]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) given to children above 6 months of age may reduce overall mortality in low-income countries by 23–30%. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends high-dose VAS at immunisation contacts after 6 months of age. Children between 6 and 12 months are advised a dose of 100,000 IU, and children older than 12 months, a dose of 200,000 IU every 4 to 6 months.

The reduction in mortality is assumed to be due to the treatment and prevention of vitamin A deficiency (VAD). However, this may not be the only explanation. Routine vaccines during childhood have been shown to have non-specific effects on overall mortality. While the live BCG and measles vaccines seem to confer protection against diseases other than the targeted diseases, the inactivated diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine has been associated with increased overall mortality in girls. Our group hypothesised that the effect of VAS on mortality may depend on an amplification of the non-specific effects of the vaccines. If this is true, a high dose of vitamin A would not necessarily be better than a low dose, especially for girls who were also receiving DTP.

Previous trials have, in fact, indicated that a lower dose of vitamin A might be more beneficial than a higher dose in reducing mortality and morbidity. One of the first randomised vitamin A trials used small weekly doses of vitamin A instead of a high-dose supplement, and that study found the strongest beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation.

### Serum tocopherol levels in very preterm infants following a single dose of vitamin E at birth [^114PPrAV]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Our aim was to examine the impact of a single enteral dose of vitamin E on serum tocopherol levels. The study was undertaken to see whether a single dose of vitamin E soon after birth can rapidly increase the low α-tocopherol levels seen in very preterm infants. If so, this intervention could be tested as a means of reducing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Ninety-three infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive a single enteral dose of vitamin E (50 IU DL-α-tocopherol) or placebo within 2 hours of birth. Serum α-tocopherol levels were measured at baseline and 24 hours after dosing.

- **Results**: There was a significant increase in serum α-tocopherol levels in the vitamin E group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: A single enteral dose of vitamin E soon after birth can rapidly increase serum α-tocopherol levels in very preterm infants. To achieve serum α-tocopherol levels > 0.5 mg/dL, a higher dose or several doses of vitamin E may be needed.

### Should we prioritise children 6–23 months of age for vitamin A supplementation? Case study of West and Central Africa [^111Xz9tx]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin A (VA) supplementation is and remains one of the key nutrition interventions implemented at scale. Every year, billions of VA capsules are distributed through the health system to reduce VA deficiency, thereby reducing child morbidity and averting child deaths. However, with the increasing number of countries implementing interventions such as oil fortification and biofortification that can prevent VA deficiencies, continued VA supplementation is now primarily justified by its beneficial effect on reducing child morbidity and mortality. The anti-infectious vitamin was named after its immune-regulating function and beneficial effect in reducing diarrhoea and measles mortality.

The most recent meta-analysis by Imdad et al. suggests that VA supplementation reduces the overall risk of death by 12% for children aged 6–59 months. The certainty of the evidence was rated as high for mortality reductions related to diarrhoea, but to a lesser extent for measles and meningitis. A disaggregated analysis also suggested that the effect of VA supplementation may vary by child age and geography (e.g. Asia vs. Africa). Furthermore, a recent study by Baye et al. indicated that the estimated averted child deaths related to VA supplementation are highly variable among countries in the sub-Saharan African region. This variability can be partly explained by differing levels of all-cause mortality and VA supplementation-amenable child morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the age distribution of child morbidity and mortality can significantly influence the effectiveness of the intervention, as VA supplementation's effectiveness may vary according to these factors.

### Zolgensma [^112dEfwn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Drug interactions**: Where feasible, adjust a patient's vaccination schedule to accommodate concomitant corticosteroid administration prior to and following Zolgensma infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Certain vaccines, such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella, are contraindicated for patients on a substantially immunosuppressive steroid dose (i.e. ≥ 2 weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg or 2 mg/kg body weight of prednisone or equivalent). Seasonal RSV prophylaxis is recommended (General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization [www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/downloads/general-recs.pdf], eds2017). Where feasible, adjust a patient's vaccination schedule to accommodate concomitant corticosteroid administration prior to and following Zolgensma infusion.

### Serum retinol and beta-carotene levels in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [^112WY7xW]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Reduced serum levels of vitamin A affect morbidity and mortality in measles. The authors' newly diagnosed subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (n = 21) and age-matched control groups (n = 20) had mean serum beta-carotene levels of 1.12 ± 0.56 and 1.50 ± 0.52 microg/mL, respectively. Serum retinol < 20 microg/dL was observed in 6 of 21 subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and 0 of 20 control cases (P < .05). Vitamin A deficiency can accompany subacute sclerosing panencephalitis; its contribution to the pathogenesis or course of the disease warrants further investigations.

### Arnuity ellipta [^113WY4p5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Immunosuppression and risk of infections**: Persons using drugs that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, including Arnuity Ellipta, are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The safety and effectiveness of Arnuity Ellipta have not been established in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age, and Arnuity Ellipta is not indicated for use in this population. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the Prescribing Information for VZIG, IVIG, and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.
