## Question

Whats the most aggressive hypertensive medication combo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes the most aggressive antihypertensive medication combination and how to justify it clinically and with references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "most aggressive" in guideline-concordant terms. Then, I should verify which combinations are explicitly endorsed for rapid and large BP lowering. Next, I will review the pharmacologic rationale for synergy and dose-response. After that, I need to check safety constraints and what to avoid. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and confirm it aligns with contemporary guidelines and outcome data.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "most aggressive". In guideline usage, that generally means the regimen that achieves the largest, fastest BP reduction with complementary mechanisms, typically via initial combination therapy rather than sequential monotherapy, and often progressing to triple therapy when dual therapy is insufficient, with attention to tolerability and adherence [^116nKqcH] [^116Uiyap].

> I need to check which combinations are explicitly recommended for aggressive initial control. Contemporary European and North American guidelines converge on starting with two first-line agents from different classes, preferably as a single-pill combination, and then escalating to a three-drug regimen if BP remains above target, typically ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a dihydropyridine CCB plus a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, which is the canonical triple therapy for aggressive control [^116nKqcH] [^111rJjTU] [^116Uiyap] [^115CpYaf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for why this triple is "most aggressive". The RAS blocker suppresses RAAS activation, the dihydropyridine CCB provides direct vasodilation, and the thiazide diuretic reduces plasma volume. Together they target independent pathways and yield additive BP lowering, which is consistently greater than monotherapy and often greater than dual therapy, enabling faster attainment of lower targets in higher-risk patients [^1133UAxf] [^111NJokU] [^113Gme7V].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response and intensity expectations. A recent high-quality meta-analysis shows that dual combinations at one standard dose reduce SBP by about 14–15 mm Hg on average, and each doubling of dose adds roughly 2.5 mm Hg. Triple therapy typically achieves larger reductions, often in the high-intensity range (≥ 20 mm Hg SBP reduction from a standardized baseline), with the caveat that absolute effect size scales with pretreatment BP, so higher baselines yield larger absolute falls [^1133UAxf] [^111HxiRX].

> I should confirm safety constraints and what to avoid in an "aggressive" approach. Guidelines uniformly advise against combining two RAS blockers (ACEi plus ARB or either with a renin inhibitor) due to increased risks of hyperkalemia, AKI, and cardiovascular harm, so the "most aggressive" regimen must still respect this prohibition. Additionally, in frail older adults or those prone to orthostasis, aggressive initiation may be inappropriate, and therapy should be individualized and monitored closely [^114bnyEQ] [^113W3b3c] [^111kNc8j].

> Let me consider practical implementation and adherence, because aggressiveness without durability is not optimal. Single-pill combinations of dual and triple therapy improve adherence and speed of control compared with free combinations, and SPRINT-era regimens frequently used ACEi/ARB plus thiazide plus CCB to achieve intensive SBP targets, underscoring real-world feasibility when carefully titrated and monitored [^114kCRRQ] [^115SvHGx] [^114UJnvA].

> But wait, what if dual therapy suffices in a given patient? Does that change the "most aggressive" designation? The "most aggressive" label applies to the regimen with the greatest expected BP-lowering intensity and guideline endorsement for rapid control; thus, even if some patients ultimately stabilize on dual therapy, the triple combination of RAS blocker, dihydropyridine CCB, and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic remains the reference for maximal initial intensity when aggressive control is indicated, with escalation based on response and tolerability [^116nKqcH] [^116Uiyap] [^111kNc8j].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my synthesis is aligned with guidelines and evidence. The most aggressive, evidence-based antihypertensive combination is a triple regimen comprising a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) plus a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker plus a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic, ideally as a single-pill combination when available, with careful attention to contraindications, monitoring for hypotension or electrolyte disturbances, and avoidance of dual RAS blockade; this strategy maximizes additive BP lowering, accelerates time to target, and is consistently endorsed by major guidelines for patients who require rapid and substantial BP reduction [^116nKqcH] [^116Uiyap] [^111kNc8j] [^1133UAxf].

The most aggressive hypertensive medication combination is a **triple therapy** regimen [^116Uiyap] comprising a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic [^112anHrA], preferably as a single-pill combination [^113VbLPh]. This combination is recommended by the 2024 ESC/ESH guidelines for patients with **BP ≥ 160/100 mmHg** or those needing rapid control, and it achieves greater BP reduction than monotherapy or dual therapy [^1174eNxK] while maintaining good tolerability at lower component doses [^111HxiRX]. Avoid combining two RAS blockers (ACEi + ARB) [^114bnyEQ] due to harm [^113W3b3c], and monitor for hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and renal function during aggressive titration [^notfound].

## Evidence-based aggressive combination therapy

### Triple therapy combination

- **Components**: RAS blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) + dihydropyridine CCB + thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic [^116Uiyap].
- **Rationale**: Targets multiple pathways (RAAS, vascular smooth muscle, and volume) for synergistic BP lowering [^1178Mdxh].
- **Guideline support**: Strongly recommended by 2024 ESC/ESH for BP ≥ 160/100 mmHg or when rapid control is needed [^notfound].
- **Efficacy**: Greater BP reduction than monotherapy or dual therapy; achieves control in ~80% of patients [^113HhyUr].
- **Tolerability**: Lower doses of each component reduce adverse effects and improve adherence [^116qqzbb].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting triple therapy

- **SPRINT**: Intensive BP targets often required ACEi/ARB + thiazide + CCB combinations to achieve < 120 mmHg systolic [^115SvHGx].
- **ACCOMPLISH**: ACEi + CCB outperformed ACEi + diuretic for cardiovascular outcomes, supporting RAS blocker + CCB as a core pair [^112fewAA].
- **Meta-analyses**: Triple therapy achieves greater BP reduction and control than monotherapy or dual therapy [^notfound].

---

## Alternative aggressive combinations

Alternative aggressive combinations include **dual therapy** with a RAS blocker plus a dihydropyridine CCB [^111bBmCr], which provides strong BP lowering and cardiovascular benefit, particularly in high-risk patients [^112fewAA]. Another option is a RAS blocker plus a thiazide diuretic — a classic, effective combination, though ACEi/ARB + CCB may offer superior cardiovascular outcomes in some patients [^111bBmCr].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Hypotension**: Monitor closely, especially in older or frail patients [^113JSXaD].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Watch for hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperkalemia [^notfound].
- **Renal function**: Monitor regularly, particularly with diuretics and RAS blockers [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid dual RAS blockade (ACEi + ARB) due to harm [^114bnyEQ] [^113W3b3c].

## Clinical scenarios for aggressive combination therapy

Aggressive combination therapy is indicated for **stage 2 hypertension** (≥ 140/90 mmHg) [^111kNc8j], especially when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target [^113m3sgA], and for **resistant hypertension**, in which BP remains uncontrolled despite optimal doses of two agents [^1147zhWP]. It is also appropriate for high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease who require rapid BP control [^113GhXGe].

The most aggressive hypertensive combination is **triple therapy** with a RAS blocker, dihydropyridine CCB, and thiazide diuretic [^116Uiyap], supported by guidelines and evidence for rapid, substantial BP lowering. Use is tailored to patient risk, comorbidities, and tolerability, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^112zkx4m].

Study Limitations

First, we pooled together trials with different combinations of antihypertensives, which may have partly contributed to the heterogeneity between trials. However, the total standard dose of each LDC did not explain underlying heterogeneity in BP reduction. Some analyses may be underpowered to detect a difference in adverse events and there were differences in follow-up duration between studies. Further studies of LDCs in different patient populations would be important to determine if differences in tolerability exist. This study was not powered to investigate for clinical event reduction, although the relationship between BP reduction and reduction in major cardiovascular events and death is well established. Finally, this analysis was pooled using study-level data, and more precise estimates of the relationship between pretreatment BP and expected treatment efficacy may be obtained with individual patient meta-analyses.

In conclusion, LDCs in the form of 3 or 4 antihypertensives at less than standard dose are an effective and well-tolerated option for the initial management of hypertension. LDCs offer a "single step" solution that reliably achieves BP target in two-thirds of patients at first follow-up visit and remain superior to usual care that involve clinician-guided uptitration of therapy. Finally, BP reduction with LDCs was associated with trial level pretreatment BP, with greater BP reductions observed in higher grades of hypertension compared to lower or mildly elevated BP.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL SKILLS: In patients with hypertension, low-dose combinations consisting of 3 or 4 antihypertensives each at low dose are well tolerated and associated with significantly greater reductions in BP compared to an initial monotherapy and usual care. The BP reduction of low-dose combinations are highly dependent on their pretreatment BP, with smaller reductions in BP observed in individuals with only mildly elevated BP.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies should evaluate the efficacy and safety of other combinations of antihypertensives and the use of low-dose combinations as an initial treatment option in different patient populations.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — stage-based recommendations are: In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended (1 B-R). In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control (2a C-EO). In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115MpYMG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Most hypertensive patients do not have their blood pressure (BP) controlled by monotherapy. Yet combinations of drugs are not commonly used as initial therapy for hypertension despite studies that suggest the advantages of this approach. 1, 2, 3 Initial treatment of hypertension with combination therapy has been discouraged because of concern about excessive reduction in BP, increased side effects, and the difficulty of attributing adverse events to 1 drug. However, the alternatives also have risks and downsides. The most common practice, long recommended by guidelines, is to start with 1 drug and add another. But this could result in patients continuing to take a drug that is ineffective. Some guidelines recommend tailoring initial therapy to patient characteristics such as age and ethnicity, which may be surrogates for plasma renin status. 4, 5 An alternative is sequential monotherapy to find each patient's best monotherapy, but this takes time and endurance, during which uncontrolled hypertension is not without risk. 6

Evidence that the prompt versus delayed control of BP was of benefit came initially from the VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long‐term Use Evaluation) trial. In that study, a BP difference of −3.8 mm Hg in the first 3 months of the trial was associated with fewer cardiovascular events, particularly stroke and mortality. 7 Recent observational analyses have confirmed that delays in achieving BP control are not benign and that rapid BP control is important. 8, 9

These observations have led to recommendations in some guidelines to consider initial combination therapy in patients with BP > 160/100 mm Hg, but this practice has not been widely adopted. We thought practitioners might be persuaded by a finding that superior BP control by initial combination was sustained — indeed, this possibility was suggested by the results of the VALUE 7 and ASCOT (Anglo Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) 10 studies. In these studies, the BP lowering in participants randomized to the less effective of 2 treatments early in the study "never caught up" with that achieved by the other group, despite the former eventually receiving more drug therapy. Furthermore, our previous study of dual therapy versus monotherapy suggested that participants who began initial dual therapy always appeared to have better BP control than the monotherapy group, perhaps because combination therapy attenuated compensatory changes induced by monotherapy. 11

### Combination antihypertensive drug therapy… [^111Gxq8S]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

4–7 Monotherapy will be ineffective in most high-risk patients with hypertension, including those with renal failure, diabetes mellitus or stage 3 hypertension. These patients will require combination therapy to achieve blood pressure control to the level of 140/90 mm Hg or less. Blood pressure control is probably more important than drug selection. Drug selection is, however, important. Accordingly, one of the authors of this editorial has argued previously that the concept of "preferred" drug therapy is more relevant to most practitioners in optimally integrating the concept of favored drug selection with the all-important goal of attaining the target blood pressure. 8 Typically, a preferred drug is chosen for initial treatment. This drug is then titrated upward until the target blood pressure is achieved or the patient is being given the maximum tolerated dosage.

When blood pressure control is not achieved, a second drug from a different class is added. What does all of this have to do with combination drug therapy. Plenty. Therapy with the low to moderate doses of the two drugs in a combination agent more effectively lowers blood pressure than monotherapy with a higher dosage of either drug alone — and with fewer side effects. 9 Given the newer, more appropriate lower target blood pressures for high-risk patients with hypertension, combination drug therapy will play an increasingly important role in attaining goal blood pressure. For example, the United Kingdom trial 7 found that almost 30 percent of patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension required three or more drugs to achieve an on-treatment blood pressure of 143/81 mm Hg.

Thus, it is relatively easy to deduce from available evidence that combination drug therapy will play an increasing role in achieving goal blood pressures. The clinician is well advised to heed the important advice that Skolnik and colleagues 1 provide about the merits of combination antihypertensive drug treatment. The move to combination antihypertensive drug therapy, even as initial therapy, in high-risk patients with hypertension is long overdue. The many benefits that will accrue from adoption of this therapeutic strategy include improved blood pressure control, fewer drug-induced side effects and lower drug acquisition costs.

Purpose Of Review

Control of hypertension remains sub-optimal with only half of patients achieving adequate control. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommend initial use of two antihypertensive agents in patients with stage 2 hypertension. This review discusses the drug combinations that have additive effects and those that do not provide additional benefit while increasing the adverse events.

Recent Findings

Results from late-breaking trials have shown that combinations of a calcium channel blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor are superior to a diuretic with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for reducing cardiovascular events. Additionally, in patients with vascular disease with relatively 'controlled' blood pressure at baseline, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker did not reduce cardiovascular endpoints compared with either monotherapy and modestly increased the incidence of adverse effects.

Summary

Combination therapy of antihypertensive agents (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretics, and angiotensin receptor blocker/diuretics) as initial therapy in stage 2 hypertension can lead to markedly improved blood pressure control in patients compared with monotherapeutic regimens.

### Combination antihypertensive drugs: recommendations… [^113RewBE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

21 assessed the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive therapy using the cardioselective beta blocker bisoprolol alone and in combination with low dosages of hydrochlorothiazide. The dosages of bisoprolol were 2. 5, 5 and 10 mg per day. The hydrochlorothiazide dosages were 6. 25 and 25 mg per day. The study showed that monotherapy with either agent was more effective than placebo, but that when combination therapy was used, the beneficial effects were greater than when either agent was used alone.
21. 22 of black patients with hypertension compared monotherapy using 20 mg per day of enalapril with combination therapy consisting of 20 mg of enalapril plus
12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day. Combination therapy significantly reduced systolic, diastolic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements compared with monotherapy. Combination therapy controlled blood pressure to a level of less than 140/90 mm Hg in 74 percent of patients.

In this study, 23 505 patients with diastolic blood pressures of 100 to 114 mm Hg received placebo, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide or the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. All drug therapies were more effective than placebo in lowering blood pressure, but the combination antihypertensive therapies produced the greatest effect.
23. The treatments were compared with each other and with placebo. 27 The greatest antihypertensive effect occurred with the combination of 50 mg of losartan and 12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. This treatment reduced diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 78 percent of patients. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers work effectively in combination to lower blood pressure. 30–32 In one representative study, 33 diastolic blood pressures were reduced by 3.

6 mm Hg more with a trandolapril-verapamil combination than with monotherapy using either agent. No increase in side effects was observed for treatment with combined trandolapril and verapamil.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate a three-drug combination, usually a renin-angiotensin system blocker, a CCB, and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, if BP is not controlled with the initial two-drug combination with the maximum recommended and tolerated dose of the respective components.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111NJokU]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — rationale for initial two‑drug therapy for most patients: With the emphasis on achieving a BP target in most patients of < 130/80 mmHg, the majority of patients will require combination therapy, and initial combination therapy is invariably more effective at BP lowering than monotherapy, with even low‑dose combination therapy usually more effective than maximal dose monotherapy. Two‑drug combinations as initial therapy have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, with no or only a small increase in the risk of hypotensive episodes. Although no RCT has compared major cardiovascular (CV) outcomes between initial combination therapy and monotherapy, observational evidence indicates that shorter time to achieve BP control is associated with lower risk, and compared with initial monotherapy, starting with a two‑drug combination exhibits more frequent BP control after 1 year. Previous Guidelines acknowledged initial combination therapy for patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension or patients at high or very high risk, and initial monotherapy was only recommended for grade 1 hypertension and low‑ or moderate‑risk patients. Some low‑ or moderate‑risk patients with grade 1 hypertension may achieve their BP target with monotherapy, but this is unlikely in those with initial SBP > 150 mmHg who would require a BP reduction of > 20 mmHg; however, in patients with high–normal BP and a high CV risk or in frail older patients, treatment initiation with monotherapy may be appropriate because only a small BP reduction may be required to achieve the BP target.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115wkfzb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs) are characterized as follows: Combination therapy "is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy". Initial combination therapy "is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control", and "in general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk". Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that "low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together" reduce BP more than monotherapy "over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention". Observational data note that "SPCs have fewer cardiovascular events and all-cause deaths than those on equivalent multiple-pill combination therapy", and in older patients "BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored… because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop". Supportive text also states that, for appropriate candidates, "starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence".

Review

Achieving recommended goal of blood pressure (BP) { < 140/90 mmHg in all hypertensives, < 130/80 mm Hg in hypertensives with diabetes mellitus (DM) } is difficult in majority of patients with hypertension. Various studies have shown that tight control of BP is required to produce the maximum reduction in clinical cardiovascular end points. The Framingham Heart Study indicated that a 2-mm Hg reduction in average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) could result in a 14% decrease in the risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks and a 6% reduction in the risk of coronary artery disease. A meta-analysis of 9 major prospective observational studies also showed that prolonged reduction in DBP of 5, 7.5, and 10 mm Hg were associated with 34%, 46%, and 56% fewer strokes and 21%, 29%, and 37% lower incidences of coronary heart disease respectively. These data suggest that more aggressive BP lowering might be beneficial. Though single drug treatment may be effective in some, more than 50% will require more than one drug for appropriate control of their BP.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines recommend that therapy with more than one antihypertensive agent be considered in patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than 20 mm Hg or DBP more than 10 mm Hg above goal and among patients at high cardiovascular risk, as determined by elevated BP level and the presence of other risk factors. The approach of combination therapy may be theoretically favored by the fact that multiple factors contribute to the hypertension and achieving control of BP with single agent that acts through one particular mechanism may be unrealistic. Combining the second agent may lead to better control, acting by complimentary mechanism.

This review focuses the need and basis of combination therapy, different classes of combination agents available at present, rationale for their combination, comparisons of these combinations and their effect on the outcome.

### Chlorthalidone (Hemiclor) [^113wk17o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

HEMICLOR is a thiazide-like diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions (1.1).

1.1 Hypertension

HEMICLOR is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults, to lower blood pressure.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

HEMICLOR may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116nKqcH]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Implementation of the 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of hypertension in primary care: the HYPEDIA study [^114UJnvA]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arterial hypertension is a major global public health problem due to its high prevalence in the general population and its association with considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The benefits of blood pressure (BP) lowering treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established. Results of meta-analyses which used data from randomized controlled trials including several hundred thousand patients have shown that a 10/5 mmHg reduction in systolic/diastolic BP is associated with significant reductions in all major cardiovascular events by about 20%.

Despite the proven benefit of the antihypertensive treatment, hypertension awareness and BP control rates have remained poor worldwide. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension identified that poor adherence to treatment and physician clinical inertia (ie, lack of therapeutic action when the patient's BP is uncontrolled) are important causes of poor BP control. In this context, the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines adopted an aggressive stepwise treatment strategy using two-drug single-pill combination at the initial step of the treatment algorithm for most patients. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) constitute the basis of the combination therapy due to their established cardiovascular and renal protective effects together with their excellent tolerability. The initiation of treatment in most patients with a two-drug single-pill combination improves adherence as well as speed, efficiency, and predictability of BP control, resulting in improvement of the hypertension control rates in the general population.

Office BP measurement has been regarded as the "cornerstone" for diagnosis and management of hypertension, because the vast majority of the evidence on the risks associated with elevated BP and the benefits of treatment-induced BP lowering has been based on office BP measurements. Despite the limitations of office BP and the increasing use of out‐of‐office BP using home and less so ambulatory monitoring, at present and for some time to come it is likely that in many people the diagnosis and management of hypertension will be based on office BP measurement alone, especially in primary care. The 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines propose office BP threshold levels for the antihypertensive drug treatment initiation and for treatment targets. Moreover, stricter BP treatment target ranges are recommended for patients aged < 65 years (120–129/70–79 mmHg, systolic/diastolic).

### Irbesartan (Avapro) [^115z3T2v]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1	Hypertension

AVAPRO®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

AVAPRO may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113yhsam]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension — initial combination therapy considerations: Combination therapy for treating HTN is common, and the ACCOMPLISH study confirmed that combination therapy is safe and effective. In ALLHAT, only 26% of participants reached goal blood pressure (< 140/90 mm Hg) with monotherapy, and larger reductions of blood pressure (e.g., 20/10 mm Hg or more) often require at least two medications; initiating therapy with two drugs is effective and well tolerated, apart from a slight increase in dizziness incidence for some combination dosing. The systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG update did not identify any studies that met inclusion criteria comparing one-drug initiation with sequential titration versus two-drug initiation, but providers and patients may wish to consider combination therapy when selecting initial therapy. Initial combination therapy may reduce the number of titrations and visits to achieve blood pressure goal, patients with a compelling indication for more than one class of antihypertensive agent may benefit from initial combination therapy, and combination pills, when available, may reduce medication co-payments. Whether using sequential or initial combination therapy, providers should attempt to achieve dosing ranges that have been found to impact important clinical outcomes, recognizing that fixed-dose combination therapy may not always be available or prescribed.

Hypertension in diabetes — initial number of medications: Those with blood pressure between 130/80 mmHg and 150/90 mmHg may begin with a single drug, whereas for individuals with blood pressure ≥ 150/90 mmHg, initial pharmacologic treatment with two antihypertensive medications is recommended to more effectively achieve blood pressure goals; single-pill antihypertensive combinations may improve medication taking in some individuals.

### Antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure in diabetic and nondiabetic patients: the lower, the better? [^117VpQmr]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

International guidelines on hypertension recommend maintaining blood pressure (BP) below 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic in the general hypertensive population up to the age of 80 years. A more aggressive BP target is recommended when the hypertensive patient has an additional risk for cardiovascular disease, such as if the patient has diabetes, renal disease, or a prior history of cardiovascular disease. In these situations, guidelines encourage decreasing BP below 130/80 mmHg to grant additional cardiovascular protection.

In the last 2 years, the target BP values recommended by guidelines have been the object of some dissenting views, based on the argument that these targets are often not supported by evidence from prospective randomized trials and that lowering BP too aggressively may do harm rather than ensuring protection. This article addresses this issue by examining three sets of relevant studies: randomized trials, post hoc analysis of prospective studies, and studies on organ damage. Because of space limitations, thedo not include all single trials mentioned; the reader can refer to a recent document of the European Society of Hypertension for this information. This is the case also for the acronym of the trials quoted in Fig. 1.

### Hypertension management in type 2 diabetes mellitus: recommendations of the Joint National Committee VII [^111KdNmY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

HTN in patients who have diabetes should be managed aggressively; the goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg should be attained if clinicians seek to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for these patients. Along with instituting medical therapy after HTN is detected, lifestyle modifications need to be managed aggressively, together with strict glycemic and lipid control. Early management and optimization of treatment of HTN can delay and possibly prevent progression of cardiovascular complications, such as CAD, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Studied approaches to treat HTN in diabetics have included ACEIs and ARBs. Either class of medication, generally in combination with a thiazide diuretic, should be considered as initial therapy. Calcium antagonists, BBs, and alpha-antagonists also have a role in this population of patients, usually as third- and fourth-line add-ons. The importance of using agents that block RAAS is becoming understood better. Typically, three or more antihypertensive medications plus lifestyle interventions are required to achieve a goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Managing patients who have diabetes and HTN is a dynamic, ever-changing challenge. Early and aggressive antihypertensive therapy pays off; it is hoped that the insights in this article enable clinicians to meet the challenge more successfully.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### New approach to blood pressure control: triple combination pill [^113VbLPh]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control remains insufficient worldwide, mostly due to poor adherence to treatments, clinical inertia, adverse effects and underuse of drug-combination strategies. Monotherapy and its uptitration have been long considered the first-line strategy in the treatment of hypertension, often leading to ineffective, time consuming and frustrating results. On the other hand, several studies have demonstrated that starting and continuing antihypertensive therapy based on a drug combination is associated with a greater reduction of BP, an earlier achievement of therapeutic goals and a higher proportion of patients achieving targets with favorable implications on cardiovascular events. However, one-fourth to one-third of hypertensive patients fail to achieve BP control even with dual combination therapies, requiring three or more antihypertensive agents. The aim of this review is to discuss the effects of triple-drug associations in terms of BP lowering and prevention of major cardiovascular events, also in high-risk patients. We also discuss available data on side effects and tolerability of triple combination therapy, and the advantages to use a single-pill formulation to promote simplification and adherence to therapy. The findings reported have provided the background for most recent international guidelines on hypertension that support the use of dual and triple combination therapy for most patients.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

### Telmisartan (Micardis) [^112RJRUs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

MICARDIS is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

MICARDIS may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^114BZaic]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Combination therapy of hypertension with separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill offers the potential to lower blood pressure more quickly, obtain target blood pressure, and decrease adverse effects. Antihypertensive agents from different classes may offset adverse reactions from each other, such as a diuretic decreasing edema occurring secondary to treatment with a calcium channel blocker. Most patients with hypertension require more than a single antihypertensive agent, particularly if they have comorbid conditions. Although the Joint National Committee guidelines recommend diuretic therapy as the initial pharmacologic agent for most patients with hypertension, the presence of "compelling indications" may prompt treatment with antihypertensive agents that demonstrate a particular benefit in primary or secondary prevention. Specific recommendations include treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, or aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients with heart failure. For hypertensive patients with diabetes, recommended treatment includes diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or calcium channel blockers. Recommended treatment for hypertensive patients with increased risk of coronary disease includes a diuretic, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or calcium channel blocker. The Joint National Committee guidelines recommend beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients who are postmyocardial infarction; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease; and diuretic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for recurrent stroke prevention in patients with hypertension.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Single-pill combination product availability of the antihypertensive regimens used for intensive systolic blood pressure treatment in the systolic blood pressure intervention trial [^114k1zf1]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Single-pill combination (SPC) antihypertensive products improve blood pressure control and medication adherence among patients with hypertension. It is unknown to what degree commercially available SPC products could be used to target an intensive systolic blood pressure goal of < 120 mm Hg.

Methods

This cross-sectional analysis included participants randomized to the intensive treatment arm (goal systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg) of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) using ≥ 2 antihypertensive medication classes at the 12-month postrandomization visit. Antihypertensive medication data were collected using pill bottle review by research coordinators, and regimens were categorized by the unique combinations of antihypertensive classes. We calculated the proportion of regimens used, which are commercially available as one of the 7 SPC class combinations in the United States as of January 2023.

Results

Among the 3833 SPRINT intensive arm participants included (median age, 67.0 years; 35.5% female), participants were using 219 unique antihypertensive regimens. The 7 regimens for which there are class-equivalent SPC products were used by 40.3% of participants. Only 3.2% of all medication class regimens used are available as a class-equivalent SPC product (7/219). There are no SPC products available with 4 or more medication classes, which were used by 1060 participants (27.7%).

Conclusions

Most SPRINT participants in the intensive arm used an antihypertensive medication regimen, which is not commercially available as a class equivalent SPC product. To achieve the SPRINT results in real-world settings, maximize the potential benefit of SPCs, and reduce pill burden, improvements in the product landscape are needed.

### Hypertension management 2011: optimal combination therapy [^114CD6yS]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Raised levels of blood pressure result from the complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors. The complexity of blood pressure control mechanisms has major implications for individual responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs. The underlying haemodynamic disorder in the majority of cases is a rise in peripheral vascular resistance. This observation led to the discovery and development of increasingly sophisticated and targeted vasodilators, although many of the earlier antihypertensive drugs, by virtue of their actions blocking the sympathetic nervous system, had a vasodilator component to their mode of action. A recent meta-analysis of placebo controlled trials of monotherapy in unselected hypertensives, reports average (placebo-corrected) blood pressure responses to single agents of 9.1 mmHg systolic and 5.5 mmHg diastolic pressure. These average values disguise the extremely wide ranging responses in individuals across a fall of 20–30 mmHg systolic at one extreme, to no effect at all, or even a small rise in blood pressure at the other. The second factor determining individual responses to monotherapy is the extent to which initial falls in pressure are opposed by reflex responses in counter regulatory mechanisms that are activated following the blood pressure reduction. Thus, a satisfactory blood pressure response is rarely reached with monotherapy alone. What then is the next step if blood pressure is not a goal after the patient has been treated with monotherapy for a few weeks? Should you uptitrate, substitute or combine?

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate therapy with a two-drug combination in most patients with HTN. Prefer combinations of a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a CCB or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic. Consider using other combinations of the five major drug classes.

### Candesartan cilexetil (Atacand) [^111tjA2f]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

ATACAND is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in children 1 to < 17 years of age, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

ATACAND may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Single pill combination therapy for hypertension: new evidence and new challenges: combination therapy for hypertension [^116DkB2F]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) continues to be one of the most important risk factors for major cardiovascular events and mortality. The global prevalence of hypertension is approximately 30% among adults over 20 years old. Cardiovascular risk stratification is crucial to determine the most appropriate pharmacological therapeutic strategy for hypertensive patients. Despite the many scales to stratify risk, none is perfect and represents weighted mathematical models to determine risk at 10 years. Reports have identified numerous limitations, and the challenge persists. A practical way to determine CV risk is the clinical approach based on 1) the number of risk factors, 2) the degree of elevation of blood pressure, 3) the presence of target organ damage/DM/CKD, and 4) a history of major cardiovascular events. Currently, it is recommended to start with dual therapy in a single pill (either ACE inhibitors or ARB2 + dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic); however, many patients could need to start with triple therapy (low or standard doses) if they belong to the high- or very high-risk group with elevation grade 2 or 3 of blood pressure. This article discusses this topic and establishes some practical recommendations for the physician of first contact.

### Monotherapy vs combination treatments of different complexity: a meta-analysis of blood pressure lowering randomized outcome trials [^113Gme7V]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of drug combinations is recommended by hypertension guidelines for most patients because of the greater blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect compared with monotherapy. However, no evidence is available on outcome benefits of treatment strategies based on drug combinations vs. simpler treatment regimens, using data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We evaluated drug combination therapies of different complexity.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for BP-lowering RCTs that compared combination treatment or monotherapy vs. placebo, no-treatment or less-complex treatment. Combination treatment was considered as follows: background treatment continued during follow-up on top of the trial drug(s) of interest and drug(s) were added to the initial drug(s) of interest in the majority of the patients. Monotherapy was considered whenever pre-randomization treatment was withdrawn or absent and a single drug was administered at randomization. Complexity of treatment indicates the higher averaged number of daily medications used in the eligible RCTs.

Results

We selected 93 trials (290304 patients; follow-up, 3.9 years). The on-treatment mean number of drugs was 2.10 and 0.99 in the more and less actively treated patients, respectively. Compared with placebo, no-treatment or less-complex treatment, combination treatments of any complexity (mean number of drugs, 1.40 vs. 0.41, 2.32 vs. 0.48, 2.56 vs. 1.62 and 3.14 vs. 2.19) were associated with reduction of all or most fatal and nonfatal outcomes. There was also an increased rate of side effects leading to treatment discontinuation, although in absolute numbers the benefit usually prevailed.

Conclusion

These data provide randomized-based trial evidence that antihypertensive combination treatment up to three or more drugs is protective. The net benefit, however, may be attenuated when side effects are considered.

### Aprocitentan (Tryvio) [^114b3nvf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TRYVIO, in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure (BP) in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other drugs. Lowering BP reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes. There are no controlled trials demonstrating reduction of risk of these events with TRYVIO.

Control of high BP should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve BP goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs) — use and candidate criteria: Combination therapy is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering blood pressure (BP) and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy, although a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed. Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably an SPC; available randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy. Several small RCTs have demonstrated that low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together reduce BP more effectively than monotherapy over 3 to 6 months of treatment, although none of these trials have evaluated cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk. For candidates for initial combination therapy — nonfrail adults with SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 10 mm Hg from target — starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence; BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop. In most cases, SPCs are a cost-effective alternative to multiple pill combination therapy and allow longer follow-up intervals between medication intensifications, but because SPCs are not available with every possible combination, in some cases the use of separate agents may be more or equally effective.

### Low-dose combinations with 3 or 4 blood pressure-lowering medications for the treatment of hypertension [^111HxiRX]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The magnitude of BP benefits for LDC was similar irrespective of whether LDCs are used as initial therapy among those untreated at baseline or among those on monotherapy at baseline — these findings therefore call in to question the requirement for separate evidence in these 2 patient populations in some regulatory guidelines. We did however observe significant heterogeneity between the trials according to trial level pretreatment BP in terms of BP reduction with LDC compared to placebo. Each 10 mm Hg increase in trial level pretreatment SBP was associated with a 6 mm Hg increase in the mean difference in SBP between LDC and placebo. This phenomenon has been previously described by Wald et aland other authors as Wilder's principle — pretreatment value determines post-treatment response. Wald et alreported a 1 mm Hg increase in SBP reduction for monotherapy for each 10 mm Hg higher trial level pretreatment SBP with monotherapy and a 2 to 3 mm Hg for dual and triple therapy. Our data indicate trial level pretreatment BP has a larger impact on BP efficacy with LDCs. The clinical significance is that LDCs can be expected to be very effective at high BP levels, but at lower starting BP levels, LDCs are less potent. This means LDCs are associated with a small increase in symptoms of hypotension such as dizziness (about 3% to 4% absolute increase in our analyses compared to placebo and monotherapy) but also that higher dose combinations may be needed to reach aggressive BP targets.

Evidence Supporting SPCs

The literature on SPCs focuses on efficiency, adherence (also known as compliance), persistence, and safety. Over time, these notions permeated to several, – but not all, – guidelines. What is the evidence?

Randomized Clinical Trials

Our extensive literature review revealed only one randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a SPC with its components. The COACH Study (Combination of Olmesartan Medoxomil and Amlodipine Besylate in Controlling High Blood Pressure) was a double-blind trial, conducted at 172 clinical sites in the United States. Patients aged 18 years or older with a diastolic BP ranging from 95 to 120 mm Hg were randomized in equal proportions to combination therapy with olmesartan/amlodipine (daily doses, 10/5, 20/5, 40/5, 10/10, 20/10, or 40/10 mg) or monotherapy with olmesartan (10, 20, or 40 mg) or amlodipine (5 or 10 mg). Of 4234 patients, who entered the 2-week washout phase, 1940 (45.8%) were randomized (women, 45.7%; mean age, 54.0 years; mean entry BP, 164/102 mm Hg) and 1689 (87.1%) completed the 8-week trial. Predictably, each treatment modality, compared with placebo, produced dose-dependent decreases in systolic and diastolic BP and at each dose, combination therapy reduced BP more and achieved BP control more frequently (< 140/ < 90 and < 130/ < 90 mm Hg in diabetic patients) than the equivalent dose of the single-component drug. Limitations of the COACH trial were selection of patients (45.8% of those screened were randomized), the short washout (2 weeks) and follow-up (8 weeks), the highly predictable BP results, and the post hoc analysis of patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

### Is it time to move to multidrug combinations? [^115b7nia]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical benefit of aggressive blood pressure (BP) control in reducing adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes is well documented. However, a majority of patients with hypertension remain poorly controlled with monotherapy and require two or more agents to achieve their target BP levels. Patients with hypertension who also have diabetes or renal disease benefit from even lower BP targets, but may be more difficult to treat and require three or more drugs to achieve control. Using two or more drugs, each at lower doses, is usually more effective and less commonly associated with adverse effects than higher doses of a single drug. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes and renal disease, the treatment of hypertensive patients with multidrug combinations will become even more common. Knowing how specific combinations can be used effectively will be an important component of the treatment strategy for hypertension.

1.1 Hypertension

EPANED is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and children older than one month [see Pediatric Use (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14)].

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

EPANED is effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of EPANED and thiazides are approximately additive.

EPANED is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients, EPANED increases survival and decreases the frequency of hospitalization.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^1133UAxf]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

We aimed to quantify the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations from the five major drug classes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adult participants randomly assigned to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. Eligibility criteria included follow-up duration between 4 weeks and 26 weeks, antihypertensive drug treatment fixed in all participants for at least 4 weeks before follow-up blood pressure assessment; and availability of clinic blood pressure for the calculation of mean difference in systolic blood pressure between treatment groups. Crossover trials with less than 2 weeks' washout between the crossover periods were excluded. Eligible studies published between database inception and Dec 31, 2022 were identified from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Epistemonikos; searches were updated to include studies published between Jan 1, 2023, and Feb 28, 2025. The primary outcome was placebo-corrected reduction in systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure-lowering efficacy was estimated using fixed-effects meta-analyses standardised to mean baseline blood pressure across included trials. Drug regimens were categorised into low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to systolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of < 10 mm Hg, 10–19 mm Hg, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively, from a baseline of 154 mm Hg. A model was developed to calculate efficacy for any combination of antihypertensives and validated on external trials of dual and triple combination antihypertensives. The study protocol was registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410036).

Findings

We analysed 484 trials including 104176 participants (mean age 54 years [SD 8], 57422 [55%] men, 46754 [45%] women, and mean baseline systolic blood pressure 154/100 mm Hg). Mean follow-up duration was 8.6 weeks (SD 5.2). On average, monotherapy at standard dose reduced systolic blood pressure by 8.7 mm Hg (95% CI 8.2–9.2), and each doubling in dose conferred an additional 1.5 mm Hg (1.2–1.7) reduction. Dual combinations at one standard dose conferred a 14.9 mm Hg (95% CI 13.1–16.8) reduction in systolic blood pressure, with each doubling of doses of both drugs conferring an additional reduction of 2.5 mm Hg (1.4–3.7). Each 10 mm Hg decrease in baseline systolic blood pressure reduced pressure-lowering efficacy by 1.3 mm Hg (1.0–1.5) for monotherapies, although differences between drug classes were observed. Among 57 monotherapies at standard dose, 45 (79%) were classified as low intensity. Of 189 different drug-dose dual combinations, 110 (58%) were classified as moderate intensity, and 21 (11%) as high intensity. There were considerable differences in dose-response and baseline blood pressure-response relationships between and within drug classes. The efficacy model showed a high correlation between predicted and observed systolic blood pressures when validated on external trials (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

These analyses provide robust estimates of the expected blood pressure-lowering effect for any combination of antihypertensive drugs, allowing their efficacy to be classified into low, moderate, and high intensity.

### Effect of cardiometabolic risk factors on hypertension management: a cross-sectional study among 28 physician practices in the United States [^1127M1G8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study design enabled us to assess the co-occurrence of cardiometabolic risk factors in a large hypertensive study population representing a "real-world" setting among physician practices across the US, and to estimate the impact of specific overlapping risk factors on BP control. 82% of our hypertensive study population had one or more additional cardiometabolic risk factors: almost half were obese, and 1 in 4 had diabetes. With the exception of patients with only hypertension and dyslipidemia, patients with 1 or more CMRFC were less likely to have controlled BP. The odds of BP control for hypertensive patients with all 3 CMRFCs were 23% of the odds of control for hypertensive patients with no CMRFCs, yet, on average, patients with all 3 CMRFCs were prescribed less than 1 additional antihypertensive medication class than patients with no CMRFCs. The increasing obesity prevalence and the deleterious effect of obesity on BP control is a key public health concern. Health care providers and public health officials must consider the potential compounding effects of increased obesity on BP control in future years. The high prevalence of CMRFCs in hypertensive patients presents a challenge to the management of BP, and should be considered when selecting each patient's most appropriate antihypertensive medication regimen, with consideration given to both specific medication classes comprising the regimen, as well as the overall intensity of the therapeutic regimen (dosage strength and/or number of medications used in combination). More aggressive hypertension management strategies for obese and/or diabetic hypertensive patients are warranted to improve BP control in these difficult-to-treat patient subgroups.

### Irbesartan [^114febe9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Irbesartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^115ZRxpK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of dual therapy, either with 2 different subclasses of antihypertensive agents, given as separate medications, or as an FDC medication for patients with stage 2 hypertension (JNC 8 report defines as ≥ 160/100 mm Hg; 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines define as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) or whose baseline BP was > 20/10 mm Hg above the BP target. However, our analysis revealed a declining trend in the use of FDC, which is not consistent with the guidelines. FDC have been advocated as a beneficial choice for BP treatment, as they can reduce the pill burden, enhance patient uptake and adherence, achieve adequate BP control, and lower rates of adverse events. However, contrary to the recommendation, and in accordance with our findings, FDC use has consistently declined over time in our study, NHANES, Medicare, and national prescription sales data from 2009 to 2014. The low uptake of FDC may be due to limited options for combinations of subclasses in FDC compared with individual medications and a restricted ability to flexibly titrate medications. Cost is unlikely to be a major factor, as 90% of FDC medications are available in generic form. Since 2017, other guidelines such as the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertensionand the World Health Organization 2021 guideline on the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adultshave also emphasized the use of combination therapy, preferably with FDC, as an initial treatment for those requiring pharmacological treatment. Although FDCs continue to have a role in hypertension management, clinical guidelines could promote specific FDCs that should be used as first‐line therapy, with clear guidance on how to best combine antihypertensive subclasses to promote necessary polytherapy and more aggressive BP management. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for this decline and its implications for patient outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Combination antihypertensive therapy — drug classes to avoid and allowed exceptions: High-quality RCT reports demonstrate that simultaneous administration of RAS blockers (ie, an ACEi combined with an ARB or an ACEi or ARB combined with the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren) increases the risk of CVD, kidney disease, and hyperkalemia, and drug combinations with agents that have similar mechanisms of action or clinical effects should be avoided; for example, 2 drugs from the same class should not be administered together (eg, 2 different BB, ACEi, or dihydropyridine CCB), and 2 drugs from classes that target the same BP control system are less effective and potentially harmful when used together (eg, ACEi and ARB). Exceptions include concomitant use of thiazide-type and potassium-sparing diuretics, and thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine CCB can be combined for additional BP-lowering in selected patients.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. 4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5.

Special Populations These general antihypertensive therapy recommendations complement treatment recommendations for each disease state. In some cases, antihypertensive medications may be used to treat the underlying disease regardless of blood pressure. For this reason, these recommendations should be used in conjunction with disease-specific guidelines. 31 The JNC8 found insufficient evidence to recommend preferential use of ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure and hypertension 6; however, the JNC8 recommendations were published before the PARADIGM-HF results. The beta blockers carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol, and bisoprolol have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality. One of these agents should be initiated in patients with HFrEF unless they have contraindications. 32–34 Beta blockers are usually added once the patient no longer has symptoms of volume overload.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

### Anti-atherosclerotic therapies: milestones, challenges, and emerging innovations [^114ngB3S]. Molecular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

To achieve contemporary blood pressure targets, combinational therapy is often required. Thus, several single-pill combination therapies have been widely used, and these antihypertensive treatments are among the most remarkable achievements in modern clinical medicine. Even with these accomplishments, resistant hypertension, defined by uncontrolled blood pressure despite the use of a diuretic and ≥ 2 antihypertensives drugs at the maximum tolerated dose, persists in 12%–14% of treated hypertensive patients. It has been reported that patients with resistant hypertension experience higher rates of target organ damage compared to those with well-controlled blood pressure. Moreover, 3% of these patients who do not achieve blood pressure control even with ≥ 5 antihypertensive therapies are defined as refractory hypertensive, and those with refractory hypertension were found to have higher prevalence ratios for Black race, diabetes mellitus, and albuminuria, compared to those with resistant hypertension. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are still needed to combat resistant and refractory hypertension.

### Management of cardiovascular risk with RAS inhibitor / CCB combination therapy [^115ZSezz]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney disease and heart failure. Considerable research has been undertaken to delineate the differential effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents in delaying or preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although possible benefits may result from specific agents or classes of agents in certain high-risk subgroups, prompt and intensive blood pressure (BP) reduction to target levels remains the most crucial factor in this benefit. Despite this, the BP remains above the target level in a large majority of patients, reinforcing the need for improved treatment paradigms. Among antihypertensive agents, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system — angiotensin-II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors — and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP-CCBs) have been shown to provide safe, effective and well-tolerated BP control. These agents have also been proven as effective as, and in some cases superior to, other classes of agents in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As the majority of high-risk patients require at least two and possibly even three medications to achieve the target BP, combination therapy with these two classes of drugs is a rational approach to therapy. Whether fixed-dose combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor plus a DHP-CCB affords greater clinical benefit compared with other combination regimens remains to be determined in large, prospective clinical trials. Meanwhile, such a combination offers effective, convenient, well-tolerated control of the most important modifiable risk factor for CVD.

Pharmacotherapy for hypertension — combination antihypertensive therapy may allow for use of lower doses of individual agents and, therefore, minimize adverse drug effects, but clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether specific combinations and doses are more effective than a maximum-level dose of a single agent for blood pressure control and medication adherence; trials should also focus on comparative effectiveness of equivalent doses of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide and newer antihypertensive agents, such as vasodilatory beta-blockers in essential HTN, and in RHT, future studies with long-term follow-up that would allow evaluation of clinical outcomes are needed to establish optimal fourth-line antihypertensive agents in RHT and whether variations in patient characteristics may necessitate differential approaches to a fourth-line agents for RHT.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^111gnkci]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

### Highlights of the 2024 Chinese hypertension guidelines [^1146fuak]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2024 Chinese hypertension guidelines has been recently issued by Chinese Hypertension League (CHL), joint with partner societies. Since the 2018 guidelines was released, amount of evidence accumulated, in favor of intensive blood pressure (BP) control. New drugs and devices, innovative concepts and new insights have been introduced into hypertension management. The hypertension control rate improved gradually in past 30 years, while the constantly increased population of hypertension and high-normal BP still brought huge burden in China. More efficient, precise and individualized strategies for BP control are needed. The new guidelines integrated the latest evidence from epidemiological studies and clinical trials, particularly included recent data from Chinese populations, together with new concept and insights of hypertension management from the globe. In brief, the 2024 Chinese hypertension guidelines insists on 140/90mmHg as the office BP thresholds for hypertension diagnosis. Ambulatory or home BP monitoring are recommended as alternatives for diagnosis. Validated smart wearable devices are introduced for hypertension screening and monitoring. A combined BP level and CV risk -based treatment strategy is still adopted. A more aggressive BP target (< 130/80mmHg) is recommended for most, including those at high CV risk, if tolerable. Low-sodium and potassium-rich salt substitute and Chinese heart-healthy diet are recommended and sleep and mental health are added in addition to traditional life style changes. New drugs and more flexible combination protocols, and concise treatment algorithm are introduced. Management of hypertension in special populations are updated and specific phenotype, for instance morning and nocturnal hypertension are addressed.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^116ET2nc]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

More than 70% of adults treated for primary hypertension will eventually require at least two antihypertensive agents, either initially as combination therapy or as add-on therapy if monotherapy and lifestyle modifications do not achieve adequate blood pressure control. Four main classes of medications are used in combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension: thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACEIs and ARBs should not be used simultaneously. In black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be treated initially with a beta blocker and an ACEI or ARB (or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), followed by add-on therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a diuretic based on volume status. Treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria should include an ACEI or ARB plus a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated similarly to those without diabetes unless proteinuria is present, in which case combination therapy should include an ACEI or ARB.

### Resistant hypertension [^1147zhWP]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Hypertension that remains above 140/90 mmHg despite the use of three antihypertensive drugs in a rational combination at full doses and including a diuretic is known as 'resistant'. The percentage of hypertensives whose condition is resistant varies in large part upon the setting: those seen in general practice show a prevalence of perhaps 5%; those seen by nephrologists, probably 50%. This paper reviews the major causes of resistant hypertension and provides specific recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with this threatening condition.

### Cardiovascular benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade in patients achieving tight blood pressure control and with resistant hypertension [^111bBmCr]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2017 hypertension guidelines lowered systolic blood pressure (BP) goals to < 130 mm Hg and redefined resistant hypertension. We investigated if these changes alter the cardiovascular benefits demonstrated by combining a calcium channel blocker (CCB), rather than hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI).

Methods

In this post hoc analysis of the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial (n = 11,506), we compared the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac death, and coronary revascularization) between the 2 combination-treatment limbs in patients achieving a systolic BP ≤ 130 mm Hg and those with "apparent resistant hypertension" (prescribed ≥ 4 antihypertensive medications).

Results

Among study patients, 5,221 (45.4%) achieved a systolic BP ≤ 130 mm Hg. There were fewer primary endpoints in the amlodipine/benazepril (9.2%) vs. the HCTZ/benazepril (10.9%) limb (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–0.99). There were also fewer primary endpoints in the amlodipine/benazepril (12.8%) vs. the HCTZ/benazepril (15.2%) limb (n = 4,451, 38.7%) among patients with apparent resistant hypertension (HR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.70–0.95).

Conclusions

Combination therapy adding a CCB, rather than HCTZ, to an ACEI was more effective in preventing composite cardiovascular events even in hypertensive patients achieving aggressive systolic BP targets as well as in those with apparent resistant hypertension. Our findings add support that most patients, including those following contemporary clinical guidelines, will benefit from this combination.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114kCRRQ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Single-pill combination therapy as usual therapy for hypertension — the 2013 ESH/ESC Guidelines favored the use of combinations of two antihypertensive drugs in a single pill, because reducing the number of pills to be taken daily improves adherence and increases the rate of BP control, and this recommendation is endorsed by the current Guidelines. In addition, the advantage of treatment simplification and adherence suggests that use of the polypill may be considered in patients with hypertension as substitution therapy when prior separate-tablet effectiveness of each component has been established.

### Antihypertensive medication regimens used by US adults with hypertension and the potential for fixed-dose combination products: the national health and nutrition examination surveys 2015 to 2020 [^115zqLQ7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Blood pressure (BP) control rates among patients with treated hypertension have plateaued at 68% as of 2020. Most patients with hypertension require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control. Yet, recent data show that 40% of US adults with treated, uncontrolled BP are only taking 1 antihypertensive medication. This treatment gap represents a major missed opportunity to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

Fixed‐dose combination (FDC) products conveniently formulate ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications with complementary mechanisms of action into 1 pill. FDCs improve medication adherence and BP control rates, translating to fewer CVD events. FDC products that combine antihypertensive medications and other cardiovascular therapeutics (ie, statins and aspirin) have also been evaluated to reduce CVD risk. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association BP guidelines endorse the use of antihypertensive FDCs for patients who are initiating treatment or remain uncontrolled on their current regimens. Despite guideline recommendations, < 20% of patients with hypertension are taking an FDC. As of January 2023, there are 29 FDC antihypertensive products available on the US market, 26 (90%) of which are generic.

To achieve their full potential, FDC products consisting of the actual combinations of antihypertensive medications used by adults with hypertension must be available, and providers must prescribe them. The extent to which currently available FDC products meet the needs of the real‐world treatment patterns in US adults with hypertension is unknown. Therefore, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we detail the antihypertensive medication regimens used by US adults taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications and estimate the degree to which currently available FDC products satisfy these real‐world treatment patterns.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^115WstSF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

What are the preferred drug classes for combination regimens?

A range of mostly two-drug antihypertensive SPCs is available. Preferred drug classes for combination regimens target the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CCBs and diuretics, with selection dependent on individual patient factors, including additional CV risk factors and comorbidities. For example, in patients with diabetes and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, which together confer a greater risk of renal damage, combination therapy with a RAS blocker is preferred because these agents offer a superior protective effect against initiation and progression of nephropathy. In patients with renal disease, antihypertensive therapy should aim to target a range of markers of renal (and CV) risk, such as serum creatinine, urine albumin:creatinine ratio, microalbuminuria and proteinuria, usually by RAS blockade, with a view to reducing and slowing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and CV events. Microalbuminuria in particular is a marker of global CV risk and is very common in patients with hypertension. Several position statements also recommend combined therapy that includes RAS blockers. The American Society of Hypertension indicated a preference for RAS blockers in combination with either a diuretic or CCB, with SPCs rather than separate agents preferred when convenience outweighs all other considerations. In addition, the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks (IHSB) recommend a RAS blocker-diuretic or CCB combination in patients with BP > 15/10 mmHg above the target goal. IHSB guidance extends to recommending combination with CCB over diuretics where appropriate (in absence of oedema and/or volume-overload states) due to superiority for hard clinical outcomes.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112zkx4m]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — drug treatment strategy states that among all antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics are indicated as the basis of therapy because they have demonstrated effective reduction of BP and cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials. Combination treatment is recommended for most hypertensive patients as initial therapy, and preferred combinations should comprise a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic, though other combinations of the five major classes can be used. It is recommended that beta-blockers are combined with any of the other major drug classes when there are specific clinical situations such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control. It is recommended to initiate antihypertensive treatment with a two-drug combination, preferably in a single-pill combination (SPC), with exceptions for frail older patients and those at low risk and with grade 1 hypertension (particularly if SBP < 150 mmHg). It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a two-drug combination, treatment should be increased to a three-drug combination, usually a RAS blocker with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably as an SPC. It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination, treatment should be increased by the addition of spironolactone or, if not tolerated, other diuretics such as amiloride or higher doses of other diuretics, a beta-blocker, or an alpha-blocker. The combination of two RAS blockers is not recommended.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Effect of combination therapy on adherence among US patients initiating therapy for hypertension: a cohort study [^1167qNB7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

New trial evidence suggests that many patients may require more aggressive pharmacologic management to achieve lower blood pressure goals. Especially when first initiating anti-hypertensive treatment, it is unknown whether starting patients on multiple medications may be better for long-term adherence and persistence compared with starting one medication.

Objective

To examine contemporary patterns of anti-hypertensive therapy initiation and compare long-term adherence and persistence among patients initiating fixed-dose combinations and single anti-hypertensive therapies.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Patients

Using claims from a large nationwide insurer, we identified all patients initiating oral hypertension treatment from 2009 to 2013. We categorized patients into three categories based on the number and type of anti-hypertensive medications they initiated: a fixed-dose combination, a multi-pill combination or a single therapy.

Main Measures

The primary outcome was persistence to any anti-hypertensive medication, either the initiated medication or other anti-hypertensive, 12 months after initiation in administrative claims. We also measured adherence to at least one anti-hypertensive in the 12 months after initiation and refilling at least one anti-hypertensive medication as outcomes. Full adherence was defined as having ≥ 80% of potential days covered with medication. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were used to examine the association between initiating a fixed-dose combination anti-hypertensive and medication outcomes.

Key Results

Of the 484,493 patients who initiated oral anti-hypertensives, 78,958 patients initiated fixed-dose combinations, 383,269 initiated a single therapy, and 22,266 initiated multi-pill combinations. Patients initiating fixed-dose combinations were 9% more likely to be persistent (relative risk [RR]: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.08–1.10) and 13% more likely to be adherent (RR: 1.13 95% CI: 1.11–1.14) than those who started on a single anti-hypertensive therapy. Refill rates were also slightly higher among fixed-dose combination initiators.

Conclusions

Fixed-dose combination pills appear to enhance adherence and persistence to anti-hypertensive medications among commercially insured patients starting treatment compared with single therapy.

### Evidence for a combined approach to the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia [^114q7jQi]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The recognition that hypertension and dyslipidemia coexist more often than would be expected by chance and that their combination increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) has important implications for patient management. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and healthy individuals with multiple CVD risk factors — including concomitant dyslipidemia and hypertension-are the primary focus of updated treatment guidelines for CVD prevention. There is a need for a treatment paradigm shift from the diagnosis and treatment of individual CVD risk factors to the assessment and management of total CVD risk. Goals for each CVD risk factor need to be intensified when multiple sources of risk are present. Patients who have no overt disease but who have multiple CVD risk factors are now understood to be at high risk and should be the target of aggressive primary preventive strategies to avert unnecessary morbidity and mortality. It is also becoming clear that CVD risk factors interact at the level of the endothelium to promote atherosclerosis. Furthermore, recent clinical trials, including those assessing atherosclerotic progression and CVD endpoints, have demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions targeted at multiple risk factors for CVD.

### Treatment patterns and blood pressure control with initiation of combination versus monotherapy antihypertensive regimens [^111qBbM6]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Many patients with hypertension require 2 or more drug classes to achieve their blood pressure (BP) goal. We compared antihypertensive medication treatment patterns and BP control between patients who initiated combination therapy versus monotherapy. We identified adults with hypertension enrolled in a US integrated healthcare system who initiated antihypertensive medication between 2008 and 2014. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, antihypertensive medication, and BP were extracted from electronic health records. Antihypertensive medication patterns and multivariable adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of achieving the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline-recommended BP < 130/80 mmHg were evaluated for 2 years following treatment initiation. Of 135971 patients, 43% initiated antihypertensive combination therapy (35% ACE [angiotensin converting enzyme] inhibitor (ACEI)-thiazide diuretics; 8% with other combinations) and 57% initiated monotherapy (22% ACEIs; 16% thiazide diuretics; 11% β blockers; 8% calcium channel blockers). After multivariable adjustment including premedication BP levels, patients who initiated ACEI-thiazide diuretic combination therapy were more likely to achieve BP < 130/80 mmHg compared with their counterparts who initiated monotherapy with ACEI (PR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.08–1.12]), thiazide diuretic (PR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.18–1.24]), β blocker (PR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.14–1.20]), or calcium channel blocker (PR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.22–1.29]). Compared with initiating monotherapy, patients initiating ACEI-thiazide diuretic combination therapy were more likely to achieve BP goals.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, subsequent therapy, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to add additional antihypertensive drugs if target BP levels are not achieved with standard-dose monotherapy.
Choose add-on drugs from first-line choices, such as thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics or CCBs with either ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers.
Be cautious when combining a nondihydropyridine CCB and a β-blocker.
Do not combine an ACEi and an ARB.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^116qqzbb]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Meticulous control of blood pressure is required in patients with hypertension to produce the maximum reduction in clinical cardiovascular end points, especially in patients with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus where more aggressive blood pressure lowering might be beneficial. Recent clinical trials suggest that the approach of using monotherapy for the control of hypertension is not likely to be successful in most patients. Combination therapy may be theoretically favored by the fact that multiple factors contribute to hypertension, and achieving control of blood pressure with single agent acting through one particular mechanism may not be possible. Regimens can either be fixed dose combinations or drugs added sequentially one after other. Combining the drugs makes them available in a convenient dosing format, lower the dose of individual component, thus, reducing the side effects and improving compliance. Classes of antihypertensive agents which have been commonly used are angiotensin receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, beta and alpha blockers, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are effective, as well as combinations that include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, in reducing BP. The majority of currently available fixed-dose combinations are diuretic-based. Combinations may be individualized according to the presence of comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, heart failure, thyroid disorders and for special population groups like elderly and pregnant females.

### Update on the drug treatment of hypertension in patients with cardiovascular disease [^115ZHdAF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The management of the high-risk patient with hypertension has become more challenging in recent years. Drug therapy should be initiated earlier and at lower blood pressure levels in patients with coexisting cardiovascular or kidney diseases. The blood pressure goals of drug therapy are substantially lower when patients have concomitant heart or kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. Numerous clinical trials in tens of thousands of hypertensive patients with increased cardiovascular risk have demonstrated that the calcium antagonists are as effective and safe as diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, and renin-angiotensin blocking agents to prevent heart attack and stroke but not heart failure. Several recent studies also demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers are effective in preventing stroke, progressive renal insufficiency, and heart failure in higher risk patients with hypertension. To achieve the aggressive blood pressure goals in patients with cardiovascular disease, thoughtful combinations of additive or synergistic agents improve efficacy and tolerability and have become an integral part of the modern management of hypertensive patients with coexisting cardiovascular disease.

### Antihypertensive medication regimens used in the systolic blood pressure intervention trial [^115SvHGx]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Describing the antihypertensive medication regimens used in the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) would contextualize the standard and intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) interventions and may inform future implementation efforts to achieve population-wide intensive SBP goals.

Methods

We included SPRINT participants with complete medication data at the prerandomization and 12-month visits. Regimens were categorized by antihypertensive medication class. Analyses were stratified by treatment group (standard goal SBP < 140 mmHg versus intensive goal SBP < 120 mmHg).

Results

Among 7860 participants (83.7% of 9361 randomized), the median number of classes used at the prerandomization visit was 2.0 and 2.0 in the standard and intensive groups (P = 0.559). At 12-months, the median number of classes used was 3.0 and 2.0 in the intensive and standard groups (P < 0.001). Prerandomization, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE), or angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy was the most common regimen in the intensive and standard groups (12.6% versus 12.2%). At 12-months, ACE/ARB monotherapy was still the most common regimen among standard group participants (14.7%) and was used by 5.3% of intensive group participants. Multidrug regimens used by the intensive and standard participants at 12 months were as follows: an ACE/ARB with thiazide (12.2% and 7.9%); an ACE/ARB with calcium channel blocker (6.2% and 6.8%); an ACE/ARB, thiazide, and calcium channel blocker (11.4% and 4.3%); and an ACE/ARB, thiazide, calcium channel blocker, and beta-blocker (6.5% and 1.2%).

Conclusions

SPRINT investigators favored combining ACEs or ARBs, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers to target SBP < 120 mmHg, compared to ACE/ARB monotherapy to target SBP < 140 mmHg.

### Newer renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker combinations: is there an advantage? [^1178Mdxh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The necessity for new and more effective management approaches to achieve blood pressure goals is still present in spite of the number of antihypertensive medications available. One of the cornerstones of successful therapy is implementation of drug combinations that act on complementary biological pathways. This review article focuses on the evaluation of recent data supporting newer combinations involving inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with other drug classes such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics.

Recent Findings

New angiotensin receptor blockers as well as renin inhibitors, with a more robust blood pressure-lowering effect than their predecessors, have emerged recently. The data presented in this text also strongly supports a combination therapy approach as initial therapy to achieve blood pressure goals in a timely fashion. Additionally, the blood pressure-lowering effect is more robust with lower-dose, single-pill combinations than with highest doses of single agents alone. Therefore, using combination agents is less prone to side effects. The challenges for such single-pill combinations remain affordability. For this reason, payers and patients have traditionally not preferred such agents in spite of better blood pressure control and adherence rates.

Summary

The new combinations of renin inhibitors and the new angiotensin receptor blocker combinations add to the armamentarium of agents to control blood pressure. Whereas the new angiotensin receptor blocker offers greater efficacy on blood pressure control over other agents in the class and the availability of the only chlorthalidone combination, no outcome data exist yet with any of the new agents.

### Strategies for combination therapy in hypertension [^111QLRRq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To achieve the target blood pressure (BP) mandated by current guidelines, a large majority of patients require simultaneous administration of multiple antihypertensive agents. The purpose of this review is to focus attention on the rational selection of effective drug combinations, and upon ways to use them efficiently to achieve therapeutic objectives. The topic is widely relevant given that more than 46 million ambulatory care visits are conducted in the United States annually for hypertension management.

Recent Findings

Recommended drug combinations exhibit complimentary pharmacology and additive BP reduction, are well tolerated, and include components with demonstrated endpoint reduction in long-term clinical trials. Recently, the choice of diuretics has emerged as a controversial issue with some evidence favoring the long-acting agent, chlorthalidone, in preference to hydrochlorothiazide. For resistant hypertension, mineralocorticoid antagonists are increasingly used as preferred add-on agents. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to the use of low-dose combinations, and to initiation of combination therapy in a broader range of hypertensive patients.

Summary

Thoughtful use of drug combinations is critical for achieving therapeutic objectives in hypertensive individuals and populations - more rapid BP control and more effective endpoint reduction. Practical strategies for the optimal use of combination therapy continue to evolve from the older stepped-care approach to more recent recommendations favoring the use of low-dose combinations, and initiation therapy of combination treatment, particularly in patients with Stage 2 hypertension.

### Analysis of dual combination therapies used in treatment of hypertension in a multinational cohort [^113KMNcm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the leading global risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, contributing worldwide to more than 7 million deaths and 57 million disability-adjusted life-years annually. In 2015, approximately 1.13 billion adults had hypertension, yet fewer than 30% had achieved their blood pressure control goal. Notably, the burden of hypertension is particularly salient in the Asia Pacific region, given that this region has 60% of the world's population and has experienced a rapid increase in prevalence of hypertension since 1980.

Approximately 70% of patients with hypertension cannot achieve their blood pressure control goal with monotherapy. Despite the wide availability of antihypertensive agents, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the optimal choice for a second agent for use in escalation from monotherapy. Clinical trials lack head-to-head comparisons of second antihypertensive agents added to monotherapy, and only 2 trials (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension [ACCOMPLISH]and Combination Therapy of Hypertension to Prevent Cardiovascular Events [COPE]) directly compared combination regimens in patients with hypertension who required 2 drugs. These trials, however, provided comparisons between few agents, not drug classes; included primarily patients from Western countries; and did not systematically assess heterogeneity in patient subgroups. The absence of head-to-head comparison in clinical trials has limited the ability of clinical guidelines to provide recommendations about the preferred choice of second medication for treatment escalation. However, it is plausible that not all dual combination therapies have the same mean risks and benefits. Moreover, some combinations may be associated with better outcomes in particular patient subgroups. Evidence about the choice of medication in escalating treatment to 2 agents may better inform clinical decisions and provide needed evidence for practice guidelines.

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^112fewAA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce the adverse cardiovascular consequences of high blood pressure (BP). 1 The overall evidence supports that the degree of BP lowering is the major determinant of the health benefits. 1 Guidelines, therefore, emphasize the importance of controlling BP as the preeminent goal. 2, 3 In this regard, it is important to acknowledge that most hypertensive patients (eg, 75%) require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP targets. 4 As such, the most germane issue to explore in guiding present‐day clinical practice is which combination of medications (rather than what single agent) provides optimal cardiovascular protection. 5 Although most patients in clinical trials were taking > 1 antihypertensive medication, 1 only the ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial was designed to investigate the comparative cardiovascular risk reductions derived from 2 prespecified combination regimens prescribed as initial therapy. 6 The study was terminated early (mean follow‐up, 36 months) because of the superiority of benazepril+amlodipine compared with benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide for preventing the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.90; P < 0.001). Subsequent analyses showed that this benefit occurred among patients with coronary artery disease 7 and diabetes mellitus, 8 was superior for preventing adverse renal outcomes, 9 and was not likely a consequence of subtle BP differences between groups (ambulatory BP monitoring). 10

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^113GgoKf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hypertension is now considered as a part of a complex syndrome of changes in cardiac and vascular structure and function. All of the current guidelines suggest that ≥ 1 antihypertensive agent is required in most patients with hypertension to reach BP goals that will effectively reduce the cardiovascular risk. Therapy with 2 drugs separately or with fixed combinations that include agents with complementary actions. Many combinations have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcome and include a diuretic with the RAAS blocker. Choice of combination therapy depends upon the risk factors, presence of comorbidities like diabetes, renal dysfunction and the adverse effects and tailored according to individual patient.

Combination therapy and SPCs — Combination therapy "is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy", though "a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed". "Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control". For candidates for initial combination therapy, thresholds include "SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 10 mm Hg above their goal", and "starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence". "Available RCT evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy". "Several small RCTs have demonstrated that low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together reduce BP more effectively than monotherapy over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention". "In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk". "However, BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop".

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112UvZU5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension has a major associated risk for organ damage and mortality, which is further heightened in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and renal impairment. Given that most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognised in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking. However, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminura and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the oedema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy. The occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough supports the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for RAS blockade rather than ACE inhibitors. In this regard, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the calcium CCB, amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with preferential pharmacodynamic profile compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations, telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Clinical studies suggest that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB/CCB combination may be preferred to ARB/HCTZ combinations due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders. However, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology.

### Initial combination therapy for rapid and effective control of moderate and severe hypertension [^113xQWJy]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Moderate (grade 2) and severe (grade 3) hypertension are important public health problems associated with high cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure (BP) control becomes more difficult to achieve as hypertension progresses. Therefore, early and effective treatment is essential to prevent hypertensive urgencies and emergencies and reduce cardiovascular risk. Currently, less than 50% of patients being treated for moderate or severe hypertension in the United States achieve their BP goal as recommended by treatment guidelines. This review examines the cardiovascular risk and physician inertia associated with moderate and severe hypertension, and concludes that increased use of initial combination therapy can overcome many of the barriers to effective BP control. Furthermore, initial combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor and diuretic has the potential to rapidly and effectively reduce BP across a range of baseline BPs, with a comparable adverse event profile to monotherapy.

### Trends in antihypertensive medication monotherapy and combination use among US adults, national health and nutrition examination survey 2005–2016 [^112RwQZt]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control rates among US adults taking antihypertensive medication have not increased over the past decade. Many adults require 2 or more classes of antihypertensive medication to achieve guideline-recommended BP goals, but the proportion of US adults taking antihypertensive medication monotherapy, versus combination therapy, has not been quantified using contemporary data. We analyzed data from 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to determine trends in monotherapy and combinations of antihypertensive medication classes among US adults age ≥ 20 years with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication (n = 7837). The proportion of US adults taking antihypertensive medication with uncontrolled BP (ie, systolic BP ≥ 140 or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg) was 32.3%, 30.2%, and 31.0% in 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016, respectively (P trend = 0.37). Between 2005 to 2008 and 2013 to 2016, there was no evidence of changes in the proportions of US adults taking antihypertensive monotherapy (39.5%-40.4%, P trend = 0.67), dual-therapy (37.9%-38.3%, P trend = 0.75), triple-therapy (17.6%-16.5%, P trend = 0.36), or quadruple-therapy (4.4%-4.3%, P trend = 0.93). Between 2005 to 2008 and 2013 to 2016, there was no evidence of changes in the proportions of US adults with uncontrolled BP taking antihypertensive monotherapy (39.3%-40.6%, P trend = 0.78). A high proportion of US adults with hypertension, including those with uncontrolled BP, are taking one antihypertensive medication class. Increasing the use of dual- and triple-therapy antihypertensive medication regimens may restore the upward trend in BP control rates among US adults.
