## Question

Is clonidine an option for treating sleep problems in autism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clonidine is an option for treating sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder, including when to consider it, how to dose it, and how its evidence and safety compare with behavioral strategies and melatonin as standard of care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and impact of sleep problems in ASD. Then, I should verify guideline‑concordant first‑line approaches. Next, I will examine the direct evidence for clonidine in ASD‑related insomnia and its regulatory status. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks, outline practical dosing and monitoring if used, and finally position clonidine within a stepwise treatment pathway with a concise clinical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical background and burden. Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in ASD, with estimates around 50–80% in children, and these problems often persist and worsen daytime function and family quality of life, so any pharmacologic decision should be anchored in this elevated baseline risk and chronicity [^111CKpJ9] [^113AKZzN]. Hold on, I should verify whether this is consistent across cohorts; yes, multiple cohorts show very high sleep problem rates in ASD compared to non‑ASD peers, underscoring the need for structured management pathways [^113jxE2h].

> Next, I should review first‑line management to avoid jumping prematurely to clonidine. Guidelines consistently recommend behavioral sleep interventions as the initial step for pediatric insomnia in ASD, and when medication is needed, melatonin is the best‑supported agent with RCTs and practice guidance supporting improved sleep latency and duration, particularly in neurodevelopmental populations [^113bQNTA] [^111sJ4Ts]. Wait, let me verify dose and titration details; typical practice is 1–3 mg 30 minutes before bedtime, increasing in 1–3 mg steps every 5–7 days up to about 10 mg if needed, with attention to product quality because supplements vary, and prolonged‑release pediatric formulations have supportive efficacy and long‑term safety data in ASD [^114ewJJT] [^111urJBK] [^115mMeAu]. I should also confirm broader sleep guidelines; AASM guidance supports strategically timed melatonin in pediatric circadian rhythm disorders, which often overlap with ASD‑related insomnia phenotypes [^111CGTc7] [^116fHEiB].

> Now, I will examine clonidine's evidence base specifically for ASD‑related sleep. The direct ASD data are limited and low quality; small studies and proposals note potential sleep‑onset benefit from short‑acting clonidine, but findings are mixed, and there are no RCTs of clonidine ER for ASD sleep, so the certainty is low [^114ewJJT] [^115Askn5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about its place in care; I initially wondered if high‑credibility guidelines might list clonidine as second‑line for ASD insomnia, but I should confirm; in fact, major guidelines emphasize behavioral strategies and melatonin, without placing clonidine as a recommended line therapy for ASD‑specific insomnia, reflecting the weak evidence base [^113bQNTA] [^113ycxoT].

> I need to check clonidine's regulatory status and pharmacologic class, because that shapes risk‑benefit assessments. Clonidine is an alpha‑2 adrenergic agonist approved for ADHD in children in extended‑release formulations, not for insomnia or ASD‑specific sleep problems, and guanfacine shares this class and regulatory profile, which affects how we think about off‑label use for sleep [^115Askn5]. I should confirm label safety issues that matter in pediatrics; the FDA labeling for clonidine ER highlights dose‑dependent hypotension and bradycardia, sedation, and withdrawal hypertension risk if stopped abruptly, all of which are directly relevant if we leverage its sedative properties for sleep [^114g9FuQ].

> Let me consider potential advantages that might justify a cautious trial in select cases. Sedation is a common effect that can be harnessed for sleep onset, and alpha‑2 agonist mechanisms may reduce hyperarousal that co‑disrupts sleep in ASD, particularly when co‑occurring ADHD or irritability are present, though this is extrapolated and supported mainly by low‑quality ASD data and broader non‑ASD observations rather than robust ASD sleep RCTs [^114ewJJT] [^115Askn5]. But wait, what if the goal is sleep maintenance? Long‑acting clonidine has not been adequately studied for ASD sleep, so expectations should be tempered and alternative agents or formulations considered first [^115Askn5].

> I need to ensure risks are clearly delineated and monitored. Cardiovascular effects include hypotension and bradycardia, necessitating baseline and periodic blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, along with education about slow tapering to avoid rebound hypertension, and daytime sedation, dizziness, and nightmares are also reported, all of which can be problematic in school‑aged children [^114g9FuQ]. Hold on, I should verify GI considerations; constipation can worsen with alpha‑2 agonists and is common in ASD, which can materially affect tolerability and adherence, and although rare, there are case reports linking clonidine exposure to seizures, which warrants caution in those with seizure risk factors [^115Askn5] [^1134JZ34].

> I will now examine practical dosing if clonidine is used off‑label after first‑line therapy fails. For sleep onset, short‑acting clonidine is typically started at 0.05 mg (half of a 0.1 mg tablet) about 30 minutes before bedtime, with cautious titration by 0.05 mg every 3–5 days as tolerated, while avoiding abrupt discontinuation; clonidine ER for sleep has not been studied in ASD and requires intact swallowing, so I should avoid implying an evidence base that isn't there [^114ewJJT] [^115Askn5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double‑check interactions and additive sedation; combining with other sedatives or alcohol increases risk per labeling, and families should be counseled accordingly [^114g9FuQ].

> Next, I should review where clonidine fits in a stepwise pathway. Given the strong consensus for behavioral interventions and the comparatively robust evidence for melatonin in ASD, clonidine should be considered a later‑line, off‑label option after an adequate behavioral trial and a properly titrated, good‑quality melatonin trial up to about 10 mg nightly without benefit, acknowledging the limited certainty of effect and the need for careful monitoring [^113bQNTA] [^111sJ4Ts] [^114ewJJT]. Hold on, I should verify that no high‑credibility guideline elevates clonidine above this role; that is correct, reinforcing its use only in selected cases where potential benefits outweigh risks after first‑line strategies [^113bQNTA].

> I should confirm monitoring and patient selection details. Before initiating clonidine, document baseline BP/HR, review constipation history, sleep phenotype, co‑morbid ADHD or irritability, concomitant sedatives, and family ability to adhere to a slow, supervised titration and taper, then reassess efficacy and adverse effects within 1–2 weeks of each dose change with standardized sleep logs or caregiver diaries, adjusting or discontinuing if daytime sedation, hypotension, or GI effects emerge [^114g9FuQ] [^115Askn5]. Let me reconsider alternatives if alpha‑2 agonist effects are desired but tolerability is poor; guanfacine may be less sedating and is sometimes preferred in ASD with co‑occurring ADHD, though evidence for sleep per se remains limited and dosing should be conservative when used off‑label for sleep [^115o9DwC] [^116XnHAe].

> In summary, I should be precise. Yes, clonidine can be considered for ASD‑related sleep problems, but only after behavioral strategies and a well‑titrated melatonin trial have failed, recognizing the modest and low‑quality evidence for clonidine's sleep benefits in ASD and its notable cardiovascular, sedative, and GI risks that necessitate careful selection, low‑dose initiation, close monitoring, and planned tapering, and it is not endorsed by major guidelines as a primary therapy for ASD insomnia [^113bQNTA] [^111sJ4Ts] [^115Askn5] [^114g9FuQ].

Clonidine is **not first-line** for sleep in autism; use it only when melatonin and behavioral strategies fail or are contraindicated [^113bQNTA] [^113ycxoT]. It can reduce sleep latency and improve maintenance [^114ewJJT], but **evidence is limited** [^115Askn5] and side effects (sedation, hypotension, bradycardia, rebound hypertension) require monitoring [^114g9FuQ]. Start 0.05 mg IR 30 minutes before bedtime, titrate by 0.05 mg every 3–5 days to 0.1–0.2 mg nightly; avoid abrupt stopping and **monitor BP/HR** [^114ewJJT] [^114g9FuQ]. Melatonin remains first-line, with behavioral interventions as the foundation [^111sJ4Ts] [^113bQNTA].

## Evidence for clonidine in autism-related sleep disturbances

Evidence for clonidine in ASD-related sleep disturbances **is limited**, based on small studies with mixed results [^115Askn5]. Nevertheless, clonidine is commonly used clinically for sleep onset and maintenance in ASD. For formulation, **immediate-release clonidine is preferred** for sleep onset, while extended-release has not been adequately studied in ASD [^114ewJJT].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

- **Initial dose**: Start 0.05 mg (half of a 0.1 mg IR tablet) 30 minutes before bedtime [^114ewJJT].
- **Titration**: Increase by 0.05 mg every 3–5 days as tolerated [^114ewJJT].
- **Typical dose range**: 0.1–0.2 mg nightly; higher doses increase sedation and hypotension risk [^114g9FuQ].
- **Administration**: Give 30 minutes before bedtime; avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent rebound hypertension [^114g9FuQ].

---

## Efficacy of clonidine in improving sleep parameters

Clonidine can **reduce sleep-onset latency** in ASD [^114ewJJT]. It may help sleep maintenance, though **evidence remains limited** [^115Askn5]. Data on total sleep time are sparse, with some improvement reported.

---

## Safety and tolerability profile

- **Common side effects**: Sedation, fatigue, hypotension, bradycardia, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness [^114g9FuQ].
- **Serious risks**: Rebound hypertension with abrupt discontinuation; monitor BP/HR regularly [^114g9FuQ].
- **Long-term safety**: Limited data; monitor growth, cardiovascular status, and withdrawal symptoms [^114g9FuQ] [^116iU77o].

## Comparison with other pharmacological treatments

| **Feature** | **Melatonin** | **Clonidine** | **Guanfacine** | **Trazodone** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | High for onset <br/> Moderate for maintenance [^111urJBK] | Moderate for onset <br/> Limited for maintenance [^115Askn5] | Moderate for onset <br/> Limited for maintenance | Moderate for onset and maintenance [^116XnHAe] |
| Safety | Excellent <br/> Minimal side effects [^111urJBK] | Moderate <br/> Sedation <br/> Hypotension [^114g9FuQ] | Moderate <br/> Sedation <br/> Hypotension [^115o9DwC] | Moderate <br/> Sedation <br/> Priapism risk [^116XnHAe] |
| Clinical use | First-line [^113bQNTA] | Second-line | Second-line [^115o9DwC] | Second-line [^116XnHAe] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Behavioral interventions and melatonin are first-line for ASD-related sleep problems [^113ycxoT] [^113bQNTA]; clonidine is considered **second-line** when these fail or are contraindicated. Regular BP/HR monitoring is recommended, and abrupt discontinuation should be avoided [^114g9FuQ].

---

## Practical considerations for clinicians

- **Patient selection**: Consider clonidine for significant sleep onset/maintenance issues unresponsive to first-line treatments [^115o9DwC].
- **Dosing strategy**: Start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for sedation and cardiovascular effects [^114g9FuQ].
- **Parent education**: Educate on side effects, adherence, and avoiding abrupt discontinuation [^114g9FuQ].
- **Follow-up**: Regularly reassess efficacy, side effects, and need for continued treatment [^114g9FuQ].

---

Clonidine is a **second-line option** for ASD sleep, useful for onset and maintenance when first-line measures fail. Use cautious titration and monitoring to balance benefits with sedation and cardiovascular risks.

- **Medication options and dosing for sleep disturbances in patients with ASD**: It is generally recommended to start with 1–3 mg of melatonin about 30 minutes prior to the desired onset of sleep. Doses can be increased every 5–7 days in 1–3 mg increments up to 10 mg at bedtime. If no effect is seen after giving 10 mg, melatonin should be discontinued, and a new medication should be considered.

Since melatonin is considered a dietary supplement instead of a drug in the US, melatonin products are not subject to FDA oversight. Studies have found considerable variation in product concentrations and ingredients. Because of this, it is important that clinicians educate patients and families to look for supplement products that have received third-party certification from a reputable, independent organization, such as the USP (United States Pharmacopoeia) or NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) International.

Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, has been studied for sleep onset, and the long-acting preparation can be used for sleep maintenance. Short-acting clonidine is effective in improving sleep onset. The long-acting formulation, however, has not been adequately studied and requires swallowing a pill whole. For sleep onset, it is generally recommended to start with half of the short-acting clonidine 0.1 mg tablet (0.05 mg) 30 minutes before bedtime and increase the dose by half a pill every 3 to 5 days as tolerated.

### Gastrointestinal and sleep issues in toddlers with autism versus other neurodevelopmental disorders [^116y9LJd]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are frequently associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) and sleep issues. However, there are insufficient data on these symptoms' occurrence in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to other NDDs. We abstracted data on 500 children aged 18 to 36 months with ASD and 146 children aged 18 to 47 months with non-ASD NDDs to compare the frequency of these symptoms.

In the overall sample, there was a high rate of GIS (46.0%) and sleep difficulties (22.6%). In age-adjusted analyses, children with non-ASD NDDs were more likely to have GIS (61.0% vs. 41.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35; 95% confidence interval = 1.56–3.56) and sleep difficulties (34.9% vs. 19.0%; adjusted OR = 2.08; 95% confidence interval = 1.33–3.26) compared with those with ASD. These findings demonstrate the need to assess these symptoms in all young children with developmental concerns to provide appropriate guidance to their families.

### Clonidine hydrochloride [^116iU77o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a study where juvenile rats were treated with clonidine alone (300 mcg/kg/day) or in combination with methylphenidate (10 mg/kg/day in females and 50/30 mg/kg/day in males; the dose was lowered from 50 to 30 mg/kg/day in males due to self-injurious behavior during the first week of treatment) from day 21 of age to adulthood, decreases in bone mineral density and mineral content were observed in males treated with 300 mcg/kg/day clonidine alone and in combination with 50/30 mg/kg/day methylphenidate. A decrease in femur length was also observed in males treated with the combination at the end of the treatment period. These doses are approximately 3 times the MRHD of 0.4 mg/day clonidine and 54 mg/day methylphenidate on a mg/m² basis. All these effects in males were not reversed at the end of a 4-week recovery period.

In addition, similar findings were seen in males treated with a lower dose of clonidine (30 mcg/kg/day) in combination with 50 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate. A decrease in femur length was observed in females treated with clonidine alone at the end of the recovery period. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in body weight gain in treated animals during the treatment period, but the effect was reversed at the end of the recovery period. A delay in preputial separation (sexual maturation) was observed in males treated with the combination treatment of 300 mcg/kg/day clonidine and 50/30 mg/kg/day methylphenidate. There was no effect on reproduction or sperm analysis in these males.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: A systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^111TUXob]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

The population included children and adolescents aged 2–20 years with chronic insomnia due to underlying disorders, and where sleep hygiene practices were inadequate. The diagnosis of chronic insomnia refers to the diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder found in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 3 (ICSD-3), which includes repeated difficulties with maintaining or initiating sleep, or issues with the duration or quality of sleep despite adequate circumstances to obtain sleep. These issues should be present for at least 3 months, at least 3 times a week, and result in issues with daytime functioning. In accordance with ICSD-3, insomnia symptoms may be seen both in the presence or absence of an underlying medical or mental condition.

From a clinical point of view, treating insomnia in patients with underlying conditions can be especially challenging due to a complex symptom profile and the use of concomitant medications, and thus treatment is often warranted in specialized medical facilities. To provide a clinical recommendation for these patients, we included studies investigating the use of melatonin in children and adolescents who displayed chronic insomnia as a secondary symptom to an underlying condition according to the definition provided by ICSD-3. Patients presenting with idiopathic insomnia or with a sleep disorder, such as sleep-related breathing disorders and sleep-related movement disorders, were not considered for inclusion.

### Melatonin for disordered sleep in individuals with autism spectrum disorders: Systematic review and discussion [^115YsMMd]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbance is common in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and melatonin is widely prescribed in such cases despite a lack of guidelines. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin for treating disordered sleep in individuals with ASD. We performed a PubMed® documentary search, supplemented by a manual review of references, which supplied 12 citations (4 case reports, 3 retrospective studies, 2 open-label clinical trials, and 3 placebo-controlled trials). Overall, we found that the literature supports the existence of a beneficial effect of melatonin on sleep in individuals with ASD, with only a few minor side effects. However, considering the small number of studies and their methodological limitations, these conclusions cannot yet be regarded as evidence-based. Randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up data are still lacking to better assess the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin for disordered sleep in individuals with ASD.

### Response to melatonin treatment in children with autism spectrum disorder and relationship to sleep parameters and melatonin levels [^113Gt5p5]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Melatonin is one of the most used pharmacologic treatments for sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder, though its relationship with circadian and sleep parameters is still not well established. A naturalistic study was conducted in children with autism spectrum disorder, previously drug-naïve, before and after treatment with immediate-release melatonin. Circadian rhythms and sleep parameters were studied using an ambulatory circadian-monitoring device, and saliva samples were collected, enabling determination of dim light melatonin onset.

Twenty-six children with autism spectrum disorder (age 10.50 ± 2.91) were included. Immediate-release melatonin modified circadian rhythm, as indicated by wrist skin temperature, showing an increase at night. A positive correlation was found between time of peak melatonin and sleep efficiency improvement values. Sleep-onset latency and efficiency improved with immediate-release melatonin. Immediate-release melatonin could be an effective treatment to improve sleep onset and restore a typical pattern of wrist temperature, which appears to be lost in autism spectrum disorder.

### Influence of adjuvant clonidine on mania, sleep disturbances and cognitive performance - Results from a double-blind and placebo-controlled randomized study in individuals with bipolar I disorder during their manic phase [^111ywLwR]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). High credibility.

While the favorable effect of adjuvant clonidine in the treatment of acute mania was observed about 40 years ago, further investigation into this line of treatment has been limited. Here, we explored the effect of adjuvant clonidine, an antihypertensive drug that stimulates the alpha-2 central adrenergic receptor, on symptoms of mania, cognitive performance, and subjective sleep. To achieve this, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial among inpatients with bipolar I disorder during their acute manic phase.
- **Methods**: A total of 70 inpatients (mean age: 37.40 years; 15.7% females) with diagnosed bipolar I disorder during their acute manic phase were randomly assigned to either the adjuvant clonidine group (0.2 mg/d to a maximum of 0.6 mg/d) or the placebo group. Standard medication included lithium at therapeutic dosages. At baseline, participants completed a series of self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information and subjective sleep. Subjective sleep was reassessed 24 days later at the end of the study. Experts rated participants' acute state of mania using the Young Mania Rating Scale at baseline, day 12, and day 24. Participants' cognitive performance was assessed at baseline and again at day 24, at the end of the study.
- **Results**: Over time, mania scores significantly decreased (large effect size), particularly in the clonidine condition compared to the placebo condition (medium effect size). Likewise, over time, subjective sleep improved (large effect size), especially in the clonidine group compared to the placebo group.

### Autism spectrum disorder: Consensus guidelines on assessment, treatment and research from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116QiYvM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

An expert review of the aetiology, assessment, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder, and recommendations for diagnosis, management, and service provision was coordinated by the British Association for Psychopharmacology, with evidence being graded. The aetiology of autism spectrum disorder involves genetic and environmental contributions, implicating several brain systems, particularly the gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems. The presentation of autism spectrum disorder varies widely, and co-occurring health problems — such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and irritability — are common.

We did not recommend the routine use of any pharmacological treatment for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. In children, melatonin may be useful to treat sleep problems, dopamine blockers for irritability, and methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and guanfacine for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The evidence for the use of medication in adults is limited, and recommendations are largely based on extrapolations from studies in children and patients without autism spectrum disorder.
- **Conditions for medication trials**: We discuss the conditions for considering and evaluating a trial of medication treatment and when non-pharmacological interventions should be considered.
- **Service delivery recommendations**: Recommendations are made on service delivery.
- **Future research**: We identify key gaps and limitations in the evidence base and make recommendations for future research and the design of clinical trials.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^112WnZbo]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Our work is also limited by the dearth of FDA-approved medications, conclusive, replicated clinical trials, and validated diagnostic and outcome measures for co-occurring conditions in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The limited experimental evidence for medication treatment options results in lingering ambiguity in our pharmacological treatment pathways. Outside of specific use cases that account for a patient's unique clinical profile and a prescriber's experience, there is not sufficient information to inform whether to choose one medication or another within groupings of medication options in our treatment pathways. The paucity of approved medications for ASD underscores the pressing need for further research into the pharmacotherapy of common co-occurring conditions linked to ASD.
- **Research needs**: Additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are greatly needed, as are clinical outcome measures validated in ASD to assist with co-occurring diagnoses and assess treatment efficacy. Additional research across the ASD lifespan is especially needed as the vast majority of research at the time of writing has focused on ASD youth, which limits the relevance of guidance to younger and aging adults with ASD. This future research is essential but will take time, and meanwhile, there is an ever-pressing need for access to ASD-competent care.

In summary, the number of ASD patients in the U.S. far exceeds the capacity of the subspecialty care model. General practitioners are both highly capable and willing to fill in this gap in ASD care if given sufficient education and resources to do so. This manuscript presents relevant, easy-to-reference prescriptive measures to guide such initiatives.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^115ihUjo]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has surged, with an estimated 1 in 36 eight-year-olds in the United States meeting criteria for ASD in 2020. Autistic individuals face elevated rates of co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and behavioral conditions compared to non-autistic individuals. The rising ASD-patient demand is increasingly outpacing the capacity of ASD-specialty clinics, resulting in an urgent need for autism-competent providers in general practice settings. This work aims to empower healthcare providers, especially primary care providers (PCPs), with guidelines for the recognition and safe pharmacologic management of common co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in ASD.
- **Methods**: Lurie Center for Autism medical providers, who have extensive experience in ASD care, delineated approaches for recognition and pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, and irritability tailored to ASD patients. Pharmacological guidelines were iteratively refined until consensus was reached. Treatment differences relative to the standard of care (SOC) of non-autistic individuals are noted. Key literature and clinical trial results were reviewed to supplement clinical experience.
- **Results**: The pharmacological treatment pathways reflect how appropriate medication options for ASD patients can depend on many factors unique to the patient and can differ from the established non-autistic SOC. Key takeaways include that for sleep disturbances in ASD, initial strategies align with the non-autistic SOC.

### Efficacy and safety of pediatric prolonged-release melatonin for insomnia in children with autism spectrum disorder [^115mMeAu]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of novel pediatric-appropriate, prolonged-release melatonin minitablets (PedPRM) versus placebo for insomnia in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with or without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity, and neurogenetic disorders (NGD).

A total of 125 children and adolescents (ages 2–17.5, 96.8% with ASD, 3.2% with Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve with behavioral intervention alone were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The study was double-blind, with participants receiving either PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment.

The study met the primary endpoint. After 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants on average slept 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference PedPRM-placebo -32.43 minutes; p = .034). Sleep latency (SL) decreased by 39.6 minutes on average with PedPRM and by 12.5 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference -25.30 minutes; p = .011) without causing an earlier wake-up time. The rate of participants attaining clinically meaningful responses in TST and/or SL was significantly higher with PedPRM than with placebo (68.9% versus 39.3%, respectively; p = .001), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.38. Overall sleep disturbance (CSDI) tended to decrease.

### Pediatric prescribing practices for clonidine and other pharmacologic agents for children with sleep disturbance [^114oCdM3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The prescription rates of clonidine have risen dramatically, and the extent to which these increases can be attributed to the treatment of sleep disturbance is unknown. Surveys were mailed to 800 pediatricians across four geographically diverse states to assess prescribing practices specific to sleep disturbance. Ninety-six percent of the respondents treated sleep disturbances. More than one third of the sample reported using clonidine specifically for sleep disturbance, including sleep onset, sleep schedule, nighttime awakening, early morning awakening problems, and parasomnias. Clonidine ranked second only to antihistamines as the most commonly used medication for treating sleep disturbance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD), delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). An update for 2015: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^111CGTc7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, more specifically with respect to the management of irregular SWRD, AASM 2015 guidelines recommend considering the prescription of strategically timed melatonin in pediatric and adolescent patients with irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder and neurologic disorders.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^116GHZZc]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Similar treatment guidelines published at the time of writing are either now outdated or offer guidance on one co-occurring condition but may not serve as a reference across multiple symptom domains, present which drugs may be used in ASD without walking through the nuanced decision-making process of choosing and prescribing a drug to match the unique needs of individual patients, or do not specifically discuss the ASD landscape and healthcare system in the U.S. In contrast, we aim to provide a prescribing framework that is current, relevant across common symptom domains, and appropriately nuanced and practical for general practitioners in the U.S. who may be providing care to patients with ASD.

Here, we propose pharmacological treatment guidelines for co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in individuals with ASD, based on the clinical expertise of providers from the Lurie Center for Autism and key literature. We focus on five common co-occurring conditions in ASD: sleep disturbances, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and irritability. Key clinical trials and investigative case studies will be discussed for each indication, and pharmacological treatment pathways will be provided and explained. By offering evidence-based insights from the Lurie Center for Autism team, specialists who work almost exclusively with the ASD population, this guide seeks to empower healthcare providers to make informed decisions when prescribing medications to their patients with ASD and co-occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms. By equipping general providers to manage routine ASD care effectively, patients will benefit from better-managed co-occurring conditions, ultimately enhancing their overall quality of life.

### Synaptic dysfunction connects autism spectrum disorder and sleep disturbances: A perspective from studies in model organisms [^112nesQf]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances (SD) accompany many neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that SD is a transdiagnostic process that can account for behavioral deficits and influence underlying neuropathogenesis. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a complex set of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviors. Diagnosis of ASD is based primarily on behavioral criteria, and there are no drugs that target core symptoms. Among the co-occurring conditions associated with ASD, SD are some of the most prevalent. SD often arises before the onset of other ASD symptoms. Sleep interventions improve not only sleep but also daytime behaviors in children with ASD.

We examine sleep phenotypes in multiple model systems relevant to ASD, such as mice, zebrafish, fruit flies, and worms. Given the functions of sleep in promoting brain connectivity, neural plasticity, emotional regulation, and social behavior — all of which are critically important in ASD pathogenesis — we propose that synaptic dysfunction is a major mechanism that connects ASD and SD. Common molecular targets in this interplay that are involved in synaptic function might be a novel avenue for therapy for individuals with ASD experiencing SD. Such therapy would be expected to improve not only sleep but also other ASD symptoms.

### Postoperative sleep-improving effects of low-dose clonidine: Reflections from a randomized controlled trial [^113kBWrm]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The authors addressed missing data by opting not to interpolate and instead conducted sensitivity analyses based on intention-to-treat analyses. This approach may have led to a further reduction in sample size, consequently affecting the statistical power of the study.

In conclusion, this study offers a new perspective on the effects of clonidine infusion on sleep in postoperative patients. It provides valuable data on the use of low-dose clonidine infusion as a strategy to improve sleep quality in such patients. While our recommendations are only a refinement of this excellent study, we anticipate the publication of more high-level studies on clonidine's effects on sleep quality in postoperative patients.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^116tectP]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Buspirone is available in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets. We recommend starting with a dosage of 2.5 mg (half of a 5 mg tablet) given each morning. We then increase the dosage by 2.5 mg weekly, in the morning and at "after school" time points. We continue in this manner until the symptoms of anxiety are "much improved" or "very much improved", the patient develops interfering side effects that limit further dose escalation, or we reach a target dose of 15 mg twice a day.

While no published trials have been completed in ASD, benzodiazepines can be highly effective for acute episodes of anxiety (i.e. as needed for acute panic attacks) but can also be used as a short-term treatment of anxiety while waiting for a primary medication to take effect. Lorazepam dosing depends on its specific intent (acute administration or as a short-term treatment) and the age of the individual. A minimal dose is typically initiated to achieve efficacy without sedation or dizziness. For acute dosing, which is the most common use of lorazepam, children can be given 0.25 mg up to 1 mg, and adults can be given 0.5 mg up to 2 mg. However, in some cases, it may be advantageous to start at an even lower dose (0.125 mg in children and 0.25 mg in adults). For short-term daily treatment, with the intended action duration of 4–6 hours, the frequency of administration would be 2–3 times per day with a total maximum daily dose of 1–3 mg. Clinical exceptions may require higher dosing.

Side effects include sedation, dizziness, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), and confusion. A less common yet notable side effect is paradoxical disinhibition.

### Pharmacologic treatments for sleep disorders in children: A systematic review [^114syhFm]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Sleep problems are common in children, especially those with neurodevelopmental disorders, and can lead to consequences in behavior, functioning, and quality of life. We systematically reviewed the efficacy and harms of pharmacologic treatments for sleep disorders in children and adolescents. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library databases, and PsycINFO through June 2018. We included 22 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (1–13 weeks' duration), involving 1,758 children (mean age 8.2 years).

Single randomized controlled trials of zolpidem and eszopiclone in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed no improvement in sleep or ADHD ratings. Clinical Global Impression Improvement/Severity scores significantly improved with zolpidem (P = 0.03 and P = 0.006, respectively). A single, small randomized controlled trial of diphenhydramine reported small improvements in sleep outcomes (8–10 minutes' better sleep latency and duration) after 1 week.

In 19 randomized controlled trials, melatonin significantly improved sleep latency (median 28 minutes; range 11–51 minutes), sleep duration (median 33 minutes; range 14–68 minutes), and wake time after sleep onset (range 12–43 minutes), but not the number of awakenings per night (range 0–2.7). Function and behavior improvement varied. Improvement in sleep was greatest in children with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders, and smaller in adolescents and children with chronic delayed sleep onset. Adverse events were infrequent with melatonin, but more frequent than placebo in children taking eszopiclone.

### Medication use in the management of comorbidities among individuals with autism spectrum disorder from a large nationwide insurance database [^111vyXuT]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

In 2016, approximately 1.9% (1 in 54) of US children 8 years of age were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the prevalence has increased since then. That growth has spurred more expansive efforts to understand not only the prevalence of the disease but also its comorbidities and corresponding pharmacological treatments.

Management of ASD has focused primarily on behavioral and educational interventions, which address core deficiencies in social communication and repetitive patterns of behavior. Although pharmacological intervention is not intended to reverse ASD-related disabilities, medications can treat symptoms of ASD and co-occurring conditions, including intellectual disabilities, language delays, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, agitation, irritability, disruptive behavior, and sleep disorders.

At least 83% of children and adolescents with ASD in the US have at least one co-occurring developmental disorder, and 70% display a co-occurring psychiatric condition. Physicians have treated these comorbidities with pharmaceutical agents, with varying degrees of success.

Overall, pharmacological agents used to treat patients with ASD fall into three broad categories:

- **Agitation and irritation**: Medications to address these symptoms.
- **Hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentive-type ADHD**: Medications targeting ADHD symptoms.
- **Mood and anxiety disorders**: Includes major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The major psychotropic medication classes used in individuals with ASD include ADHD medications.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^115Askn5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

One small, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that transdermal clonidine reduced hyperarousal symptoms in patients with ASD. A small, placebo-controlled study of oral clonidine in children with ASD had mixed findings. There are no RCTs of clonidine ER in the ASD population. Potential side effects of clonidine include somnolence, fatigue, and reductions in pulse and blood pressure. Clonidine tends to be more sedating than guanfacine. Of note, α2-adrenergic agonists can worsen constipation, which is a common issue in the ASD population. Patients can experience rebound hypertension with abrupt discontinuation of α2-adrenergic agonists.

Research indicates that α2-adrenergic agonists have a lower effect size than psychostimulants for treating symptoms of ADHD in non-autistic children and adolescents. Nonetheless, they can be attractive options for patients presenting with significant co-occurring issues, such as irritability, anxiety, disruptive behavior, tics, and sleep disturbances. Start with the IR preparations of guanfacine or clonidine for patients who cannot swallow tablets whole or who require a smaller initial dose.

Guanfacine IR is available in 1 mg and 2 mg tablets. The starting dose for ADHD is 0.5 mg (half of a 1 mg tablet), administered in the morning. The medication can be titrated up by 0.5 mg every few days as tolerated and divided into twice daily dosing. Some individuals may respond better to three or four times daily dosing. The maximum daily dose varies by weight and is 2 mg/day for patients weighing 27 to 40.5 kg, and 3 mg/day for patients weighing…

### Rexulti [^113NATDY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Rexulti for the treatment of irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose clinical study conducted in 119 Rexulti-treated pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years with irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria. In this study, somnolence (including sedation) occurred at a higher rate than reported in other Rexulti studies evaluating adults and elderly patients (16% in Rexulti-treated pediatric patients versus 5% for placebo). The mean increase in age-and-gender adjusted body weight z-score from baseline to last visit was 0.3 for Rexulti-treated patients versus 0.1 for placebo-treated patients. Increases in age-and-gender adjusted body weight z-score of at least 0.5 SD from baseline were higher in Rexulti-treated patients compared to placebo (19% versus 5%).

Of the 119 patients from this study, 95 entered the open-label treatment study and received up to 26 weeks of daily treatment with brexpiprazole. During the open-label treatment period, 2% of patients discontinued due to weight increase. In patients previously treated with Rexulti for 8 weeks, the mean increase in weight from the open-label study baseline to last visit was 4.5 kg, and 26% of patients had an increase in age-and-gender-adjusted body weight z-score of at least 0.5 SD from baseline.

### Principles of medicating children with neurodevelopmental and sleep disorders — a review [^112AdHox]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Conflict between the demands of the environment in which a child lives and the child's intrinsic sleep signature produces stress-behavior difficulties in the child. Distorted development, especially distorted brain development, often leads to distorted intrinsic sleep signatures. The sleep-behavior outcome, arising from the conflict between each child's sleep signature and the environmental niche in which they live, can be modified by medications on the one hand, and by taking the role of kin, peer, and social networks seriously.

Medications alter the intrinsic sleep signature of the child and the stress response. Non-medical interventions address the demands and constraints of the child's environmental niche. When the main medication strategy to address distorted sleep involves brain stimulation, those children that do not respond will often need a reversal of medication priorities. An inhibitory strategy is suggested as short-to-medium-term support, with sleep regulation being primary for longer-term management, and stimulatory strategies used sparingly, if at all.

We are often dealing with vulnerable populations that are not always reliable or accurate sources of information. Features of a presentation alerting the clinician to non-medication factors contributing to the failure of treatment are discussed.

### Melatonin in autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ZBSN6]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate melatonin-related findings in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified.

Comprehensive searches were conducted in the PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC databases from their inception to October 2010. Two reviewers independently assessed 35 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, meta-analysis was performed on five randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, and the quality of these trials was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist.

Nine studies measured melatonin or melatonin metabolites in ASD and all reported at least one abnormality, including an abnormal melatonin circadian rhythm in four studies, below average physiological levels of melatonin and/or melatonin derivatives in seven studies, and a positive correlation between these levels and autistic behaviors in four studies. Five studies reported gene abnormalities that could contribute to decreased melatonin production or adversely affect melatonin receptor function in a small percentage of children with ASD. Six studies reported improved daytime behavior with melatonin use. Eighteen studies on melatonin treatment in ASD were identified; these studies reported improvements in sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and night-time awakenings. Five of these studies were randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies; two of the studies contained blended samples of children with ASD.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^115HjafU]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

A thorough differential diagnosis should assess factors that may contribute to the clinical presentation and/or mimic symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These may include other neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety, mood disorders, and tic disorders; medical conditions such as sleep disturbance and hyperthyroidism; adverse effects of medications, such as movement disorders like akathisia due to an antipsychotic medication; or environmental considerations such as an unbefitting school placement. In some cases, a medical workup may be indicated to assess for medical causes, such as thyroid function tests to check for endocrine disorders like hyperthyroidism.
- **Signs and symptoms of ADHD in ASD**:

	- In the context of ASD, symptoms of ADHD may appear uniquely or in combination with other symptoms, presenting challenges in recognizing and diagnosing ADHD accurately.
- **Treatment**:

	- There are differences of opinion as to whether to first initiate pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions in the treatment of ADHD. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Clinical Practice Guideline on ADHD in the general population identifies parent-training behavior management (PTBM) as the first-line approach for preschool-aged children and medication management in conjunction with PTBM and behavioral classroom interventions for youth ages six years or older. Young et al. outline many non-pharmacological avenues through which to support children and adults with co-occurring ASD and ADHD and how to tailor these to meet the needs of the individual. Their practice recommendations echo the AAP guidelines for ADHD.

### Sleep, growth, and puberty after 2 years of prolonged-release melatonin in children with autism spectrum disorder [^111urJBK]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

A recent 3-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of pediatric prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) for insomnia in children with autism spectrum disorder. This study examined the long-term effects of PedPRM treatment on sleep, growth, body mass index, and pubertal development.
- **Method**: Eighty children and adolescents (2–17.5 years of age; 96% with autism spectrum disorder) who completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were given 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg PedPRM nightly for up to 104 weeks, followed by a 2-week placebo period to assess withdrawal effects.
- **Results**: Improvements in child sleep disturbance and caregiver satisfaction with child sleep patterns, quality of sleep, and quality of life were maintained throughout the 104-week treatment period (p < .001 versus baseline for all). During the 2-week withdrawal placebo period, measures declined compared with the treatment period but were still improved compared with baseline. PedPRM was generally safe; the most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (6.3%), somnolence (6.3%), and mood swings (4.2%). Changes in mean weight, height, body mass index, and pubertal status (Tanner staging done by a physician) were within normal ranges for age with no evidence of delay in body mass index or pubertal development.

Nightly PedPRM at the optimal dose (2, 5, or 10 mg nightly) is safe and effective for long-term treatment in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and insomnia. There were no observed detrimental effects on children's growth.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^115o9DwC]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Non-stimulants: Clonidine and guanfacine are α2-adrenergic agonists that exert their action primarily by stimulating presynaptic α2 receptors in the central nervous system. Their effects on noradrenergic transmission in the locus coeruleus and the prefrontal cortex are postulated to underlie their benefits on cognition and behavior. Clonidine and guanfacine were initially used as antihypertensive agents. Extended-release formulations of these drugs carry FDA approval as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to stimulants for the treatment of ADHD in patients aged 6–17 years.

Sixty-two subjects, aged 5–14 years, diagnosed with autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or PDD-NOS, participated in an 8-week RCT of guanfacine ER to target symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility. Doses ranged from 1 to 4 mg/day. ABC-Hyperactivity subscale scores fell by 43.6% in the active treatment group and 13.2% in the placebo group. The guanfacine group had a 50% positive response rate on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale compared to 9.4% for placebo. Drowsiness, fatigue, emotional/tearful presentation, dry mouth, and irritability were the most common side effects in the active treatment arm. In the guanfacine group, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse decreased in the first four weeks. By week eight, however, blood pressure parameters had returned close to baseline, while pulse was a little under 10 points below baseline. The results of this trial indicated that guanfacine ER is safe and efficacious for the short-term treatment of ADHD symptoms in autism.

### Pharmacologic treatment of autism [^113Qvao2]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Autism is a chronic and lifelong pervasive developmental disorder for which there is yet no effective cure, and medical management remains a major challenge for clinicians. In spite of the possible similarities with conditions that have an established pharmacotherapy, and despite improvements in some associated "problematic behaviors" following the use of available medications, effective medical treatment for the core symptoms involving language and social cognition remains elusive.

The purpose of the present article is to review biologic knowledge about autism in an attempt to correlate clinical trials with known mechanisms of disease. In addition, the need for controlled studies and for the creation of homogeneous subgroups of patients based on clinical and genetic characteristics is emphasized. The application of molecular genetic investigations and pharmacogenetics in the diagnostic work-up of autistic patients can lead to more effective individualized medical care.

### Non-pharmacological and melatonin interventions for pediatric sleep initiation and maintenance problems: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114AYEyz]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Sleep initiation and maintenance problems are common in the pediatric population, and while behavioral interventions are recommended, their efficacy remains to be evaluated in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatments and melatonin for sleep initiation and maintenance problems in healthy pediatric populations. We included 30 studies in the systematic review and 15 in the meta-analysis.

- **Sleep onset latency (SOL)**: The results support greater effectiveness of light therapy and melatonin than evidence-based psychological interventions, whether implemented in combination with light therapy or not.
- **Wake after sleep onset (WASO)**: Evidence-based psychological interventions and a combination of those techniques plus light treatment were the most efficacious.
- **Total sleep time (TST)**: A larger effect was shown for the combined treatment of evidence-based psychological intervention with light therapy compared to other interventions.

In conclusion, we found a high variability between study protocols likely impacting the results of the meta-analysis. Future randomized controlled trials, stratified by pediatric age classes, are needed to provide clear suggestions in clinical settings.

### Low-dose clonidine infusion to improve sleep in postoperative patients in the high-dependency unit. A randomised placebo-controlled single-centre trial [^111qHun3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Subjective sleep quality can also be assessed using questionnaires. At least 13 questionnaires have been used in ICU research, but the RCSQ is the only scale validated in an ICU population. The self-reported RCSQ correlated closely with polysomnography in 70 ICU patients. It is unclear whether nurses' assessment of sleep quality using the RCSQ is a reliable substitute for patient self-assessment. Our study found a clearer effect of clonidine in patient-reported scores, with the exception of the nurses' observation of the time taken to fall asleep — perhaps the most difficult element for a patient to assess.

We studied clonidine as an alternative to dexmedetomidine for several reasons. Clonidine is substantially cheaper than dexmedetomidine in our hospital. Dexmedetomidine is only available in intravenous form, requiring intravenous access, an infusion pump, and monitoring by nursing staff. If an equivalent dose of clonidine could be administered enterally or transcutaneously, discomfort and cost would be reduced. Dexmedetomidine's potential cardiovascular side effects require monitored critical-care environments, while enteral or transcutaneous clonidine could be administered in surgical wards. Dexmedetomidine's short elimination half-life (two hours) allows for easy titration when used as a sedative, but if used for low-dose prophylaxis, titratability is less useful. Clonidine's longer elimination half-life (12–16 hours) means any protective effects against postoperative delirium or improvement in sleep — if they exist — might last longer.

### Atypical sleep architecture and the autism phenotype [^115WDXKX]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

A growing body of evidence indicates that people with autism frequently experience sleep disorders and exhibit atypical sleep architecture. In order to establish whether sleep disorders truly belong to the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype, we conducted a subjective and objective study of sleep in a group of high-functioning adults with ASD but without sleep complaints, psychiatric disorders, or neurological comorbidity.

We compared the subjective data of 27 ASD participants with those of 78 healthy controls matched for chronological age and gender. Subjective measures of sleep in the clinical group were compatible with insomnia and/or a tolerable phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle. Subjective data were confirmed by objective laboratory sleep recordings in a subset of 16 patients and 16 controls.

Persons with autism presented with:

- **Sleep characteristics**:
	- Longer sleep latency (P < 0.04)
	- More frequent nocturnal awakenings (P < 0.03)
	- Lower sleep efficiency (P < 0.03)
	- Increased duration of stage 1 sleep (P < 0.02)
	- Decreased non-REM sleep (stages 2 + 3 + 4, P < 0.04) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 + 4, P < 0.05)
	- Fewer stage 2 EEG sleep spindles (P < 0.004)
	- Lower number of rapid eye movements during REM sleep (P < 0.006) than did control participants

On clinical scales:

- The scores of persons with ASD on the Beck Depression Inventory were similar to those of persons without, but their trait anxiety scores on the Spielberger Anxiety Scale were higher (P < 0.02).
- The state anxiety scores of the Spielberger scale and cortisol levels were the same in the two groups.

### Behavioural treatments for sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder: a review of the recent literature [^112m1Q5s]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Behavioural sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common and burdensome for both the child and their family. This paper provides an up-to-date review of behavioural sleep interventions and their core features, concluding with expert recommendations regarding the modification of interventions for children with ASD.

In the past three years, four original research studies (n ≥ 10) have evaluated behavioural sleep interventions for children with ASD; this includes one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and three pre-post studies. All four studies reported significant improvements across various sleep outcomes and daytime behaviours. The interventions varied in assessment comprehensiveness, nature of implementation support, length and delivery of intervention, outcome measurements, and follow-up periods.

Clinically, behavioural sleep interventions are regarded as the first-line treatment for sleep problems experienced by children with ASD. However, there is still much to be learned regarding their clinical effectiveness.

### New-onset seizures: A possible association with clonidine [^1134JZ34]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Clonidine is used as a second-line medication for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children. Product information concerning clonidine reported seizures only after overdosage of clonidine, and the prescription of clonidine has not been contraindicated in patients with known epilepsy. The present case report discusses a possible association of clonidine with new-onset seizures in the context of status epilepticus in a 9-year-old girl.

### Clonidine is better than zopiclone for insomnia treatment in chronic pain patients [^112iDBrt]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is associated with insomnia. The objective of this clinical study was to compare the efficacy and safety of different prescribed doses of zopiclone and clonidine for the management of insomnia in patients with chronic pain.

This prospective observational crossover study included 160 consenting adult patients receiving pain management treatment. For insomnia treatment, each patient ingested different prescribed doses of zopiclone or clonidine on alternate nights. Each patient used a specially validated sleep diary to collect data, including pain score, sleep scores, sleep duration, sleep medication dose, and adverse effects. Each patient completed the diary for three continuous weeks. Pain was measured using a numeric pain rating scale, and the sleep score was measured using the Likert Sleep Scale. A change in the pain or sleep scores by 2 points was considered significant. Of the 160 study participants, 150 (93.8%) completed the study successfully, and their data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) using Student's t-test, analysis of variance, Pearson chi-square test, and regression analysis. A P value < .05 was considered significant.
- **Results**: Pain score was lower with clonidine than zopiclone (P = 0.025). Time to fall asleep was shorter with clonidine than zopiclone (P = 0.001). Feeling rested on waking in the morning was better with clonidine than zopiclone (P = 0.015). Overall sleep quality was better with clonidine than zopiclone (P = 0.015). Total Likert sleep score was better with clonidine than zopiclone.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD), delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). An update for 2015: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116fHEiB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for circadian rhythm sleep disorders, specifically in the context of managing delayed SWPD, the AASM 2015 guidelines recommend considering the prescription of strategically timed melatonin in pediatric and adolescent patients with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. This recommendation applies both to those without comorbidities and those with comorbid psychiatric conditions.

### Clonidine conserves sleep spindle properties and age-dependent electroencephalogram patterns mirroring physiologic sleep in infants under spinal anesthesia [^116U4meX]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Low credibility.

Spinal anesthesia is an alternative to general anesthesia in infants. A caveat of spinal anesthesia in infants is its short block duration. Clonidine is a common adjunct that prolongs spinal anesthesia, though the mechanisms by which clonidine prolongs spinal anesthesia are unknown. Infants under spinal anesthesia appear in a sleep-like state. We hypothesized that infants receiving bupivacaine spinal anesthesia with clonidine may exhibit more sleep spindles on the electroencephalogram (EEG).
- **Methods**: We obtained intraoperative frontal EEG recordings in 73 infants under spinal anesthesia. We compared EEG spectral features of bupivacaine and bupivacaine + clonidine spinal anesthesia using nonparametric multitaper spectral analysis. A recently developed switching state-space modeling approach was then applied to extract and compare spindle features in bupivacaine versus bupivacaine + clonidine spinal anesthesia. We applied the same model to compare younger versus older infants.
- **Results**: There was no difference in the power spectra and sleep spindle detection probability between bupivacaine and bupivacaine + clonidine spinal anesthesia (P = 0.51). We found age-related EEG changes in both bupivacaine and bupivacaine + clonidine spinal anesthesia, independent of clonidine. Increasing age was associated with decreased spectral power from 0 to 0.6 Hz (median difference -2.9 dB, 95% CI [-5.3, -0.5]) and increased power from 2 to 15 Hz (median difference 3.4 dB, 95% CI [1.5, 5.2]). Increasing age was also associated with increased spindle strength (R² = 0.323, F(2,67) = 15.98).

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^116v9LBR]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

When an individual has a diagnosis of both ADHD and ASD, the trigger point for prescribing medication is when the ADHD symptom presentation is severe and/or associated with impairments that hamper personal, social, and educational development and achievement. Given the substantial symptom overlap between the two conditions, commencing with psychological/environmental interventions for ASD-associated difficulties, monitoring outcomes, and reviewing the need for medication is merited when both conditions present in an individual (child or adult).

In childhood and adolescence, if psychological/environmental interventions fail, ADHD medications (stimulant and non-stimulant) are beneficial for symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, especially when these arise distinctly from ADHD. In adults with co-occurring ASD and ADHD, appropriate ADHD medication should be administered with regular monitoring and should not be delayed until the completion of psychological treatment. This is particularly important when there is a shortage of specialized ASD/ADHD adult psychology services, as medication for ADHD may be a more immediately available treatment option. Such medication may also enhance adults' concentration, thereby maximizing the benefits of psychological treatment.

Prescribers need to be mindful of conditions or problems co-existing with combined ADHD and ASD and, if appropriate, prescribe medication. For example, melatonin may help in cases where it is deemed suitable.

### The use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric insomnia in primary care: Rational approaches. A consensus meeting summary [^116DJasT]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To formulate a rational approach to the pharmacologic treatment of pediatric insomnia, a consensus meeting aimed to develop clinical guidelines regarding indications, target populations, and parameters for medication use, especially by community-based pediatricians.

A multidisciplinary task force, developed under the auspices of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, included experts in pediatric sleep medicine, psychiatry, pharmacology, neurology, and general pediatrics.

The evidence reviewed included existing data on the use of over-the-counter and prescription medications for pediatric insomnia in primary care settings, along with empirical data on the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and tolerability of medications commonly used for treating pediatric insomnia.

The consensus process involved group consensus on defining pediatric insomnia and clinical guidelines, as well as working group recommendations regarding special populations and future directions.

The conclusions emphasize that the use of medications for pediatric insomnia should be diagnostically driven and implemented alongside empirically-based behavioral treatment strategies and adequate sleep hygiene. Specific target populations include children with neurodevelopmental disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, chronic medical conditions, and psychiatric disorders. Additional research, including clinical trials, is critically needed to provide an evidence-based approach to using these medications in clinical practice.

### Sleep difficulties and medications in children with autism spectrum disorders: A registry study [^113AKZzN]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Sleep difficulties are common in children with autism spectrum disorders, affecting the child's daytime behavior. We reviewed data within our Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network Registry to determine the prevalence of sleep difficulties and patterns of medication use.

Data from 1518 children aged 4 to 10 years were analyzed to determine the number of children documented to have sleep difficulties by parent-completed questionnaires and clinician-completed forms and how these findings related to the use of sleep medications.

The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire total score was ≥ 41 (associated with clinically significant sleep problems in past research) in 71% of children. The prevalence of sleep diagnoses was less frequent, found in 30% of children aged 4–10 years (P < .0001). Medications for sleep were prescribed to 46% of 4- to 10-year-olds given a sleep diagnosis. The most common medication used for sleep was melatonin followed by α-agonists, with a variety of other medications taken for sleep, including anticonvulsants, antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines. Children taking medications for sleep had worse daytime behavior and pediatric quality of life than children not taking sleep medications.

Parent concerns about sleep may not be reflected in the information gathered during a clinic visit, supporting the need to develop screening practice pathways for sleep in autism spectrum disorders. Furthermore, many medications taken for sleep have adverse effects, supporting the need for evidence-based approaches.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^112xxztt]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The treatment pathways defined in Figures 1 through 5 involve context-dependent decision-making due to the limited knowledge base in the literature. When choosing between medications within the same grouping, prescribers should consider how the medication side effect profiles will interact with the patient's unique clinical profile. Additionally, familiarity with a medication can influence proficiency in dosing, assessing efficacy, and monitoring for side effects.

### Web-survey of pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep interventions for children with early-onset bipolar spectrum disorders [^117G6ihx]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

A web-based survey was developed to explore the effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for sleep difficulties associated with early-onset bipolar spectrum disorders (EBSD).

Four hundred ninety-four parents of 4–12 year-olds, identified by parents as being diagnosed with EBSD, provided information about which professionals were consulted regarding their child's EBSD-related sleep problems and pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that helped or worsened sleep.

- **Results**: Most parents reported consulting at least one medical, mental health, and/or school professional regarding their child's sleep problems. Psychiatrists and other physicians were most often consulted. The majority of parents reported several medications/supplements as helpful, most commonly atypical antipsychotics (54.4%). Over half identified various pharmacological agents that worsened sleep, most commonly stimulants (35.0%). Most parents also reported several non-pharmacological interventions that aided sleep problems, most frequently a sleep routine. Over two-thirds reported a variety of non-pharmacological interventions that worsened sleep, most notably punishment (34.8%).

- **Limitations**: The sample was non-random, consisting of self-selected and web-savvy parents who self-identified their children as having EBSD and provided only parent-derived data.

- **Conclusions**: Although exploratory and despite limitations, this is the first survey to report data on both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for EBSD-related sleep problems. It highlights clinic…

### Provigil [^114Ctind]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In both studies, the primary measures of effectiveness were: 1) sleep latency, as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); and 2) the change in the patient's overall disease status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C). For a successful trial, both measures had to show statistically significant improvement.

The MWT measures latency (in minutes) to sleep onset averaged over four test sessions at two-hour intervals following nocturnal polysomnography. For each test session, the subject was asked to attempt to remain awake without using extraordinary measures. Each test session was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred or 10 minutes after sleep onset. The CGI-C is a seven-point scale, centered at No Change, and ranging from Very Much Worse to Very Much Improved. Patients were rated by evaluators who had no access to any data about the patients other than a measure of their baseline severity. Evaluators were not given any specific guidance about the criteria they were to apply when rating patients.

Both studies demonstrated improvement in objective and subjective measures of excessive daytime sleepiness for both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses compared to placebo. Patients treated with Provigil showed a statistically significantly enhanced ability to remain awake on the MWT at each dose compared to placebo at the final visit. A statistically significantly greater number of patients treated with Provigil at each dose showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at the final visit.

### Low-dose clonidine in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder [^117HtYVn]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms of hyperarousal are mediated through sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity. PTSD symptoms, including distressing thoughts and memories, flashbacks, hyperarousal, and sleep disturbances, have been linked with elevated norepinephrine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Clonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic agonist, reduces the release of norepinephrine and has been suggested as a treatment for PTSD. However, literature on the use of clonidine in PTSD is limited.

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical records of patients with PTSD treated with clonidine to assess reported efficacy and safety. A cohort of veterans with PTSD treated with clonidine at a midwestern VA hospital between July 2015 and January 2018 were studied retrospectively. Medical records of 79 patients with moderate to severe PTSD symptoms were reviewed by three independent clinicians using the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale to quantify symptom severity (CGI-S) before starting clonidine, and subjects' change in symptoms (CGI-I) after starting clonidine. Data on adverse events were also collected.
- **Subgroup analyses**: Conducted on the impact of comorbid diagnoses, conMedications, and substance use.
- **Baseline scores and outcomes**: Mean CGI-S score at baseline was 4.8 (5 = markedly ill). After treatment with low-dose clonidine, 72% of patients experienced improvement, and 49% scored "much improved" or "very much improved".
- **Adverse effects**: Reported by 18 out of 79 subjects.

In this retrospective analysis of veterans prescribed clonidine for PTSD, CGI-I scores suggested improvement.

### Sleep, growth, and puberty after 2 years of prolonged-release melatonin in children with autism spectrum disorder [^116ek8SN]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy of prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) was assessed by changes in the CSDI score after 13 weeks of treatment. This score change significantly correlated with variations in total sleep time (TST) recorded in the SND, regardless of whether participants received the active drug or placebo (Spearman's rank correlation −0.375; p < .001) [Supplemental Figure S1, available online].

The changes in CSDI and caregiver variables for participants originally assigned to the two randomization groups were evaluated by the end of the open-label (OL) phase (week 106). No significant differences in outcomes were noted at week 106 between participants who were initially assigned to placebo and those who were given PedPRM treatment for 91 weeks, compared to participants originally assigned to PedPRM and treated for 104 weeks. This lack of difference allowed the groups to be combined (Figure 2).

For the combined PedPRM and placebo groups (n = 74), the mean (SE) changes from baseline in CSDI sleep disturbance, caregiver satisfaction with the child's sleep patterns, and WHO-5 quality of life in the follow-up phase are presented in Figure 2. Data from weeks 28 and 54 on this combined population are also shown (yellow outline). Increases in efficacy were observed between week 28 and week 54, following dose optimization at week 28, which allowed some children to escalate to 10 mg/day. Significant improvements in CSDI (decrease), caregiver satisfaction with the child's sleep patterns (increase), and WHO-5 quality of life (increase) over baseline values were maintained until the end of PedPRM treatment.

### Prevalence of sleep abnormalities in Indian children with autism spectrum disorder: A cross-sectional study [^113jxE2h]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is on the rise. Apart from the core behavioral issues of impaired communication, impaired social interaction, and restricted and/or repeated behavioral phenotype, comorbidities like sleep problems are increasingly recognized as important determinants of management and overall quality of life.
- **Methods**: This study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in northern India over a two-year period. Children diagnosed with ASD and normally developing children (control subjects) aged 3 to 10 years were enrolled in the study. Both groups underwent sleep evaluation based on the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire. Children with ASD also underwent polysomnography, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Childhood Behavioral Checklist, and Developmental Profile 3 assessments.
- **Results**: The prevalence of poor sleepers among children with ASD and control subjects was 77.5% (confidence interval 66 to 86.5) and 29.2% (confidence interval 18.6 to 41.5), respectively (P < 0.01). The Childhood Behavioral Checklist score was significantly high in poor sleepers compared with good sleepers on the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (P = 0.004). There was no correlation of Childhood Autism Rating Scale or Developmental Profile 3 score with sleep problems in children with ASD.
- **Conclusions**: Nearly three-fourths of children with ASD have sleep abnormalities, which are significant determinants of overall quality of life.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^111CKpJ9]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sleep difficulties are more common in individuals with ASD than in non-autistics, with reported prevalence rates of 50–80% for children with ASD compared to 9–50% for control groups. Children with ASD between the ages of 2–5 years experience sleep problems twice as often as their peers in the general population, and these sleep difficulties in children of all ages tend to persist compared to typically developing peers.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of sleep parameters found that adults with ASD also demonstrate significantly impaired sleep compared to controls in most subjective and objective measures of sleep. The prevalence rate of sleep disturbances varies in ASD adults. In one study of adults with ASD, 85% had sleep problems, and in adults with ASD and intellectual disability (ID), about 45% were reported to have sleep problems. Even though sleep disturbances are common in ASD across the lifespan, they are reported less often in adults due to adaptation to impaired sleep patterns, and adult ASD sleep disturbances are understudied.

Sleep problems in ASD can manifest in many different forms, including difficulties with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, parasomnias (e.g. nightmares, night terrors, enuresis), hypersomnia (excessive sleeping or sleepiness), sleep-related breathing or movement disorders, isolated symptoms like short sleep or early waking, abnormal sleep patterns, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. The psychiatric and medical co-occurring conditions that contribute to sleep problems in ASD include anxiety, depression, ADHD, GI problems, and epilepsy.

### Psychopharmacology of autism spectrum disorders [^113hPokd]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

At present, no evidence-based effective pharmacologic options are available for treating the core deficits of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are best addressed by behavioral and educational interventions. However, such evidence exists for several of the frequently associated/comorbid symptoms such as aggression and severe irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive behaviors, which can become a major source of additional distress and interference in functioning. This article offers information on the psychopharmacology of ASD that is current, relevant, and organized in a user-friendly manner to form a concise but informative reference guide for primary pediatric clinicians.

### First night effect analysis in a cohort of young children with autism spectrum disorder [^116t2e43]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the first night effect (FNE) in a group of young children with autism. The design involved analyzing polysomnographic data from a two-night sleep laboratory study at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health. The participants were 15 children, aged 2–10 years, diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). No interventions were applied during the study.

Polysomnographic analysis revealed the presence of an FNE for wake after sleep onset minutes, stage 2, and sleep efficiency, but not for REM sleep parameters or total sleep time (TST). In this two-night polysomnographic analysis of sleep stages in young children with autism, the expected second night increase in total sleep time or REM sleep percentage, or a decrease in REM sleep latency, was not observed. This lack of an FNE for TST and REM parameters suggests that a single-night polysomnogram may be sufficient to evaluate children with an ASD for TST or REM parameters.

### Sleep and autism spectrum disorders [^115MwvHp]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in children with autism spectrum disorders and have a significant effect on daytime function and parental stress. The cornerstone of treatment is to establish the cause of the sleep concern, which is often multifactorial. Identifying and treating sleep disorders may result not only in more consolidated sleep, more rapid time to fall asleep, and avoidance of night waking but also favorably affect daytime behavior and parental stress. Targeting effective treatment strategies is dependent on understanding the underlying causes of sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorders; therefore, further research is paramount.

### Autism spectrum disorder: Consensus guidelines on assessment, treatment and research from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116HboHD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). High credibility.

The 2018 guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) recommend initiating methylphenidate as first-line therapy for children with both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Additionally, atomoxetine or an α-2A receptor agonist is recommended as second-line therapy in pediatric patients. It is important to recognize that pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder may experience more side effects and exhibit a diminished response compared to patients with ADHD who do not have autism spectrum disorder.

### New models for considering the role of medication in the treatment and elucidation of the etiology of autism [^114jj3pQ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder. Over the past decades, much research has been conducted to elucidate a single etiological factor and effective pharmacotherapeutics to address the core symptom domains of ASD, with limited success. The focus of research has shifted from behavioral observations of ASD to translating findings from animal models, genomic manipulation studies, and basic science studies to pharmacological agents aimed at lessening or reversing core symptoms of ASD. This paper evaluates potential models for translating information from the biology of ASD to pharmacological treatments.

Guanfacine is a medication in the same drug class as clonidine (α2-adrenergic agonist), and some practitioners may prefer trying guanfacine before clonidine. Guanfacine is FDA-approved for ADHD in children but is used off-label for sleep disturbances. The short-acting guanfacine can be prescribed at a starting dose of half of a 1 mg tablet (0.5 mg) and can be increased by 0.5–1 mg every 3 to 5 days as tolerated, up to 2 mg for sleep disturbances. Long-acting guanfacine preparations can be effective for sleep maintenance. If the short-acting preparation is effective with sleep onset and the patient can swallow a pill, then guanfacine ER can be tried. Dosing of guanfacine ER should start with 1 mg (these tablets cannot be broken or chewed) and can be increased every 5–7 days until achieving the desired clinical response or reaching a maximum dose of 4 mg/day.

Trazodone, a 5-HT2 antagonist, was initially FDA-approved for the treatment of depression in adults and was found to be too sedating. It is thus frequently used for sleep disturbance in adults and children with mood and anxiety disorders. There are no RCTs of trazodone in children with ASD, yet clinically, it is a very effective medication for improving sleep onset and maintenance. Side effects, including prolonged erection of the penis (priapism), should be explained to patients and families. Start with half of a 50 mg tablet (25 mg) at bedtime and increase weekly by 25 mg to a maximum dosage of 100–150 mg at bedtime, depending on body weight.

Mirtazapine is a central presynaptic α2-adrenergic antagonist.
