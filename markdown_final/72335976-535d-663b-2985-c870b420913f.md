## Question

What does gaba do what happens when there is too much or too little and what meds promote or reduce gaba

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what GABA does, what happens when there is too much or too little GABA, and which medications increase or decrease GABA activity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about GABA's core function and receptor subtypes. Then, I should verify the consequences of GABA deficiency versus excess. Next, I will categorize medications that enhance versus reduce GABA signaling, and I need to be careful to distinguish true GABAergic drugs from those with indirect or disputed mechanisms. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications and safety considerations, including tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal phenomena.

> Let me first confirm the basics: GABA is the brain's principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, acting via GABA-A (ionotropic, fast) and GABA-B (metabotropic, slow) receptors to reduce neuronal excitability; GABA-A activation typically increases chloride influx and hyperpolarizes neurons, while GABA-B modulates presynaptic release and postsynaptic potentials through second messengers, maintaining excitatory–inhibitory balance in circuits across the CNS.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "too little GABA" without anchoring to disease states. GABA deficiency or impaired GABAergic function is linked to hyperexcitability syndromes such as epilepsy, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and alcohol withdrawal, reflecting a shift toward excess excitation; mechanistically, this includes reduced GABA synthesis, impaired receptor function, or impaired clearance, and is supported by clinical and preclinical data showing low GABA levels or GABAergic dysfunction in these conditions [^eb26d420] [^0921786e] [^3d74bd1d].

> Wait, let me verify the "too much GABA" side. Excess GABAergic inhibition can manifest as sedation, cognitive slowing, respiratory depression, and impaired motor coordination; clinically, this is seen with benzodiazepine or barbiturate overdose, and in pathological contexts such as hepatic encephalopathy where GABAergic tone is increased. Importantly, after stroke, heightened tonic GABAergic inhibition in peri-infarct cortex constrains plasticity and recovery, and reducing extrasynaptic GABA-A signaling improves functional outcomes in animal models, illustrating that "more GABA" is not always beneficial [^8bd02b79] [^c87d50bc].

> I will now examine medications that increase GABAergic activity, but I need to ensure I separate true GABAergic mechanisms from indirect effects. Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam) are positive allosteric modulators at the GABA-A receptor's benzodiazepine site and enhance phasic inhibition; barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital) prolong chloride channel opening and can directly activate GABA-A at high doses; neuroactive steroids like brexanolone and ganaxolone potentiate both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA-A currents; tiagabine inhibits GABA reuptake (GAT-1), vigabatrin irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase, and valproate increases GABA synthesis and reduces degradation; propofol and etomidate enhance GABA-A function and are used for anesthesia and sedation [^7a64d7a0] [^d83845cc] [^ac31d228].

> But wait, what if a drug is structurally related to GABA yet not truly GABAergic? Gabapentin and pregabalin bind the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and reduce calcium-dependent excitatory neurotransmitter release; they do not directly modulate GABA binding, uptake, or degradation, so calling them "GABA-enhancing" is misleading even though they reduce excitatory drive and can indirectly affect inhibitory tone in some circuits [^c0275a92] [^43031fd8].

> Next, I should review agents that reduce GABAergic activity. Flumazenil is a GABA-A benzodiazepine-site antagonist used to reverse benzodiazepine overdose; bicuculline is a competitive GABA-A antagonist used experimentally; and β-carbolines like DMCM act as negative allosteric modulators at the benzodiazepine site and are pro-convulsant and anxiogenic, illustrating the pathological consequences of blocking GABA-A signaling; clinically, abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepines or alcohol exposes a relative GABA deficiency and can precipitate seizures, underscoring the need for careful tapering and substitution strategies [^9522746c] [^0921786e].

> Let me consider disease-specific nuances so I don't overgeneralize. In epilepsy, enhancing phasic GABA-A inhibition is anticonvulsant, whereas excessive tonic inhibition can be maladaptive in some models; in stroke recovery, reducing extrasynaptic tonic inhibition improves plasticity, whereas enhancing phasic inhibition may aid repair in specific windows; in anxiety and mood disorders, GABAergic deficits are implicated, but chronic benzodiazepine use can worsen outcomes via tolerance and dependence, prompting interest in subtype-selective modulators and neuroactive steroids that may avoid sedation and addiction liability [^8bd02b79] [^c006c460] [^0e98c0a4].

> I should double-check safety and clinical trade-offs. Chronic benzodiazepine use leads to tolerance, dependence, cognitive impairment, and withdrawal seizures on discontinuation; barbiturates carry risks of respiratory depression and overdose; propofol can cause profound sedation and respiratory depression; thus, GABAergic enhancement must be individualized, time-limited, and monitored, with non-benzodiazepine strategies considered when appropriate, such as SSRIs/SNRIs for anxiety, levetiracetam for seizures, and neuroactive steroids for postpartum depression, while avoiding hazardous combinations with alcohol or opioids [^0e98c0a4] [^0921786e] [^d83845cc].

> In summary, GABA maintains inhibitory tone and circuit stability. Too little GABA drives hyperexcitability and is linked to epilepsy, anxiety, mood disorders, and withdrawal states, whereas too much GABA causes sedation, cognitive and motor impairment, and can impede recovery after brain injury. Medications that enhance GABA include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neuroactive steroids, tiagabine, vigabatrin, valproate, and general anesthetics, whereas flumazenil, bicuculline, and β-carbolines reduce GABA-A function; careful selection, dosing, and monitoring are essential to balance benefit and risk [^8bd02b79] [^7a64d7a0] [^9522746c].

---

GABA is the brain's **primary inhibitory neurotransmitter** that reduces neuronal excitability by increasing chloride influx and hyperpolarizing neurons. Too little GABA causes **hyperexcitability** [^6d1d8e5f], leading to anxiety, insomnia, epilepsy, and seizures [^3d74bd1d]; too much GABA causes sedation, cognitive impairment, respiratory depression, and coma [^c87d50bc]. Medications that increase GABA include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, gabapentin, pregabalin, valproate, tiagabine, vigabatrin, and propofol [^7a64d7a0] [^ac31d228]; medications that reduce GABA include flumazenil (benzodiazepine antagonist) [^9522746c] and bicuculline (GABA-A antagonist) [^664c668e].

## Physiological role of GABA

GABA is the **primary inhibitory neurotransmitter** in the CNS [^c8ab613c], released by interneurons to regulate excitability and prevent excessive firing [^63233861]. It binds to GABA-A (ionotropic) and GABA-B (metabotropic) receptors [^c8ab613c], increasing chloride influx and causing hyperpolarization, which suppresses action potentials [^6271bf7c]. GABA also shapes neural circuits, supports plasticity, and modulates sleep, anxiety, and motor control [^94be5935] [^bb6364f3].

---

## Consequences of insufficient GABA

Insufficient GABAergic inhibition leads to **neuronal hyperexcitability** [^6d1d8e5f] and is linked to:

- **Anxiety disorders**: Reduced GABA is associated with anxiety and hyperarousal [^a94ad670] [^7c511cc4].
- **Insomnia**: Low GABA disrupts sleep onset and maintenance [^bb6364f3].
- **Epilepsy and seizures**: GABA deficits lower seizure thresholds and promote epileptogenesis [^3d74bd1d] [^ce2f760c].
- **Mood disorders**: Reduced GABA is implicated in depression and bipolar disorder [^eb26d420] [^d83845cc].

---

## Consequences of excessive GABA

Excessive GABAergic inhibition causes **CNS depression** [^c87d50bc] and is linked to:

- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: Over-inhibition slows cognition and motor function [^738b15e8].
- **Respiratory depression**: High GABA tone can suppress breathing, especially with sedatives [^fe3d5a9f].
- **Coma**: Profound GABAergic excess can cause coma or death [^notfound].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** |
|-|-|-|
| Benzodiazepines | - Diazepam <br/> - Lorazepam <br/> - Alprazolam | Positive allosteric modulators at GABA-A receptors [^6271bf7c] [^7a64d7a0] |
| Barbiturates | - Phenobarbital <br/> - Pentobarbital | Prolong GABA-A chloride channel opening [^90874d38] [^7a64d7a0] |
| Gabapentinoids | - Gabapentin <br/> - Pregabalin | Bind α2δ subunits, reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release [^c0275a92] [^43031fd8] |

| General anesthetics | - Propofol <br/> - Etomidate | Potentiate GABA-A receptors [^ac31d228] [^6eecbf96] |

---

## Medications that decrease GABA activity

Fewer agents **reduce GABAergic function**:

- **Flumazenil**: Benzodiazepine antagonist at GABA-A receptors [^9522746c].
- **Bicuculline**: Competitive GABA-A antagonist (research use) [^664c668e].
- **FG-7142**: Inverse agonist at benzodiazepine site (research use) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

Balancing GABAergic activity is essential: too little causes hyperexcitability, while too much causes sedation and respiratory depression. Chronic benzodiazepine use can cause **tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal** [^0e98c0a4]; clinicians should monitor for adverse effects and interactions, especially with other CNS depressants [^fe3d5a9f].

---

GABA is the **primary inhibitory neurotransmitter** [^c8ab613c]; too little causes hyperexcitability (anxiety, insomnia, seizures), and too much causes sedation and respiratory depression. Medications can enhance or reduce GABA activity, so careful selection and monitoring are required to balance efficacy and safety.

Modulatory agents of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors have been widely used for more than 40 years to treat anxiety, epilepsy, and sleep disorders; these drugs are generally safe, well tolerated, and effective. Recently, there has been a substantial growth in understanding of the mechanism of action of these drugs, which act at different sites on GABAA receptors. A variety of GABAA receptor subtypes with distinct functional roles have been characterized and an evolving awareness of GABAA receptor modulation holds promise for the future development of new, more sophisticated drug interventions that can elicit more selective effects by targeting specific subtypes of GABAA receptors. Advances in genetic engineering have led to the development of transgenic mouse models that have further refined our understanding of the pharmacology and physiology for various GABAA receptor subunits.

### Is there more to GABA than synaptic inhibition? [^fa57e471]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act as a trophic factor during nervous system development to influence events such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates these processes by the activation of traditional ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and probably by both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional properties of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain. The unique features of the early-appearing GABA signalling systems might help to explain how GABA acts as a developmental signal.

### GABAergic dysfunction in mood disorders [^eb26d420]. Molecular Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The authors review the available literature on the preclinical and clinical studies involving GABAergic neurotransmission in mood disorders. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter present almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS), distributed across almost all brain regions, and expressed in interneurons modulating local circuits. The role of GABAergic dysfunction in mood disorders was first proposed 20 years ago. Preclinical studies have suggested that GABA levels may be decreased in animal models of depression, and clinical studies reported low plasma and CSF GABA levels in mood disorder patients. Also, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, electroconvulsive therapy, and GABA agonists have been shown to reverse the depression-like behavior in animal models and to be effective in unipolar and bipolar patients by increasing brain GABAergic activity. The hypothesis of reduced GABAergic activity in mood disorders may complement the monoaminergic and serotonergic theories, proposing that the balance between multiple neurotransmitter systems may be altered in these disorders. However, low GABAergic cortical function may probably be a feature of a subset of mood disorder patients, representing a genetic susceptibility. In this paper, we discuss the status of GABAergic hypothesis of mood disorders and suggest possible directions for future preclinical and clinical research in this area.

### GABA tone regulation and its cognitive functions in the brain [^94be5935]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter released at GABAergic synapses, mediating fast-acting phasic inhibition. Emerging lines of evidence unequivocally indicate that a small amount of extracellular GABA - GABA tone - exists in the brain and induces a tonic GABA current that controls neuronal activity on a slow timescale relative to that of phasic inhibition. Surprisingly, studies indicate that glial cells that synthesize GABA, such as astrocytes, release GABA through non-vesicular mechanisms, such as channel-mediated release, and thereby act as the source of GABA tone in the brain. In this Review, we first provide an overview of major advances in our understanding of the cell-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of GABA synthesis, release and clearance that regulate GABA tone in various brain regions. We next examine the diverse ways in which the tonic GABA current regulates synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity through extrasynaptic GABA A -receptor-mediated mechanisms. Last, we discuss the physiological mechanisms through which tonic inhibition modulates cognitive function on a slow timescale. In this Review, we emphasize that the cognitive functions of tonic GABA current extend beyond mere inhibition, laying a foundation for future research on the physiological and pathophysiological roles of GABA tone regulation in normal and abnormal psychiatric conditions.

### Revisiting benzodiazepines (GABA enhancers): a transdiagnostic and precision medicine approach [^429ae221]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the mid 1980's, there has been an increased focus on the side effects of benzodiazepines (GABA enhancers), and as a result there has been a decrease in their use. We have systematically reviewed recent studies of GABA enhancers in psychiatry, and highlight evidence of their utility which may impact their negative conceptualization in clinical practice. We propose a new perspective on the appropriate use of these medications and describeclinical reasoning underpinning the use of benzodiazepine (GABA enhancers) based on their effect on specific receptors. A translational approach, involving a more comprehensive characterization of GABA receptors and their neuroscience-based mechanisms allows for a more precise use of this medication class. By adopting a precision person-centered approach, instead of a categorical approach, supports the prescribing of GABA enhancers when a cross-cutting transdiagnostic assessment shows anxiety symptoms associated with clinical impairment.

### The GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex: structure, function, and role in anxiety [^ba1de8b7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines bind to a specific site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. This complex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety by numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. Preclinical studies have shown that there are multiple molecular forms of this receptor complex, that these genetically coded variations are linked to specific actions of the benzodiazepines, and that receptors are located in neuroanatomical areas known to mediate the anxiety response in animals and humans. Human studies have shown that patients with pathologic anxiety have anomalous responses to drugs that specifically bind to these receptors and have reduced numbers of benzodiazepine receptors in key brain areas that regulate anxiety responses. More recent preclinical studies suggest that molecular alterations in this receptor complex may produce findings in animals similar to those observed in anxious humans. Finally, chronic treatment with benzodiazepines causes the development of tolerance, which may be associated with molecular changes and a pharmacologic response profile similar to that observed in pathologically anxious humans.

### Mechanisms and functions of GABA co-release [^5856dc07]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2016). Medium credibility.

The 'one neuron, one neurotransmitter' doctrine states that synaptic communication between two neurons occurs through the release of a single chemical transmitter. However, recent findings suggest that neurons that communicate using more than one classical neurotransmitter are prevalent throughout the adult mammalian CNS. In particular, several populations of neurons previously thought to release only glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine or histamine also release the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Here, we review these findings and discuss the implications of GABA co-release for synaptic transmission and plasticity.

### Evidence-based medicine for… [^d0eff85d]. chemm.hhs.gov (2013). Low credibility.

The anticonvulsant midazolam has been shown to be effective against both convulsant and cholinergic, soman, cyclosarin, tabun, VX, and organophosphorus pesticides) agents by enhancing the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid at GABA receptors and limiting excess central nervous system excitation and seizures. Mechanism of action Midazolam, like other benzodiazepines, is presumed to interact with the gamma-aminobutyric acid -benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is widespread in the brain of humans as well as other species. The pharmacodynamic consequences of benzodiazepine agonist actions include antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of seizure activity. Midazolam binds to the GABA receptor but does not displace GABA; rather, it enhances the affinity of GABA for its receptor site on the same receptor complex.

The pharmacodynamic consequences of benzodiazepine agonist actions include antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of seizure activity. The intensity of action is directly related to the degree of benzodiazepine receptor occupancy. In the presence of atropine sulfate, the benzodiazepines, mecamylamine, flunarizine, diphenylhydantoin, clonidine, CGS 19755 and Organon 6370 studied were effective. There was no significant side effect in both the groups. The findings suggest that buccal midazolam can be used as an alternative to intravenous diazepam especially when getting an IV line becomes difficult. In situations where establishing an IV line is a problem, buccal midazolam may be the first choice. When treatment was given 5 min after seizure onset, all three benzodiazepines controlled seizures in virtually 100% of the cases at the higher doses.

Time to terminate seizures tended to decrease at the higher doses of diazepam, although there were still a number of outliers at all doses tested. Seizure termination times were short with midazolam and did not substantially decrease at higher doses, again with a number of outliers.

### The role of GABA in anxiety disorders [^a94ad670]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Anxiety stems from and perpetuates dysregulation of neurobiological systems, but the exact mechanisms of anxiety disorders are still only partially understood. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter known to counterbalance the action of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Several pharmacologic agents target the GABA system and modulate the overall effect of GABA. This article highlights multiple neurobiological interactions that play a role in anxiety and reviews selected studies of plasma neurosteroid levels, plasma GABA levels, and benzodiazepine binding site sensitivity and density in patients with anxiety disorders. The article concludes with further support for the role of the GABA system in anxiety by summarizing the current evidence supporting the use of novel GABAergic agents including tiagabine in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

### Neurosteroids: endogenous regulators of the GABA (A) receptor [^29092a31]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors mediate most of the 'fast' synaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain and are targeted by many clinically important drugs. Certain naturally occurring pregnane steroids can potently and specifically enhance GABA(A) receptor function in a nongenomic (direct) manner, and consequently have anxiolytic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and anaesthetic properties. These steroids not only act as remote endocrine messengers, but also can be synthesized in the brain, where they modify neuronal activity locally by modulating GABA(A) receptor function. Such 'neurosteroids' can influence mood and behaviour in various physiological and pathophysiological situations, and might contribute to the behavioural effects of psychoactive drugs.

### Activation of GABAA receptors: views from outside the synaptic cleft [^cbaa3501]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Some GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are activated by low transmitter levels present in the extracellular space and generate an uninterrupted conductance referred to as "tonic". This tonic conductance is highly sensitive to all factors regulating the amount of GABA surrounding the neurons. Only a few GABA(A)Rs with particular subunit combinations are well suited to mediate the tonic conductance. These same receptors constitute important and specific targets for various endogenous and exogenous neuroactive compounds and possible therapeutic targets.

### Reducing excessive GABA-mediated tonic inhibition promotes functional recovery after stroke [^8bd02b79]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of disability, but no pharmacological therapy is currently available for promoting recovery. The brain region adjacent to stroke damage-the peri-infarct zone-is critical for rehabilitation, as it shows heightened neuroplasticity, allowing sensorimotor functions to re-map from damaged areas. Thus, understanding the neuronal properties constraining this plasticity is important for the development of new treatments. Here we show that after a stroke in mice, tonic neuronal inhibition is increased in the peri-infarct zone. This increased tonic inhibition is mediated by extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and is caused by an impairment in GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporter (GAT-3/GAT-4) function. To counteract the heightened inhibition, we administered in vivo a benzodiazepine inverse agonist specific for α5-subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors at a delay after stroke. This treatment produced an early and sustained recovery of motor function. Genetically lowering the number of α5- or δ-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition also proved beneficial for recovery after stroke, consistent with the therapeutic potential of diminishing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Together, our results identify new pharmacological targets and provide the rationale for a novel strategy to promote recovery after stroke and possibly other brain injuries.

### Effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid on working memory and attention: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^e88139f1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in the central nervous system. Studies on both animals and humans show that GABA has the pharmacological potential for reducing the impact of cognitive disorders, as well as enhancing cognitive functions and mood. However, its specific effects on human attention and working memory have not yet been extensively studied.

Aims:

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover trial, we aimed to test whether the administration of 800 mg GABA, dissolved in a drink, acutely affected visual working memory (VWM) maintenance, as well as temporal and spatial attention in healthy adults.

Methods:

The participants were 32 young adults (16 females and 16 males). Working memory recall precision, spatial attention and temporal attention were measured by a delayed match-to-sample task, a visual search (VS) task and a speeded rapid serial visual presentation task, respectively. Participants completed two experimental sessions (GABA and Placebo) in randomized and counterbalanced order. In each session, 45 min after administration of the drink, they completed all three aforementioned cognitive tasks.

Results:

Linear mixed model analysis results showed that GABA increased VS time, compared to the placebo, but did not affect VS accuracy, temporal attention, nor VWM precision.

Conclusions:

The results suggest that GABA increases VS time but does not affect temporal attention and memory, and that previously reported effects on cognition might rely on other functions.

Introduction

Humans seem to have an innate desire to enhance their abilities, physical as well as cognitive. This is why many people take dietary supplements on a regular basis. One such supplement that has been popular in recent years is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and can be found to occur naturally in various foods such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes, spinach and soybeans. Therefore, even without supplementation, many people already consume GABA daily. It is conceivable that GABA consumption may have (positive) effects on neuronal signalling, and thereby improve cognition.

Due to its concentration in the central nervous system (CNS), GABA plays a critical role in all mammals. In the CNS, GABA acts via its two primary receptors, GABA A and GABA B, which are responsible for different regulation systems and include several subtypes. GABA A receptors regulate mood, vigilance, muscle tension, and memory functions, while GABA B receptors regulate cerebral reward processes and behaviour. Whereas primarily GABA A receptors are associated with cognitive functions, it has been suggested that GABA B receptors also play a crucial role in memory, learning and neurological disorders. In particular, subtype α 5 GABA A receptors are central to the pharmacological modulation of learning and memory. These receptors thus seem crucial to the effect of GABA on cognitive functions.

GABA also seems to have region-specific effects within the brain. It has been shown that a decrease in hippocampal GABA A receptor α 5 subunits disrupts object recognition and memory in mice. Similarly, reduced hippocampal GABAergic inhibition in GABA A receptors causes lower memory and attention performance in rats. In the prefrontal cortex, GABA activations and levels also influence cognitive functions directly and indirectly.reported that dysregulation of GABAergic activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged rats negatively affected their working memory performance. Furthermore, Auger and Floresco showed that antagonism in GABA A signalling in the prefrontal cortex affects search behaviours that are guided by spatial working memory, short-term and reference memory in rats. Nevertheless, the same study showed that blocking GABA's action does not affect spatial discrimination performance. In other words, GABA's action did affect working memory performance, but not to the extent that it had a noticeable effect on the precision of memory.

### GABA systems, benzodiazepines, and substance dependence [^971c4f0b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Alterations in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex and GABA neurotransmission influence the reinforcing and intoxicating effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines. Chronic modulation of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex plays a major role in central nervous system dysregulation during alcohol abstinence. Withdrawal symptoms stem in part from a decreased GABAergic inhibitory function and an increase in glutamatergic excitatory function. GABA(A) receptors play a role in both reward and withdrawal phenomena from alcohol and sedative-hypnotics. Although less well understood, GABA(B) receptor complexes appear to play a role in inhibition of motivation and diminish relapse potential to reinforcing drugs. Evidence suggests that long-term alcohol use and concomitant serial withdrawals permanently alter GABAergic function, down-regulate benzodiazepine binding sites, and in preclinical models lead to cell death. Benzodiazepines have substantial drawbacks in the treatment of substance use-related disorders that include interactions with alcohol, rebound effects, alcohol priming, and the risk of supplanting alcohol dependency with addiction to both alcohol and benzodiazepines. Polysubstance-dependent individuals frequently self-medicate with benzodiazepines. Selective GABA agents with novel mechanisms of action have anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and reward inhibition profiles that have potential in treating substance use and withdrawal and enhancing relapse prevention with less liability than benzodiazepines. The GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen has promise in relapse prevention in a number of substance dependence disorders. The GABA(A) and GABA(B) pump reuptake inhibitor tiagabine has potential for managing alcohol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal and also possibly a role in relapse prevention.

### Γ-aminobutyric acid regulates both the survival and replication of human β-cells [^a9df5ce4]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

A central focus of research in the type 1 diabetes (T1D) field is to develop ways to safely improve β-cell survival and function and promote their replication. The addition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or the GABA B receptor (GABA B -R)–specific agonist baclofen to culture media has been shown to inhibit β-cell apoptosis in cultured rodent cell lines and islets. It remains to be determined whether GABA treatment can inhibit mouse β-cell apoptosis in vivo or, more importantly, whether it can protect human β-cells from stress-induced apoptosis. If GABA can inhibit human β-cell apoptosis, elucidating whether this effect is mediated through the G-protein–coupled GABA B -Rs, and/or the chloride channel GABA A -Rs will enable more specific drug targeting.

GABA can promote neurogenesis and neuronal proliferation and is a neuronal survival factor. GABA has also been shown to promote rodent β-cell replication. Those studies, however, differentially pointed to GABA A -Rs or GABA B -Rs as modulators of GABA's effects, making it important to clarify whether one or both types of GABA receptors modulate rodent β-cell replication. While a number of mitogens and growth factors can promote rodent β-cell replication, most fail to promote human β-cell replication (reviewed in refs.). Therefore, a key question is whether GABA can promote human β-cell replication. Even a small amount of GABA-induced human β-cell replication may be clinically useful by lowering insulin requirements and reducing the risk for long-term complications in T1D patients.

### Enhanced phasic GABA inhibition during the repair phase of stroke: a novel therapeutic target [^9b94297b]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mechanisms that promote brain repair and recovery offer novel drug targets for stroke, a major cause of adult disability with very few therapeutic options. The majority of available treatments target the acute phase of ischaemic stroke to establish reperfusion and reduce brain cell death, but must be administered within a few hours of stroke onset. Unfortunately, < 10% of stroke patients can benefit from such treatments due, in large part, to late referral to the hospital and inability to meet other eligibility criteria. In contrast to the acute stage, the repair phase of stroke occurs days to months after the stroke incident and thus offers an expanded therapeutic window. Importantly, brain plasticity and remapping during the repair phase play a major role in the spontaneous recovery observed after stroke in both humans and rodents. For example, reorganization and rewiring of surviving circuits, including those adjacent to the stroke site (i.e. the peri-infarct), enable the healthy portion of the brain to compensate for the functions of the stroke-damaged area. Deciphering the specific synaptic changes involved in the repair phase of stroke, and identifying those that can be modulated to improve outcome, is paramount to identifying novel therapeutics to promote functional recovery.

GABAergic signaling and normal brain functioning

The complex interplay between excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory GABAergic neurons is essential to achieving balanced cortical neural activity. The glutamatergic-GABAergic balance is tightly regulated by the biosynthesis, transport, and signaling of the respective neurotransmitters (ie, glutamate and GABA) in the central nervous system (CNS). The biosynthesis of glutamate and GABA are interrelated via the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. Briefly, glutamatergic neurons release glutamate via synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft, where it is taken up by astrocytes and converted to glutamine. Glutamine is transported back to glutamatergic neurons, hydrolyzed to glutamate, and repackaged into synaptic vesicles. GABAergic neurons release GABA into the synapse, where it is taken up by astrocytes and ultimately converted to glutamine. Glutamine is then transported to GABAergic neurons, where it is converted to glutamate by glutaminase and then to GABA by glutamate decarboxylase.

GABAergic transmission enhancers

GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex which acts by binding to two types of receptors: GABA A, an ionotropic receptor (GABA A R), and GABA B (GABA B R), a metabotropic receptor.

Benzodiazepines (e.g. clobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) are GABA-positive allosteric modulators able to enhance the effect of synaptically released GABA, binding a specific well-characterised site at the α+-γ2– subunit interface. Barbiturates (PHB) act in a very similar way and, at high doses, have also a partial agonist effect, in the absence of GABA itself. The binding site of barbiturates within the GABA A R remains controversial.

Stiripentol (STP) also operates as a GABA A R modulator, with a high affinity for α3- and δ-subunits. Other ASMs, such as FBM and TPM, present a positive modulating action on GABA A R within their range of action.

GABA transporters (GATs) and the GABA catabolic enzyme GABA -transaminase (GABA-T) represent major inactivating systems of GABAergic transmission, removing GABA through uptake into both glia and presynaptic nerve terminals and then catabolising respectively.

To enhance GABA neurotransmission, vigabatrin and tiagabine were designed. They are selective irreversible inhibitors of respectively GABA-T and GAT-1. The former results in an overall increase in GABA levels whereas the latter prolongs the synaptic presence of GABA transiently.

An increase in GABA levels is also suggested for TPM and GBP, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Lastly, it is interesting to report how other non-receptor-mediated signalling mechanisms have also been suggested for ASMs, as in the case of the VPA, which is attributed to a role in increasing GABA synthesis and reducing its degradation.

Also worthy of mention is ganaxolone, recently approved by FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with Cyclin-dependent Kinase-like 5 Deficiency Disorder.

This synthetic neuroactive steroid functions as a positive allosteric modulator for both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors, binding to a site separate from benzodiazepines or barbiturates. It has been proposed it might be able to enhance GABAergic signalling during instances when synaptic GABA A receptors are internalized and benzodiazepines exhibit reduced effectiveness, as seen in refractory status epilepticus.

### Beyond classical benzodiazepines: novel therapeutic potential of GABAA receptor subtypes [^2c224c2a]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2011). Medium credibility.

GABA(A) (γ-aminobutyric acid, type A) receptors are a family of ligand-gated ion channels that are essential for the regulation of central nervous system function. Benzodiazepines - which non-selectively target GABA(A) receptors containing the α1, α2, α3 or α5 subunits - have been in clinical use for decades and are still among the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety disorders. However, their use is limited by side effects and the risk of drug dependence. In the past decade, the identification of separable key functions of GABA(A) receptor subtypes suggests that receptor subtype-selective compounds could overcome the limitations of classical benzodiazepines; furthermore, they might be valuable for novel indications such as chronic pain, depression, schizophrenia, cognitive enhancement and stroke.

### Neurotransmitters and sleep [^bb6364f3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Sleep is an active process, not just a default state when there is less incoming sensory information. It can be understood best by considering fluctuating levels of a series of neurotransmitters including the biogenic amines and acetylcholine. The effects of these neurotransmitters are not unique to sleep, but also subserve a wide range of other functions, including affect, sexual behavior, and appetite. The mechanism by which the most common hypnotics work is by binding to the benzodiazepine recognition site of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which mediates action of the most widely distributed inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. It is possible that some endogenous sleep factors indirectly alter the properties of this receptor complex.

Apart from demonstrating β-cell regeneration and glucagon suppression with GABA in two distinct diabetic mouse models, Soltani and colleagues described significant decreases in inflammatory cytokine expression. Functional GABA receptors are present on T-cells and increases expression of splenic T regulatory cells, in turn potentially arresting or slowing T cell mediated beta cell destruction. In vivo, GABA inhibits adoptive transfer of T1D following transplant of diabetogenic splenic T cells into a NOD/SCID mouse model. Individually, GABA and GAD-alum promote survival of transplanted beta cells in the NOD mouse, while combination therapy promoted synergistic and dose dependent beta cell survival. To date, neither GABA alone, nor GABA-GAD in tandem, has been explored as therapeutic agents in study participants with T1D. Here we show, in this human trial of low-dose GABA, alone or as co-therapy GABA/GAD, that while the primary outcome, β-cell function, was not statistically proven, the combination GABA/GAD reduced fasting and meal-stimulated serum glucagon. Glycemic control, proinsulin and diabetes autoantibodies, all secondary outcomes, were similar between GABA/GAD and placebo. Moreover, the safety and tolerability of the treatments was established.

### Neuropsychiatric adverse effects from CFTR modulators deserve a serious research effort [^7c511cc4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), and chloride is so central to its proper function that the GABA-A receptor is commonly categorized as a ligand-gated chloride channel. Upon binding of GABA to its receptor, a synaptic pore opens that allows chloride anions to pass, leading to hyperpolarization or inhibition of the neuron. Just as chloride balance dysfunction is a core mechanism of CF, proper chloride balance is a core mechanism of normal brain function, particularly regulation of anxiety and depression. For example, the antianxiety and antidepressive actions of benzodiazepines are exerted by binding to the GABA-A receptor and modulating GABA-induced chloride current.

Specific emotion regulation brain circuits and structures are particularly reliant upon GABA – and therefore chloride – function. For example, the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is an emotion regulation hub whose function is disrupted in multiple psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety (See Fig. 1). Neuroimaging studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have repeatedly shown that reduced GABA concentration in rACC is associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Loss of GABAergic function disinhibits the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which is thought to be a central mechanism of anxiety and depression. Relatedly, inflammation-related activation of glial cells (the resident immune cells of the central nervous system) causes release of proinflammatory and neuroexcitatory mediators, including glutamate. Therefore, loss of GABA function would interact with inflammatory processes, driving neuropsychiatric consequences.

FIGURE 1
The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is an important structure in emotion regulation neurocircuitry. Several studies have shown that decreased GABA concentration in rACC is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression. ETI drug therapy may affect GABA function via chloride. Furthermore, rACC is dense with serotonin 2A receptors (5HT-2Ar), which are also involved in emotion regulation and directly modulated by ETI.

Furthermore, ETI appears to affect 5-HT2 serotonin receptor subtypes. There is high expression of serotonin 2A receptors (5HT-2AR) in the cingulate cortex. This receptor system is intimately related to GABA function both at the neurotransmitter and receptor level. While this topic demands further study, given the central role of 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in suicidality there may be a compounding effect of ETI on both GABA and serotonin (5-HT) function in vulnerable individuals.

The role of GABA B Rs contributing to human brain health and pathology

GABAergic neurotransmission has long been linked to the onset and development of seizure disorders, albeit the role of ionotropic GABA A Rs displays complex and paradoxical effects on seizure propagation, with many anti-seizure medications targeting these receptors and GABA release. GABA B Rs have received much less attention as potential therapeutic targets for seizures, due to the fact that the agonist baclofen can exacerbate seizures, and antagonists have bidirectional effects. This complexity is likely due to potent GABA B R signalling in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons alike, leading to shifts in excitatory/inhibitory balance that may produce complex circuit effects (reviewed in Kulik, et al.).

GABA B Rs themselves have long been implicated in seizure disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), where expression of receptor subunits has been suggested to be elevated in post-mortem human brain, but with impaired function in neurons recorded from the seizure focus. This is mimicked in rodent models of TLE, where rapid loss of GABA B R subunits was observed in the dorsal hippocampus. Our data does not address whether GABA B Rs are lost following seizures, however, we show that in patients who have received LEV functional GABA B R currents are elevated, irrespective of seizure history. The mechanism by which LEV mediates long-term suppression of seizures is not fully understood. It is known that it directly binds to Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2A (SV2A), which is present in axon terminals of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and may be strongly expressed in basket cell axon terminals. Indeed, administration of LEV leads to increased GABA levels in the brain, which agrees with a central role at GABAergic synapses. The mechanisms by which LEV leads to elevated GABA B R currents remain to be determined. However, this is likely a specific effect, as previous studies of GABA A R signalling in resected human brain tissue did not observe an effect on ionotropic currents. The ability to regulate endogenous GABA B R functional currents represents a unique and promising avenue for the development of future anti-seizure medications, which may lack many of the deleterious side effects of LEV. Intriguingly, we observed that baclofen did not produce more pronounced effects on neuronal oscillations in LEV-only patients. This may reflect a compensation to altered GABA release probability that has yet to be identified, or indeed that the effects of baclofen on post-synaptic membranes are saturating at the concentrations used in our study. The absence of an altered response to 2 μM baclofen indicates that presynaptic GABA B R function may be unaffected in LEV patients. This may indicate that effects on GABA B R signalling are confined to postsynaptic membranes of excitatory neurons, and not inhibitory interneurons, but this requires further investigation.

### Effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid on working memory and attention: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^21999b0d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in the central nervous system. Studies on both animals and humans show that GABA has the pharmacological potential for reducing the impact of cognitive disorders, as well as enhancing cognitive functions and mood. However, its specific effects on human attention and working memory have not yet been extensively studied.

Aims

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover trial, we aimed to test whether the administration of 800mg GABA, dissolved in a drink, acutely affected visual working memory (VWM) maintenance, as well as temporal and spatial attention in healthy adults.

Methods

The participants were 32 young adults (16 females and 16 males). Working memory recall precision, spatial attention and temporal attention were measured by a delayed match-to-sample task, a visual search (VS) task and a speeded rapid serial visual presentation task, respectively. Participants completed two experimental sessions (GABA and Placebo) in randomized and counterbalanced order. In each session, 45min after administration of the drink, they completed all three aforementioned cognitive tasks.

Results

Linear mixed model analysis results showed that GABA increased VS time, compared to the placebo, but did not affect VS accuracy, temporal attention, nor VWM precision.

Conclusions

The results suggest that GABA increases VS time but does not affect temporal attention and memory, and that previously reported effects on cognition might rely on other functions.

### Anxiolytics: past, present, and future agents [^e33d186d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Although anxiety disorders were classified as neurotic disorders and not systematically studied before DSM-III, researchers and clinicians have been searching for effective, safe agents to treat anxiety symptoms and disorders for over a century. In that time, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and many classes of antidepressants have been used as anxiolytics, all with side effect profiles that made them less than optimal treatments for anxiety. The recognition of the role of GABA in anxiety disorders has led researchers to develop anxiolytics that target GABA. The long-sought-after class of anxiolytics that are both effective and safe may be found in the new research being conducted with agents that selectively target GABA receptors and their subtypes.

### The medical management of spasticity [^304f3ac8]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

When spasticity produces a clinical disability by interfering with posture, motor capacity, nursing or daily living activities, medical treatment is recommended. It is mainly indicated when the muscle overactivity is diffusely distributed and should be implemented early, to prevent permanent musculoskeletal deformities or contractures. A pharmacological approach relies on the use of drugs which modulate neurotransmitters acting at the cortico-spinal level (GABA, glycine, glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin). The aim of this treatment is to decrease spinal reflex excitability by reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, or by potentiating the activity of inhibitory inputs. Evaluation of the efficacy of these drugs is determined by the therapeutic objectives which may be biomechanical, or functional. Diazepam increases presynaptic inhibition by stimulating GABA(A) receptors in the brainstem and spinal cord. In double-blind studies of patients with spinal cord lesions, antispastic efficacy has been shown, but side-effects are common. Baclofen stimulates GABA(B) receptors inducing a suppression of excitatory neurotransmitter release. Antispastic efficacy is sufficiently documented, but no definite effects on ambulation or activities of daily living have been proved. Tizanidine has an alpha2-agonist activity (at spinal and supraspinal level) and decreases the presynaptic activity of excitatory interneurones. The main clinical effects are a reduction in tonic stretch, polysynaptic reflexes, and co-contraction, with fewer side-effects but no definite functional change. The efficacy of several other antispastic drugs is documented in a few controlled studies, but the majority of information arises from open trials or anecdotal observations.

In conclusion, our study provides the first account of increased phasic GABA activity in the early weeks following stroke injury and demonstrates that enhancing phasic GABA signalling in the repair phase with an FDA-approved drug promotes post-stroke functional recovery. Taken together our data offer new insights into mechanisms of brain repair and identify a novel therapeutic strategy and pharmacological target for stroke. Furthermore, our observations emphasize the necessity to distinguish the role of phasic and tonic GABA inhibition in stroke recovery as well as in normal brain functions.

GABA receptors

GABA mediates neural inhibition in the brain by activating the 2 major GABA receptors: (1) GABA A, ionotropic ligand-gated ion channels that signal via direct ligand-mediated opening; and (2) GABA B, metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors that act indirectly via intracellular signaling cascades. GABA B receptor-mediated signaling relies on the activation of G protein signaling pathways to inhibit neurotransmitter release and modulate action potential propagation. GABA B receptor expression or activity does not appear to be consistently altered in individuals with depression and has therefore attracted less research interest compared with GABA A receptors in this disease. However, GABA B receptor activation has been reported to increase membrane trafficking of GABA A receptors in dentate gyrus granule cells, resulting in enhanced GABA A receptor current.

GABA A receptors are widely distributed in the brain and play an important role in many brain functions. In addition to GABA, other endogenous ligands include zinc, NASs, and certain amino acids. GABA A receptors are encoded by 19 subunit genes, six α (α1-α6), three β (β1-β3), three γ (γ1-γ3), three ρ (ρ1-ρ3), and one each of the δ, ε, π, and θ subunits. GABA A receptors belong to a large heterogeneous class of pentameric chloride channels comprising 2 α, 2 β, and 1 γ, δ, ρ, θ, or ε subunits, with the α1β2γ2 GABA A receptors being the most abundant. The complex and heterogenous nature of GABA A receptors results in considerable diversity in their physiology, location, and pharmacologic profile. Upon GABA binding and activation of the GABA A receptor, chloride ions flow into the cell, leading to rapid membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron. A subclass of GABA A receptors, termed GABA A -ρ (previously GABA C) receptors, is a group of receptors composed exclusively of ρ subunits, which are typically insensitive to GABA A allosteric modulators (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and most NASs). However, there are some GABA A receptor modulators that can also engage GABA A -ρ receptors, such as pregnanolone, allopregnanolone, and some synthetic NASs.

### Upregulation of CCK3R leading to the suppression of chronic seizures [^6d1d8e5f]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epilepsy, or seizure disorder, is a neurological disease characterized by transient motor, sensory, psychiatric, autonomic, and visual signs and symptoms. It leads to an increased predisposition of the brain to generate seizures and is often accompanied by cognitive and psychosocial decline. The manifestation and recurrence of seizures vary considerably among individuals diagnosed with epilepsy, ranging from momentary attentional deficits to severe convulsive episodes. Although the precise etiology of epilepsy often remains undetermined, various factors, including cerebral trauma, genetic susceptibility, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, may contribute to its emergence. Hyperexcitability and hypersynchronous firing of neurons, caused by an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition (E/I), drive seizure initiation in one or more brain subcortical or cortical circuits. The extent of seizure propagation within a local or remote epileptic network ultimately determines its severity and impact on behavior.

Globally, epilepsy affects approximately 0.5–1% of the human population, and many of these patients are refractory to currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Unrestrained excitability and loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) inhibitory control are prerequisites for seizure initiation and propagation; these provide the basis for developing AEDs that either reduce excitation or increase inhibition. Studies have reported the involvement of GABAergic inhibitory circuits in the formation, propagation, and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including epilepsy. Numerous pharmaceuticals, including benzodiazepines, have been developed or are currently being developed by targeting GABA-related mechanisms for epilepsy treatment. Nevertheless, potential limitations of these direct GABA-targeted drugs result in several unavoidable adverse effects, partially attributable to the extensive distribution and indispensable functions of GABA receptors. Despite the availability of various antiepileptic drugs, 30–40% of patients remain drug-resistant and continue to experience seizures, highlighting a significant unmet medical need. This persistent challenge underscores the urgent necessity for novel therapeutic approaches to address drug-resistant epilepsy. Researchers are actively exploring alternative treatment modalities, including neuromodulation techniques and targeted gene therapies, to improve seizure control. Considering the challenges associated with tolerability, safety, and therapeutic efficacy of several AEDs, current and future epilepsy treatment research is focused on novel therapeutic approaches with new targets.

### Understanding the mechanism of action and clinical effects of neuroactive steroids and GABAergic compounds in major depressive disorder [^0e98c0a4]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are sometimes used to treat specific symptoms that are frequently associated with depression (eg, anxiety and insomnia). However, while a meta-analysis showed that treatment with the benzodiazepine alprazolam led to a higher percentage of individuals with MDD achieving response on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17; ≥ 50% reduction in total score) or Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale (much improved or very much improved) compared with placebo, other benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam did not exhibit clear antidepressant activity. In addition, chronic use of benzodiazepines more than 2–4 weeks is not recommended as it may result in decreased GABAergic and monoaminergic function, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, and interference with neurogenesis. These concerns, in addition to the risk of dependence and abuse and an overall increase in the risk of attempting or completing suicide may further limit the potential use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of depression.

Given that benzodiazepines appear to have questionable antidepressant activity, it is speculated that lack of antidepressant activity may be associated with the subunit composition of the GABA A receptors with which benzodiazepines interact. Benzodiazepines bind at the α-γ subunit interface on synaptic GABA A receptors (primarily augmenting phasic inhibition). Preclinical data suggest that α1 subunit-containing GABA A receptors play a major role in sedation and addiction, positive modulation of α2 subunit-containing receptors may have more consistent antidepressant effects, and activation of α3 subunit-containing receptors have pro-depressant actions. Benzodiazepines show a higher affinity for α1 subunit-containing receptors and concomitantly activate α2- or α3 subunit-containing receptors, the net effect of which is the promotion of sedation and addiction and a null effect on depression. In addition, benzodiazepines may only enhance phasic inhibitory currents through their binding to synaptic (γ subunit-containing) GABA A receptors. GABA A receptor PAMs that bind to both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors and enhance both phasic and tonic inhibitory currents, respectively, may have greater therapeutic utility than benzodiazepines in treating depression.

### Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAreceptor modulators with opposing activities [^6271bf7c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

GABA A receptors, the ionotropic targets of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mainly function to suppress excitability in the central nervous system. Upon GABA binding, the intrinsic ion channel opens, which in most cases enables the influx of chloride to oppose depolarization and inhibit neuronal firing. Several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism, and anxiety disorders, have been associated with GABA A -receptor dysregulation –. The diverse physiological roles of this receptor are related to variable expression of GABA A -receptor subunits, with the most abundant synaptic isoform in adult brain composed of two α1-subunits, two β-subunits and one γ2-subunit.

The GABA A receptor is the principal site of action of benzodiazepines. These drugs act through two distinct groups of binding sites: a primary high-affinity site at the α/γ extracellular interface and three low-affinity binding sites located between subunits (γ/β and β/α) in the transmembrane domain –. Classical benzodiazepines like diazepam are used to treat epilepsy, insomnia, and anxiety disorders. However, administration of these drugs is often accompanied by the development of side effects including sedation, cognitive impairment, addiction, and tolerance, which is in part due to their non-selective modulation of many GABA A -receptor subtypes. Zolpidem, a representative of a new generation of benzodiazepine-site modulators, is the most widely prescribed hypnotic in the United States. It is an imidazopyridine, chemically distinct from benzodiazepines, but exerts similar pharmacological and physiological effects through GABA A receptors. Interestingly, zolpidem shows significantly higher binding affinity and modulatory potency at α1βγ2 receptors, exhibiting high selectivity for α1-containing GABA A receptors. However, direct structural information on zolpidem binding to GABA A receptors that would illuminate how this selectivity is determined is currently absent.

### GABA agonists and gabapentin for spastic hypertonia [^0b1d18a6]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Spasticity is a result of an imbalance between the afferent excitatory and descending inhibitory pathways after central nervous system damage. Its pharmacologic control is believed to result from the antagonism of inhibitory mechanisms (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] or glycine-mediated antagonism of excitatory mechanisms), or both. Because GABA receptor sites are widely present in the central nervous system, it is amenable to pharmacologic manipulation.

Psychotropic drug effects

Primary vs secondary drug effects

Another contributor to lack of translational efficacy of results from animal models is the insensitivity of many animal-behavioural paradigms to "primary" vs "secondary" drug effects. For example, while animal models of anxiety cannot model all of the primary and secondary effects of clinical drugs due to the inherent subjectivity of the human experience, many studies have been conducted to assess basic behavioural impacts of anxiolytics. Typically, in animal models that assess the impacts of anxiolytic drugs, the primary effect would be a decrease in anxiety-related behaviour (more time spent in the middle of the open field or open arms of a maze), while the secondary effect would be anything else the drug does that is not related to relieving anxiety. For the assessment to have clinical validity, the behavioural paradigm needs to be able to differentiate anxiolytic effects from other effects.

In humans, the main (or primary) effect of a drug is defined as the primary therapeutic outcome for which the drug is prescribed, aimed at addressing the condition or symptoms. In contrast, the side (or secondary) effects of a drug are considered the unintended or secondary consequences that arise from its use, which can either be mild or severe. For example, in benzodiazepines, which are frequently prescribed for anxiety disorders, the main effect of the drug is to produce a calming effect to reduce anxiety through enhancing the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, memory impairment, and an increased risk of dependence with long-term use.

How well do common tests of the anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines differentiate between primary and secondary effects? In a recent investigation, Pádua-Reis et al (2021) assessed the impact of diazepam (a drug that was synthesized in 1959 and widely used to treat anxiety) on behaviour in an open field and elevated plus maze. Critically, their analysis was able to differentiate the typical indicators of anxiolysis from a more general sedative effect of diazepam. They found that diazepam decreased entry into the open arms in the elevated plus maze (particularly at higher doses) but that it also decreased the overall time spent moving, a sedative effect. In the open field, they found that diazepam dose-dependently decreased overall movement and entries and time in the center, an overall sedative effect. They concluded that their analyses provided no evidence for an anxiolytic effect of diazepam. Rather, their results could be attributed solely to a sedative effect.

### Variations on an inhibitory theme: phasic and tonic activation of GABA (A) receptors [^63233861]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

The proper functioning of the adult mammalian brain relies on the orchestrated regulation of neural activity by a diverse population of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons. Until recently, our appreciation of GABA-mediated inhibition focused predominantly on the GABA(A) (GABA type A) receptors located at synaptic contacts, which are activated in a transient or 'phasic' manner by GABA that is released from synaptic vesicles. However, there is growing evidence that low concentrations of ambient GABA can persistently activate certain subtypes of GABA(A) receptor, which are often remote from synapses, to generate a 'tonic' conductance. In this review, we consider the distinct roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptor subtypes in the control of neuronal excitability.

### Clinical management of seizures in patients with meningiomas: efficacy of surgical resection for seizure control and patient-tailored postoperative anti-epileptic drug management [^e8238d24]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Several anti-seizure medication may decrease neuronal firing by inhibiting sodium or calcium channels while others may increase inhibition. Phenobarbital, a first-generation ASM, increases GABA levels and GABA activity with the former acting as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase and the latter directly facilitating increased GABA release. Furthermore, it functions as a form of prophylactic or preventative therapy rather than as an abortive therapy for already ongoing seizures. Valproate is another first-generation ASM frequently used and is a first-line long-term treatment for tonic-clonic generalized seizures as well as focal seizures and established status epilepticus. Valproate can be taken orally and is dosed with the goal of remaining within the therapeutic index. To assess if an individual is within the therapeutic index for the drug serum concentration of valproate can be measured using a serum valproic acid test. It is typically ordered at the beginning of treatment with the medication, is not routinely monitored but can be assessed in the case of suspected toxicity. Valproate toxicity often presents with encephalopathy, hepatotoxicity, and electrolyte abnormalities. It also carries the adverse effects of pancreatitis, alopecia, tremor, agranulocytosis, and teratogenicity as well as, inhibiting cytochrome P450 leading to increased serum levels of other drugs such as warfarin. Phenobarbital is a direct agonist of GABA by increasing the length of time that the chloride channels that facilitate GABA release are open. Phenobarbital must be dosed carefully as it has the risk of causing respiratory and cardiac depression, sedation, dependency, and tolerance. Following the initial administration or increases in dosage, the peak serum level of phenobarbital will need to be measured and is done so 2–8 h following intake. Expert judgment should be used when increasing the dose of phenobarbital as tolerance to the drug can display individuals requiring larger doses for the same degree of seizure control. As the maximum dose is approached other pharmacologic methods for seizure prophylaxis may need to be explored. Another first-generation ASM, carbamazepine, is effective as a prophylactic anti-seizure medication. Carbamazepine has two important mechanisms of action that allow it to prevent and dampen seizure activity. It impacts synaptic transmission increasing GABA release and decreasing glutamate release and reducing the high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials that are responsible for seizure activity. Carbamazepine does this by increasing the inactivation of the sodium channels that enable action potentials. Monitoring of serum levels of carbamazepine is obligated for anyone on the medication as the adverse effects of this drug directly correlate with the serum levels. The increase in serum levels will often precede the observation of the drug's adverse effects and can prompt necessary modifications to an individual's drug regimen before severe effects occur. Serum levels should be measured often and at regular intervals such as every 3 weeks following the initiation of the drug and then the interval between serum-drug level measurement can be increased to approximately every 3 months or soon after beginning a medication that induces or inhibits the cytochrome. Adverse effects of carbamazepine that can occur with a serum level elevated above the therapeutic index include rash, agranulocytosis, toxicity, ataxia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, Steven-Johnson syndrome, and teratogenicity. Additionally, carbamazepine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 decreasing the serum concentration of drugs that are metabolized by this cytochrome.

Inherent neurobiochemical properties of these control-relevant cortical areas play key roles in orchestrating the complex and dynamic processes defining cognitive control. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a critical modulator of neuronal activity, primarily by exerting inhibitory effects, especially on interneurons in the striatum and cingulate areas (200;). In healthy adults, GABAergic levels in the striatum and ACC play a key role for fine-tuned response control and motor response inhibition. Conversely, the glutamatergic system drives the excitatory part of neurotransmission, with glutamate receptors influencing synaptic plasticity and transmission, thereby modulating the function of fronto-striatal circuits. Evidence suggests an important role of glutamatergic projections from the ACC and SMA onto striatal neurons for cognitive/response control and inhibition. Glutamatergic inputs from executive cortical networks provide excitatory inputs to SMA neurons, which is crucial for the planning, rapid initiation, and execution of motor responses as well as sensorimotor integration. In healthy adults, glutamate concentrations in the (pre-)SMA and striatum are associated with successful regulation of inhibitory control. Overall, the complex interplay between GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation (particularly within the striatum, SMA, and ACC) dynamically contributes to the complex mechanisms of response control and inhibition, enabling quick movement adjustments in alignment with behavioral goals.

Notably, the sensitivity of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses is affected by other neurotransmitter systems, particularly catecholamines, which are intricately involved in regulating the response inhibition network and cognitive control mechanisms. Theoretical and empirical evidence shows that catecholamine levels follow an inverted U-shaped function with either too low or too high levels being suboptimal for performance. Dopaminergic pathways innervating cortical and striatal structures regulate the delicate catecholamine balance required for optimal cognitive functioning by fine-tuning the sensitivity of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. It is, therefore, of high relevance to investigate the dynamic interplay between baseline amino acid transmitters and catecholamines within the striatum, ACC and SMA, and their predictive influence on cognitive control processes. The results will enhance our understanding of the degree to which GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling in control-relevant cortical networks modulate catecholaminergic effects on behavior.

### Propofol [^ac31d228]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Propofol injectable emulsion is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAAreceptors.

### Preserving the balance: diverse forms of long-term GABAergic synaptic plasticity [^f154e65a]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2019). High credibility.

Cellular mechanisms that regulate the interplay of synaptic excitation and inhibition are thought to be central to the functional stability of healthy neuronal circuits. A growing body of literature demonstrates the capacity for inhibitory GABAergic synapses to exhibit long-term plasticity in response to changes in neuronal activity. Here, we review this expanding field of research, focusing on the diversity of mechanisms that link glutamatergic signalling, postsynaptic action potentials and inhibitory synaptic strength. Several lines of evidence indicate that multiple, parallel forms of plasticity serve to regulate activity at both the input and output domains of individual neurons. Overall, these varied phenomena serve to promote both stability and flexibility over the life of the organism.

### Disinhibition of somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons results in an anxiolytic and antidepressant-like brain state [^dd155a8d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly disabling and phenotypically heterogeneous psychiatric syndrome that affects up to 17% of the worldwide population at least once in their lives. The biology underlying depressive brain states remains poorly understood. However, studies of patients and animal models increasingly suggest a key role for functional imbalances between the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their respective receptors. Evidence from analyses of depressed patients includes reduced expression of plasma membrane glutamate transporters, and elevated brain concentrations of glutamate. Conversely, MDD is also associated with reduced concentrations of GABA, reduced expression of GABA type A receptors (GABA A Rs), reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase, and impaired function of certain subtypes of GABAergic interneurons. Glutamic acid decarboxylase functions as a key enzyme in the synthesis of GABA from glutamate; its reduced expression therefore could account for both the reduced concentrations of GABA and elevated glutamate. Such neurochemically based excitation–inhibition (E:I) imbalances may directly cause MDD, or they may increase the vulnerability to environmental factors that precipitate depressive episodes, such as uncontrollable stress.

### Understanding the mechanism of action and clinical effects of neuroactive steroids and GABAergic compounds in major depressive disorder [^d83845cc]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is thought to result from impaired connectivity between key brain networks. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, working primarily via GABA A receptors, with an important role in virtually all physiologic functions in the brain. Some neuroactive steroids (NASs) are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABA A receptors and potentiate phasic and tonic inhibitory responses via activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors, respectively. This review first discusses preclinical and clinical data that support the association of depression with diverse defects in the GABAergic system of neurotransmission. Decreased levels of GABA and NASs have been observed in adults with depression compared with healthy controls, while treatment with antidepressants normalized the altered levels of GABA and NASs. Second, as there has been intense interest in treatment approaches for depression that target dysregulated GABAergic neurotransmission, we discuss NASs approved or currently in clinical development for the treatment of depression. Brexanolone, an intravenous NAS and a GABA A receptor PAM, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in patients 15 years and older. Other NASs include zuranolone, an investigational oral GABA A receptor PAM, and PH10, which acts on nasal chemosensory receptors; clinical data to date have shown improvement in depressive symptoms with these investigational NASs in adults with MDD or PPD. Finally, the review discusses how NAS GABA A receptor PAMs may potentially address the unmet need for novel and effective treatments with rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in patients with MDD.

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^373624f1]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Catatonia is a serious neuropsychiatric condition that has been associated with a wide range of psychiatric, medical, neurologic, and drug-induced conditions. Catatonia has been described as having two subtypes, a stuporous form that includes signs and symptoms of mutism, rigidity, immobility, negativism, posturing, and catalepsy, and an excited form that includes excitement, aggression, and impulsivity. Additionally, a severe and life-threatening form that is associated with autonomic instability and fever is known as malignant catatonia.

Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for catatonia regardless of the underlying causewith high treatment response rates –. Benzodiazepines exert their effects on GABA A receptors, which are classified as ligand-gated ion channels. When GABA binds to its binding site on the GABA A receptor, it increases the frequency of opening of the receptor chloride channel, allowing more chloride to pass through, resulting in an inhibitory effect. The flow of ions through the channel also depends on the concentration gradient of the ions and the membrane potential of the cell. Benzodiazepines are classified as a positive allosteric modulator, as they bind to a separate site on the GABA A receptor and amplify the effect of GABA on the GABA A receptor. The presence of a benzodiazepine at a GABA A receptor increases the frequency of opening of the chloride channel more than when GABA alone is present. Benzodiazepines have no activity on their own, and thus require the presence of GABA at the GABA A receptor to exert their effect. The well-established efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of catatonia implicates GABA hypoactivity in the pathophysiology of catatonia.

### Gabapentin (gaba 300-EZS) [^7e970f4f]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The precise mechanisms by which gabapentin produces its analgesic and antiepileptic actions are unknown.

Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but has no effect on GABA binding, uptake, or degradation. In vitro studies have shown that gabapentin binds with high-affinity to the α2δ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels; however, the relationship of this binding to the therapeutic effects of gabapentin is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

All pharmacological actions following gabapentin administration are due to the activity of the parent compound; gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.

Oral Bioavailability

Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1,200, 2,400, 3,600, and 4,800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. Food has only a slight effect on the rate and extent of absorption of gabapentin (14% increase in AUC and Cmax).

Distribution

Less than 3% of gabapentin circulates bound to plasma protein. The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after 150 mg intravenous administration is 58 ± 6 L (mean ± SD). In patients with epilepsy, steady-state predose (Cmin) concentrations of gabapentin in cerebrospinal fluid were approximately 20% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.

Elimination

Gabapentin is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.

Gabapentin elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours and is unaltered by dose or following multiple dosing. Gabapentin elimination rate constant, plasma clearance, and renal clearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance. In elderly patients, and in patients with impaired renal function, gabapentin plasma clearance is reduced. Gabapentin can be removed from plasma by hemodialysis.

### The effect of dexmedetomidine and clonidine on the inflammatory response in critical illness: a systematic review of animal and human studies [^3413392a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The α2 agonists dexmedetomidine and clonidine are widely used as sedative drugs during critical illness, acting by dose-dependent decrease in activity of noradrenergic neurons in the brain stem via post-synaptic receptor-mediated inhibition. This increases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurone activity, which mediates central sedative effects. Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2 agonist (α2:α1 receptor selectivity ratio 1620:1), is licenced for intensive care unit (ICU) sedation and systematic reviews suggest it decreases duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay compared with propofol and/or benzodiazepines. Effects on delirium are less certain, but recent trials suggest dexmedetomidine can decrease delirium in selected populations, even when used in low doses. Clonidine has substantially lower α2:α1 selectivity (220:1), is unlicensed for ICU sedation, but is also widely used in some countries. Despite this popularity, evidence for clinical effectiveness is very limited and of poor quality.

α2 agonists decrease central sympathetic nerve activity, which might affect inflammation and immune function either directly via cell surface receptors or indirectly by altering sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. Although α2 agonists cause bradycardia, they may paradoxically increase cardiovascular stability in shock. A post hoc trial analysis and prospective clinical trial suggest trends towards improved survival in sepsis when dexmedetomidine is used for sedation but remains unproven and was not observed in the recent large SPICE III randomised trial.

If α2 agonists have effects via mechanisms other than sedation, these could be important for clinical practice. Any anti-inflammatory effects could plausibly explain putative effects on delirium, shock, and other organ dysfunction and might explain why low doses of dexmedetomidine decrease delirium in perioperative patients. Current evidence for anti-inflammatory effects from α2 agonists in critical illness has not previously been summarised. We therefore undertook a systematic review of relevant animal and human studies of critical illness to summarise current evidence.

### Photo-antagonism of the GABAA receptor [^6cd4e6d1]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The precise coordination of our behaviour requires that we have adequate temporal control over neuronal excitation. The responsibility for this control falls largely to γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA A Rs). The timing, extent and cellular location of synaptic inhibition have a critical impact on neural network activity and therefore behaviour. Under normal circumstances, inhibition will be regulated by endogenous factors, post-translational modifications and by plasticity mechanisms. It is therefore unsurprising that dysfunction to GABAergic inhibition is implicated in numerous neurological diseases.

The strength (or macroscopic efficacy) of synaptic inhibition will depend on many factors, not least the number of GABA A Rs clustered at the postsynaptic membrane, and the mean probability of GABA channel opening. Receptor clustering will be affected by numerous signalling pathways, including GABA A R phosphorylation; while channel opening will be a function of the GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft and the activity of allosteric modulators, such as the neurosteroids. Of equal importance for effective synaptic inhibition is the potential for different GABA A R isoforms with their attendant differences in physiological and pharmacological properties, to be targeted to specific domains (inhibitory synapses) in the same cell.

### Dysregulation of REV-ERB α impairs GABAergic function and promotes epileptic seizures in preclinical models [^ce2f760c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy, a serious chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures that affects ~50 million people worldwide. In about one-third of patients, epilepsy is refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and surgical removal of the epileptic foci is suitable only for a portion of them. Although AEDs can reduce or eliminate seizures for the more fortunate patients, these medicines are associated with diverse and troublesome side effects, including weight gain, metabolic acidosis, hepatotoxicity, and movement disorders. Therefore, understanding the molecular events underlying the occurrence of seizures (and epileptogenesis) is necessary and more effective therapeutic agents are desperately needed.

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, functions to maintain inhibitory tone that counterbalances neuronal excitation (seizures may ensue when the balance is perturbed). GABA is formed within GABAergic axon terminals by two sequential reactions catalyzed by GABA α-oxoglutarate transaminase and glutamic acid decarboxylase. It is released into the synaptic cleft and acts on GABA receptors. GABA is rapidly removed by reuptake into presynaptic neurons and glia mediated by Slc6a1 (Gat1) and Slc6a11 (Gat3), respectively. Mounting evidence supports a critical role of GABA in epilepsy and in epileptogenesis. AEDs such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates act to promote the binding of GABA to GABA receptors, therefore, enhancing GABAergic function. Also, tiagabine and vigabatrin are two AEDs that increase synaptic GABA level to inhibit the seizure activity.

Circadian rhythmicity in epileptic seizures has long been recognized in humans and in rodents –. Seizures in rodent models have a tendency to occur more frequently in the light phase than in the dark phase. These diurnal events suggest a potential role of circadian clock in regulation of seizure occurrence. Circadian clock is an autoregulatory feedback loop system consisting of transcriptional activators (e.g. Bmal1 and Clock) and repressors (e.g. Cry, Per, and Rev-erbα). Single deletion of core clock genes (Bmal1 and Clock) in mice has been associated with an increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Altered expression of clock genes is observed in human epileptic tissues. All these support involvement of circadian clock in the development of epilepsy. However, the molecular mechanisms for circadian clock-controlled epilepsy remain poorly explored, and how seizure rhythmicity is generated is unanswered.

### GABA induces a hormonal counter-regulatory response in subjects with long-standing type 1 diabetes [^9568fde8]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a mediator in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral tissues with effects exerted through ionotropic GABA-A and GABA-C, as well as metabotropic GABA-B receptors.GABA is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic acid decarboxylase, a well-known autoantigen in type 1 diabetes (T1D). In the adult brain, GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, while its peripheral effects vary depending on the tissue. Outside the CNS, GABA is found at the highest concentrations in beta-cells and immune cells. Most immune cells express GABA receptor subunits and the metabolic machinery required for GABA metabolism. GABA exerts a predominantly inhibitory effect on immune cells by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines.GABA receptor activation also enhances regulatory T cells, contributing to its immunosuppressive functions. In addition to beta-cells, GABA-A receptors are also expressed in a number of peripheral tissues, including the pituitary, chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and hepatocytes. In experimental studies with rodent and human beta-cells, GABA has been shown to reverse diabetes by stimulating beta-cell regeneration, both through beta-cell proliferation and, although more controversial, transdifferentiation. The combined immune-modulatory and beta-cell effects make GABA a highly interesting candidate for the treatment of T1D. However, in many countries, including those in the European Union, GABA is considered a pharmaceutical drug. In this initial safety and dose escalation study, we have evaluated short-term GABA treatment in subjects with T1D as a first step toward testing the potential of GABA as a beta-cell regenerative treatment.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^fe3d5a9f]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Table 4 — Most commonly used oral medications in spasticity treatment — diazepam dosing, onset, and cautions: In children, the usual dose is 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg of body weight per 24 h in divided every 6 to 8 h; in adults, the recommended oral dose starts with 2 mg twice a day and can be titrated up to 60 mg a day in divided doses. IV onset of action is within 1 to 3 min and oral dosing onset ranges between 15 and 60 min, and diazepam is long lasting with a duration of action of more than 12 h. Reported side effects include somnolence, impaired memory/cognition, respiratory depression with higher doses, physical and psychological dependence, hypotension, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and it is contraindicated for patients with glaucoma, coma, and respiratory disorders. Additional information notes that diazepam is a GABA-A agonist which facilitates postsynaptic effects of GABA resulting in increased presynaptic inhibition, that careful dosing and monitoring is important due to potential for dependence and implications of withdrawal, that it readily crosses the placental barrier and using during pregnancy may result in neonatal withdrawal soon after birth, that elderly patients are at increased risk of accumulation due to decreased renal function and clearing capability, and that in long-term use and abrupt cessation there is potential for hallucinations and epileptic seizures to occur.

### Computational assessment of GABA receptor modulation in PTSD… [^3135231b]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

The investigators propose a computational goal-directed control paradigm as a novel clinical assessment based on the premise that a reduction in dynamic inhibition, regulated by GABA signaling, can serve as a specific, objective phenotypic target in a high arousal PTSD subgroup. This study will leverage: 1) a single dose of a benzodiazepine as an acute GABA receptor modulator for phenotypic target validation rather than treatment purposes; 2) a novel computational control modeling strategy to precisely measure the effect of GABA receptor modulation on dynamic inhibition; 3) functional neuroimaging to assess specific neural mechanisms of GABAergic influence on dynamic inhibition. Benzodiazepines are robust positive GABA receptor modulators which acutely reduce anxious arousal but result in tolerance and side effects when used chronically.

Several novel pharmacotherapies may chronically normalize deficient GABA signaling without the downsides of chronic benzodiazepines. Given heterogeneity in PTSD, precision phenotyping will be critical for assigning these treatments to Veterans most likely to benefit, i.e. to an HA-PTSD group with deficient GABA signaling. The investigators propose that RAMP dynamic inhibition can serve as a specific, objective phenotypic target for positive GABA modulation in HA-PTSD. While preliminary data from the investigators has established a specific relationship between dynamic inhibition and fear, a crucial step prior to clinical use is validation of the relationship between dynamic inhibition and GABA receptor modulation. The investigators propose to test this causal relationship using the benzodiazepine lorazepam as a pharmacologic probe.

The validated phenotypic target can then be used for subgroup assignment and mechanistic outcome-tracking in trials of novel GABAergic agents for HA-PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that the HA-PTSD group will show greater enhancement in dynamic inhibition than other groups with lorazepam compared to placebo. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose a randomized crossover study in which HA-PTSD, LA-PTSD, and HC Veterans receive a single dose of the lorazepam and placebo in separate experimental sessions in which they perform the RAMP paradigm.

### Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAreceptor modulators with opposing activities [^be51c3d7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels abundant in the central nervous system and are prolific drug targets for treating anxiety, sleep disorders and epilepsy. Diverse small molecules exert a spectrum of effects on γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors by acting at the classical benzodiazepine site. They can potentiate the response to GABA, attenuate channel activity, or counteract modulation by other ligands. Structural mechanisms underlying the actions of these drugs are not fully understood. Here we present two high-resolution structures of GABA A receptors in complex with zolpidem, a positive allosteric modulator and heavily prescribed hypnotic, and DMCM, a negative allosteric modulator with convulsant and anxiogenic properties. These two drugs share the extracellular benzodiazepine site at the α/γ subunit interface and two transmembrane sites at β/α interfaces. Structural analyses reveal a basis for the subtype selectivity of zolpidem that underlies its clinical success. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into how DMCM switches from a negative to a positive modulator as a function of binding site occupancy. Together, these findings expand our understanding of how GABA A receptor allosteric modulators acting through a common site can have diverging activities.

### Baclofen [^1f99f7cf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The precise mechanism of action of baclofen is not fully known. Baclofen is capable of inhibiting both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level, possibly by hyperpolarization of afferent terminals, although actions at supraspinal sites may also occur and contribute to its clinical effect. Although baclofen is an analog of the putative inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), there is no conclusive evidence that actions on GABA systems are involved in the production of its clinical effects. In studies with animals baclofen has been shown to have general CNS depressant properties as indicated by the production of sedation with tolerance, somnolence, ataxia, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Baclofen is rapidly and extensively absorbed and eliminated. Absorption may be dose-dependent, being reduced with increasing doses. Baclofen is excreted primarily by the kidney in unchanged form and there is relatively large intersubject variation in absorption and/or elimination.

### GABAreceptor signalling mechanisms revealed by structural pharmacology [^664c668e]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Type-A γ-aminobutyric (GABA A) receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels with a very rich pharmacology. Some of their modulators, including benzodiazepines and general anaesthetics, are among the most successful drugs in clinical use and are common substances of abuse. Without reliable structural data, the mechanistic basis for the pharmacological modulation of GABA A receptors remains largely unknown. Here we report several high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures in which the full-length human α1β3γ2L GABA A receptor in lipid nanodiscs is bound to the channel-blocker picrotoxin, the competitive antagonist bicuculline, the agonist GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), and the classical benzodiazepines alprazolam and diazepam. We describe the binding modes and mechanistic effects of these ligands, the closed and desensitized states of the GABA A receptor gating cycle, and the basis for allosteric coupling between the extracellular, agonist-binding region and the transmembrane, pore-forming region. This work provides a structural framework in which to integrate previous physiology and pharmacology research and a rational basis for the development of GABA A receptor modulators.

### Structural studies of the actions of anesthetic drugs on the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor [^acb0afaf]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor is the major transmitter-gated inhibitory channel in the central nervous system. The receptor is a target for anesthetics, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, and sedatives whose actions facilitate the flow of chloride ions through the channel and enhance the inhibitory tone in the brain. Both the kinetic and structural aspects of the actions of modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor are of great importance to understanding the molecular mechanisms of general anesthesia. In this review, the structural rearrangements that take place in the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor during channel activation and modulation are described, focusing on data obtained using voltage-clamp fluorometry. Voltage-clamp fluorometry entails the binding of an environmentally sensitive fluorophore molecule to a site of interest in the receptor, and measurement of changes in the fluorescence signal resulting from activation- or modulation-elicited structural changes. Detailed investigations can provide a map of structural changes that underlie or accompany the functional effects of modulators.

### Spinal cord stimulation [^454c5564]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation is the most common mode of neuromodulation used in managing chronic low back pain. It is minimally invasive and reversible as opposed to nerve ablation. The basic scientific background of the initial spinal cord stimulation trials was based on the gate control theory of Melzack and Wall. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies that dorsal horn neuronal activity caused by peripheral noxious stimuli could be inhibited by concomitant stimulation of the dorsal columns. Various other mechanisms, which may play a significant role in the mechanism of action of spinal cord stimulation, include the suppressive effect of spinal cord stimulation on tactile allodynia, increased dorsal horn inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), prevention or abolition of peripheral ischemia, and effects on human brain activity. Spinal cord stimulation is indicated in low back pain with radiculopathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, and ischemic heart disease. There is substantial scientific evidence on the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for treatment of low back and lower extremity pain of neuropathic nature. Clinical studies revealed a success rate of from 50% to 70% with spinal cord stimulation, with decreased pain intensity scores, functional improvement and decreased medication usage. This review discusses multiple aspects of spinal cord stimulation, including pathophysiology and mechanism of action, rationale, indications, technique, clinical effectiveness, and controversial aspects.

### Hippocampal GABA enables inhibitory control over unwanted thoughts [^7dbe1545]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Here we test a novel hypothesis about how hippocampal GABA supports this core feature of voluntary control over the contents of awareness. We hypothesized that GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus forms a critical link in a fronto-hippocampal inhibitory control pathway that suppresses unwanted thoughts. Observations from both human neuroimaging and rodent electrophysiology motivate this hypothesis. Human imaging studies indicate that when individuals are given a reminder to an unwanted thought and try to suppress the thought from awareness, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) acts, via polysynaptic pathways, to downregulate hippocampal activity, inducing forgetting of suppressed content –. This provides a systems level model for how thought suppression occurs. Rodent electrophysiology, on the other hand, demonstrates that tonically disinhibiting GABAergic interneuron networks in the hippocampus desynchronizes hippocampal rhythms, reducing overall activity and impairing memory function. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that suppressing retrieval to stop an unwanted thought recruits a fronto-hippocampal inhibitory control pathway that engages this hippocampal GABAergic mechanism. Specifically, prefrontal control signals may tonically increase activity in local hippocampal interneuron networks, inhibiting (and desynchronizing) principal cell activity throughout the hippocampus, impairing retrieval and disrupting memory. If this hypothesis is correct, diminished GABAergic tone local to the hippocampus may mute the inhibitory impact of control signals originating from DLPFC, compromising the ability to suppress unwanted content. This same deficit of GABAergic tone may also cause abnormally elevated hippocampal activity (hippocampal hyperactivity), explaining the recurring association between this feature and intrusive symptomatology.

### GABA, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and neurological disease [^3d74bd1d]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GABA is converted from glutamic acid by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) of which two isoforms exist GAD65 and GAD67. GABA then is broken down, both within the cell and in the synaptic cleft by GABA transaminase to form succinic semialdehyde. In turn, succinic semialdehyde is converted either to succinic acid by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase or into gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) by succinic semialdehyde reductase. Because GABA modulates the majority of inhibition that is ongoing in the brain, perturbations in GABAergic inhibition have the potential to result in seizures. Therefore, the most common disorder in which GABA is targeted as a treatment is epilepsy. However, other disorders such as psychiatric disease, spasticity, and stiff-person syndrome all have been related to disorders of GABAergic function in the brain. This review covers the roles of GABAergic neurotransmission in epilepsy, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, stiff-person syndrome, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In the final section of this review, the GABA metabolite GHB is discussed in terms of its physiological significance and its role in epilepsy, sleep disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, and an inborn error of GABA metabolism, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

The next generation of anxiolytics may be subtype-selective partial agonists at GABA-A receptors. By exploiting new psychopharmacologic principles, such as the targeting of receptor subtypes that have unique subunits and the partial activation of these subtypes with stabilizers, we may eventually have anxiolytics that are rapid acting, but without sedation, amnesia, or dependence.

### New molecular targets for antianxiety interventions [^a42cd5ab]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Recent advances in neuroscience and understanding in the etiology of anxiety have led researchers to new targets for treatments that are proving to be at least as effective as benzodiazepines, which have been the traditional treatment for anxiety for over 40 years. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system has long been targeted in anxiety interventions via benzodiazepines, but better understanding of its role in anxiety disorders has led to the development of partial benzodiazepine-GABA receptor antagonists and agents that target specific subunits of the GABA-A receptor and that manipulate GABA levels. The recognition that antidepressants are effective in anxiety even in nondepressed patients has caused researchers to develop antianxiety agents that affect the serotonin and norepinephrine systems. Other neurotransmitter systems such as corticotropin-releasing factor and substance P appear to be abnormally regulated in patients with anxiety disorders, so antagonists of these neurotransmitters may prove to be beneficial anxiolytics. Meanwhile, antistress and antianxiety effects through neurogenesis may be possible with the use of agents that decrease glutamate neurotransmission, such as metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists. Finally, the stimulation of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which appears to enhance neurogenesis, may also prove to have anxiolytic effects.

### Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke [^4730e384]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed March 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2016, Issue 3, part of the Cochrane Library (accessed March 2016), MEDLINE (from 1949 to March 2016), Embase (from 1980 to March 2016), CINAHL (from 1982 to March 2016), AMED (from 1985 to March 2016), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed March 2016). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias.

Main Results

We included five trials with 3838 participants (3758 analyzed). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. Four trials (N = 2909) measured death and dependency at three months for chlormethiazole versus placebo; pooled results did not find a significant difference (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11). One trial (N = 849) measured this outcome for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; N = 2527) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; N = 2527).

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.

### Dietary modulation of cortical excitation and inhibition [^4cff8060]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

The balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain affects both neural responses and behaviour in humans and animals. Here we investigated whether dietary intervention aimed at increasing levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can influence neural responses to basic sensory stimuli. Using a steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, we found that the neural response to visual patterns was reduced in individuals who consumed a yeast extract product rich in substances associated with the production of GABA (glutamate and B vitamins), but not in a control group who consumed a placebo substance (n = 14 per group). This demonstrates that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain can be influenced by dietary interventions, suggesting possible clinical benefits in conditions (e.g. epilepsy) where inhibition is abnormal.

### A randomized trial of oral gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) or the combination of GABA with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) on pancreatic islet endocrine function in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes [^5ff6fb7b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) is synthesized by glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) in β-cells. Regarding Type 1 diabetes(T1D), animal/islet-cell studies found that GABA promotes insulin secretion, inhibits α-cell glucagon and dampens immune inflammation, while GAD immunization may also preserve β-cells. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral GABA alone, or combination GABA with GAD, on the preservation of residual insulin secretion in recent-onset T1D. Herein we report a single-center, double-blind, one-year, randomized trial in 97 children conducted March 2015 to June 2019(NCT02002130). Using a 2:1 treatment:placebo ratio, interventions included oral GABA twice-daily(n = 41), or oral GABA plus two-doses GAD-alum(n = 25), versus placebo(n = 31). The primary outcome, preservation of fasting/meal-stimulated c-peptide, was not attained. Of the secondary outcomes, the combination GABA/GAD reduced fasting and meal-stimulated serum glucagon, while the safety/tolerability of GABA was confirmed. There were no clinically significant differences in glycemic control or diabetes antibody titers. Given the low GABA dose for this pediatric trial, future investigations using higher-dose or long-acting GABA formulations, either alone or with GAD-alum, could be considered, although GABA alone or in combination with GAD-alum did nor preserve beta-cell function in this trial.

### Understanding the mechanism of action and clinical effects of neuroactive steroids and GABAergic compounds in major depressive disorder [^90874d38]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

While acute stressors can lead to increased levels of NAS GABA A receptor PAMs (ie, allopreg-nanolone and allo-THDOC) in animal models, chronic stress, a major predictor of MDD, was shown to result in altered GABAergic signaling and decreased production of endogenous GABA A receptor PAMs (ie, allopregnanolone) in rodent stress models. Chronic stress-induced reduction in allopregnanolone levels was associated with abnormal behaviors such as aggression, enhanced fear, depressive- or anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis in animal models.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and norfluoxetine can normalize decreased levels of allopregnanolone in the brain while decreasing behavioral abnormalities associated with mood disorders, as demonstrated in socially isolated mice. Studies in individuals with depression also showed that treatment with fluoxetine could increase allopregnanolone levels in the CSF, and these changes were correlated with improvements in depressive symptoms. The important role of NAS GABA A receptor PAMs in depression is further supported by the findings that allopregnanolone administration prevented or normalized depressive- or anxiety-like behaviors in a social isolation rodent model.

GABA A receptor positive allosteric modulators

Most GABA A receptor-targeting drugs (ie, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and NASs) function via allosteric binding to the receptor at sites distinct from the GABA binding sites (Fig. 4). GABA binding sites are located at the α-β subunit interface on both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and NASs bind the GABA A receptor at allosteric sites and increase the GABA A receptor current by increasing chloride conductance. The presence of GABA is necessary for benzodiazepine response. Binding of benzodiazepines to the synaptic GABA A receptor locks the receptor into a conformation for which GABA has much higher affinity, thus increasing the frequency of the chloride channel opening, with minimal effect on the duration of bursts. Barbiturates, on the other hand, bind in the presence of GABA to both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors and increase the duration of chloride channel opening without altering the frequency of bursts. Only at high doses can barbiturates directly stimulate GABA A receptors in the absence of GABA.

### The desensitization pathway of GABAreceptors, one subunit at a time [^2bf0b67a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs) are the main inhibitory synaptic receptors in the forebrain of vertebrates, and are involved in key physiological and pathological processes such as memory, epilepsy, anxiety, and sedation. This is well illustrated by their medical significance, since the most prevalent GABA A Rs are the target of the widely used benzodiazepine class of drugs.

GABA A Rs belong to the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) superfamily, which also comprises the anionic glycine receptor, as well as the excitatory 5HT 3 serotonin receptors and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Upon agonist binding, their transmembrane pore quickly opens to enable the selective flow of permeant ions across the plasma membrane, thereby affecting cell excitability. However, during sustained binding of the agonist, most pLGICs will gradually enter a shut-state refractory to activation, called the desensitized state, thereby preventing excessive activation. The exact roles of desensitization in vivo are still debated, but potentially include the reduction of responses during high-frequency neurotransmitter release, the prolongation of synaptic currents, as well as the modulation of extra-synaptic receptors subjected to tonic activation by low ambient concentrations of neurotransmitters.

### Tonic excitation or inhibition is set by GABA (A) conductance in hippocampal interneurons [^5f991e36]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Inhibition is a physiological process that decreases the probability of a neuron generating an action potential. The two main mechanisms that have been proposed for inhibition are hyperpolarization and shunting. Shunting results from increased membrane conductance, and it reduces the neuron-firing probability. Here we show that ambient GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, can excite adult hippocampal interneurons. In these cells, the GABA A current reversal potential is depolarizing, making baseline tonic GABA A conductance excitatory. Increasing the tonic conductance enhances shunting-mediated inhibition, which eventually overpowers the excitation. Such a biphasic change in interneuron firing leads to corresponding changes in the GABA A -mediated synaptic signalling. The described phenomenon suggests that the excitatory or inhibitory actions of the current are set not only by the reversal potential, but also by the conductance.

### Gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia [^b36abd37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic antipsychotic drug treatment may cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a long-term movement disorder. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist drugs, which have intense sedative properties and may exacerbate psychotic symptoms, have been used to treat TD.

Objectives

1. Primary objectiveThe primary objective was to determine whether using non-benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs for at least six weeks was clinically effective for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced TD in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses.2. Secondary objectivesThe secondary objectives were as follows. To examine whether any improvement occurred with short periods of intervention (less than six weeks) and, if this did occur, whether this effect was maintained at longer periods of follow-up. To examine whether there was a differential effect between the various compounds. To test the hypothesis that GABA agonist drugs are most effective for a younger age group (less than 40 years old).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (last searched April 2017), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials, and, when necessary, contacted authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of non-benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs in people with antipsychotic-induced TD and schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted and analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD). We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 studies that randomised 343 people. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was unclear, mainly due to poor reporting; allocation concealment was not described, generation of the sequence was not explicit, participants and outcome assessors were not clearly blinded. For some studies we were unsure if data were complete, and data were often poorly or selectively reported. Data from six trials showed that there may be a clinically important improvement in TD symptoms after GABA agonist treatment compared with placebo at six to eight weeks follow-up (6 RCTs, n = 258, RR 0.83, CI 0.74 to 0.92; low-quality evidence). Data from five studies showed no difference between GABA agonist treatment and placebo for deterioration of TD symptoms (5 RCTs, n = 136, RR 1.90, CI 0.70 to 5.16; very low-quality evidence). Studies reporting adverse events found a significant effect favouring placebo compared with baclofen, sodium valproate or progabide for dizziness/confusion (3 RCTs, n = 62 RR 4.54, CI 1.14 to 18.11; very low-quality evidence) and sedation/drowsiness (4 RCTS, n = 144, RR 2.29, CI 1.08 to 4.86; very low-quality evidence). Studies reporting on akathisia (RR 1.05, CI 0.32 to 3.49, 2 RCTs, 80 participants), ataxia (RR 3.25, CI 0.36 to 29.73, 2 RCTs, 95 participants), nausea/vomiting (RR 2.61, CI 0.79 to 8.67, 2 RCTs, 64 participants), loss of muscle tone (RR 3.00, CI 0.15 to 59.89, 1 RCT, 10 participants), seizures (RR 3.00, CI 0.24 to 37.67, 1 RCT, 2 participants), hypotension (RR 3.04, CI 0.33 to 28.31, 2 RCTs, 119 participants) found no significant difference between GABA drug and placebo (very low-quality evidence). Evidence on mental state also showed no effect between treatment groups (6 RCTS, n = 121, RR 2.65, CI 0.71 to 9.86; very low-quality evidence) as did data for leaving the study early (around 10% in both groups, 6 RCTS, n = 218, RR 1.47, CI 0.69 to 3.15; very low-quality evidence). No study reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, a group of outcomes selected as being of particular importance to patients.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the evidence of the effects of baclofen, progabide, sodium valproate or tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol (THIP) for people with antipsychotic-induced TD. Evidence is inconclusive and unconvincing. The quality of data available for main outcomes ranges from very low to low. Any possible benefits are likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects associated with their use.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^0921786e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Box 1: Neuroscience of alcohol withdrawal — pathophysiology and therapeutic targets — emphasizes the role of γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA-A) binding, states that during prolonged alcohol use there is an upregulation of N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDA) and a downregulation of GABA-A, and notes that with a high glutaminergic (excitatory) state and a low GABAergic (inhibitory) state the typical signs of alcohol withdrawal include tremor, seizures, nausea and delirium. Therapeutically, benzodiazepines and certain anti-seizure medications with GABAergic activity (carbamazepine and valproic acid) can be used to abate symptoms by reversing the GABA-A deficiency, and adjuncts include alpha2-adrenergic agonists [AA2As] that can decrease the over activity of the excitatory norepinephrine glutamate or one with both mechanisms of action (phenobarbital).

Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of AEDs

Pharmacodynamics

AEDs depress abnormal neuronal firing by various mechanisms of action including altering ion channel activity, enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, or reducing glutamate-mediated excitation. While some AEDs have a single mechanism of action, others have multiple mechanisms of action and, in some, the exact mechanism of action is not yet known (Table 1).

### GABAergic signaling linked to autophagy enhances host protection against intracellular bacterial infections [^1a906c22]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and has been extensively studied in neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia –. In neuronal cells, GABA is produced from glutamic acid by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD67. In turn, GABA is broken down by GABA transaminase to be recycled through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to form glutamic acid. The optimal regulation of GABA-glutamic acid circuits is critical for the physiological function of the central nervous system, and its imbalance may trigger a myriad of symptoms associated with numerous neurological disorders. Therefore, GABAergic medications that correct dysregulated GABAergic neurotransmission are being used to treat epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia, as well as in anesthesia. A growing body of evidence has shown that a variety of peripheral immune cells express functional GABAergic components, including GABA-A ion channels, the GABA-B receptor, GABA transporters, and enzymes involved in GABA synthesis or degradation –. Preclinical studies suggest the potential application of GABA or GABAergic (agonistic) drugs as new therapeutics against autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including type 1 diabetes, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and collagen-induced arthritis. Nonetheless, given the potential role for GABA in the modulation of innate immune responses, it is poorly understood whether and how GABAergic signaling regulates antimicrobial host defenses in the context of bacterial infections.

### Enhanced phasic GABA inhibition during the repair phase of stroke: a novel therapeutic target [^77acb0d8]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Zolpidem binds with high affinity to the α1 subunit and with 10-fold lower affinity to α2 and α3 subunits. Therefore, we cannot rule out the involvement of other GABA A R subunits in promoting recovery after stroke. Indeed, our electrophysiology data suggest that in addition to GABA A Rs containing the α1 subunit, GABA A R's containing other subunits also increase after stroke. α1-containing GABA A Rs have rapid decay kinetics; accordingly if only α1-containing GABA A Rs increased we would expect to see an increase in miniature or spontaneous IPSC amplitude with a decrease in duration. However, we observed an increase in charge with no significant change in amplitude and kinetics. These findings suggest changes in other GABA A R subunits after stroke, in addition to α1, may contribute to the enhanced phasic GABA signalling. Identifying which additional subunits are altered and their potential involvement in functional recovery is an important focus for future studies.

A beneficial role of phasic GABA is in contrast to the detrimental role of tonic GABA signalling in post-stroke recovery and challenges the idea that enhanced GABA function is generally detrimental after stroke. This is not the first account of phasic and tonic inhibition mediating opposing outcomes. In absence epilepsy, agents that enhance tonic inhibition exacerbate seizures, while benzodiazepines that enhance phasic inhibition are effective antiepileptic drugs. Our data offer a fresh perspective on GABA's role in brain repair after stroke. It also raises the intriguing question of why the brain activates two opposing actions in a similar time frame. A balance between promoting and inhibiting plasticity is likely important to prevent maladaptive plasticity, which could induce stroke-related epilepsy, while still driving brain repair. The increase in phasic GABA signalling we observed is predominantly in cortical layer 5, the main source of cortical output, with very little effect seen in layer 2/3, the major source of interhemispheric cortico-cortical connections. Tonic GABA signalling, by contrast, is reported to be significantly altered in layer 2/3. This cortical layer specificity suggests that distinct cortical microcircuits respond differently after stroke. However, the significance of this and the interplay between phasic and tonic GABA in modulating stroke recovery remain to be determined. Moreover, as the GABA A receptors that mediate phasic and tonic inhibition differ in their subunit composition — phasic GABA A Rs contain primarily α1–3,5 subunits whereas tonic GABA A Rs contain primarily α4,6 subunits — it highlights the importance of targeted pharmacological intervention when considering therapeutic strategies for stroke that modulate GABA signalling.

### Gabapentin (Gabarone) [^43031fd8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The precise mechanisms by which gabapentin produces its analgesic and antiepileptic actions are unknown. Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but has no effect on GABA binding, uptake, or degradation. In vitro studies have shown that gabapentin binds with high-affinity to the α2δ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels; however, the relationship of this binding to the therapeutic effects of gabapentin is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

All pharmacological actions following gabapentin administration are due to the activity of the parent compound; gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.

Oral Bioavailability

Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. Food has only a slight effect on the rate and extent of absorption of gabapentin (14% increase in AUC and Cmax).

Distribution

Less than 3% of gabapentin circulates bound to plasma protein. The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after 150 mg intravenous administration is 58 ± 6 L (mean ± SD). In patients with epilepsy, steady-state predose (Cmin) concentrations of gabapentin in cerebrospinal fluid were approximately 20% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.

Elimination

Gabapentin is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.

Gabapentin elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours and is unaltered by dose or following multiple dosing. Gabapentin elimination rate constant, plasma clearance, and renal clearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance. In elderly patients, and in patients with impaired renal function, gabapentin plasma clearance is reduced. Gabapentin can be removed from plasma by hemodialysis.

### Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAreceptor modulators with opposing activities [^9522746c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Functionally diverse ligands interact with the benzodiazepine site in the extracellular α/γ-subunit interface of the GABA A receptor (Fig. 1a). Classical benzodiazepines and zolpidem are positive allosteric modulators (PAM) that enhance the response to GABA. Flumazenil can have variable activity but is mainly considered a silent allosteric modulator, with limited direct effects on GABA-induced currents, and antagonizes the action of benzodiazepine PAMs. Several β-carbolines such as methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) are negative allosteric modulators (NAM) that can decrease GABA A -receptor activity, particularly at low concentrations. Conversely, at high concentrations DMCM can act as a positive modulator, especially in the presence of flumazenil, to enhance GABA-elicited currents –. Identification of structural elements that couple the benzodiazepine-site binding to modulation of channel function has begun –. However, the mechanisms by which DMCM binding is transduced to both potentiation and inhibition remain unclear.

Fig. 1
Representative benzodiazepine-site ligands and overall structures of the GABA A receptor-ligand complexes.

Zolpidem is shown as cyan spheres, DMCM as orange spheres, GABA as red spheres.

Here we obtained cryo-EM structures of the α1β2γ2 GABA A receptor in complex with GABA plus either zolpidem or DMCM, enabling visualization of the binding sites and protein interactions of these important ligands (Fig. 1b–e). A combination of structural pharmacology and metadynamics simulations supports a rationale for zolpidem selectivity for the α1βγ2 subtype of GABA A receptors. Furthermore, structural comparisons and all-atom simulations suggest a mechanism for the distinctive bimodal modulation profile of DMCM. This structural and simulation data shed new light on allosteric ligand binding and modulation in the GABA A -receptor family, with applications in channel biophysics and the refinement of benzodiazepine-site therapeutics.

### GABA and glx levels in cortico-subcortical networks predict catecholaminergic effects on response inhibition [^69400771]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

On the neurobiochemical level, the DA system in our healthy adult sample may have been relatively close to the optimal level. Low doses of MPH thus likely induced catecholaminergic increases resulting in optimized motor inhibitory control performance. In line with the inverted U -shaped dose-response effect of MPH on inhibitory control processes, high doses of MPH likely pushed participants' catecholamine levels beyond optimum for the task at hand, leading to comparably worse response inhibition performance.

It was central to our study to investigate the extent to which the observed MPH dose-dependent effects were due to GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling in control-relevant cortical regions. We showed for the first time in a healthy adult sample that striatal GABA+/Glx levels are indicative of MPH-induced catecholaminergic effects on response inhibition. That is, higher striatal GABA+/Glx levels were predictive of low MPH dose-induced optimized response inhibition. Striatal GABA+/Glx ratios reflect the balance between inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) neurotransmission, which is essential for cognitive control and response control processes. MPH treatment is known to increase DA and NE availability and has been shown to modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling in the striatum. The present results suggest the GABA+/Glx ratio as critical marker for optimal striatal functioning under low-dose catecholaminergic stimulation, offering greater sensitivity than GABA+ and Glx levels alone. Therefore, examining neurotransmitter ratios in certain cortical areas may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neurochemical dynamics underlying cognitive control processes than evaluating individual neurotransmitter levels. Our results partially indicate the involvement of the striatal GABAergic system in response selection and inhibition through GABAergic neural transmission. GABA is abundant in striatal structures and plays a crucial role in the functioning of MSNs. Striatal MSNs are assumed to form a winner-takes-all network (WTA;), in which inhibitory interconnections among MSNs inhibit nearby neurons, thereby suppressing competing actions and causing the network to converge on a sole "winner". MPH-induced DA increases likely induce increased GABA release from striatal interneurons (e.g.;). This distinctive WTA may be strengthened by elevated levels of GABA in the striatum, leading to more robust suppression of prepotent responses/alternative action plans. Catecholamines, especially DA, play crucial roles in modulating the strength of connections within the WTA in the striatum. Notably, DA-glutamate interactions are present on/innervate approximately 95% of striatal neurons (particularly MSNs), and heavily modulate each other's function and release. DA modulates glutamatergic neurons in striatal structures and finely tunes their sensitivity to glutamatergic input from the PFC. PFC glutamatergic afferents were shown to play a key role in acute effects of MPH, whereas glutamatergic signaling in the caudate nucleus appeared to be crucial for chronic, but not necessarily for acute effects of MPH. Taken together, our low MPH dose-induced increases in catecholamines may have further facilitated/improved the striatum's role in adjusting response caution, allowing for optimal motor response inhibition performance in high response tendency scenarios.

### Structural insights into opposing actions of neurosteroids on GABAreceptors [^94f44191]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors mediate fast inhibitory signaling in the brain and are targets of numerous drugs and endogenous neurosteroids. A subset of neurosteroids are GABA A receptor positive allosteric modulators; one of these, allopregnanolone, is the only drug approved specifically for treating postpartum depression. There is a consensus emerging from structural, physiological and photolabeling studies as to where positive modulators bind, but how they potentiate GABA activation remains unclear. Other neurosteroids are negative modulators of GABA A receptors, but their binding sites remain debated. Here we present structures of a synaptic GABA A receptor bound to allopregnanolone and two inhibitory sulfated neurosteroids. Allopregnanolone binds at the receptor-bilayer interface, in the consensus potentiator site. In contrast, inhibitory neurosteroids bind in the pore. MD simulations and electrophysiology support a mechanism by which allopregnanolone potentiates channel activity and suggest the dominant mechanism for sulfated neurosteroid inhibition is through pore block.

### GABAergic modulation of performance in response inhibition and interference control tasks [^738b15e8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibitory control is a crucial executive function with high relevance to mental and physical well-being. However, there are still unanswered questions regarding its neural mechanisms, including the role of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Aims

This study examined the effects of lorazepam (0.5mg and 1mg), a positive allosteric modulator at the GABA A receptor, on response inhibition and interference control. We also explored the heterogeneity of inhibitory control and calculated delta plots to explore whether lorazepam affects the gradual build-up of inhibition and activation over time.

Methods

N = 50 healthy participants performed antisaccade, Eriksen flanker and Simon tasks in a within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized design.

Results

Lorazepam increased reaction time (RT) and error rates dose dependently in all tasks (p ≤ 0.005). In the antisaccade and Simon tasks, lorazepam increased congruency effects for error rate (p ≤ 0.029) but not RT (p ⩾0.587). In the Eriksen flanker task, both congruency effects were increased by the drug (p ≤ 0.031). Delta plots did not reflect drug-induced changes in inhibition and activation over time. Delta plots for RT in the Simon task were negative-going, as expected, whereas those for the antisaccade and flanker tasks were positive-going.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence for GABAergic involvement in performance on response inhibition and interference control tasks. Furthermore, our findings highlight the diversity of the broader construct of inhibitory control while also pointing out similarities between different inhibitory control tasks. In contrast to RT and error rates, the cognitive processes indexed by delta plots may not be sensitive to GABAergic modulation.

### Differential assembly diversifies GABAreceptor structures and signalling [^ae8748be]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA A Rs) are pentameric ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory signalling in neural circuits 1,2 and can be modulated by essential medicines including general anaesthetics and benzodiazepines 3. Human GABA A R subunits are encoded by 19 paralogous genes that can, in theory, give rise to 495,235 receptor types. However, the principles that govern the formation of pentamers, the permutational landscape of receptors that may emerge from a subunit set and the effect that this has on GABAergic signalling remain largely unknown. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structures of extrasynaptic GABA A Rs assembled from α4, β3 and δ subunits, and their counterparts incorporating γ2 instead of δ subunits. In each case, we identified two receptor subtypes with distinct stoichiometries and arrangements, all four differing from those previously observed for synaptic, α1-containing receptors 4–7. This, in turn, affects receptor responses to physiological and synthetic modulators by creating or eliminating ligand-binding sites at subunit interfaces. We provide structural and functional evidence that selected GABA A R arrangements can act as coincidence detectors, simultaneously responding to two neurotransmitters: GABA and histamine. Using assembly simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing data 8,9, we calculated the upper bounds for receptor diversity in recombinant systems and in vivo. We propose that differential assembly is a pervasive mechanism for regulating the physiology and pharmacology of GABA A Rs.

### GABAB receptor isoforms caught in action at the scene [^fd79ac0e]. Neuron (2006). Low credibility.

The metabotropic GABAB receptors mediate slow synaptic inhibition and consist of heterodimers of GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunits. The only known molecular diversity of the GABAB receptors arises from the two GABAB1 isoforms, but its functional significance has been unclear. Two studies in this issue of Neuron now demonstrate that GABAB1a and GABAB1b show strategically distinct subcellular localization and physiological action.

### GABAergic changes in the thalamocortical circuit in Parkinson's disease [^43fb63c1]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

4.3 Is cerebral GABA beneficial for Parkinson's disease?

The negative correlation between GABA and disease severity we report may relate to converging ideas suggesting that GABA acts as a neuroprotective agent in neurodegenerative disorders. This idea was put forward in the GABA‐collapse hypothesis (Błaszczyk, 2016; Hurley, Brandon, Gentleman, & Dexter, 2013), which proposes that GABAergic input protects neurons from calcium‐based neurotoxicity. This notably affects dopamine neurons, because of high energy requirements and dependence on regular slow calcium‐based pacemaker activity (Hurley et al. 2013). Evidence for the contribution of calcium‐based neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease comes from postmortem studies showing a brain‐wide imbalance of calcium channels (Hurley et al. 2013). In rats, GABA‐producing transplants increases survival rates of implanted dopaminergic neurons (Winkler, Bentlage, Nikkhah, Samii, & Björklund, 1999). In multiple human intervention studies in late stage Parkinson's disease, upregulating the GABA‐producing glutamic acid decarboxylase protein with gene therapy improved motor symptoms (LeWitt et al. 2011), and less invasive alternatives in the form of GABA receptor modulators, such as benzodiazepines or Zolpidem, have also been reported to help normalize Parkinson's disease related symptoms (Hall et al. 2014; Pourcher, Bonnet, Kefalos, Dubois, & Agid, 1989) — although opinions differ with respect to the use of these drugs (Lavoisy & Marsac, 1997). Outside of the motor system, a study by Firbank et al. showed that visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease were associated with reduced GABA in the visual cortex, while GABA levels of nonaffected patients showed no difference from control subjects (Firbank et al. 2018). The role of GABA in neurodegeneration is likely not specific to Parkinson's disease, given the role of altered GABA levels in other neurodegenerative diseases such as dystonia (Levy & Hallett, 2002; Marjańska et al. 2013). Taken together, this study provides evidence for an inverse association between motor cortex inhibition (GABA) and disease severity in Parkinson's disease, which may be related to a protective role of GABAergic inhibition. Intervention studies are necessary to test whether a potentiation of GABAergic mechanisms worsens or improves Parkinson's disease symptoms, to establish whether GABA plays a compensatory or pathophysiological role in Parkinson's disease.

### Independent actions on fear circuits may lead to therapeutic synergy for anxiety when combining serotonergic and GABAergic agents [^4fca2054]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Issue

Both serotonin and GABA powerfully regulate the neuroanatomical circuit that mediates fear in anxiety disorders. This suggests that use of pharmacotherapies acting on both systems may provide synergistic therapeutic actions.

### Effect of gabapentin on GABA concentration and emotional… [^2c0a0b51]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

At three separate clinic visits, participants are given either gabapentin or a placebo. They take placebo at one visit, 600 mg of gabapentin at another visit, and 1200 mg of gabapentin at another visit. One hour after taking the capsules, the amount of GABA in the brain is measured by MRS. Gamma-aminobutyric acid is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the forebrain structures, and the GABAergic system has been found to have roles in attentional and learning processes, recognition of aversive stimuli, and regulation of emotion and behavior. Decreases in GABA have been associated with seizures, anxiety and mood disorders. Enhancement of GABA may result in anticonvulsive, anxiolytic, and mood-stabilizing effects. The GABA system has been proposed as a target for novel antidepressant and mood-stabilizing treatments. Recent studies suggest a GABAergic dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders.

Specifically, reduced GABA levels have been found in the occipital cortex of patients with major depression and panic disorder; and after therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an increase in occipital GABA concentrations has been observed in depressed patients and healthy volunteers. Gabapentin is a relatively novel drug that has been approved for the treatment of epilepsy. The effects of GBP on brain amino acid neurotransmitters are not completely understood. GBP significantly increases brain GABA levels in humans after one hour of the first oral dose, although it does not seem to directly affect GABA-specific enzymes, GABA receptors, and GABA uptake. In vitro, GBP stimulates the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase that is involved in the synthesis of GABA. To date, studies that have examined the mechanism of action of GABA enhancing compounds using magnetic resonance spectroscopy measured GABA exclusively in the occipital cortex due to technical limitations.

Not surprisingly, associations between occipital GABA levels and cognitive measures and psychiatric symptom severity have not been found. Given the potential role of GABA in the physiologic stress response, this protocol includes a pilot study that compares prefrontal GABA levels between shock/threat-of-shock and no-threat conditions in healthy volunteers. This part of the study may contribute to the elucidation of the role of the prefrontal GABAergic system in the processing of acute stress.

### Effects of antecedent GABAA activation with alprazolam on counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia in healthy humans [^14781a83]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia continues to be the major limiting factor to good glycemic control in patients with diabetes. During the last two decades, there have been many studies demonstrating that antecedent hypoglycemia can blunt counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia in healthy and type 1 and type 2 diabetic individuals. Despite the clinical importance and many elegant studies addressing this topic, there remain gaps in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms regulating neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses during episodes of repeated hypoglycemia in man.

The three major acute neuroendocrine/ANS counterregulatory defenses against a falling plasma glucose include release of glucagon and epinephrine combined with inhibition of endogenous insulin release. All of these mechanisms either fail (i.e. insulin modulation and glucagon release within ∼5 years of type 1 diabetes duration) or become substantially reduced with disease duration (type 2 diabetes). Furthermore, repeated hypoglycemia has been demonstrated to reduce epinephrine and glucagon responses, which are important defenses against subsequent falling blood glucose levels in both type 1 (epinephrine) and type 2 (epinephrine and glucagon) diabetes.

### Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors are critical targets for sedative-hypnotic drugs [^c87d50bc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype A (GABAA) receptor is widely considered to be an important target for most clinically effective sedative-hypnotic compounds, including general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and gaboxadol or THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol). GABAA receptors are highly expressed in anatomical regions that are implicated in sleep processes, notably the thalamus. Furthermore, concentrations of these drugs that modify behavior in vivo also increase GABA-induced inhibitory conductances in vitro. This review will summarize the functional, regional distribution, and pharmacologic properties of various classes of GABAA receptors. Particular emphasis is placed on subpopulations of GABAA receptors that are expressed in extrasynaptic regions of neurons, as these receptors are exquisitely sensitive to several classes of sedative-hypnotic compounds. Evidence to date suggests that extrasynaptic GABAA receptors can be broadly classified into two groups; those containing the delta subunit and the non-delta subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Finally, the probable contribution of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in the modulation of sleep will be considered.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^c0736824]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — withdrawal tools and related terms include that CIWA‑Ar (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised) is described as reliable, valid, and reproducible in communicative patients once a diagnosis has been made. Several items direct readers to Special Terms on page 16, including complicated alcohol withdrawal, fixed‑dosing, front loading, and inpatient withdrawal management. Clinicians (healthcare providers) is intentionally broad and includes anyone who participates in providing care to patients with substance use disorders across specialty addiction treatment centers or other healthcare settings that provide substance use disorder treatment. GABAergic agents are drugs that affect the neurotransmitter GABA or its receptors, including agonists, antagonists, modulators, reuptake inhibitors and enzymes, with examples such as benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Kindling refers to the relationship between repeated episodes of alcohol withdrawal that become progressively more severe, termed the kindling effect or process.

### Preoperative medication use and postoperative delirium: a systematic review [^763ba5df]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a serious and common complication following major surgery; however, its pathophysiology is not clearly understood. The most important mechanism involves disturbances of the neurotransmitter system; comprising of insufficient acetylcholine activity, increase in dopamine and noradrenaline activities, and either an excess or shortage of serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activities. The acetylcholine hypothesis has been supported by studies showing an increase in the occurrence of delirium in patients with higher level of serum anticholinergic activity.

A specific agent or medication class can induce delirium by affecting the actions of one or more of the above neurotransmitters. Medications with anticholinergic activity include antiparkinsonians (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl), narcotics (meperidine, codeine), first generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine), antispansmodics, antinauseants, histamine (H2)-receptor blockers (ranitidine), psychoactive medicines (tricyclic antidepressants, lithium), and cardiac medications (digoxin). Sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and fluoroquinolone antibiotics can precipitate delirium through their effect on GABA. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics also enhance glutamate activity. Dopaminergic antiparkinsonians and morphine may increase delirium risk by increasing dopaminergic actions.

Studies have shown that the incidence of postoperative delirium ranges from 4.4% in patients undergoing cataract surgery in Israel to 56% among elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery in Sweden. An Australian study reported that postoperative delirium is common even in people without known preoperative risk, affecting 28% of surgical patients admitted to surgical ICU.

A number of risk factors have been identified to independently predict postoperative delirium; these include older age, type of surgical procedure, smoking, alcohol use, comorbidities, medications, and preoperative cognitive and functional status. Many of these factors are not modifiable, however, medications are potentially modifiable and are commonly implicated in delirium; associated with up to 39% of delirium cases in elderly medical and surgical patients. High-risk medication use can occur preoperatively, perioperatively or postoperatively. While some peri and postoperative medication use may not be modifiable or avoidable, such as use of anaesthetics for surgical patients, preoperative medication use is potentially modifiable. The available evidence on the effect of perioperative and postoperative medication use on postoperative delirium has been reviewed.

### Diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and conditioned pain modulation: a shared neurobiology within the descending pain inhibitory system? [^bfa7f52b]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Investigations of cannabinoid function in CPM are similarly scarce as in DNIC. One study assessed CPM after exogenous administration of the cannabinoid nabilone, which had no effect. It would be interesting whether interfering with the endocannabinoid system, eg, via antagonists, affected CPM.

The above-mentioned ubiquitous expression of GABA and glycine receptors in the CNS renders the examination of these neurotransmitters in pharmacological experiments difficult. A few human studies investigated how manipulating GABAergic inhibition affects CPM using nonselective, or subtype-selectivepositive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABA A receptors. Conditioned pain modulation was not influenced by any of these compounds, suggesting that GABAergic neurotransmission is not key to CPM. No clinical data are available on glycine receptors because no glycine receptor modulators have so far been approved for use in humans.

For all neurotransmitters discussed, it needs to be considered that net zero effects on CPM after a systemic manipulation of a given system might reflect the sum of opposite nonzero effects. For example, GABA A receptor PAMs might act simultaneously at DNIC-relevant sites with a GABA-mediated antinociceptive (eg, the spinal dorsal horn) or pronociceptive function (eg, the RVM).

### Gabapentin [^c0275a92]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The precise mechanisms by which gabapentin produces its analgesic and antiepileptic actions are unknown. Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but has no effect on GABA binding, uptake, or degradation. In vitro studies have shown that gabapentin binds with high-affinity to the α2δ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels; however, the relationship of this binding to the therapeutic effects of gabapentin is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

All pharmacological actions following gabapentin administration are due to the activity of the parent compound; gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.

 Oral Bioavailability

Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. Food has only a slight effect on the rate and extent of absorption of gabapentin (14% increase in AUC and Cmax).

 Distribution

Less than 3% of gabapentin circulates bound to plasma protein. The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after 150 mg intravenous administration is 58 ± 6 L (mean ± SD). In patients with epilepsy, steady-state predose (Cmin) concentrations of gabapentin in cerebrospinal fluid were approximately 20% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.

 Elimination

Gabapentin is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans.

Gabapentin elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours and is unaltered by dose or following multiple dosing. Gabapentin elimination rate constant, plasma clearance, and renal clearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance. In elderly patients, and in patients with impaired renal function, gabapentin plasma clearance is reduced. Gabapentin can be removed from plasma by hemodialysis.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^c6dc0ebb]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Lorazepam (Ativan) — An anticonvulsant, antianxiety agent, anxiolytic, and benzodiazepine — acts as a sedative hypnotic with short onset of effects and relatively long half-life; by increasing the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), lorazepam may depress all levels of the central nervous system (CNS), including limbic and reticular formation. Indications include management of seizures, uncontrolled shivering in hypothermia, and management of agitated or violent patients suffering behavioral emergencies. Contraindications include documented hypersensitivity, acute narrow angle glaucoma, severe respiratory depression, and sleep apnea.

### Perisomatic GABA release and thalamocortical integration onto neocortical excitatory cells are regulated by neuromodulators [^b68ef468]. Neuron (2008). Low credibility.

Neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline are powerful regulators of neocortical activity. Although it is well established that cortical inhibition is the target of these modulations, little is known about their effects on GABA release from specific interneuron types. This knowledge is necessary to gain a mechanistic understanding of the actions of neuromodulators because different interneuron classes control specific aspects of excitatory cell function. Here, we report that GABA release from fast-spiking (FS) cells, the most prevalent interneuron subtype in neocortex, is robustly inhibited following activation of muscarinic, serotonin, adenosine, and GABA(B) receptors — an effect that regulates FS cell control of excitatory neuron firing. The potent muscarinic inhibition of GABA release from FS cells suppresses thalamocortical feedforward inhibition. This is supplemented by the muscarinic-mediated depolarization of thalamo-recipient excitatory neurons and the nicotinic enhancement of thalamic input onto these neurons to promote thalamocortical excitation.

### The immediate alteration of cerebellar glx / GABA and cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity in patients with schizophrenia after cerebellar TMS [^f1b37508]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Following cerebellar TMS, the Glx/GABA ratio tended to normalize in patients with schizophrenia. At baseline, SCZ patients exhibited a significantly lower Glx/GABA ratio compared to HCs, suggesting an imbalance between excitatory (Glx) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission in the cerebellum. The imbalance, resulting from elevated GABA levels, may contribute to the pathophysiological CTC hyperconnectivity, as excessive inhibition could distort the normal regulation of neuronal activity and connectivity. After TMS, while GABA levels remained unchanged — possibly reflecting a complex interplay between compensatory mechanisms and the ceiling effects of GABAergic activity in the cerebellum — here was a significant normalization of the Glx/GABA ratio, accompanied by an increase in Glx levels. This change suggests that TMS may have modulated the E/I balance in a way that increased the excitatory neurotransmitters. Many studies have shown that E/I imbalance in the brain is proposed as a potential mechanistic framework underlying SCZ pathophysiology, representing a widespread microcircuit-based alteration implicated across neurodevelopmental disorders. More importantly, in HCs, both GABA and Glx levels increased following iTBS, suggesting that iTBS simultaneously enhances both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. This coordinated increase in both neurotransmitters likely reflects the balanced E/I modulation that is characteristic of healthy brain function, where a dynamic equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory signals is maintained. In contrast, SCZ patients exhibit a ceiling effect in GABA levels, which limits the potential for further increases in inhibitory neurotransmission following iTBS. However, in these patients, Glx levels could still be elevated, leading to a normalization of the Glx/GABA ratio. This suggests that although the inhibitory system in SCZ patients is less responsive to iTBS due to the already elevated GABA levels, the excitatory system can still be modulated. It should be noted that all participants in our study were prescribed antipsychotic medications, which are known to influence neurotransmitter systems, including GABA and glutamate. Although the effects of antipsychotic medications on neurotransmitter levels were therefore likely consistent before and after TMS, and CPZ equivalents were included as covariates in the statistical analysis to account for potential effects of antipsychotic dosage, it is important to consider that benzodiazepines, which act by enhancing GABAergic activity through GABA A receptor modulation, could influence baseline neurotransmitter levels and potentially interact with TMS-induced changes.

### Structure of a human synaptic GABAreceptor [^7990c7de]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is principally mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) and its synaptic target, the type A GABA receptor (GABA A receptor). Dysfunction of this receptor results in neurological disorders and mental illnesses including epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. The GABA A receptor is also a prolific target for therapeutic, illicit and recreational drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anaesthetics and ethanol. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human α1β2γ2 GABA A receptor, the predominant isoform in the adult brain, in complex with GABA and the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, the first-line clinical treatment for benzodiazepine overdose. The receptor architecture reveals unique heteromeric interactions for this important class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. This work provides a template for understanding receptor modulation by GABA and benzodiazepines, and will assist rational approaches to therapeutic targeting of this receptor for neurological disorders and mental illness.
