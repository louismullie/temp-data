## Question

anticoagulation after stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation after ischemic stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the stroke mechanism because cardioembolic versus non-cardioembolic etiology drives antithrombotic choice. Then, I should verify the timing of anticoagulation initiation, especially in atrial fibrillation, and reconcile guideline ranges with emerging randomized data. Next, I will examine what to do when a patient has a stroke while already on a DOAC, including whether to switch agents or adjust dose. After that, I need to check special scenarios like hemorrhagic transformation, intracranial hemorrhage, and arterial dissection. Finally, I will integrate risk stratification tools, shared decision-making, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any outdated assumptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: stroke mechanism dictates antithrombotic therapy, so I need to ensure we classify the event as cardioembolic versus non-cardioembolic before committing to anticoagulation, because antiplatelet therapy is preferred for non-cardioembolic strokes and anticoagulation is indicated for cardioembolic sources such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or left ventricular thrombus [^112kBnsM] [^115b3X9A] [^1165ZssL].

> Now, for cardioembolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation, I should confirm the timing of oral anticoagulation initiation. Historically, guidelines suggested starting between 4 and 14 days after onset to balance ischemic recurrence risk against hemorrhagic transformation, but wait, let me verify whether newer randomized data shift that window earlier [^116iyueR] [^117NqGMJ] [^115cE6fa].

> Hold on, I should verify the latest randomized evidence: the CATALYST individual patient data meta-analysis of four RCTs found that starting a DOAC within 4 days versus 5 or more days reduced the composite of recurrent ischemic stroke, symptomatic ICH, or unclassified stroke at 30 days, driven by fewer ischemic strokes without excess symptomatic ICH, supporting earlier initiation in appropriately selected patients [^117VLExR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the optimal start day might be precisely day 3, but let me reconsider. The phase 2 adaptive trial exploring day-specific initiation within 14 days did not identify a single statistically superior day, yet its Bayesian trajectory favored earlier starts, reinforcing that earlier within the first 1–2 weeks is better than later rather than pinpointing a single "best" day [^1169UHVM] [^113GCsMy].

> I should double-check guideline integration: AHA/ASA 2021 still advises 2–14 days for most ischemic strokes with AF, with earlier initiation reasonable after TIA and delayed initiation beyond 14 days for large infarcts or high hemorrhagic risk. This remains consistent with a risk-tailored approach even as RCTs nudge practice earlier in many patients [^116JH2Bw] [^115cE6fa].

> Next, I will examine agent selection. DOACs are preferred over warfarin for nonvalvular AF because they reduce intracranial hemorrhage and are at least as effective for stroke prevention, so I should confirm that apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban are appropriate choices unless there is mechanical valve or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, in which case warfarin is indicated [^116JH2Bw] [^115wFFni].

> For non-cardioembolic stroke, I need to ensure I do not overuse anticoagulation. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended, with aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor as options, and short-course dual antiplatelet therapy considered for minor stroke or high-risk TIA, after which monotherapy is resumed, while anticoagulation should be avoided unless there is another indication such as venous thromboembolism [^112kBnsM] [^115b3X9A] [^113qLJM2].

> But wait, what if the patient had a stroke while already taking a DOAC? I should verify whether switching to warfarin helps, and the emerging meta-analysis suggests it does not, with higher risks of recurrent ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage after switching to warfarin compared with staying on the same DOAC or switching to another DOAC, so I should avoid reflexively switching to warfarin and instead reassess adherence, dosing, drug interactions, and competing mechanisms before changing therapy [^114tst6X] [^115cv98M].

> I will now examine hemorrhagic transformation. If it is present, I should confirm that early anticoagulation is generally deferred, often beyond 14 days in larger infarcts, to mitigate bleeding risk, and I need to check for hemorrhagic transformation on follow-up imaging before restarting anticoagulation in AF patients [^1164wsPx] [^1174rfZW].

> For patients with a history of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and ongoing AF, I should confirm that evidence is limited and decisions require shared decision-making. Observational data are mixed, and ongoing trials may clarify timing and selection, so I must individualize based on ICH location, etiology, and thrombotic risk while discussing uncertainty with the patient [^114V4LaL] [^1111vBu2].

> Let me consider arterial dissection. For extracranial carotid or vertebral dissection, either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for 3–6 months is reasonable, so I should tailor the choice to bleeding risk, patient preference, and imaging features rather than assuming anticoagulation is mandatory [^116NWb1w].

> I need to ensure I incorporate risk stratification. CHA2DS2-VASc guides thrombotic risk in AF, and HAS-BLED helps identify modifiable bleeding risks, but I should not let a high HAS-BLED alone deter indicated anticoagulation. Instead, I should correct reversible bleeding risks and then proceed when the net clinical benefit is favorable [^114F4Yev] [^1132AuQD].

> Next, I should review special populations. In end-stage kidney disease or dialysis, warfarin or dose-adjusted apixaban may be reasonable, and in very elderly patients, DOACs still offer favorable ICH profiles compared with warfarin, though renal dosing and fall risk must be weighed carefully in shared decision-making [^116JH2Bw] [^115wFFni].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical algorithm: confirm AF or another cardioembolic source, assess infarct size and hemorrhagic transformation risk, start DOAC early, typically around day 2–4 if small-to-moderate infarct without hemorrhage, extend to day 7–14 if large infarct or imaging concerns, and delay beyond 14 days if hemorrhagic transformation is present. After TIA, start immediately if no contraindications, and throughout, avoid heparin bridging which increases bleeding without proven benefit in this setting [^117VLExR] [^116JH2Bw] [^115aCAiv].

> I should double-check that I am not conflating acute treatment with secondary prevention. Urgent anticoagulation for acute ischemic stroke is not recommended to improve outcomes, whereas secondary prevention with appropriately timed oral anticoagulation for AF is beneficial, so I must keep these indications distinct in my plan [^113q7Dtf] [^116xPYgj] [^111vKaDj].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is explicit, especially when evidence is uncertain, such as after ICH or in complex multimorbidity. Discussing trade-offs, aligning with patient values, and documenting the rationale for timing and agent choice are essential steps that also support reassessment as new evidence emerges [^115BNW12] [^1132AuQD].

Anticoagulation after stroke is indicated for **cardioembolic stroke** (especially atrial fibrillation) [^116JH2Bw] and for **mechanical heart valves** [^111CbxDq], but not for non-cardioembolic stroke [^112kBnsM]. For atrial fibrillation, **start DOACs 4–14 days** after stroke, earlier for small infarcts and later for large infarcts or hemorrhagic transformation [^116iyueR] [^115cE6fa]; DOACs are preferred over warfarin [^115wFFni] unless mechanical valves are present [^111CbxDq]. For non-cardioembolic stroke, use antiplatelets, not anticoagulants [^115b3X9A]. After intracerebral hemorrhage, individualize anticoagulation resumption based on stroke and bleeding risk [^114V4LaL]; avoid early anticoagulation after thrombolysis or thrombectomy [^116fQowM].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation after ischemic stroke

Anticoagulation is indicated for **secondary prevention** in specific scenarios:

- **Cardioembolic stroke**: Most commonly due to atrial fibrillation (AF) [^notfound]; anticoagulation significantly reduces recurrence risk [^116JH2Bw].

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Lifelong anticoagulation is required [^notfound].

- **Other cardioembolic sources**: Left ventricular thrombus, certain cardiomyopathies, and other high-risk cardiac conditions [^115wTxmi].

---

## Timing of anticoagulation initiation

The timing of anticoagulation initiation depends on **stroke severity, infarct size, and hemorrhagic risk**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing** |
|-|-|
| Small, non-severe infarct (≤ 1.5 cm) | 2–4 days after stroke onset [^117VLExR] |
| Moderate infarct (1.5–3 cm) | 4–7 days after stroke onset [^notfound] |
| Large infarct (> 3 cm) or NIHSS > 10 | 7–14 days after stroke onset [^notfound] |
| Hemorrhagic transformation on imaging | Delay initiation beyond 14 days [^116JH2Bw] |
| TIA without infarct | Immediate initiation is reasonable [^113GM8Kx] |

---

## Choice of anticoagulant

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin for most patients with **non-valvular AF** because of lower intracranial hemorrhage risk and fewer monitoring requirements [^115wFFni] [^116WyuMX]. Warfarin remains the preferred option for patients with **mechanical heart valves** or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^111CbxDq].

---

## Risks and benefits of anticoagulation

Anticoagulation effectively reduces **recurrent ischemic stroke risk** [^116JH2Bw] but increases **bleeding risk**, particularly intracranial hemorrhage [^111vKaDj]. The balance of risks and benefits must be individualized, considering stroke severity, hemorrhagic transformation, and patient-specific factors [^115cE6fa].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hemorrhagic transformation**: Delay anticoagulation initiation until hemorrhage has resolved and risk of recurrence outweighs bleeding risk [^notfound].

- **Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)**: Anticoagulation resumption should be individualized, balancing stroke and bleeding risks [^1111vBu2] [^115BNW12].

- **Thrombolysis or thrombectomy**: Avoid early anticoagulation within 24 hours post-procedure due to hemorrhagic risk [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** regarding anticoagulation timing and agent selection [^116JH2Bw]. DOACs are preferred for non-valvular AF, and anticoagulation initiation should be delayed in patients with large infarcts or hemorrhagic transformation [^116JH2Bw] [^115cE6fa].

---

Anticoagulation after stroke is indicated for **cardioembolic stroke** and mechanical heart valves, with timing individualized based on stroke severity and hemorrhagic risk [^116JH2Bw]. DOACs are preferred for non-valvular AF, while warfarin is reserved for mechanical valves or mitral stenosis [^115wFFni].

### Net benefit of early anticoagulation for stroke with atrial fibrillation… [^112xBXHW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

This post hoc analysis of 1966 participants from the ELAN randomized trial balancing the benefit in reduction of ischemic outcomes against the risk of bleeding outcomes by weighting events for their different clinical importance estimated a net clinical benefit of approximately 2 weighted events per 100 persons possibly prevented with early treatment with direct oral anticoagulants; however, estimates cannot exclude the possibility of no benefit or small net harm. The 90-day NCB ranged from 2. 16 to
2. 14 weighted events per 100 participants. Conclusions and Relevance This post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial estimated a sizeable NCB of early anticoagulation for patients after atrial fibrillation–associated ischemic stroke.

Although estimates cannot exclude the possibility of no benefit or small net harm, the findings suggest that early treatment may be more favorable. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03148457 After an acute ischemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation, early direct oral anticoagulant initiation may reduce the risk of recurrence but expose patients to a higher risk of bleeding complications — particularly intracranial hemorrhage — compared with delayed treatment initiation. 1 Several observational studies and 3. The Early Versus Late Initiation of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Post–Ischaemic Stroke Patients With Atrial Fibrillation randomized clinical trial adopted no formal hypothesis testing and estimated the 30-day incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, major extracranial bleeding, ICH, or vascular death to be

1. 2% lower with early DOAC initiation.

3 Taken together, in these trials, composite outcomes did not occur in excess and even seemed to be less frequent with early treatment. In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial, we estimated that early DOAC initiation yielded a sizeable NCB by preventing approximately 2 weighted events per 100 persons after atrial fibrillation–associated ischemic stroke. Although estimates could not exclude the possibility of no benefit or small net harm, our findings lend further support to the early treatment approach.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of ischemic stroke, – and oral anticoagulation treatment, preferably non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is highly recommended for stroke prevention. – The optimal time point for initiating anticoagulation after acute ischemic stroke is uncertainbecause the pivotal large-scale studies of NOAC versus warfarin excluded patients with a recent stroke (within 7–30 days). – Because of the sparse evidence, current international guidelines do not provide specific recommendations on the best time point to start anticoagulation in this setting. – The risk of ischemic stroke recurrence seems highest in the days immediately after an ischemic stroke, but hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic lesion or intracerebral hemorrhage could offset the advantages of acute secondary prevention. Several observational studies indicate possible clinical benefit of early initiation of NOAC therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke. Randomized clinical trials on the optimal time point to start NOAC early after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation are highly warranted, yet very limited evidence is available, and the lack of consensus among stroke physicians is therefore not surprising. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early versus delayed initiation of NOAC in patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation.

AHA/ASA secondary stroke prevention guideline — top take-home messages emphasize tailoring strategies to stroke subtype and comprehensive risk reduction. Specific recommendations "depend on the ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack subtype", with dedicated diagnostic workup to define etiology and identify treatment targets. Vascular risk factor control "remains extremely important", including diabetes, smoking cessation, lipids, and "especially hypertension", with "Intensive medical management… usually best" and individualized goals. Lifestyle measures are highlighted: "Lifestyle factors, including healthy diet and physical activity, are important for preventing a second stroke", and "Low-salt and Mediterranean diets are recommended for stroke risk reduction"; patients "should be encouraged to perform physical activity in a supervised and safe manner". Effective behavior change "requires more than just simple advice", and programs using theoretical models, proven techniques, and multidisciplinary support "are needed". Antithrombotic therapy is broadly endorsed: "Antithrombotic therapy, including antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, is recommended for nearly all patients without contraindications", while combination therapy is generally discouraged: "the combination of antiplatelets and anticoagulation is typically not indicated", and "Dual antiplatelet therapy is not recommended long term".

Acute ischemic stroke — low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) versus UFH for prophylaxis: When prophylactic anticoagulation is used, the benefit of prophylactic-dose LMWH over prophylactic-dose UFH is uncertain. There were no significant effects on death or disability for LMWH/heparinoids compared with UFH, and LMWH/heparinoid use was associated with a reduction in DVTs (OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.44–0.70]) at the expense of a greater risk of major extracranial hemorrhages (OR, 3.79 [95% CI, 1.30–11.03]); LMWH can be administered once a day, but higher cost and increased bleeding risk in elderly patients with renal impairment are disadvantages that should be kept in mind.

Consensus statements

The co-occurring and inter-linked nature of CVD requires an integrated care action plan to prevent, identify, treat, and rehabilitate people. This targets the prevention of recurrent stroke, improves patient functional status and symptoms, and manages cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and lifestyle changes

A post-stroke ABC pathway is proposed as a more holistic approach to integrated stroke care and would include three pillars of management:

A: Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy.
B: Better functional and psychological status.
C: Cardiovascular risk factors and Comorbidity optimization (including lifestyle changes).

Appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be targeted to the underlying comorbidity, for example, anticoagulation for patients with AF.

When stroke patients have both AF and vascular disease, anticoagulation monotherapy would suffice.
In high-risk stable atherosclerotic vascular disease patients without AF, combination therapy with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and aspirin provides some benefits on CVD events (including on stroke) even in the absence of associated AF, but at the risk of more major bleeding.
In the absence of AF, antiplatelet drugs are used for secondary stroke prevention for non-cardioembolic stroke with either aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Both the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin and ticagrelor and aspirin have been found to be superior to aspirin alone for 90-day treatment of acute minor strokes and high-risk TIAs. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin has also been utilized for intracranial atherosclerotic ISs.

Better functional and psychological status requires care packages and management pathways to be established and implemented, including tailored rehabilitation and personalized appropriately to the patient's needs, both in hospital, during rehabilitation, and post-discharge. Assessment of PSD, anxiety, and cognitive impairment should be undertaken as part of post-stroke care, with appropriate intervention where required.

Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are common in stroke patients, and all need to be considered and addressed in a holistic manner, with treatment targets as per CVD prevention guidelines.

A considerable burden of previously unknown AF can be detected when long-term monitoring is applied in at-risk patients.

Across the stroke continuum, there is a need for multi-disciplinary collaboration and coordination of care, including the complex treatment of cardiovascular conditions with the overarching goal to improve recovery, prevent recurrence, and enhance survival and quality of life for the patient with stroke.

### Early statin use is associated with improved survival and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and recent ischaemic stroke: a propensity-matched analysis of a global federated health database [^115ShUc4]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of cardioembolic stroke present in up to 25% of all ischaemic strokes, which are often more severe or fatal. The recurrence of ischaemic stroke (IS) is high, up to 35% at 5 years and up to 50% at 10 years. The risk of recurrent stroke in non-anticoagulated patients with AF and history of previous stroke is 2.5 fold higher, compared to anticoagulated patients, with an average rate of 10% yearly. This is particularly important given the multimorbidity burden associated with such patients, necessitating a holistic or integrated care approach to post-stroke management to mitigate clinical cardiovascular outcomes.

Evidence for the beneficial effects of statin therapy in patients with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or at high risk of cardiovascular events is well documented. Moreover, the use of statins for prevention of recurrent strokes in non-AF related and non-cardioembolic IS patients without a history of CHD is well established. – However, many major secondary prevention trials excluded patients with AF or patients who had cardioembolic strokes. In addition, whether the perceived higher risks of haemorrhagic strokes associated with statin use observed in some trials would extend to such patients, or would be influenced by stroke sub-type, is unknown. Thus, there remains a gap in evidence to support the role of early statin use in AF-related stroke. No specific recommendations on the use of statins for secondary prevention in cardioembolic stroke exists in clinical practice guidelines.

On the basis of current clinical evidence, many international stroke guidelines on the secondary prevention of stroke recommend intensive statin therapy for stroke patients with non-cardioembolic strokes or history of atherosclerotic disease, or those at very high-risk. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on management of dyslipidaemia and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on long-term secondary prevention after IS, go even further. As patients with a history of IS are considered at very high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly recurrent IS, such patients should receive intensive lipid lowering therapy.

Nevertheless, knowing whether or not to initiate statins in patients with AF and recent IS would help to clarify a familiar management conundrum. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of early statin therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with AF who have recently experienced an IS using a global federated research network.

Acute ischemic stroke with restricted mobility — prophylactic-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) versus no anticoagulation reduces symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with moderate-quality evidence. Symptomatic DVT shows RR, 0.31 (0.21–0.42), with 33 fewer DVTs per 1,000 (from 28 fewer to 38 fewer). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage shows RR, 1.52 (0.96–2.39), with 3 more bleeding events per 1,000 (from 0 fewer to 7 more). Across outcomes, prophylaxis results in 33 fewer symptomatic DVTs, five fewer pulmonary emboli, and five additional major hemorrhages (three intracranial and two extracranial) per 1,000 treated patients; the overall quality of the evidence is moderate due to imprecision.

The presence of LV thrombus confers increased embolic risk (OR of 5.45), which is substantially reduced with VKA (OR of 0.14). Over 3.3 years, an annualized rate of stroke or systemic embolism of 3.7% versus 0.8% was observed in patients with LV thrombus compared with those without, suggesting risk persists.

Summary

Background

Many international guidelines on the prevention of venous thromboembolism recommend targeting heparin treatment at patients with stroke who have a high risk of venous thrombotic events or a low risk of haemorrhagic events. We sought to identify reliable methods to target anticoagulant treatment and so improve the chance of avoiding death or dependence after stroke.

Methods

We obtained individual patient data from the five largest randomised controlled trials in acute ischaemic stroke that compared heparins (unfractionated heparin, heparinoids, or low-molecular-weight heparin) with aspirin or placebo. We developed and evaluated statistical models for the prediction of thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism) and haemorrhagic events (symptomatic intracranial or significant extracranial) in the first 14 days after stroke. We calculated the absolute risk difference for the outcome "dead or dependent" in patients grouped by quartiles of predicted risk of thrombotic and haemorrhagic events with random effect meta-analysis.

Findings

Patients with ischaemic stroke who were of advanced age, had increased neurological impairment, or had atrial fibrillation had a high risk of both thrombotic and haemorrhagic events after stroke. Additionally, patients with CT-visible evidence of recent cerebral ischaemia were at increased risk of thrombotic events. In evaluation datasets, the area under a receiver operating curve for prediction models for thrombotic events was 0.63 (95% CI 0.59–0.67) and for haemorrhagic events was 0.60 (0.55–0.64). We found no evidence that the net benefit from heparins increased with either increasing risk of thrombotic events or decreasing risk of haemorrhagic events.

Interpretation

There was no evidence that patients with ischaemic stroke who were at higher risk of thrombotic events or lower risk of haemorrhagic events benefited from heparins. We were therefore unable to define a targeted approach to select the patients who would benefit from treatment with early anticoagulant therapy. We recommend that guidelines for routine or selective use of heparin in stroke should be revised.

### Ischaemic stroke in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation [^112ZyDkg]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation substantially reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, recent studies have shown that up to 22%-36% of patients on anticoagulation will suffer an ischaemic stroke (IS). In this narrative review, we provide an overview of risk factors, mechanisms, management of acute IS and strategies for secondary prevention for patients with AF with stroke despite oral anticoagulation. For this paper, we reviewed available literature from important studies (randomised clinical trials, meta-analyses, reviews and case series) on patients with IS despite anticoagulation. We focused on recent studies that examined safety and efficacy of acute stroke treatments and evaluation and management strategies for secondary prevention. The literature review suggests that patients with AF with IS despite anticoagulation are a heterogeneous group with several possible mechanisms, which may include reduced or non-adherence to anticoagulation, competing non-cardioembolic stroke aetiologies or cardioembolic mechanisms separate from AF. The identification of one or more possible mechanisms of stroke despite anticoagulation may allow for a more targeted and individualised approach for secondary prevention. There are limited data to guide management in such patients, and strategies to prevent recurrent strokes include strict risk factor control and therapies targeting the most likely stroke mechanism. In cases where AF is suspected to be the culprit, clinical trials are needed to test the safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion plus anticoagulation versus continued anticoagulation alone.

### Optimal delay time to initiate anticoagulation after AF-associated ischemic stroke… [^1169UHVM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Is there an optimal day within the first 14 days to initiate anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant after atrial fibrillation–associated acute ischemic stroke. Findings In this phase 2, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial, none of the 4 groups met statistical criteria as the optimal day for treatment initiation. Group 1 had no ischemic events and the highest posterior probability of being optimal for treatment initiation. Meaning Although a clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant was not identified, the evidence suggests that initiating a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than later within the first 2 weeks after stroke due to atrial fibrillation. Importance Clinical practice guidelines recommend initiation of anticoagulation within 2 weeks after stroke with atrial fibrillation.

It is unknown whether there is an optimal starting day within the 14-day period that balances the risks of recurrent embolic events against serious hemorrhagic events. Objective To determine if there is an optimal delay time to initiate treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant after atrial fibrillation–related stroke that minimizes the risk of a composite outcome of ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Design, Setting, and Participants. This phase 2, pragmatic, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial was conducted between June 2017 and June 2023 at acute care hospitals in Texas and included patients who had a mild to moderate ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation and were prescribed a direct oral anticoagulant within 2 weeks from stroke onset.

Intervention Within 3 to 4 days after atrial fibrillation–associated ischemic stroke, patients were randomized to a group for treatment start date with a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention. Conclusions and Relevance A clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation was not identified, but the evidence suggests that initiating use of a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than at later times within the first 2 weeks after stroke onset.

### Multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cancer: is there a role for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention? [^1125drbR]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

In closing, the interrelationship between ischaemic stroke and cancer is a complex one. As the life expectancy of the general population increases and the survival rate of patients with cancer improves, the coexistence of stroke and cancer in adult patients will continue to be common. This report seeks to highlight the intricacies of this correlation. It emphasises the relevance of establishing a distinct stroke aetiology on a patient-by-patient basis, especially when active malignancy is present. This, in turn, can have important implications for the prognosis, therapeutic management and prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cancer.

Learning points

Clinicians should remain alert for thromboembolic events (both arterial and venous) in patients with cancer as a possible cause of any clinical deterioration. Even though their risk is significantly increased with advanced cancer, delay in diagnosis is not uncommon and may negatively impact patient morbidity and mortality.
Identifying stroke aetiology in the setting of malignancy can be complex due to the presence of traditional cerebrovascular risk factors in many adult oncology patients, but this is crucial to defining treatment and prevention strategies.
Some studies have associated elevated D-dimer levels with a high risk of early recurrent ischaemic strokes in patients with cancer. Thus, it can be beneficial to consider D-dimer levels for risk stratification of recurrent events as part of the acute inpatient stroke management of certain patients with active cancer.
There are no current recommendations to support any benefit of early anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention after acute stroke in patients with cancer. However, it should be considered if cancer-associated hypercoagulability is likely to be the main stroke aetiology.

### Dilemmas in secondary stroke prevention [^117Qip22]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention encompasses many approaches, including antithrombotic therapy, risk factor management, and a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations are typically based on the results of randomized clinical trials that provide evidence of benefit. However, in some situations, clinicians extrapolate the results of clinical trials into everyday practice, or trials have not provided sufficient information to make treatment decisions. This review will discuss 4 scenarios: dual-antiplatelet therapy, the perils of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulation, indications for statin therapy, and therapeutic considerations for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### Advances and challenges in treatment and prevention of ischemic stroke [^112q8Xpn]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

We review recent advances in the treatment and prevention of acute ischemic stroke, including the current state of endovascular therapy, in light of 5 randomized controlled trials published this past year. Although no benefit of endovascular therapy over intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been demonstrated, endovascular therapy is an appropriate treatment for acute ischemic stroke patients within the t-PA window who are ineligible for IV t-PA but have a large vascular occlusion. These trials reveal promises and current limitations of endovascular therapy, and comparison of reperfusion therapies remains an important area of research. One common theme is the strong association between a faster time to reperfusion, improved outcome, and reduced mortality. Primary and secondary stroke prevention trials emphasize the importance of aggressive management of medical risk factors as part of any preventative strategy. New oral anticoagulants, for example, offer cost-effective risk reduction in patients with atrial fibrillation, and may represent an opportunity for those with cryptogenic stroke. We highlight areas of unmet need and promising research in stroke, including the need to deliver proven therapies to more patients, and the need to recruit patients into clinical trials that better define the role of endovascular and other stroke therapies. Finally, improvement in strategies to recover speech, cognition, and motor function has the potential to benefit far more stroke patients than any acute stroke therapy, and represents the greatest opportunity for research in the coming century.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke: a practical guide [^111JSYkD]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurologists and stroke physicians will be familiar with atrial fibrillation as a major cause of ischaemic stroke, and the role of anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic stroke. However, making decisions about anticoagulation for individual patients remains a difficult area of clinical practice, balancing the serious risk of ischaemic stroke against that of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation management requires interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues in cardiology and haematology. Recent advances, especially the now-widespread availability of direct oral anticoagulants, have brought opportunities to improve stroke care while posing new challenges. This article gives an overview of the contemporary diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation, and the associated evidence base. Where there is uncertainty, we describe our own approach to these areas, while highlighting ongoing research that will likely guide future practice.

Atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack — treatment recommendations include that in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulation (e.g., apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin) is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with AF and stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulation is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent; in patients with stroke or TIA and AF who do not have moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban is recommended in preference to warfarin to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with atrial flutter and stroke or TIA, anticoagulant therapy similar to that in AF is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with AF and stroke or TIA, without moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, who are unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with stroke at high risk of hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of AF, it is reasonable to delay initiation of oral anticoagulation beyond 14 days to reduce the risk of ICH; in patients with TIA in the setting of nonvalvular AF, it is reasonable to initiate anticoagulation immediately after the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with stroke or TIA in the setting of nonvalvular AF who have contraindications for lifelong anticoagulation but can tolerate at least 45 days, it may be reasonable to consider percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage with the Watchman device to reduce the chance of recurrent stroke and bleeding; in patients with stroke at low risk for hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of AF, it may be reasonable to initiate anticoagulation 2 to 14 days after the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; and in patients with AF and stroke or TIA who have end-stage renal disease or are on dialysis, it may be reasonable to use warfarin or apixaban (dose adjusted if indicated) for anticoagulation to reduce the chance of recurrent stroke.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review [^114F4Yev]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity, with a substantial increase in stroke and systemic thromboembolism. Strokes related to AF are associated with higher mortality, greater disability, longer hospital stays, and lower chance of being discharged home than strokes unrelated to AF.

Objective

To provide an overview of current concepts and recent developments in stroke prevention in AF, with suggestions for practical management.

Evidence Review

A comprehensive structured literature search was performed using MEDLINE for studies published through March 11, 2015, that reported on AF and stroke, bleeding risk factors, and stroke prevention.

Findings

The risk of stroke in AF is reduced by anticoagulant therapy. Thromboprophylaxis can be obtained with vitamin K antagonists (VKA, eg, warfarin) or a non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOAC). Major guidelines emphasize the important role of oral anticoagulation (OAC) for effective stroke prevention in AF. Initially, clinicians should identify low-risk AF patients who do not require antithrombotic therapy (ie, CHA2DS2-VASc score, 0 for men; 1 for women). Subsequently, patients with at least 1 stroke risk factor (except when the only risk is being a woman) should be offered OAC. A patient's individual risk of bleeding from antithrombotic therapy should be assessed, and modifiable risk factors for bleeding should be addressed (blood pressure control, discontinuing unnecessary medications such as aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). The international normalized ratio should be tightly controlled for patients receiving VKAs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Stroke prevention is central to the management of AF, irrespective of a rate or rhythm control strategy. Following the initial focus on identifying low-risk patients, all others with 1 or more stroke risk factors should be offered OAC.

### Comparing the guidelines: anticoagulation therapy to optimize stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^117Awxd8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke. According to a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials with warfarin, anticoagulation therapy reduces stroke risk by 62%. However, clinicians must decide whether the benefit of long-term anticoagulation therapy with available agents outweighs the risk of bleeding for individual patients. Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and by the joint American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology task force recommend antithrombotic therapy to protect AF patients from stroke based on risk-stratification algorithms. Risk factors for stroke AF patients include age ≥ 75 years; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism. Patients at high risk for stroke experience greater absolute benefit from anticoagulation therapy than patients at low risk. The guidelines are consistent in recommendations for high-risk patients (warfarin therapy, international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) and low-risk patients (aspirin 325 mg), but differ for intermediate-risk patients with diabetes or heart disease. The guidelines continue to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to incorporate new clinical data, including the CHADS(2) algorithm for determining risk and the results of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial, the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation study, and the Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation II to V trials.

### Antithrombotic treatment for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a European Stroke Organisation guideline [^115wFFni]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and non-valvular atrial fibrillation have a high risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events. The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations on antithrombotic medication for secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular outcomes in these patients. The working group identified questions and outcomes, graded evidence, and developed recommendations according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure for guidelines. The guideline was reviewed and approved by the ESO guideline board and the ESO executive committee. In patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of recurrence over antiplatelets or no antithrombotic treatment. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are preferred over vitamin K antagonists because they have a lower risk of major bleeding and death. Recommendations are weak regarding timing of treatment, (re-)starting oral anticoagulants in patients with previous intracerebral haemorrhage, and treatment in specific patient subgroups of those of older age, with cognitive impairment, renal failure or small vessel disease, because of a lack of strong evidence. In conclusion, for patients with atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are the preferred treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent stroke or thromboembolism. Further research is required to determine the best timing for initiating oral anticoagulants after an acute ischemic stroke, whether or not oral anticoagulants should be (re)started in patients with a history of intracerebral haemorrhage, and the best secondary preventive treatment in specific subgroups.

### Antithrombotic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke: JACC State-of-the-art review [^1165ZssL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a devastating condition with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antithrombotic therapy plays a crucial role in both primary and secondary prevention of stroke events. Single or dual antiplatelet therapy is generally preferred in cases of large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel disease, whereas anticoagulation is recommended in conditions of blood stasis or hypercoagulable states that mostly result in red thrombi. However, the benefit of antithrombotic therapies must be weighed against the increased risk of bleeding, which can pose significant challenges in the pharmacological management of this condition. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the currently available evidence on antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke and outlines an updated therapeutic algorithm to support physicians in tailoring the strategy to the individual patient and the underlying mechanism of stroke.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

### Timing of oral anticoagulants initiation for atrial fibrillation after acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115j52jR]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

There is a longstanding clinical uncertainty regarding the optimal timing of initiating oral anticoagulants (OAC) for non-valvular atrial fibrillation following acute ischemic stroke. Current international recommendations are based on expert opinions, while significant diversity among clinicians is noted in everyday practice.

Methods:

We conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis including all available randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies that investigated early versus later OAC-initiation for atrial fibrillation after acute ischemic stroke. The primary outcome was defined as the composite of ischemic and hemorrhagic events and mortality at follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the components of the composite outcome (ischemic stroke recurrence, intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality). Pooled estimates were calculated with random-effects model.

Results:

Nine studies (two RCTs and seven observational) were included comprising a total of 4946 patients with early OAC-initiation versus 4573 patients with later OAC-initiation following acute ischemic stroke. Early OAC-initiation was associated with reduced risk of the composite outcome (RR = 0.74; 95% CI:0.56–0.98; I² = 46%) and ischemic stroke recurrence (RR = 0.64; 95% CI:0.43–0.95; I² = 60%) compared to late OAC-initiation. Regarding safety outcomes, similar rates of intracranial hemorrhage (RR = 0.98; 95% CI:0.57–1.69; I² = 21%), major bleeding (RR = 0.78; 95% CI:0.40–1.51; I² = 0%), and mortality (RR = 0.94; 95% CI:0.61–1.45; I² = 0%) were observed. There were no subgroup differences, when RCTs and observational studies were separately evaluated.

Conclusions:

Early OAC-initiation in acute ischemic stroke patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation appears to have better efficacy and a similar safety profile compared to later OAC-initiation.

### Ischemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115itAWa]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Oral anticoagulation substantially reduces the risk for ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Nevertheless, patients with AF may still have an ischemic stroke despite taking oral anticoagulants. 1 This is often regarded as a treatment failure, whose mechanisms include incompliance, reduced pharmacological efficacy of the anticoagulant in individual patients, or other factors such as alternative stroke mechanisms (eg, small vessel occlusion). 2 These patients might be at particularly high risk of further ischemic stroke events, but this has not been investigated. Moreover, the optimal prevention strategy to reduce further recurrence risk in such patients is unknown. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are a proven effective alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for oral anticoagulation in patients with AF. 3 Among patients with an ischemic stroke despite anticoagulant therapy, it is unknown whether changing the type of anticoagulant (VKA to DOAC, DOAC to VKA, or switching to an alternative DOAC) reduces the risk of recurrence.

We aimed to answer the following questions in patients with AF and an index acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). First, are patients who have an ischemic stroke or TIA despite taking oral anticoagulants (VKA or DOAC) at increased risk of recurrent acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or other outcome events? Second, after the index event, is changing the type of anticoagulant (VKA or DOAC or type of DOAC) associated with reduced rates of AIS?

### Anticoagulants for acute ischaemic stroke [^113daUCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Most ischaemic strokes are caused by blood clots blocking an artery in the brain. Clot prevention with anticoagulant therapy could have a significant impact on patient survival, disability and stroke recurrence.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of anticoagulant therapy versus control in the early treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched 30 October 2003). For previous updates of this review, we searched the register of the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration, consulted MedStrategy (1995), and contacted relevant drug companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing early anticoagulant therapy (started within two weeks of stroke onset) with control in patients with acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Twenty-two trials involving 23,547 patients were included. The quality of the trials varied considerably. The anticoagulants tested were standard unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, heparinoids, oral anticoagulants, and thrombin inhibitors. Based on nine trials (22,570 patients) there was no evidence that anticoagulant therapy reduced the odds of death from all causes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.12) at the end of follow-up. Similarly, based on six trials (21,966 patients), there was no evidence that anticoagulants reduced the odds of being dead or dependent at the end of follow-up (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04). Although anticoagulant therapy was associated with about 9 fewer recurrent ischaemic strokes per 1000 patients treated (OR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88), it was also associated with a similar sized 9 per 1000 increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (OR = 2.52; 95% CI 1.92 to 3.30). Similarly, anticoagulants avoided about 4 pulmonary emboli per 1000 (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81), but this benefit was offset by an extra 9 major extracranial haemorrhages per 1000 (OR = 2.99; 95% CI 2.24 to 3.99). Sensitivity analyses did not identify a particular type of anticoagulant regimen or patient characteristic associated with net benefit.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Immediate anticoagulant therapy in patients with acute ischaemic stroke is not associated with net short- or long-term benefit. The data from this review do not support the routine use of any type of anticoagulant in acute ischaemic stroke. People treated with anticoagulants had less chance of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following their stroke, but these sorts of blood clots are not very common, and may be prevented in other ways.

### Current strategies for ischemic stroke prevention: role of multimodal combination therapies [^115xuQ5G]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Stroke remains a global leading cause of death and long-term disability, highlighting the need for more effective treatment approaches. The majority of strokes are of ischemic origin, often caused by large- or small-artery atherothrombosis, or cardioembolism. Considering the systemic nature of the atherothrombotic disease process, stroke patients are at increased risk for ischemic events in several vascular territories: cerebral, coronary and peripheral. Due to the limited options for acute stroke therapies, stroke prevention is an important therapeutic approach. In addition to the management of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and smoking through pharmacotherapy or lifestyle adjustments, anticoagulants, surgical and perhaps endovascular approaches are indicated in certain patients. Antiplatelet therapies using various agents are a cornerstone of secondary stroke prevention. To ensure the appropriate continuum of care after hospitalization for ischemic stroke, some interventions for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke should be initiated during the acute hospitalization setting and maintained in the out-patient setting.

### Anticoagulants for acute ischaemic stroke [^111vKaDj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is the third leading cause of early death worldwide. Most ischaemic strokes are caused by a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain. Patient outcomes might be improved if they are offered anticoagulants that reduce their risk of developing new blood clots and do not increase the risk of bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1995, with updates in 2004, 2008, and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of early anticoagulation (within the first 14 days of onset) for people with acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke. Our hypotheses were that, compared with a policy of avoiding their use, early anticoagulation would be associated with:

- reduced risk of death or dependence in activities of daily living a few months after stroke onset;
- reduced risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke;
- increased risk of symptomatic intracranial and extracranial haemorrhage; and
- reduced risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2021); the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 7), in the Cochrane Library (searched 5 August 2021); MEDLINE (2014 to 5 August 2021); and Embase (2014 to 5 August 2021). In addition, we searched ongoing trials registries and reference lists of relevant papers. For previous versions of this review, we searched the register of the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration, consulted MedStrategy (1995), and contacted relevant drug companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing early anticoagulant therapy (started within two weeks of stroke onset) with control in people with acute presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using RoB1 and GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 28 trials involving 24,025 participants. Quality of the trials varied considerably. We considered some studies to be at unclear or high risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition, or reporting bias. Anticoagulants tested were standard unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, heparinoids, oral anticoagulants, and thrombin inhibitors. Over 90% of the evidence is related to effects of anticoagulant therapy initiated within the first 48 hours of onset. No evidence suggests that early anticoagulation reduced the odds of death or dependence at the end of follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 12 RCTs, 22,428 participants; high-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found no evidence suggesting that anticoagulant therapy started within the first 14 days of stroke onset reduced the odds of death from all causes (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.09; 22 RCTs, 22,602 participants; low-certainty evidence) during the treatment period. Although early anticoagulant therapy was associated with fewer recurrent ischaemic strokes (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; 12 RCTs, 21,665 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), it was also associated with an increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.90 to 3.21; 20 RCTs, 23,221 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, early anticoagulation reduced the frequency of symptomatic pulmonary emboli (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81; 14 RCTs, 22,544 participants; high-certainty evidence), but this benefit was offset by an increase in extracranial haemorrhage (OR 2.99, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.99; 18 RCTs, 22,255 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review, four new relevant studies have been published, and conclusions remain consistent. People who have early anticoagulant therapy after acute ischaemic stroke do not demonstrate any net short- or long-term benefit. Treatment with anticoagulants reduced recurrent stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism but increased bleeding risk. Data do not support the routine use of any of the currently available anticoagulants for acute ischaemic stroke.

Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack exist on a continuum of the same disease process. Ischemic stroke is common, and more than 85% of stroke risk is attributed to modifiable risk factors. The initial management of acute stroke is usually performed in the emergency department and hospital settings. Family physicians have a key role in follow-up, ensuring that a complete diagnostic evaluation has been performed, addressing modifiable risk factors, facilitating rehabilitation, and managing chronic sequelae. Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke includes optimization of chronic disease management (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia), nonpharmacologic lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet changes, exercise, substance use counseling), and pharmacologic interventions. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is generally indicated for minor noncardioembolic ischemic strokes and high-risk transient ischemic attacks and should be converted to single antiplatelet therapy after 21 to 90 days. Secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke requires long-term anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants are preferred over warfarin for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Poststroke problems with mobility, balance, cognition, dysphagia, and depression are common. Rehabilitation involves a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach that includes physical therapy, speech therapy, and treatment of chronic pain and poststroke depression.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) antithrombotic treatment — agent selection: For early secondary prevention in patients with noncardioembolic AIS, the selection of an antiplatelet agent should be individualized on the basis of patient risk factor profiles, cost, tolerance, relative known efficacy of the agents, and other clinical characteristics.

Antiplatelet treatment — Administration of aspirin is recommended in patients with AIS within 24 to 48 hours after onset. For those treated with IV alteplase, aspirin administration is generally delayed until 24 hours later but might be considered in the presence of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such treatment is known to cause substantial risk, and supporting trials administered doses between 160 and 300 mg.

### Atrial fibrillation detected before or after stroke: role of anticoagulation [^114wbMyM]. Annals of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

As no data on the causes of stroke were available in our dataset, we can only speculate on the mechanisms that underlie the strong association of pre‐existing anticoagulation with stroke recurrence. Given the higher prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with stroke despite pre‐existing anticoagulation, non‐cardioembolic stroke etiologies, such as large artery atherosclerosis or small vessel disease, might partly explain this association. Insufficient anticoagulation due to non‐adherence or other causes might also play a role, as shown elsewhere. Rather than attributing KAF with an independently high risk of stroke recurrence, our findings stress the importance of focusing on these potentially preventable causes of stroke recurrence as to allow for improved preventive treatments.

Of note, we found no evidence that the risk of ischemic stroke recurrence with KAF as opposed to AFDAS might be modified by the type of anticoagulant used for secondary stroke prevention (DOAC or VKA). While this argues against non‐adherence playing a major role in the risk of stroke recurrence, as non‐adherence might be expected to be less pronounced with DOAC than with VKA, a previous large study on the subsequent management of stroke despite pre‐existing anticoagulation among patients with KAF found DOAC to be associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence than VKA. Regardless of any potential differences in the effectiveness of different anticoagulant types, it seems that the overall benefit of anticoagulation for secondary prevention is not affected by the AF category. Finally, neither AF category nor anticoagulation before stroke were independently associated with death in our study, in line with prior research.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with prior stroke or TIA — anticoagulation guidance specifies that anticoagulation is recommended for patients with AF who are at high risk of stroke (CHADS2 ≥ 2). This includes all patients with AF with a history of stroke or TIA, as a history of stroke or TIA alone accounts for two points on the CHADS2 score. The heightened secondary prevention risk is reflected in a much higher stroke rate in the two secondary prevention trials (8.0% per year) compared with the nine mainly primary prevention trials (2.6% per year).

A: Appropriate antithrombotic therapy

The 'A' criterion ('Appropriate Antithrombotic therapy') in the post-stroke patient refers to the use of oral anticoagulants (OACs), either as a non-vitamin K antagonist OAC (also called a direct OAC or DOAC) or well-managed vitamin K antagonist (VKA, e.g. warfarin) with a time in therapeutic range ≥ 70% when AF is present or a VKA, if a prosthetic mechanical heart valve is present. Where there is associated atherosclerotic vascular disease and no AF or mechanical valve present, the appropriate use of antiplatelet therapy is needed. A balance is needed between preventing recurrent ischaemic or thrombotic events and major bleeding, which is even more challenging if both AF and vascular disease, whether coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery disease, are present. In such patients (ie. AF with stable vascular disease), anticoagulation monotherapy would suffice as thromboprphylaxis, although many physicians would still prescribe combination therapy, despite the paucity of evidence from large randomized trials. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, for example, the pooled prevalence of carotid stenosis in AF patients was 12.4% (95% CI 8.7 to 16.0), ranging from 4.4 to 24.3%. In AF patients with coronary artery disease, appropriate antithrombotic therapy management varies according the clinical scenario.

When the AF patient has 'stable vascular disease', the patient should be managed with OAC monotherapy. In the AFIRE trial, combination therapy with OAC plus antiplatelets was associated with worse thromboembolic and bleeding outcomes in AF patients with stable coronary disease. In AF patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a balance between AF-related stroke prevention which requires OAC and reducing cardiac ischaemia in an ACS presentation which requires antiplatelet therapy needs to be reached; to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis after a percutaneous coronary intervention and the risk of bleeding by the combination of OAC with antiplatelet therapy. In patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis and AF, carotid endarterectomy is commonly considered, or, in those less suitable for surgery, carotid artery stenting may be chosennotwithstanding the need for a short course of combined antithrombotic therapy after stenting. While more data are needed to inform optimal antithrombotic management in this setting, a recent nationwide observational evidence suggested that OAC therapy alone could be a default treatment for most of these patients, combined with a short period single antiplatelet therapy in those at high risk of a recurrent vascular event.

### Collaboration on the optimal timing of anticoagulation after ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and prospective individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (CATALYST) [^117VLExR]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal timing of oral anticoagulation for prevention of early ischaemic stroke recurrence in people with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation remains uncertain. We aimed to estimate the effects of starting a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) early (≤ 4 days) versus later (≥ 5 days) after onset of ischaemic stroke.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched the electronic databases PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase for randomised controlled trials published from inception until March 16, 2025. We included clinical trials if they were pre-registered, randomised, investigated clinical outcomes, and included participants with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation who were assigned to either early or later initiation (≤ 4 days vs ≥ 5 days) of a DOAC in approved doses. The primary outcome was a composite of recurrent ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, or unclassified stroke within 30 days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes included components of the primary composite within 30 days and 90 days. We did a one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis with the use of a generalised linear mixed-effects model, accounting for between-trial differences, to generate treatment effects, which are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024522634.

Findings

We identified four eligible trials: TIMING (NCT02961348), ELAN (NCT03148457), OPTIMAS (NCT03759938), and START (NCT03021928). After excluding participants who opted out of data sharing or were not randomly assigned to DOAC initiation within 4 days or at day 5 or later, we included 5441 participants (mean age 77.7 years [SD 10.0], 2472 [45.4%] women, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 5 [IQR 3–10]) in the individual patient data meta-analysis. We obtained primary outcome data for 5429 participants. The primary outcome occurred in 57 (2.1%) of 2683 participants who started DOAC early versus 83 (3.0%) of 2746 participants who started later (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50–0.98, p = 0.039). Early DOAC reduced the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke (45 [1.7%] of 2683 vs 70 [2.6%] of 2746, OR 0.66, 0.45–0.96, p = 0.029). There was no evidence of an increase in symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage with early DOAC initiation (10 [0.4%] of 2683 vs 10 [0.4%] of 2746, OR 1.02, 0.43–2.46, p = 0.96).

Interpretation

For people with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation, early DOAC initiation (within 4 days) reduced the risk of the composite outcome of recurrent ischaemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, or unclassified stroke within 30 days. These findings support early DOAC initiation in clinical practice.

Post‑alteplase treatment — early antithrombotic therapy: The risk of antithrombotic therapy (other than IV aspirin) within the first 24 hours after treatment with IV alteplase (with or without mechanical thrombectomy) is uncertain, and use might be considered in the presence of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such treatment is known to cause substantial risk. A retrospective analysis found no increased risk of hemorrhage with early initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (< 24 hours) after IV alteplase or EVT compared with initiation > 24 hours, but selection bias was possible and timing should be based on an individual level, balancing risk and benefit.

### Intensive care management of acute ischemic stroke [^111zBHwr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the success of acute reperfusion therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, only a minority of patients receive such treatment. Even patients who receive reperfusion therapy remain at risk for further neuronal death through progressive infarction and secondary injury mechanisms. The goal of neurocritical care for the patient with acute ischemic stroke is to optimize long-term outcomes by minimizing the amount of brain tissue that is lost to these processes. This is accomplished by optimizing brain perfusion, limiting secondary brain injury, and compensating for associated dysfunction in other organ systems. Because of the rapid and irreversible nature of ischemic brain injury, it is crucial for best neurocritical care practices to begin as early as possible. Therefore, this chapter will discuss optimal, pragmatic neurocritical care management of patients with acute ischemic stroke during the "golden" emergency department hours from the perspective of the neurointensivist. Major topics include cerebral perfusion optimization; management of cerebral edema; post-thrombolytic care; acute anticoagulation; treatment of commonly associated cardiac and pulmonary complications; fluid, electrolyte and glucose management; the role of induced normothermia and therapeutic hypothermia; and prophylaxis against common complications.

### Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy alone for management of cryptogenic stroke? A clinical practice guideline [^113qWkxV]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

The recommendations apply to patients under 60 years old with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who have had a cryptogenic ischaemic stroke, when extensive workup for other aetiologies of stroke is negative
For patients who are open to all options, we make a weak recommendation for PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy rather than anticoagulant therapy
For patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated or declined, we make a strong recommendation for PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet therapy alone
For patients in whom closure is contraindicated or declined, we make a weak recommendation for anticoagulant therapy rather than antiplatelet therapy.
Further research may alter the recommendations that involve anticoagulant therapy

Options for the secondary prevention of stroke in patients younger than 60 years who have had a cryptogenic ischaemic stroke thought to be secondary to patent foramen ovale (PFO) include PFO closure (with antiplatelet therapy), antiplatelet therapy alone, or anticoagulants. International guidance and practice differ on which option is preferable.

The BMJ Rapid Recommendations panel used a linked systematic reviewtriggered by three large randomised trials published in September 2017 that suggested PFO closure might reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke more than alternatives. The panel felt that the studies, when considered in the context of the full body of evidence, might change current clinical practice. The linked systematic review finds that PFO closure prevents recurrent stroke relative to antiplatelet therapy, but possibly not relative to anticoagulants, and is associated with procedural complications and persistent atrial fibrillation. The review also presents evidence regarding the role of anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy when PFO closure is not acceptable or is contraindicated.

This expert panel make a

Strong recommendation in favour of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy compared with antiplatelet therapy alone
Weak recommendation in favour of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy compared with anticoagulants
Weak recommendation in favour of anticoagulants compared with antiplatelet therapy.

Timing statements include "Oral anticoagulation should generally be initiated within 1 to 2 weeks after stroke onset" and "We therefore recommend initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy within 2 weeks of a cardioembolic stroke; however, for patients with large infarcts or other risk factors for hemorrhage, additional delays are appropriate", with "Earlier anticoagulation can be considered for patients at low risk of bleeding complications" and "Delaying anticoagulation should be considered for patients at high risk of hemorrhagic complications". For dabigatran, renal safety is specified: "Dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney. It has not been studied and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less)".

### Timing of anticoagulation after recent ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116WyuMX]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Background

About 13–26% of all acute ischaemic strokes are related to non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia globally. Deciding when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation is a longstanding, common, and unresolved clinical challenge. Although the risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke is high in this population, early oral anticoagulation is suspected to increase the risk of potentially harmful intracranial haemorrhage, including haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. This assumption, and current treatment guidelines, are based on historical, mostly observational data from patients with ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation treated with heparins, heparinoids, or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent recurrent ischaemic stroke. Randomised controlled trials have subsequently shown that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; ie, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) are at least as effective as VKAs in primary and secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation-related ischaemic stroke, with around half the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. However, none of these DOAC trials included patients who had experienced ischaemic stroke recently (within the first few weeks). Clinicians therefore remain uncertain regarding when to commence DOAC administration after acute ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Recent Developments

Prospective observational studies and two small randomised trials have investigated the risks and benefits of early DOAC-administration initiation (most with a median delay of 3–5 days) in mild-to-moderate atrial fibrillation-associated ischaemic stroke. These studies reported that early DOAC treatment was associated with a low frequency of clinically symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage or surrogate haemorrhagic lesions on MRI scans, whereas later DOAC-administration initiation (ie, > 7 days or > 14 days after index stroke) was associated with an increased frequency of recurrent ischaemic stroke. WHERE NEXT? Adequately powered randomised controlled trials comparing early to later oral anticoagulation with DOACs in ischaemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation are justified to confirm the acceptable safety and efficacy of this strategy. Four such randomised controlled trials (collectively planned to include around 9000 participants) are underway, either using single cutoff timepoints for early versus late DOAC-administration initiation, or selecting DOAC-administration timing according to the severity and imaging features of the ischaemic stroke. The results of these trials should help to establish the optimal timing to initiate DOAC administration after recent ischaemic stroke and whether the timing should differ according to stroke severity. Results of these trials are expected from 2021.

Optimal antithrombotic management after intracerebral hemorrhage remains one of the central unresolved issues for patients who survive, especially for those patients with atrial fibrillation. Given the observational nature of the studies regarding anticoagulation resumption after intracerebral hemorrhage, there is uncertainty regarding resumption of oral anticoagulation therapy and its timing. There is limited high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice, leading to significant practice variation and uncertainty for patients and providers. Here, we aim to provide the key elements to guide clinicians in their individual decision: whether or not to start or resume anticoagulation in patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Difficult situations in anticoagulation after stroke: between scylla and charybdis [^11689vVc]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A significant proportion of stroke patients is treated with anticoagulants for secondary stroke prevention. Often, in such patients, stroke physicians are required to make difficult clinical decisions when confronted with the dilemma to choose between the risk of thromboembolism and the risk of bleeding. This article focuses on three common anticoagulant-related situations, where the stroke physician needs to find the delicate balance between the two risks.

Recent Findings

Three typical case vignettes are presented and the associated dilemmas are discussed: a patient with an anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: would you restart anticoagulation?, an anticoagulated patient with a previous stroke because of atrial fibrillation is scheduled for an elective polyp removal: how would you handle anticoagulation perioperatively?, and a patient presents with an ischemic stroke because of atrial fibrillation: how soon would you start anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention? The article summarizes the related literature and discusses the pros and cons of each choice.

Summary

The available evidence is limited; we need to individualize our approach according to the specific characteristics of our patients, and share the decision process with our patients and their proxies, taking strongly into consideration their values and preferences.

### Multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cancer: is there a role for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention? [^111T3ton]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with cancer have a substantial risk of ischaemic strokes, increasing their morbidity and mortality by more than twofold. This is a commonly recognised but poorly studied clinical situation, which represents a significant management challenge and brings together several medical fields. Ischaemic stroke is the second most common brain lesion in patients with cancer and, after an initial ischaemic stroke, accounts for 31% of all recurrent thromboembolic incidents in these patients. The pathophysiology of cancer-associated ischaemic stroke has been described, but the specific mechanisms linked to distinct patient and disease characteristics are not well known. There are no current diagnostic or therapeutic guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cancer-associated strokes. Initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention in such circumstance remains controversial and clinical management of these patients is challenging. We describe a case of multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. We present this case to emphasise the need for more studies that could shed light on the risk stratification and appropriate management of recurrent strokes in patients with a history of remote or current cancer. We also want to highlight the lack of current guidelines for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention in cancer-associated strokes.

### Anticoagulation strategies following breakthrough ischemic stroke while on direct anticoagulants: a meta-analysis [^114tst6X]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The management of anticoagulation after ischemic stroke while on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is controversial. We performed an aggregate-data meta-analysis to compare anticoagulation strategies against each other to define the effect of switch to warfarin, switch to another DOAC, change in dosage, and add-on antiplatelet for the prevention of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), any stroke, and mortality.

Methods

The study protocol was deposited with PROSPERO (CRD42025639057). We systematically searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library-all studies reporting on anticoagulation strategies after a stroke while on DOAC up to January 31, 2025. We included randomized controlled clinical studies and cohort studies with sample size ≥ 50 that (1) enrolled adult patients who experienced ischemic stroke while on DOACs, (2) assessed modifications to anticoagulation therapy, and (3) reported on at least one of the outcomes. Main outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke; secondary outcomes were ICH, all-cause mortality, and any stroke. We pooled estimates by random-effects modelling, reporting risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs comparing anticoagulation strategies against each other.

Results

We retrieved 2,171 results, with 8 observational studies reaching quantitative synthesis (n = 14,307 patients, mean age = 75 years, 48% female). Switching to warfarin was associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke compared with keeping the same DOAC (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42–2.29, I² = 0%, n studies = 5) or changing DOAC dosage (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.20–2.45, I² = 0%, n studies = 4). Switching to warfarin was also associated with higher ICH rates compared with keeping the same DOAC (RR 2.90, 95% CI 2.01–4.18, I² = 0%, n studies = 5) and DOAC-to-DOAC switch (RR 3.25, 95% CI 2.13–4.96, I² = 0%; n studies = 5). Keeping the same DOAC and switching to another DOAC, independently from mechanism, had similar rates of primary and secondary outcomes.

Discussion

Our meta-analysis indicates that switching to warfarin after a stroke while on DOAC seems less effective and safe in stroke recurrence prevention, ICH, and mortality compared with DOAC-based strategies.

### Anticoagulants for preventing recurrence following presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^116B8cqs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

After a first ischaemic stroke, further vascular events due to thromboembolism (especially myocardial infarction and recurrent stroke) are common and often fatal. Anticoagulants could potentially reduce the risk of such events, but any benefits could be offset by an increased risk of fatal or disabling haemorrhages.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of prolonged anticoagulant therapy (compared with placebo or open control) following presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register. We contacted companies marketing anticoagulant agents. The most recent search for this review was carried out in August 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing at least one month of anticoagulant therapy with control in people with previous presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Eleven trials involving 2487 patients were included. The quality of the 9 trials which predated routine computerised tomography scanning and the use of the International Normalised Ratio to monitor anticoagulation was poor. There was no evidence of an effect of anticoagulant therapy on either the odds of death or dependency (two trials, odds ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52 to 1.34) or of 'non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death' (four trials, odds ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.68–1.37). Death from any cause (odds ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24) and death from vascular causes (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13) were not significantly different between treatment and control. The inclusion of two recent completed trials did not alter these conclusions. There was no evidence of an effect of anticoagulant therapy on the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke (odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09). However, anticoagulants increased fatal intracranial haemorrhage (odds ratio 2.54, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.45), and major extracranial haemorrhage (odds ratio 3.43, 95% CI 1.94 to 6.08). This is equivalent to anticoagulant therapy causing about 11 additional fatal intracranial haemorrhages and 25 additional major extracranial haemorrhages per year for every 1000 patients given anticoagulant therapy.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Compared with control, there was no evidence of benefit from long-term anticoagulant therapy in people with presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, but there was a significant bleeding risk.

Knowledge gaps and future research — antithrombotic therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): In addition to the uncertainty of risk and benefit of anticoagulation in patients with AF and ICH, there is limited evidence for individual selection of optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients for whom anticoagulation will be restarted, and ongoing trials and future studies with stratification based on ICH location, mechanism, and risk factors for recurrence may lead to more informative decisions. Most analyses evaluating the role of appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients with ICH have focused on recurrent events, and future studies that incorporate outcomes such as disability or quality of life in addition to clinical events may provide information that is more patient-centric.

### New evidence for stroke prevention: clinical applications [^115A85v9]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most developed nations. There is a significant body of evidence supporting strategies that target primary and secondary stroke prevention. This evidence cannot be broadly applied to all patients, and each patient's situation and values must be considered with regard to shared evidence-based decision making. Several models can be used to apply evidence to individual patients, including formal clinical decision analysis, decision aids, or simpler tools such as the likelihood of being helped vs harmed. Various programmatic models of providing patient care in stroke prevention may also be useful; these include specialized clinics or disease-management programs, anticoagulation management services, and self-testing and management of anticoagulation by patients.

### Using anticoagulation for stroke prevention… [^11714hFu]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is well known as an independent risk factor for stroke, and millions of patients with this cardiac dysrhythmia are also at risk for cardiogenic embolism. Antithrombotics are the mainstay in stroke prevention among patients with atrial fibrillation. Hart and Halperin searched the MEDLINE database for recent advances in stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Dose-adjusted warfarin reduces the risk for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation by about 60 percent compared with placebo. This risk reduction is similar for primary and secondary prevention and for disabling and nondisabling strokes. Aspirin reduces the risk for nondisabling stroke by about 20 percent compared with placebo, and warfarin reduces the risk by about 40 percent compared with aspirin. Warfarin protection is maximized at an International Normalized Ratio between 2. 0 and 3.
0. An INR between 1. 6 and
2.

5 is also associated with substantial embolism protection — about 90 percent of that achieved with the higher-intensity levels. The target intensity of anticoagulation is a balance between prevention of stroke and an increased risk of major bleeding. Anticoagulation increases the frequency and severity of major intracranial and extracranial hemorrhage, predicted mostly by the intensity of anticoagulation and the patient age. Therefore, in patients younger than 75 years and for secondary prevention, the target INR is 2. 5; for primary prevention in older patients, the target value is 2.
0. It is unclear, however, whether observations from TEE add to the predictive value of the clinical risk factors for stroke. TEE may help distinguish cardioembolic from noncardioembolic mechanisms. Dose-adjusted anticoagulation is recommended in all cases involving secondary prevention.

Risk factors for noncardioembolic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation include aortic arch plaque, disturbances of hemostasis and postmenopausal estrogen replacement. The authors conclude that dose-adjusted anticoagulation is highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin is modestly effective in reducing nondisabling, noncardioembolic strokes. Warfarin is more effective than aspirin alone, and low-intensity warfarin alone or in combination with aspirin offers little protection.

Atrial fibrillation with prior ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease — adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation: For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, the usefulness of adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulants is uncertain for purposes of reducing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Unstable angina and coronary artery stenting represent special circumstances in which management may warrant dual antiplatelet/oral anticoagulation.

Hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic stroke — impact on anticoagulation timing: Hemorrhagic transformation is often seen as a contraindication to early (< 2 weeks of stroke onset) oral anticoagulation, although no randomized trial has been done that directly addresses the question. In a multicenter, prospective international study of consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation that included a second CT 24 to 72 hours after stroke onset, the presence of hemorrhagic transformation led to an average delay in anticoagulation.

Conclusion

DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant management and are becoming the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in AF and VTE prophylaxis and treatment, and the list of other indications is expanding. There are many factors that will affect appropriate efficacy and safety end points when prescribing DOAC therapy, and this review aims to address these scenarios. Patient comorbidities must be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant. It is now recognized that routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function, signs/symptoms of bleeding, and parameters of compliance should be considered for all patients. Clinicians should incorporate patient preferences, clinical outcomes data, patient characteristics, and quality‐of‐life considerations when recommending an anticoagulant. Cost can play a critical role in this decision, with DOAC affordability for individual patients varying based on medication benefit copayment tiers. As the future of anticoagulant therapies continues to evolve, DOACs will remain a critical therapy for preventing thrombotic events.

Results

In total, 4,357 of 5,268 (83%) patients across 5 cohort studies that systematically collected information on AF category were eligible for analysis. Information on anticoagulation before stroke was complete. We excluded 31 patients who suffered an outcome event before initiating/resuming anticoagulation, 349 patients for missing information on AF category and 144 patients for missing follow‐up information. Figure 1 shows the study flowchart. Table S1. shows the number of patients contributed by each cohort, as well as the recruitment period and follow‐up duration per cohort.

FIGURE 1
Study flowchart.

Baseline Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the pooled cohort are shown in Table 1. The index event was ischemic stroke in 4,022 patients (92%) and TIA in 335 (8%). The median (IQR) age was 79 (72–85) years and 1,999 patients (46%) were women. AFDAS was present in 1,889 patients (43%) and KAF in 2,468 (57%); 3,105 patients (71%) were anticoagulation‐naïve before stroke and 1,252 (29%) had stroke despite pre‐existing anticoagulation.

TABLE 1
Baseline Characteristics

Category –versus

Patients with KAF, in comparison to patients with AFDAS, were older, much more likely to have received pre‐existing anticoagulation, and less likely to have had ischemic stroke (as opposed to TIA) as index event, reflected in their lower NIHSS scores. In patients with KAF, anticoagulation after index event was more often with DOAC than with VKA and was initiated or resumed earlier than in those with AFDAS. Patients with KAF had a higher prevalence of prior stroke and cardiovascular comorbidities compared to those with AFDAS (Table 1).

Anticoagulation before Stroke – Anticoagulation‐naïve versus Pre‐Existing Anticoagulation

Compared to anticoagulation‐naïve patients, those with pre‐existing anticoagulation were older and almost exclusively had KAF as opposed to AFDAS. Patients with pre‐existing anticoagulation less commonly had ischemic stroke (as opposed to TIA) as index event, reflected in their lower NIHSS scores. In patients with pre‐existing anticoagulation, anticoagulant treatment after index event was more often with DOAC than with VKA and was initiated or resumed earlier than in those who were naïve to anticoagulation before stroke. Patients with pre‐existing anticoagulation had a higher prevalence of prior stroke and cardiovascular comorbidities compared to anticoagulation‐naïve patients (Table 1).

### Atrial fibrillation, stroke, and acute antithrombotic therapy: analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1117hkqo]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are typically larger, are associated with higher early mortality, and occur in older patients versus strokes in patients with sinus rhythm. Until recently, the value of antithrombotic therapies for acute stroke management has been based on empiric evidence.

Summary Of Review

We present a critical review of 3 randomized clinical trials testing aspirin, heparin/heparinoid, or both involving 5029 patients with AF and acute stroke. Early recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in about 5% of patients during the 2 to 4 weeks after initial stroke. Data conflict about whether early use of heparin/heparinoid reduced early recurrent ischemic stroke but are consistent regarding its lack of overall benefit on long-term functional outcome. Modest benefits for reduction of early recurrent stroke and functional outcome were associated with aspirin use, based largely on subgroup analysis from a single, large, unblinded trial.

Conclusions

No benefit of heparin has been demonstrated for acute stroke patients with AF; whether selected subgroups would respond differently remains to be proven. Aspirin followed by early initiation of warfarin for long-term secondary prevention is reasonable antithrombotic management.

### A survey of opinion: when to start oral anticoagulants in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation? [^1135CP1z]. European Stroke Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is uncertainty regarding the optimal timing for initiation of oral anticoagulant treatment in patients with recent ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. We surveyed the current UK practice and assessed clinician's opinions of when to use oral anticoagulant in recent stroke patients with atrial fibrillation.

Patients and Methods

An online survey was sent to stroke physicians within the United Kingdom via their national societies.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one clinicians responded to the survey. Ninety-five percent of responders agreed that there was uncertainty regarding timing of oral anticoagulant initiation after atrial fibrillation-related ischaemic stroke. Thirty-six percent of responders followed the '1–3–6–12' European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommendation. Uncertainty was greater in cases of moderate stroke than in cases of transient ischaemic attack (TIA), mild or severe stroke. Eighty-eight percent of responders would be willing to participate in a clinical trial of early versus later initiation of oral anticoagulant after stroke. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants were the preferred oral anticoagulant of choice.

Discussion and Conclusion

There is a lack of consensus amongst stroke physicians for when to initiate oral anticoagulant to prevent recurrence in stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. There is little uncertainty regarding TIA. A clinical trial assessing the use of early versus later initiation of direct-acting oral anticoagulant in patients with recent ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation would be beneficial.

AHA/ASA 2021 — timing of anticoagulation after ischemic stroke with AF: The daily embolic risk from AF is generally small (e.g., 6% per year equates to 0.016% per day and 0.23% over 14 days), and VISTA cohort data in 1644 patients found lower recurrent strokes when vitamin K antagonist (VKA) was initiated 2 to 3 days after stroke versus > 3 days without increased symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. For patients with larger infarcts, hemorrhage on neuroimaging, or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score > 9, the balance of risk and benefit favors waiting for healing to reduce bleeding risk.

### Antithrombotic dilemmas in stroke medicine: new data, unsolved challenges [^112zLouk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy is a key element of secondary prevention in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. However, its use in clinical practice is not always straightforward. This review provides an update on certain difficult scenarios in antithrombotic management, with a focus on recent clinical trials and large observational studies. We discuss the approach to patients with an indication for antithrombotic treatment who also have clinical or radiological evidence of previous intracranial bleeding, patients with indications for both anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment, and patients in whom antithrombotic treatment fails to prevent stroke. We also review the timing of anticoagulation initiation after cardioembolic stroke, and the use of antithrombotics in patients with asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease. Despite a wealth of new evidence, numerous uncertainties remain and we highlight ongoing trials addressing these.

### Aetiology, secondary prevention strategies and outcomes of ischaemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114C1KdX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study on ischaemic stroke despite anticoagulant therapy in patients with AF showed that the aetiology of stroke is heterogeneous and unfavourable outcomes are common. While DOAC treatment after stroke despite anticoagulation was associated with better outcomes than VKA, add-on antiplatelets were linked to worse outcomes; further research into more personalised and novel preventive strategies is warranted.

AHA/ASA 2021 secondary stroke prevention — atrial fibrillation (AF) with transient ischemic attack (TIA) versus stroke: Patients with TIA in the setting of AF have relatively low intracranial hemorrhage risk yet increased recurrent stroke risk, and the balance of bleeding risk versus benefit from oral anticoagulation favors earlier initiation when no cerebral infarction is present, whereas after stroke (particularly large stroke) delay is contrasted due to blood–brain barrier disruption increasing hemorrhage risk with anticoagulation initiation.

### Aetiology, secondary prevention strategies and outcomes of ischaemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115cv98M]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation with either direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there is a substantial residual stroke risk in patients with AF despite anticoagulation ranging from 0.7% to 2.3% annually in primary and secondary prevention, respectively. Since the introduction of DOAC, the overall use of oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with AF has increased steadily, particularly in patients with AF at the highest stroke risk. Due to this development, the number of patients with AF suffering a stroke despite anticoagulation is expected to increase, too. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with AF and stroke despite anticoagulation are at a higher risk for future recurrence than patients who were naive to anticoagulation treatment before stroke.

For stroke physicians, ischaemic stroke despite anticoagulation in patients with AF represents a challenge in everyday clinical practice, as its aetiology is not well-understood. Competing stroke mechanisms such as large artery and small vessel disease, as well as non-adherence or inappropriately dosed anticoagulation have been discussed as potential causes of stroke despite anticoagulation, but few data on their relative frequency exist. A better understanding of the aetiology of stroke despite anticoagulation is needed to inform strategies to prevent recurrence after a stroke despite anticoagulation. So far, limited data suggested no benefit from switching the anticoagulant type. Indeed, the optimal management of patients with stroke despite anticoagulation remains unclear, and the latest guidelines offer no recommendations on this.

We therefore sought to (i) describe the aetiology of stroke despite oral anticoagulation and (ii) investigate subsequent preventive strategies and outcomes in a large collaborative study of patients with AF and stroke despite anticoagulation from 11 experienced stroke centres.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^117JsQSK]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — stroke prevention conclusions state that stroke is a serious complication of AF with risk varying across patient groups and that antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with increased bleeding risk; recommendations are based on net clinical benefit across varying stroke-risk levels. Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, decisions require an individualized approach considering patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and non-CHADS2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in AF will evolve with results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

Antiphospholipid syndrome after unprovoked venous thrombosis — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) strategy: Recurrence rates without VKA therapy are high, so anticoagulation should be continued lifelong. Higher-intensity warfarin showed no added efficacy over a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3; targets of 3 to 4 (versus 2–3) did not add benefit, and high-intensity warfarin was associated with a nonstatistically increased bleeding risk (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 0.92–5.15]). When compared with aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 has been shown to be effective.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^111UqQPL]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability in developed countries and one of the top causes of mortality worldwide. The past decade has seen substantial advances in the diagnostic and treatment options available to minimize the impact of acute ischemic stroke. The key first step in stroke care is early identification of patients with stroke and triage to centers capable of delivering the appropriate treatment, as fast as possible. Here, we review the data supporting pre-hospital and emergency stroke care, including use of emergency medical services protocols for identification of patients with stroke, intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke including updates to recommended patient eligibility criteria and treatment time windows, and advanced imaging techniques with automated interpretation to identify patients with large areas of brain at risk but without large completed infarcts who are likely to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy in extended time windows from symptom onset. We also review protocols for management of patient physiologic parameters to minimize infarct volumes and recent updates in secondary prevention recommendations including short term use of dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in the high risk period immediately after stroke. Finally, we discuss emerging therapies and questions for future research.

### Optimal delay time to initiate anticoagulation after ischemic stroke in atrial fibrillation: a pragmatic… [^113GCsMy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Although a clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant was not identified, the evidence suggests that initiating a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than later within the first 2 weeks after stroke due to atrial fibrillation. Importance Clinical practice guidelines recommend initiation of anticoagulation within 2 weeks after stroke with atrial fibrillation. It is unknown whether there is an optimal starting day within the 14-day period that balances the risks of recurrent embolic events against serious hemorrhagic events. Objective To determine if there is an optimal delay time to initiate treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant after atrial fibrillation–related stroke that minimizes the risk of a composite outcome of ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Design, Setting, and Participants.

This phase 2, pragmatic, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial was conducted between June 2017 and June 2023 at acute care hospitals in Texas and included patients who had a mild to moderate ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation and were prescribed a direct oral anticoagulant within 2 weeks from stroke onset. Intervention Within 3 to 4 days after atrial fibrillation–associated ischemic stroke, patients were randomized to a group for treatment start date with a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention. Main Outcomes and Measures The composite primary outcome was an ischemic or hemorrhagic event observed within 30 days from the index stroke time of onset.

Posterior probabilities were used to estimate which timing groups were optimal for treatment initiation and were recalculated at predefined intervals. The randomization allocations were adjusted to favor the groups with higher probabilities. Conclusions and Relevance A clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation was not identified, but the evidence suggests that initiating use of a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than at later times within the first 2 weeks after stroke onset. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Anticoagulation after cardioembolic stroke… [^115aCAiv]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Anticoagulation of patients with cardioembolic stroke can be safely started with warfarin shortly after stroke. Heparin bridging and enoxaparin bridging increase the risk for serious bleeding. Published online July 14, 2008. The outcome distribution is shown in Table
3. Patients with AC were 2. 4 times more likely than their counterparts without AC to experience a favorable outcome. Although the NT and ASA groups had more severe strokes, these associations remained significant after controlling for baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores and age using logistic regression.

These data are in agreement with our observations as no patients in the Heparin in Acute Embolic Stroke Trial were bridged. The International Stroke Trial12 that tested heparin vs aspirin in acute stroke did show an increased risk of HT with heparin. The rate, however, was low and is consistent with our observation of a 0% rate of HT in the HB group. Stroke progression is likely multifactorial, 13 with brain edema, clot propagation, reocclusion of the parent vessel, recurrent emboli to the same territory, and hemodynamic fluctuations accounting for most cases. In our cohort, there was an excess of stroke progression in the ASA and NT groups, and patients treated with warfarin alone or bridged with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin were nearly 13 times less likely to experience stroke progression compared with ASA treatment.

This may suggest a role of AC in preventing stroke progression, which is supported by 2 studies14, 15 that recently demonstrated a better outcome with early AC treatment of patients with CES. Stroke progression may be difficult to distinguish from recurrent embolization to the same arterial territory. This may also account for some of the observed reduction in stroke progression in our study. Finally, our ASA group had more severe strokes at baseline, so the excess of progression in this group may simply reflect the extent of their infarct and not treatment effect.
