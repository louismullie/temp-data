## Question

What causes neural inflammation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes neural inflammation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining neural inflammation and its core cellular mediators. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic drivers: infectious, autoimmune, sterile injury, neurodegenerative, systemic inflammatory, and neurogenic sources. Next, I will examine convergent mechanisms such as microglial priming, inflammasome activation, blood–brain barrier disruption, and neuroimmune axis dysregulation. After that, I need to consider contextual modifiers like age, sex, and genetics. Finally, I will integrate these into a coherent causal model and highlight key uncertainties and therapeutic implications, making sure I verify each claim against the best available evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core biology. Neural inflammation, or neuroinflammation, is the CNS's inflammatory response involving microglia, astrocytes, infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines; it is normally tightly regulated in the immune-privileged brain, but when dysregulated, it can drive pathology across many neurologic conditions [^091765b3] [^ea08376d]. Hold on, I should verify the dual role point: inflammation can be protective early and detrimental when chronic or excessive, which is repeatedly emphasized in CNS injury and neurodegeneration literature, so I will keep that nuance in mind as I proceed [^03ea6526] [^a586d526].

> Next, I will examine infectious drivers. Neurotropic pathogens such as herpesviruses, including HSV-1, can directly injure neurons and provoke robust innate and adaptive immune responses; importantly, immune responses themselves can impair neural function even after pathogen clearance, and post-infectious autoimmunity can emerge, as seen with NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis after HSV encephalitis, illustrating a direct infection-to-autoimmunity bridge [^7b66ece0] [^73d65942]. Wait, let me verify the COVID-19 angle: SARS-CoV-2 is associated with chronic neuroinflammation and may accelerate neurodegenerative disease in susceptible hosts, supporting the concept that systemic viral illness can seed or amplify CNS inflammation via systemic immune activation and BBB effects rather than only direct neurotropism [^f95ae6ce].

> I will now consider autoimmune encephalitis. Misdirected immune attacks against neuronal surface antigens (for example, NMDA receptor, LGI1, GAD65) cause antibody-mediated neuroinflammation with characteristic clinical syndromes; early immunotherapy improves outcomes, underscoring that the inflammatory process itself is pathogenic and treatable in these entities [^9f8bdce5] [^e2d18fdd]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic overlap with infectious encephalitis: clinical and pathophysiologic overlap complicates early differentiation, which is why combined clinical–serologic algorithms and timely immunotherapy are critical to prevent irreversible injury [^73d65942].

> Let me think about sterile injury. Traumatic brain injury initiates a complex, multiphasic neuroinflammatory cascade with both beneficial and harmful arms; microglial activation, cytokine signaling, and peripheral immune infiltration contribute to secondary injury, and chronic neuroinflammation can persist for years, linking TBI to later neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [^60570089] [^04e2e1a9]. I should double-check the clinical implication: timing-sensitive modulation of maladaptive inflammation is a key translational target, though trials have struggled, likely due to heterogeneity and imprecise patient selection [^944640b7].

> Now, neurodegenerative diseases. Wait, let me verify the directionality here. Initially, I almost said inflammation is purely a secondary response to neuronal death; however, emerging evidence indicates innate immune activation by misfolded proteins (for example, α-synuclein, Aβ) and inflammasome signaling can precede and propagate neurodegeneration, suggesting inflammation can be causal in some contexts, not merely reactive [^1dbbe5aa] [^c8cf7085]. I need to ensure I capture the vicious cycle concept: damaged neurons release DAMPs that activate microglia, which in turn amplify neuronal injury, creating a self-propagating loop in diseases like ALS, PD, and AD [^361bc79e] [^68685a72].

> Systemic inflammation is another major driver. Let me verify the mechanism: peripheral infections or cytokine storms can signal to the brain via humoral and neural pathways, priming microglia to an exaggerated pro-inflammatory state; this is particularly consequential in the aged or diseased brain, where baseline microglia are already primed, explaining why systemic insults can precipitate delirium or accelerate neurodegeneration [^892832b1] [^f95ae6ce]. Hold on, I should confirm the clinical correlate: perioperative neurocognitive disorders and sickness behavior reflect this immune-to-brain signaling, and experimental endotoxemia in humans reproduces mood and cognitive changes seen in inflammation-associated depression, reinforcing causality in at least some settings [^a2fca05f] [^fa43a4f5].

> I will now examine neurogenic inflammation. Increased neuronal activity itself can trigger CNS inflammatory responses, a phenomenon termed neurogenic neuroinflammation; this helps meet metabolic demands but can become maladaptive in epilepsy, chronic pain, and stress-related disorders, linking neural firing to glial activation and cytokine release [^50153eb8]. But wait, what if peripheral sensory neurons are the source? Indeed, nociceptors release neuropeptides that modulate local immunity and can amplify inflammation, illustrating bidirectional neuroimmune crosstalk at the periphery that can secondarily engage central neuroinflammation [^8a996221].

> Next, I should review convergent mechanisms that cut across etiologies. Microglial priming and phenotype switching are central; in aged or degenerating brains, microglia shift toward a pro-inflammatory state, and systemic inflammation can convert this priming into aggressive cytokine release, worsening neural injury [^892832b1] [^1dbbe5aa]. Inflammasome activation, particularly NLRP3, is a recurring node in neurodegenerative and sterile injury contexts, driving IL-1β/IL-18 release and pyroptosis, and is increasingly targeted therapeutically [^c8cf7085] [^1f9ae907]. I need to check BBB integrity: breakdown of the BBB allows peripheral immune infiltration and dysregulated signaling, and BBB dysfunction is both a cause and consequence of neuroinflammation in multiple diseases, including AD and COVID-19–related neurologic injury [^a51f24c2] [^f95ae6ce]. Finally, the neuroimmune axis — especially vagal and body–brain circuits — provides real-time neural regulation of peripheral and central inflammation; dysregulation here can unleash uncontrolled inflammation, whereas targeted neuromodulation can restore balance in preclinical models [^04cb5d80] [^3f703c2f].

> Let me consider contextual modifiers. Aging primes microglia and impairs resolution, making the aged brain uniquely vulnerable to inflammatory insults; sex differences in cytokine signaling and treatment response are increasingly recognized, for example in depression and TRD, where inflammatory profiles and ketamine response vary by sex; and genetics such as C9orf72 variants can dysregulate endolysosomal pathways and suppress microbiota-driven inflammation, revealing gene–environment interactions that modulate neuroinflammation risk [^892832b1] [^03d0e6fd] [^7b68790c]. Hold on, I should verify that these modifiers align with clinical observations: yes, age-associated neuroinflammation correlates with AD risk, and C9orf72 mouse models show that reducing microbial burden attenuates systemic and neural inflammation, supporting translational implications [^f95ae6ce] [^7b68790c].

> I should now integrate these into a causal model. Neural inflammation arises when a trigger (infection, autoimmunity, sterile injury, proteinopathy, systemic cytokines, or excessive neural activity) activates CNS-resident innate immunity, which is shaped by baseline microglial priming, BBB integrity, and neuroimmune axis tone; the resulting cytokine milieu and cellular interactions determine whether inflammation resolves and repairs or persists and damages, thereby influencing clinical trajectories from acute encephalitis to chronic neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric sequelae [^ea08376d] [^1dbbe5aa] [^3f703c2f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied a linear cascade, but I should correct that: feedback loops between neurons, glia, and peripheral immunity create nonlinear dynamics, explaining heterogeneity and the need for timing-sensitive interventions [^361bc79e] [^04e2e1a9].

> Finally, I need to highlight uncertainties and therapeutic implications. Key gaps include distinguishing protective from pathogenic inflammation in specific diseases, identifying biomarkers to time interventions, and resolving translational failures from animal models to humans; nonetheless, inflammasome inhibitors, vagal neuromodulation, and precision immunotherapies are promising avenues, and early immunotherapy in autoimmune encephalitis demonstrates that timely modulation of neuroinflammation can be disease-modifying [^c8cf7085] [^3f703c2f] [^9f8bdce5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: given the dual role of inflammation, future strategies must be context- and phase-specific, leveraging our growing understanding of neuroimmune circuits to deliver targeted, reversible modulation rather than broad immunosuppression [^03ea6526] [^3c8338da].

Neural inflammation arises from **multiple drivers**: infections (e.g. COVID-19, HSV, HIV) [^7b66ece0] [^f95ae6ce], autoimmune attacks (e.g. multiple sclerosis, autoimmune encephalitis) [^9f8bdce5], traumatic brain injury [^60570089], neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS) [^1dbbe5aa], and systemic inflammation (e.g. sepsis, obesity, chronic stress) [^892832b1] [^cc3be6e1] [^de09ba3e]. Key mechanisms include **microglial activation** [^1dbbe5aa], **astrocyte dysfunction** [^c523d60a], **cytokine release** (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) [^6368c4d0], and **blood–brain barrier breakdown** [^a51f24c2], which together amplify neuronal injury and dysfunction. Chronic neuroinflammation is a **major driver of neurodegeneration** and cognitive decline, and targeting these pathways is a key therapeutic strategy [^361bc79e] [^c8cf7085].

---

## Infectious causes

Infectious agents can directly invade the CNS or trigger **immune-mediated inflammation**:

- **COVID-19**: SARS-CoV-2 can cause neuroinflammation via cytokine storms, microglial activation, and BBB disruption, contributing to neurological symptoms and long-term cognitive effects [^f95ae6ce].

- **Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**: HSV encephalitis causes severe neuroinflammation and can lead to autoimmune encephalitis via molecular mimicry [^73d65942].

- **HIV**: Chronic HIV infection causes persistent neuroinflammation, leading to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) [^notfound].

---

## Autoimmune causes

Autoimmune diseases cause **immune-mediated neuroinflammation** through direct attack on CNS components:

- **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**: Autoimmune demyelination with microglial activation and cytokine release drives neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [^66867f38].

- **Autoimmune encephalitis**: Antibodies against neuronal surface proteins (e.g. NMDA receptor) cause inflammation, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms [^9f8bdce5].

- **Guillain-Barré syndrome**: Peripheral immune attack on nerves causes inflammation and demyelination [^notfound].

---

## Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

TBI initiates a **complex neuroinflammatory cascade** with acute and chronic phases:

- **Acute phase**: Microglial activation, cytokine release, and BBB disruption cause secondary injury [^60570089].

- **Chronic phase**: Persistent neuroinflammation contributes to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), cognitive decline, and neurodegeneration [^c223cd4a].

---

## Neurodegenerative diseases

Neurodegenerative diseases feature **chronic neuroinflammation** as a core pathological component:

- **Alzheimer's disease (AD)**: Amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles trigger microglial activation and cytokine release, promoting neuronal death [^1dbbe5aa].

- **Parkinson's disease (PD)**: Alpha-synuclein aggregates activate microglia and astrocytes, causing chronic inflammation and dopaminergic neuron loss [^c8e8cd2c].

- **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**: Motor neuron degeneration is accompanied by neuroinflammation and microglial activation [^234d73af].

---

## Systemic inflammation and chronic diseases

Systemic inflammation can propagate to the CNS, causing **neuroinflammation**:

- **Sepsis**: Systemic cytokine storms activate microglia and disrupt the BBB, leading to encephalopathy and cognitive impairment [^892832b1].

- **Obesity and metabolic syndrome**: Chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance promote neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits [^cc3be6e1].

- **Chronic stress**: Stress-induced cytokine release and HPA axis activation drive neuroinflammation and mood disorders [^de09ba3e].

---

## Molecular and cellular mechanisms

Neural inflammation involves **interconnected mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Microglial activation | Primary innate immune response; releases cytokines and ROS, causing neuronal injury [^1dbbe5aa] |
| Astrocyte dysfunction | Astrocytes lose homeostatic functions, exacerbate inflammation, and impair synaptic function [^c523d60a] |
| Cytokine signaling | TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 disrupt synaptic function, promote neuronal death, and drive neurodegeneration [^6368c4d0] |
| Blood–brain barrier disruption | Allows peripheral immune infiltration, worsening inflammation and neuronal injury [^a51f24c2] |
| Inflammasome activation | NLRP3 inflammasome drives IL-1β release and pyroptosis, contributing to neurodegeneration [^c8cf7085] |

---

## Therapeutic implications

Understanding these mechanisms enables **targeted therapies**:

- **Anti-inflammatory drugs**: NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and biologics targeting cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1β) are under investigation [^c8cf7085].

- **Neuromodulation**: Vagus nerve stimulation and other neuromodulatory approaches are being explored to modulate neuroinflammation [^3c8338da].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Diet, exercise, and stress reduction can reduce systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation [^cc3be6e1].

---

Neural inflammation is a **multifactorial process** driven by infections, autoimmunity, trauma, neurodegeneration, and systemic inflammation, with convergent mechanisms that amplify CNS injury. Targeting these pathways offers promising strategies to mitigate neurological disease progression.

### Infectious immunity in the central nervous system and brain function [^7b66ece0]. Nature Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Inflammation is emerging as a critical mechanism underlying neurological disorders of various etiologies, yet its role in altering brain function as a consequence of neuroinfectious disease remains unclear. Although acute alterations in mental status due to inflammation are a hallmark of central nervous system (CNS) infections with neurotropic pathogens, post-infectious neurologic dysfunction has traditionally been attributed to irreversible damage caused by the pathogens themselves. More recently, studies indicate that pathogen eradication within the CNS may require immune responses that interfere with neural cell function and communication without affecting their survival. In this Review we explore inflammatory processes underlying neurological impairments caused by CNS infection and discuss their potential links to established mechanisms of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

This review considers the manner in which inflammation in the CNS contributes to, and protects against, neurodegeneration. A series of questions are posed, first about primarily inflammatory diseases and the causes of neurodegeneration that occurs in them, and then about neurodegenerative diseases and stroke and the role that inflammation plays there. Common themes as well as disease-specific differences are highlighted in this survey of the recent human disease and animal model literature.

### Why neurodegenerative diseases are progressive: uncontrolled inflammation drives disease progression [^361bc79e]. Trends in Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of chronic, progressive disorders characterized by the gradual loss of neurons in discrete areas of the central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism(s) underlying their progressive nature remains unknown but a timely and well-controlled inflammatory reaction is essential for the integrity and proper function of the CNS. Substantial evidence has documented a common inflammatory mechanism in various neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that in the diseased CNS, interactions between damaged neurons and dysregulated, overactivated microglia create a vicious self-propagating cycle causing uncontrolled, prolonged inflammation that drives the chronic progression of neurodegenerative diseases. We further propose that dynamic modulation of this inflammatory reaction by interrupting the vicious cycle might become a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

### Clinical evidence of inflammation driving secondary brain injury: a systematic review [^11834fb1]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite advances in both prevention and treatment, traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the most burdensome diseases; 2% of the US population currently lives with disabilities resulting from TBI. Recent advances in the understanding of inflammation and its impact on the pathophysiology of trauma have increased the interest in inflammation as a possible mediator in TBI outcome.

Objectives

The goal of this systematic review is to address the question: "What is the evidence in humans that inflammation is linked to secondary brain injury?" As the experimental evidence has been well described elsewhere, this review will focus on the clinical evidence for inflammation as a mechanism of secondary brain injury.

Data Sources

Medline database (1996-Week 1 June 2014), Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were queried for relevant studies.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies were eligible if participants were adults and/or children who sustained moderate or severe TBI in the acute phase of injury, published in English. Studies published in the last decade (since 2004) were preferentially included. Trials could be observational or interventional in nature.

Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

To address the quality of the studies retrieved, we applied the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to assess the limitations of the included studies.

Results

Trauma initiates local central nervous system as well as systemic immune activation. Numerous observational studies describe elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are associated with important clinical variables including neurologic outcome and mortality. A small number of clinical trials have included immunomodulating strategies, but no intervention to date has proven effective in improving outcomes after TBI.

Limitations

Inclusion of studies not initially retrieved by the search terms may have biased our results. Additionally, some reports may have been inadvertently excluded due to use of non-search term key words. Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings Clinical evidence of inflammation causing secondary brain injury in humans is gaining momentum. While inflammation is certainly present, it is not clear from the literature at what juncture inflammation becomes maladaptive, promoting secondary injury rather than facilitating repairand identifying patients with maladaptive inflammation (neuro-inflammation, systemic, or both) after TBI remains elusive. Direct agonism/antagonism represents an exciting target for future study.

Level Of Evidence

### Neuroimmune axis of cardiovascular control: mechanisms and therapeutic implications [^aa24a10f]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) make a substantial contribution to the global burden of disease. Prevention strategies have succeeded in reducing the effect of acute CVD events and deaths, but the long-term consequences of cardiovascular risk factors still represent the major cause of disability and chronic illness, suggesting that some pathophysiological mechanisms might not be adequately targeted by current therapies. Many of the underlying causes of CVD have now been recognized to have immune and inflammatory components. However, inflammation and immune activation were mostly regarded as a consequence of target-organ damage. Only more recent findings have indicated that immune dysregulation can be pathogenic for CVD, identifying a need for novel immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies. The nervous system, through an array of afferent and efferent arms of the autonomic nervous system, profoundly affects cardiovascular function. Interestingly, the autonomic nervous system also innervates immune organs, and neuroimmune interactions that are biologically relevant to CVD have been discovered, providing the foundation to target neural reflexes as an immunomodulatory therapeutic strategy. This Review summarizes how the neural regulation of immunity and inflammation participates in the onset and progression of CVD and explores promising opportunities for future therapeutic strategies.

### Neuro-immune interactions in the tissues [^f950f81f]. Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability of the nervous system to sense environmental stimuli and to relay these signals to immune cells via neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is indispensable for effective immunity and tissue homeostasis. Depending on the tissue microenvironment and distinct drivers of a certain immune response, the same neuronal populations and neuro-mediators can exert opposing effects, promoting or inhibiting tissue immunity. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the complex interactions between the immune and the nervous systems in different tissues and contexts. We outline current gaps in knowledge and argue for the importance of considering infectious and inflammatory disease within a conceptual framework that integrates neuro-immune circuits both local and systemic, so as to better understand effective immunity to develop improved approaches to treat inflammation and disease.

### Neural regulation of immunity: molecular mechanisms and clinical translation [^3c8338da]. Nature Neuroscience (2017). Medium credibility.

Studies bridging neuroscience and immunology have identified neural pathways that regulate immunity and inflammation. Recent research using methodological advances in molecular genetics has improved our understanding of the neural control of immunity. Here we outline mechanistic insights, focusing on translational relevance and conceptual developments. We also summarize findings from recent clinical studies of bioelectronic neuromodulation in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

---

### The inflammatory reflex [^04cb5d80]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Inflammation is a local, protective response to microbial invasion or injury. It must be fine-tuned and regulated precisely, because deficiencies or excesses of the inflammatory response cause morbidity and shorten lifespan. The discovery that cholinergic neurons inhibit acute inflammation has qualitatively expanded our understanding of how the nervous system modulates immune responses. The nervous system reflexively regulates the inflammatory response in real time, just as it controls heart rate and other vital functions. The opportunity now exists to apply this insight to the treatment of inflammation through selective and reversible 'hard-wired' neural systems.

---

### Dual role of inflammation in CNS disease [^03ea6526]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Inflammatory responses in the CNS have usually been perceived to cause or contribute to neuron injury. However, emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory reactions can also be neuroprotective. The nervous and immune systems employ overlapping mechanisms and shared mediators that promote cross-talk between the two systems. Immune cells, for example, produce not only neurodestructive molecules but also factors that can support neuroaxonal growth, survival, and plasticity. This might explain why inflammatory reactions may contribute to both injury and protection of neurons. The dual role of CNS inflammation also has important therapeutic implications that are only beginning to be explored.

### Of mice and men: comparative analysis of neuro-inflammatory mechanisms in human and mouse using cause-and-effect models [^32027456]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Perturbance in inflammatory pathways have been identified as one of the major factors which leads to neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Owing to the limited access of human brain tissues and the immense complexity of the brain, animal models, specifically mouse models, play a key role in advancing the NDD field. However, many of these mouse models fail to reproduce the clinical manifestations and end points of the disease. NDD drugs, which passed the efficacy test in mice, were repeatedly not successful in clinical trials. There are numerous studies which are supporting and opposing the applicability of mouse models in neuroinflammation and NDD. In this paper, we assessed to what extend a mouse can mimic the cellular and molecular interactions in humans at a mechanism level. Based on our mechanistic modeling approach, we investigate the failure of a neuroinflammation targeted drug in the late phases of clinical trials based on the comparative analyses between the two species.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: clinical spectrum and management [^9f8bdce5]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune encephalitis defines brain inflammation caused by a misdirected immune response against self-antigens expressed in the central nervous system. It comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders that are at least as common as infectious causes of encephalitis. The rapid and ongoing expansion of this field has been driven by the identification of several pathogenic autoantibodies that cause polysymptomatic neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. These conditions often show highly distinctive cognitive, seizure and movement disorder phenotypes, making them clinically recognisable. Their early identification and treatment improve patient outcomes, and may aid rapid diagnosis of an underlying associated tumour. Here we summarise the well-known autoantibody-mediated encephalitis syndromes with neuronal cell-surface antigens. We focus on practical aspects of their diagnosis and treatment, offer our clinical experiences of managing such cases and highlight more basic neuroimmunological advances that will inform their future diagnosis and treatments.

### Inflammation versus neurodegeneration: consequences for treatment [^66867d38]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Inflammation is assumed to be the main driver of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. However there is evidence that questions this hypothesis: Data from pathological studies and from imaging have shown that neuronal/axonal damage occurs early in lesion formation and at the earliest clinical stage of the disease. Additionally axonal damage itself can lead to inflammation and laboratory and clinical observations suggest that inflammation may be neuroprotective. Finally, clinical trials reveal that immunosuppression does not have the predicted effect on axonal damage and disability. Clearly if inflammation is not the primary event but a secondary phenomenon this has important implications in developing treatment regimes.

### Basic science of neuroinflammation and involvement of the inflammatory response in disorders of the nervous system [^091765b3]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroinflammation is a key immune response observed in many neurologic diseases. Although an appropriate immune response can be beneficial, aberrant activation of this response recruits excessive proinflammatory cells to cause damage. Because the central nervous system is separated from the periphery by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that creates an immune-privileged site, it has its own unique immune cells and immune response. Moreover, neuroinflammation can compromise the BBB causing an influx of peripheral immune cells and factors. Recent advances have brought a deeper understanding of neuroinflammation that can be leveraged to develop more potent therapies and improve patient selection.

### A double-hit of stress and low-grade inflammation on functional brain network mediates posttraumatic stress symptoms [^c0614246]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In summary, our study provides evidence for the potential brain mechanisms underlying low-grade inflammation and stress in subsequent manifestations of PTSD. Our findings indicate that increased inflammatory activity may render individuals who are exposed to trauma at an even higher risk of PTSD. The current results provide a proof of concept for the potential use of anti-inflammatory treatment methods in the prevention or treatment for PTSD for individuals who are repeatedly exposed to stress.

### Neurogenic aspects of inflammation [^f5f188a6]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The relationship between the inflammatory process and the nervous system is twofold. The nervous system is activated by inflammation which causes inflammatory pain and impaired motor function. Conversely, the nervous system acts back on the peripheral process. This is achieved by output systems at different levels, including primary afferent fibers (neurogenic inflammation), spinal cord (reflexes), and the brain (eg, neuroendocrine functions). This article first addresses the activation of the nociceptive system by inflammation; the second part describes the effects of the nervous system on inflamed tissue.

### Novel approaches to tendinopathy [^52f8b466]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The last decade has seen an evolution in the thinking of tendinopathy from inflammatory to degenerative and hence a change in approaches to treatment.

Method

We review the literature in this field to highlight the possibility of neural and neural-induced inflammation in this field.

Results

Neuropathy is a possible source of pain in tendinopathy.

Conclusion

Further work is required to develop the neuropathic model of tendinopathy, and to determine whether these neuropathic factors are responsible. The concept of neoneurovascularization being the issue in tendinopathy is established. The underlying mechanisms for the process require further evaluation.

### Innate and adaptive immune responses in the CNS [^ea08376d]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Almost every disorder of the CNS is said to have an inflammatory component, but the precise nature of inflammation in the CNS is often imprecisely defined, and the role of CNS-resident cells is uncertain compared with that of cells that invade the tissue from the systemic immune compartment. To understand inflammation in the CNS, the term must be better defined, and the response of tissue to disturbances in homoeostasis (eg, neurodegenerative processes) should be distinguished from disorders in which aberrant immune responses lead to CNS dysfunction and tissue destruction (eg, autoimmunity). Whether the inflammatory tissue response to injury is reparative or degenerative seems to be dependent on context and timing, as are the windows of opportunity for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory CNS diseases.

### Neuroinflammation and the generation of neuropathic pain [^57940fc0]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammation is the process by which an organism responds to tissue injury involving both immune cell recruitment and mediator release. Diverse causes of neuropathic pain are associated with excessive inflammation in both the peripheral and central nervous system which may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of persistent pain. Chemical mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators, released during an inflammatory response have the undesired effect of sensitizing and stimulating nociceptors, their central synaptic targets or both. These changes can promote long-term maladaptive plasticity resulting in persistent neuropathic pain. This review aims to provide an overview of inflammatory mechanisms at differing levels of the sensory neuroaxis with a focus on neuropathic pain. We will compare and contrast neuropathic pain states such as traumatic nerve injury which is associated with a vigorous inflammatory response and chemotherapy induced pain in which the inflammatory response is much more modest. Targeting excessive inflammation in neuropathic pain provides potential therapeutic opportunities and we will discuss some of the opportunities but also the clinical challenges in such an approach.

### Neurological syndromes driven by postinfectious processes or unrecognized persistent infections [^2bdb00ac]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The immune system serves a critical role in protecting the host against various pathogens. However, under circumstances, once triggered by the infectious process, it may be detrimental to the host. This may be as a result of nonspecific immune activation or due to a targeted immune response to a specific host antigen. In this opinion piece, we discuss the underlying mechanisms that lead to such an inflammatory or autoimmune syndrome affecting the nervous system. We examine these hypotheses in the context of recent emerging infections to provide mechanistic insight into the clinical manifestations and rationale for immunomodulatory therapy.

Recent Findings

Some pathogens endure longer than previously thought. Persistent infections may continue to drive immune responses resulting in chronic inflammation or development of autoimmune processes, resulting in damage to the nervous system. Patients with genetic susceptibilities in immune regulation may be particularly vulnerable to pathogen driven autoimmune responses.

Summary

The presence of prolonged pathogens may result in chronic immune stimulations that drives immune-mediated neurologic complications. Understanding the burden and mechanisms of these processes is challenging but important.

### Molecular pathogenesis of neuroinflammation [^f267c93c]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The past few years have seen significant progress towards understanding the mechanisms of immune surveillance and inflammation in the nervous system. In this review, the milestones of scientific discovery in this field are discussed, and the strengths and limitations of the different ways of examining the molecular pathogenesis of neuro-inflammation examined. The review is limited to the inflammatory reactions of the central nervous system that occur in multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

### Neuroinflammation and perioperative neurocognitive disorders [^48b48252]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuroinflammation has become a key hallmark of neurological complications including perioperative pathologies such as postoperative delirium and longer-lasting postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Dysregulated inflammation and neuronal injury are emerging from clinical studies as key features of perioperative neurocognitive disorders. These findings are paralleled by a growing body of preclinical investigations aimed at better understanding how surgery and anesthesia affect the central nervous system and possibly contribute to cognitive decline. Herein, we review the role of postoperative neuroinflammation and underlying mechanisms in immune-to-brain signaling after peripheral surgery.

---

### Viral and inflammatory triggers of neurodegenerative diseases [^4fccbd63]. Science Translational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Here, we synthesize research behind the emerging hypothesis that inflammation — which can result, for example, from viral infections — can initiate and propagate chronic neuronal dysfunction, an event that precedes the clinical onset of many neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic approaches that target immunological pathways in the prodromal phase of diseases might decrease the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders and increase the therapeutic window for neuroprotection.

### Neural correlates of peripheral inflammation in major depressive disorder and their transcriptomic architecture, neurochemical basis, and behavioral relevance [^fa9b730b]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, our data provide first empirical evidence for the neural correlates of peripheral inflammation in MDD and their transcriptomic architecture, neurochemical basis, and behavioral relevance, as well as demonstrate the mediative role of the neural correlates in accounting for the inflammatory effects on the clinical presentation of MDD. These findings may not only confirm the role of inflammation in the neuropathology of MDD, but also inform a novel conceptualization of targeting inflammatory processes to treat this disorder.

### Olfactory impairment in psychiatric disorders: does nasal inflammation impact disease psychophysiology? [^dafa13bf]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Olfactory impairments contribute to the psychopathology of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Recent neuroscience research has shed light on the previously underappreciated olfactory neural circuits involved in regulation of higher brain functions. Although environmental factors such as air pollutants and respiratory viral infections are known to contribute to the risk for psychiatric disorders, the role of nasal inflammation in neurobehavioral outcomes and disease pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Here, we will first provide an overview of published findings on the impact of nasal inflammation in the olfactory system. We will then summarize clinical studies on olfactory impairments in schizophrenia and depression, followed by preclinical evidence on the neurobehavioral outcomes produced by olfactory dysfunction. Lastly, we will discuss the potential impact of nasal inflammation on brain development and function, as well as how we can address the role of nasal inflammation in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Considering the current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which often causes nasal inflammation and serious adverse effects for olfactory function that might result in long-lasting neuropsychiatric sequelae, this line of research is particularly critical to understanding of the potential significance of nasal inflammation in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.

### Pruritus (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^4cff84ce]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Pruritus –Health Professional Version OverviewGo to Patient Version Pruritus is usually an unpleasant sensation that elicits a desire to scratch, subjectively quantified by intensity, severity, location, and intractability. It may be proposed that itch is akin to pain because both sensations are thought to be transmitted from the skin to the central nervous system through nociceptive small-caliber C nerve fibers. Both itch and pain sensations result from the activation of a network of free nerve endings at the dermal-epidermal junction. Activation may be the result of internal or external thermal, mechanical, chemical, or electrical stimulation. The cutaneous nerve stimulation is activated or mediated by several substances, including the following: The itch impulse is transmitted along the same neural pathway as pain impulses, i.e., traveling from peripheral nerves to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, across the cord via the anterior commissure, and ascending along the spinothalamic tract to the laminar nuclei of the contralateral thalamus. Thalamocortical tracts of tertiary neurons are believed to relay the impulse through the integrating reticular activating system of the thalamus to several areas of the cerebral cortex. Factors that are believed to enhance the sensation of itch include:

- Dryness of the epidermis and dermis.
- Anoxia of tissues.
- Dilation of the capillaries.
- Irritating stimuli.
- Psychological responses. The motor response of scratching follows the perception of itch. Scratching is modulated at the corticothalamic center and is a spinal reflex. Itching may be relieved for 15 to 25 minutes after scratching. The mechanism through which the itch is relieved by scratching is unknown. It is hypothesized that scratching generates sensory impulses that break circuits in the relay areas of the spinal cord. If one antihistamine is ineffective, one from another class may provide relief.

### A body-brain circuit that regulates body inflammatory responses [^54ec4ebd]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

A well-balanced immune response is of fundamental importance for the fitness and survival of the organism. An overactive pro-inflammatory state invariably leads to immune dysregulation, including a diverse range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Understanding the mechanisms that tune the immune response may afford important insights into the function of the immune system, and provide novel strategies to combat disorders and diseases characterized by dysregulated immune states.

Much is known about innateand adaptive immunity, with numerous cellular and humoral factors having essential roles in initiating, amplifying and terminating immune responses –. Several studies have shown that infection can activate neural circuits mediating physiologically conserved responses such as fever, malaise and changes in feeding behaviour –, and pioneering work by Tracey and collaborators have revealed the significance of electrical stimulation of the vagal nerve as a therapeutic strategy to attenuate inflammation. However, how the brain, as the central 'arbiter' of body physiology, regulates immunity remains poorly understood, despite our knowledge of several potential pathways linking the brain to immune cells –.

Here we describe a body–brain neural circuit that informs the brain of an emerging inflammatory response. We identified vagal neurons that respond to pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory immune mediators, and showed that they signal to a genetically defined population of neurons in the brainstem to modulate and shape the course on an inflammatory response. These results reveal the influence of the body–brain axis in controlling innate immunity and highlight the therapeutic potential of recruiting this axis to help rebalance immune function.

### Immune-mediated processes in neurodegeneration: where do we stand? [^68685a72]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Neurodegeneration is a pathological condition that predominantly affects neurons. It represents a large spectrum of disorders with heterogeneous symptoms and distinct clinical features. In addition to the devastating effects it can have on the affected individual, it constitutes a heavy burden to the society in terms of health care costs. Although the exact cause of neurodegeneration is not known, there are plenty of evidences supporting the notion that the immune system is strongly associated with various forms of neurodegenerative diseases. Given the numerous functions of immune cells, a change in their expression can either be beneficial or deleterious to the host. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes in neurodegeneration is therefore needed. This could facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets and provide effective means to dampen the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. The overarching aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the roles that the innate and adaptive immune systems play in the central nervous system, and to discuss their beneficial or detrimental effects during neurodegeneration. This paper also critically examines the contribution of immune and inflammatory-mediated responses in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyloid lateral sclerosis by illustrating key findings from animal and human studies.

### Principles for central nervous system inflammation research: a call for a consortium approach [^9d48ba8d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuroinflammation is now considered to be of pathophysiologic significance in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Nonetheless, there is no consensus as to what inflammatory mechanisms need to be combated (or facilitated), how therapies for them should be applied, or when they might be efficacious.

Methods

This article seeks to put forward cornerstone facts about neuroinflammation, with suggestions for future directions.

Results

Multiple scientific points about neuroinflammation still remain unaddressed. The main issue, however, is political. An expert body is needed that can sort through the myriad findings and provide consensus advice to agencies that fund basic and clinical research.

Discussion

Consortium approaches have shown immense value in other Alzheimer's disease research areas and are badly needed in neuroinflammation research. Lacking a consensus, neuroinflammation is just a very large number of isolated articles clamoring for attention.

### C9orf72 suppresses systemic and neural inflammation induced by gut bacteria [^7b68790c]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

A hexanucleotide-repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic variant that contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia 1,2. The C9ORF72 mutation acts through gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms to induce pathways that are implicated in neural degeneration 3–9. The expansion is transcribed into a long repetitive RNA, which negatively sequesters RNA-binding proteins 5 before its non-canonical translation into neural-toxic dipeptide proteins 3,4. The failure of RNA polymerase to read through the mutation also reduces the abundance of the endogenous C9ORF72 gene product, which functions in endolysosomal pathways and suppresses systemic and neural inflammation 6–9. Notably, the effects of the repeat expansion act with incomplete penetrance in families with a high prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia, indicating that either genetic or environmental factors modify the risk of disease for each individual. Identifying disease modifiers is of considerable translational interest, as it could suggest strategies to diminish the risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia, or to slow progression. Here we report that an environment with reduced abundance of immune-stimulating bacteria 10,11 protects C9orf72-mutant mice from premature mortality and significantly ameliorates their underlying systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. Consistent with C9orf72 functioning to prevent microbiota from inducing a pathological inflammatory response, we found that reducing the microbial burden in mutant mice with broad spectrum antibiotics-as well as transplanting gut microflora from a protective environment-attenuated inflammatory phenotypes, even after their onset. Our studies provide further evidence that the microbial composition of our gut has an important role in brain health and can interact in surprising ways with well-known genetic risk factors for disorders of the nervous system.

### Neurogenic neuroinflammation: inflammatory CNS reactions in response to neuronal activity [^50153eb8]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

The CNS is endowed with an elaborated response repertoire termed 'neuroinflammation', which enables it to cope with pathogens, toxins, traumata and degeneration. On the basis of recent publications, we deduce that orchestrated actions of immune cells, vascular cells and neurons that constitute neuroinflammation are not only provoked by pathological conditions but can also be induced by increased neuronal activity. We suggest that the technical term 'neurogenic neuroinflammation' should be used for inflammatory reactions in the CNS in response to neuronal activity. We believe that neurogenic neuro-inflammation maintains homeostasis to enable the CNS to cope with enhanced metabolic demands and increases the computational power and plasticity of CNS neuronal networks. However, neurogenic neuroinflammation may also become maladaptive and aggravate the outcomes of pain, stress and epilepsy.

### Peripheral inflammation is associated with micro-structural and functional connectivity changes in depression-related brain networks [^df4c27ab]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We tested the prior hypotheses that peripheral inflammation is associated with disruptions in human brain micro-structure and functional connectivity that co-locate with depression-related changes in functional networks. Our results supported these predictions and generated new hypotheses about how peripheral inflammation may perturb brain structure and function, and their role in depression.

### Neuroinflammation of the central and peripheral nervous system: an update [^0f4852c7]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Inflammatory disorders of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) are common, and contribute substantially to physical and emotional disability of affected individuals. Often, the afflicted are young and in their active years. In the past, physicians and scientists often had very little to offer in terms of diagnostic precision and therapeutic effectiveness. During the past two decades, both of these relative shortcomings have clearly improved. Some of the recent developments in clinical neuroimmunology are illustrated in this special edition of Clinical and Experimental Immunology.

### Shared mechanisms of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 and Alzheimer disease [^f95ae6ce]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had widespread impacts on global health, extending beyond acute respiratory symptoms to long-term neurologic and systemic outcomes. Growing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can initiate and exacerbate chronic neuroinflammatory processes, potentially accelerating the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), the leading cause of late-onset dementia and the fifth leading cause of death among individuals aged ≥ 65 years in the United States.

Despite extensive research, the cause of AD remains elusive, impeding efforts to develop viable therapeutic strategies for curing or preventing AD. Consequently, patients with AD experience an irreversible decline in cognitive function and loss of personal identity, ultimately succumbing to complications of the disease. Given the progressive and neurodegenerative nature of AD, recognizing early events that contribute to disease development and progression holds the greatest promise for identifying strategies to prevent and/or treat AD.

Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to AD pathogenesis, potentially influencing disease onset and progression. The increased risk for developing AD among individuals with proinflammatory conditions, such as recurrent infections, obesity, and multiple head injuries, points to chronic brain inflammation as a key driver of disease development and progression, irrespective of the underlying cause of inflammation. Importantly, aging, the primary risk factor for the development of sporadic, or late-onset, AD, is associated with chronic, subclinical inflammation in the brain, even in the absence of an identifiable infection or injury. This suggests that the role of aging in the development of AD may be attributed, at least in part, to chronic neuroinflammation.

Although aging remains a predominant risk factor for AD, it alone may not precipitate disease onset. However, age-associated neuroinflammation may heighten the vulnerability of the aging brain to additional insult, such as infectious disease, catalyzing the onset and progression of AD. Indeed, the increased risk for AD development and/or progression in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been posited to involve host immune responses to the infection, rather than the virus, itself, as suggested by the increased risk for AD development among individuals with existing subclinical inflammation in the brain or who carry genetic risk factors for AD. Notably, some clinical studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers new-onset ADand advances the progression of preexisting dementia.

### Inflammation and lithium: clues to mechanisms contributing to suicide-linked traits [^827838c2]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Perspective

Altogether, there is substantial evidence that suicidal behavior and individual impulsivity, aggression and depression are all associated with increased inflammation, which itself can be induced by stress. Thus, we propose the concept that stress activates GSK3 and induces inflammation, which, in turn, promotes the suicide-linked endophenotypes of impulsivity, aggression and depression-like behaviors. We speculate that different inflammatory molecules are produced following different types of stress and that different inflammatory molecules may mediate each of the behavioral outcomes, perhaps accounting, in part, for why not all suicidal patients exhibit each behavior. Furthermore, it is likely that differential effects of inflammatory molecules on the specific brain regions and neural circuits that mediate each of the suicide-linked behaviors influence the cumulative behavioral outcome, which also must be regulated by genetic and epigenetic characteristics of affected subjects. Identification of the inflammatory and behavioral responses to stress that are attenuated by lithium may begin to provide information about its mechanism for reducing suicidal behavior, and why it is not effective in all patients. Furthermore, we suggest that inhibition of inflammatory signaling and inhibition of GSK3 may provide mechanisms to diminish in tandem both the inflammatory response to stress and suicide-related behaviors.

### Inflammation and axon regeneration [^5a026edf]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The inflammatory response that accompanies neural injury involves multiple cell types and effector molecules with both positive and negative effects. Inflammation is essential for normal regeneration in the peripheral nervous system, and here we review evidence that augmenting inflammation can enhance regeneration in areas of the central nervous system in which it normally does not occur.

Recent Findings

Within the spinal cord, inflammation enables transplanted sensory neurons to regenerate lengthy axons and enhances the ability of a trophic factor to promote corticospinal tract sprouting. Induction of inflammation in the eye supports survival of retinal ganglion cells and enables them to regenerate injured axons through the optic nerve. These effects are linked to an atypical trophic factor, oncomodulin, along with other, better known molecules. Induction of inflammation within dorsal root ganglia, when combined with other treatments, enables peripheral sensory neurons to regenerate axons into the spinal cord. However, inflammation also has negative effects that impede recovery.

Summary

In light of the importance of inflammation for neural repair, it is important to identify the specific cell types and molecules responsible for the positive and negative effects of inflammation and to develop treatments that tip the balance to favor repair.

### Neuroinflammation after surgery: from mechanisms to therapeutic targets [^a2fca05f]. Nature Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Injury is a key driver of inflammation, a critical yet necessary response involving several mediators that is aimed at restoring tissue homeostasis. Inflammation in the central nervous system can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, some intrinsic to the brain and others arising from peripheral signals. Fine-tuned regulation of this response is crucial in a system that is vulnerable due to, for example, aging and ongoing neurodegeneration. In this context, seemingly harmless interventions like a common surgery to repair a broken limb can overwhelm the immune system and become the driver of further complications such as delirium and other perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Here, we discuss potential mechanisms by which the immune system affects the central nervous system after surgical trauma. Together, these neuroimmune interactions are becoming hallmarks of and potential therapeutic targets for multiple neurologic conditions, including those affecting the perioperative space.

### Changes in enteric neural circuitry and smooth muscle in the inflamed and infected gut [^85b31bd5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

Much of the morbidity associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and infection is caused by disordered gastrointestinal motor and secretory functions. Given that intestinal smooth muscle tone and epithelial cell secretion are regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS), it is quite likely that inflammation-induced changes in the enteric neural circuitry contribute to intestinal dysmotility and diarrhoea. Indeed, discoveries over the past decades have demonstrated that gut inflammation and infections are associated with changes in key elements all along the enteric neural circuitry from the sensory transducers, the enterochromaffin (EC) cells, to the terminals of motor neurones.

### Inflammation in the early stages of neurodegenerative pathology [^a4bf7f5a]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2011). Low credibility.

Inflammation is secondary to protein accumulation in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Emerging evidence indicate sustained inflammatory responses, involving microglia and astrocytes in animal models of neurodegeneration. It is unknown whether inflammation is beneficial or detrimental to disease progression and how inflammatory responses are induced within the CNS. Persistence of an inflammatory stimulus or failure to resolve sustained inflammation can result in pathology, thus, mechanisms that counteract inflammation are indispensable. Here we review studies on inflammation mediated by innate and adaptive immunity in the early stages of neurodegeneration and highlight important areas for future investigation.

### Neurogenic inflammation and the peripheral nervous system in host defense and immunopathology [^8a996221]. Nature Neuroscience (2012). Medium credibility.

The peripheral nervous and immune systems are traditionally thought of as serving separate functions. The line between them is, however, becoming increasingly blurred by new insights into neurogenic inflammation. Nociceptor neurons possess many of the same molecular recognition pathways for danger as immune cells, and, in response to danger, the peripheral nervous system directly communicates with the immune system, forming an integrated protective mechanism. The dense innervation network of sensory and autonomic fibers in peripheral tissues and high speed of neural transduction allows rapid local and systemic neurogenic modulation of immunity. Peripheral neurons also seem to contribute to immune dysfunction in autoimmune and allergic diseases. Therefore, understanding the coordinated interaction of peripheral neurons with immune cells may advance therapeutic approaches to increase host defense and suppress immunopathology.

### A body-brain circuit that regulates body inflammatory responses [^3f703c2f]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The body–brain axis is emerging as a principal conductor of organismal physiology. It senses and controls organ function, metabolismand nutritional state –. Here we show that a peripheral immune insult strongly activates the body–brain axis to regulate immune responses. We demonstrate that pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines communicate with distinct populations of vagal neurons to inform the brain of an emerging inflammatory response. In turn, the brain tightly modulates the course of the peripheral immune response. Genetic silencing of this body–brain circuit produced unregulated and out-of-control inflammatory responses. By contrast, activating, rather than silencing, this circuit affords neural control of immune responses. We used single-cell RNA sequencing, combined with functional imaging, to identify the circuit components of this neuroimmune axis, and showed that its selective manipulation can effectively suppress the pro-inflammatory response while enhancing an anti-inflammatory state. The brain-evoked transformation of the course of an immune response offers new possibilities in the modulation of a wide range of immune disorders, from autoimmune diseases to cytokine storm and shock.

### Depression treatment response to ketamine: sex-specific role of interleukin-8, but not other inflammatory markers [^03d0e6fd]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is the leading worldwide cause of disability, and females are impacted by depression at twice the rate of males. Depression can be difficult to treat, with one third of patients failing to remit following multiple interventions; this group is classified as suffering from treatment resistant depression (TRD). Unfortunately, there are no reliable clinical strategies for selecting an antidepressant treatment strategy more likely to lead to response. Elucidation of individual characteristics that predict and correlate with response to specific interventions is needed, directing clinicians toward treatments most likely to lead to response, while also providing information regarding potential underlying mechanisms.

Inflammation is implicated in both the pathophysiology and treatment responsiveness of depression –, and females appear to have differential behavioral and neural responses to inflammation. Higher inflammation is associated with poorer response to most antidepressant strategies –, and thus may be of particular relevance in the study of TRD. Interestingly, while higher inflammation has been associated with poorer outcome to many pharmacologic treatments for depression, the inverse relationship has been found for treatment responsiveness to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an intervention used primarily for TRD or other severe mood disorders (e.g. catatonia, psychotic depression).

Ketamine is a rapidly acting treatment now extensively studied for TRD, though relatively little is known about the relation between inflammation and ketamine response. Based on pharmacologic properties and animal studies, it is hypothesized that depressed patients with higher levels of inflammation may be more responsive to ketamine treatment, as supported by some, but not all treatment studies. Though an animal study has demonstrated the benefits of ketamine for behavioral symptoms elicited by an inflammatory challenge, the contribution of baseline inflammation or change of inflammatory markers to ketamine treatment response in depressed patients remains unclear.

A differential relationship on the basis of sex exists between inflammation, depressive symptom expression, and possibly depression treatment response. There is evidence that inflammatory profiles differ between depressed females and males, females are more affectively and neurally sensitive to the effects of inflammation compared to males, and inflammation is more robustly related with depression symptom profiles in females than males in cross-sectional studies. However, relatively little research has examined sex-specific differences in the association between inflammation and depression treatment response. One recent study found that elevated baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) was predictive of poorer antidepressant treatment outcomes in females, but not males.

### Inflammation and the link to vascular brain health: timing is brain [^8590e705]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammation and its myriad pathways are now recognized to play both causal and consequential roles in vascular brain health. From acting as a trigger for vascular brain injury, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, to steadily increasing the risk for chronic cerebrovascular disease, distinct inflammatory cascades play differential roles in varying states of cerebrovascular injury. New evidence is regularly emerging that characterizes the role of specific inflammatory pathways in these varying states including those at risk for stroke and chronic cerebrovascular injury as well as during the acute, subacute, and repair phases of stroke. Here, we aim to highlight recent basic science and clinical evidence for many distinct inflammatory cascades active in these varying states of cerebrovascular injury. The role of cerebrovascular infections, spotlighted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, and its association with increased stroke risk is also reviewed. Rather than converging on a shared mechanism, these emerging studies implicate varied and distinct inflammatory processes in vascular brain injury and repair. Recognition of the phasic nature of inflammatory cascades on varying states of cerebrovascular disease is likely essential to the development and implementation of an anti-inflammatory strategy in the prevention, treatment, and repair of vascular brain injury. Although advances in revascularization have taught us that time is brain, targeting inflammation for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease will undoubtedly show us that timing is brain.

### Neural upregulation in interstitial cystitis [^fbdd14b8]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a syndrome of bladder hypersensitivity with symptoms of urgency, frequency, and chronic pelvic pain. Although no consensus has been reached on the underlying cause of IC, several pathophysiologic mechanisms, including epithelial dysfunction, mast cell activation, and neurogenic inflammation, have been proposed. Despite multiple different causes of urinary cystitis, the bladder's response to cystitis is limited and typical. Animal experiments have shown upregulation of proteinase-activated receptors, tryptase, beta-nerve growth factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear transcription factor-kappaB, c-Fos, phosphodiesterase 1C, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase, and proenkephalin B. After the noxious stimulus has abated, downregulation of genes appears to follow. Distention of the bladder results in the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from urothelial cells, which activates purinergic P2X3 receptors. Activation by ATP of P2X3-expressing afferents is a fundamental signaling factor in bladder sensation and appears to play a role in bladder reflexes. Fos proteins present in spinal cord neurons have been shown to be upregulated in animals that have undergone cyclophosphamide-induced chemical cystitis. These and other findings suggest that neural upregulation occurs both peripherally and centrally in subjects with chronic cystitis. It is unclear whether neural mechanisms and inflammation are the cause of IC or the result of other initiating events. Neural upregulation is known to play a role in the chronicity of pain, urgency, and frequency and represents an exciting area of research that may lead to additional treatments and a better understanding of IC.

### The complexity of neuroinflammation consequent to traumatic brain injury: from research evidence to potential treatments [^04e2e1a9]. Acta Neuropathologica (2019). Medium credibility.

This review recounts the definitions and research evidence supporting the multifaceted roles of neuroinflammation in the injured brain following trauma. We summarise the literature fluctuating from the protective and detrimental properties that cytokines, leukocytes and glial cells play in the acute and chronic stages of TBI, including the intrinsic factors that influence cytokine responses and microglial functions relative to genetics, sex, and age. We elaborate on the pros and cons that cytokines, chemokines, and microglia play in brain repair, specifically neurogenesis, and how such conflicting roles may be harnessed therapeutically to sustain the survival of new neurons. With a brief review of the clinical and experimental findings demonstrating early and chronic inflammation impacts on outcomes, we focus on the clinical conditions that may be amplified by neuroinflammation, ranging from acute seizures to chronic epilepsy, neuroendocrine dysfunction, dementia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we provide an overview of the therapeutic agents that have been tested to reduce inflammation-driven secondary pathological cascades and speculate the future promise of alternative drugs.

### Sick for science: experimental endotoxemia as a translational tool to develop and test new therapies for inflammation-associated depression [^fa43a4f5]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Experimental administration of endotoxin to healthy volunteers offers a highly standardized translational model of systemic inflammation that has been successfully used to investigate the mechanisms underlying inflammation-associated behavioral and mood changes. It has been proven to be safe, well-tolerated, and without any known long-term health risks. The overlap of inflammatory, neural and affective characteristics in endotoxin-challenged healthy subjects and patients suffering from inflammation-associated depression emphasizes that human experimental endotoxemia might serve as a suitable tool in the quest to develop personalized and thereby more effective therapies for major depression.

### Exploring the relationship between neuroinflammation and… [^70e5ab1d]. stacks.cdc.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Details Personal Author: Description: The enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines accompanies brain injury induced by neurotrauma, disease or neurotoxicity as well as systemic infection. Elevations in proinflammatory mediators may serve as modulators or mediators of astroglial and microglial activation, cellular responses associated with all types of brain injury and collectively referred to as neuroinflammation. The "acute phase" response to systemic inflammation also leads to upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the brain in the absence of underling neural damage, responses thought to be mediated largely by microglia and that serve as the basis of "sickness behavior". Activated glia may have neuroprotective roles or may exacerbate neural damage. Exposure to the known dopaminergic damage followed by neuroinflammation.

Genetic and pharmacological interventions have resulted in partial suppression of the neuroinflammatory responses to MPTP and METH without affecting neurotoxicity and gliosis. In an attempt to achieve a complete suppression of neuroinflammation, chronic exposure to corticosterone was used. Surprisingly, mice treated with CORT exhibited an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response to METH coupled with potentiated neurotoxicity and gliosis. As the levels of chronic CORT approached or exceeded those associated with high physiological stress, the data suggest chronic CORT therapy or sustained physiological stress sensitizes CNS neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic responses. Yet, in a model of LPS-induced systemic infection that does not induce gliosis or neural damage, chronic CORT pretreatment greatly exacerbated and prolonged neuroinflammation without evidence of neural damage or gliosis.

These results show a priming of the CNS proinflammatory response to amplify future exposures to pathogens, injury or toxicity. Taken together these findings suggest that while neurotoxicity causes inflammation, neuroinflammation may potentiate, but does not necessarily cause, neurotoxicity.

### Inflammation and neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury [^60570089]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public health concern that affects individuals in all demographics. With increasing interest in the medical and public communities, understanding the inflammatory mechanisms that drive the pathologic and consequent cognitive outcomes can inform future research and clinical decisions for patients with TBI.

Objectives

To review known inflammatory mechanisms in TBI and to highlight clinical trials and neuroprotective therapeutic manipulations of pathologic and inflammatory mechanisms of TBI.

Evidence Review

We searched articles in PubMed published between 1960 and August 1, 2014, using the following keywords: traumatic brain injury, sterile injury, inflammation, astrocytes, microglia, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, reactive oxygen species, alarmins, danger-associated molecular patterns, purinergic receptors, neuroprotection, and clinical trials. Previous clinical trials or therapeutic studies that involved manipulation of the discussed mechanisms were considered for inclusion. The final list of selected studies was assembled based on novelty and direct relevance to the primary focus of this review.

Findings

Traumatic brain injury is a diverse group of sterile injuries induced by primary and secondary mechanisms that give rise to cell death, inflammation, and neurologic dysfunction in patients of all demographics. Pathogenesis is driven by complex, interacting mechanisms that include reactive oxygen species, ion channel and gap junction signaling, purinergic receptor signaling, excitotoxic neurotransmitter signaling, perturbations in calcium homeostasis, and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, among others. Central nervous system resident and peripherally derived inflammatory cells respond to TBI and can provide neuroprotection or participate in maladaptive secondary injury reactions. The exact contribution of inflammatory cells to a TBI lesion is dictated by their anatomical positioning as well as the local cues to which they are exposed.

Conclusions and Relevance

The mechanisms that drive TBI lesion development as well as those that promote repair are exceedingly complex and often superimposed. Because pathogenic mechanisms can diversify over time or even differ based on the injury type, it is important that neuroprotective therapeutics be developed and administered with these variables in mind. Due to its complexity, TBI has proven particularly challenging to treat; however, a number of promising therapeutic approaches are now under pre-clinical development, and recent clinical trials have even yielded a few successes. Given the worldwide impact of TBI on the human population, it is imperative that research remains active in this area and that we continue to develop therapeutics to improve outcome in afflicted patients.

### Contribution of systemic inflammation to chronic neurodegeneration [^892832b1]. Acta Neuropathologica (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic infection or inflammation gives rise to signals that communicate with the brain and leads to changes in metabolism and behaviour collectively known as sickness behaviour. In healthy young individuals, these changes are normally transient with no long-term consequences. The microglia are involved in the immune to brain signalling pathways. In the aged or diseased brain, the microglia have a primed phenotype as a consequence of changes in their local microenvironment. Systemic inflammation impacts on these primed microglia and switches them from a relatively benign to an aggressive phenotype with the enhanced synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators. Recent evidence suggests that systemic inflammation contributes to the exacerbation of acute symptoms of chronic neurodegenerative disease and may accelerate disease progression. The normal homeostatic role that microglia play in signalling about systemic infections and inflammation becomes maladaptive in the aged and diseased brain and this offers a route to therapeutic intervention. Prompt treatment of systemic inflammation or blockade of signalling pathways from the periphery to the brain may help to slow neurodegeneration and improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from chronic neurodegenerative disease.

### Pathophysiology of pain and mechanisms of neuromodulation: a narrative review (A neuron project) [^cf4e3d6d]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Various forms of pain arise from different sources: 1. Physiologic pain arises from surface irritation caused by noxious stimuli on skin receptors. 2. Inflammatory pain emerges as a response to tissue injury or subsequent tissue reactions. 3. Neuropathic pain results from a primary dysfunction within the peripheral or central nervous system. 4. Dysfunctional pain stems from malfunctions within the somatosensory system itself, lacking identifiable noxious stimuli.

The development of these stimuli arises from the response of these nerve fibers, triggering the activation of ion channels/receptors or the release of neurotransmitters. Inflammatory mediators are released following injury and inflammation. Consequently, these mediators interact with specific receptors in primary nociceptive neurons.

The heightened activity in nociceptors leads to the opening of ion channels and receptors, prompting the release of neurotransmitters from central terminals within the spinal cord. This process results in central sensitization (secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia). Abnormal expression of receptors and ion channels during chronic pathophysiological states contributes to atypical pain signaling, resulting in persistent pain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these events targets the modulation or altered functions of nociceptors due to inflammation or injury.

### Neuro-immune crosstalk in hematopoiesis, inflammation, and repair [^175a3645]. Trends in Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Innate immune cells are primary effectors during host defense and in sterile inflammation. Their production in the bone marrow is tightly regulated by growth and niche factors, and their activity at sites of inflammation is orchestrated by a network of alarmins and cytokines. Yet, recent work highlights a significant role of the peripheral nervous system in these processes. Sympathetic neural pathways play a key role in regulating blood cell homeostasis, and sensory neural pathways mediate pro- or anti-inflammatory signaling in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we review emerging evidence of the fine titration of hematopoiesis, leukocyte trafficking, and tissue repair via neuro-immune crosstalk, and how its derailment can accelerate chronic inflammation, as in atherosclerosis.

Background

Encephalitis is a serious condition accompanied by substantial morbidity. Although infections have long been recognized as causes, there has been growing appreciation of autoimmune aetiologies of encephalitis, most notably those associated with anti-neuronal antibodies.

Objectives

This narrative review focuses on points of commonality among clinical features, pathophysiology, and management of infectious and autoimmune encephalitis, while also noting important distinctions.

Sources

I identified studies, comprising research articles and reviews, that provide data on the epidemiology of infectious versus autoimmune encephalitis, and on clinical features that either co-occur or distinguish between them. In addition, I reviewed management practices, preclinical data, and clinical trials on the treatment of infectious and autoimmune encephalitis.

Content

I first discuss the clinical overlap between infectious and autoimmune causes of encephalitis, highlighting features and syndromes that can confound the diagnosis. I next turn to the pathogenic overlap between the two, exemplified by the development of autoimmune encephalitis with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor following a bout of herpes simplex encephalitis. Finally, I discuss management of infectious and autoimmune encephalitis, focusing on current and future avenues of treatment.

Implications

Although our understanding of causes of infectious and autoimmune encephalitis has improved considerably over the past decade, diagnosis remains challenging given the clinical and pathophysiological overlap between the two. Large multicentre clinical trials are needed to evaluate treatments that target inflammation and potentially benefit both.

### Inflammation in traumatic brain injury [^944640b7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

There is an increasing evidence that inflammation contributes to clinical and functional outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many successful target-engaging, lesion-reducing, symptom-alleviating, and function-improving interventions in animal models of TBI have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials. Timing and immunological context are paramount for the direction, quality, and intensity of immune responses to TBI and the resulting neuroanatomical, clinical, and functional course. We present components of the immune system implicated in TBI, potential immune targets, and target-engaging interventions. The main objective of our article is to point toward modifiable molecular and cellular mechanisms that may modify the outcomes in TBI, and contribute to increasing the translational value of interventions that have been identified in animal models of TBI.

### Cholinergic control of inflammation [^8ccebcd9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Cytokine production is necessary to protect against pathogens and promote tissue repair, but excessive cytokine release can lead to systemic inflammation, organ failure and death. Inflammatory responses are finely regulated to effectively guard from noxious stimuli. The central nervous system interacts dynamically with the immune system to modulate inflammation through humoral and neural pathways. The effect of glucocorticoids and other humoral mediators on inflammatory responses has been studied extensively in the past decades. In contrast, neural control of inflammation has only been recently described. We summarize autonomic regulation of local and systemic inflammation through the 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway', a mechanism consisting of the vagus nerve and its major neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, a process dependent on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit. We recapitulate additional sources of acetylcholine and their contribution to the inflammatory response, as well as acetylcholine regulation by acetylcholinesterase as a means to attenuate inflammation. We discuss potential therapeutic applications to treat diseases characterized by acute or chronic inflammation, including autoimmune diseases, and propose future research directions.

### Neuroimmune mechanisms in postoperative ileus [^2e796180]. Gut (2009). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common clinical condition arising after almost every abdominal surgical procedure, leading to increased patient morbidity and prolonged hospitalisation. Recent advances in insight into the underlying pathophysiology have identified intestinal inflammation triggered by handling of the intestine as the main mechanism. Not only does the local inflammatory process compromise the contractile activity of the handled intestine, but it also activates inhibitory neural pathways and possibly triggers inflammation at distant untouched areas, leading to a generalised impairment of gastrointestinal motility. Macrophages residing in the muscularis externa and mast cells are the key players in this inflammatory cascade. Pharmacological interventions preventing the activation of these immune cells reduce the influx of leucocytes into the intestine, an effect associated with a reduction of the duration of POI. New potential therapeutic strategies to shorten POI based on these new insights will undoubtedly enter the clinical arena soon.

### Contralateral neural tissue mobilization for cervical… [^7c822400]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Cervical radiculopathy is a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain characterized by neck and upper extremity symptoms in a dermatomal distribution. Neural tissue mobilization is an intervention shown to provide benefit for neuropathic pain presentations; however, some patients are unable to tolerate direct treatment of the symptomatic limb due to allodynia, hyperalgesia, or fear of movement. Early evidence from lower-extremity research suggests that contralateral NTM may produce therapeutic effects similar to ipsilateral treatment, but this approach has not been investigated in individuals with upper-extremity symptoms. It is characterized by pain arising from a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, with complex underlying biological mechanisms including neurogenic inflammation, immune dysregulation, demyelination, axonal loss, ion channel changes, and vascular alterations.

Clinically, peripheral neuropathic pain commonly presents with pain in dermatomal or cutaneous nerve distributions, a history of nerve injury or mechanical compromise, and symptom provocation during neurodynamic or palpatory testing. Cervical radiculopathy is a frequent and well-recognized form of peripheral neuropathic pain. CR most often results from intervertebral disc herniation or spondylosis, typically affecting the C7, C6, and C8 nerve roots. Patients commonly present with neck pain, upper extremity pain, and/or sensory, motor, or reflex deficits. Current evidence suggests that when patient presentation aligns with a peripheral neuropathic phenotype, interventions should be matched accordingly.

Neural tissue mobilization has demonstrated effectiveness in individuals with chronic neck and arm pain and is believed to exert beneficial effects through improvements in neuromeningeal mobility, blood flow, intraneural and extraneural fluid dynamics, inflammatory modulation, and graded exposure to movement. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this exploratory case series is to determine whether contralateral neural tissue mobilization produces immediate changes in pain intensity, disability, fear-avoidance beliefs, pain distribution, and neurodynamic mechanosensitivity among individuals presenting with clinical features of cervical radiculopathy. Findings may inform future research and contribute to clinical understanding of whether contralateral NTM is a viable treatment option in patients unable to tolerate direct treatment of the symptomatic extremity Behavioral: Contralateral Neural Tissue Mobilization

### Endothelial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease: is endothelial inflammation an overlooked druggable target? [^645911f9]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neurological diseases with a neurodegenerative component have been associated with alterations in the cerebrovasculature. At the anatomical level, these are centred around changes in cerebral blood flow and vessel organisation. At the molecular level, there is extensive expression of cellular adhesion molecules and increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these has been found to negatively impact blood-brain barrier integrity. Systemic inflammation has been found to accelerate and exacerbate endothelial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and degeneration. Here, we review the role of cerebrovasculature dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and discuss the potential contribution of intermittent pro-inflammatory systemic disease in causing endothelial pathology, highlighting a possible mechanism that may allow broad-spectrum therapeutic targeting in the future.

### Neurodegeneration and the immune system: lessons from autoimmune encephalitis [^38558d33]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurodegeneration is defined as a progressive loss of neurons and their functions, alongside the frequent deposition of intra- and/or extra-neuronal proteinaceous aggregates. A role for multiple non-neuronal cells in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders has been recently uncovered, with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and lymphocytes gaining the spotlight as initiators and promoters of neuronal dysfunction and death. For instance, recent studies have shed light on inflammation as a central inducer of neurodegeneration in AD, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Conversely, neurodegeneration has been demonstrated in primarily inflammatory CNS conditions such as multiple sclerosis, possibly affecting long-term outcome and cognitive sequelae.

Thus, inflammation and neurodegeneration appear closely intertwined in several neurological disorders. In clinical practice, it is crucial to correctly distinguish AE from neurodegenerative disorders, given that AE is treatable and prompt initiation of immunotherapy may allow substantial recovery, in contrast to neurodegenerative disorders where disease-modifying treatments are lacking. At the same time, research aiming to gain insight into AE mechanisms can help us shed light on the complex pathophysiological pathways linking inflammation to neurodegeneration. In this review, we provide an overview of AE manifestations that resemble neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting clues to suspect an autoimmune etiology, and summarize the current evidence on neurodegenerative mechanisms in AE, as well as the role of inflammation in neurodegenerative disorders.

### Harnessing immune alterations in neurodegenerative diseases [^0cca8061]. Neuron (2009). Low credibility.

Immune dysfunction, a well-established feature of neuroinflammatory disease, is increasingly recognized in neurodegenerative conditions. Its role is emerging as an early and active participant in neuropathology. Inflammation could be modified, with disease-slowing effects, by targeted interventions; it is also readily detectable and could serve as a source of valuable biomarkers.

### Paediatric obesity and metabolic syndrome associations with cognition and the brain in youth: current evidence and future directions [^cc3be6e1]. Pediatric Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

5.2 | Biological mechanisms

The biological mechanisms underlying the neural and behavioural correlates of obesity and MetS are not fully understood, but cellular and cerebrovascular mechanisms have been proposed. Low grade systemic inflammation contributing to IR is hypothesized to mediate the association of obesity and MetS with neurocognitive deficits. – Obesity is associated with increased visceral adipose tissue, which is generally associated with chronic low grade systemic inflammation. Inflammation has also been associated with IR and compromised endothelial function in animal models. While the mechanisms are not clear, it is possible that the inflammatory state leads to the disruption of the tight junctions between endothelial cells, which may result in infiltration of immune cells into the brain and increased production of local inflammatory cytokines. Several groups have reported an association between low grade systemic inflammation and structural brain abnormalities in the hypothalamus in obesityand MetSin adults. This effect is also observed in paediatric samples and shows an interaction with sex such that adolescent girls with obesity who have significant insulin resistance have smaller hypothalamic volumes than adolescent boys with obesity. Further, evidence in adults suggests that weight loss following bariatric surgery may reverse hypothalamic inflammation and lower systemic inflammation. However, other research in adolescents has demonstrated that low-grade systemic inflammation is not consistently associated with IR, suggesting that in youth, the relationship between adiposity, inflammation, and IR may not be as clear as in adults. Further research in children is needed to elucidate the relationship between obesity, insulin resistance and inflammation.

### A double-hit of stress and low-grade inflammation on functional brain network mediates posttraumatic stress symptoms [^30bce4b3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Growing evidence indicates a reciprocal relationship between low-grade systemic inflammation and stress exposure towards increased vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the neural correlates of this reciprocity and their influence on the subsequent development of PTSD are largely unknown. Here we investigated alterations in functional connectivity among brain networks related to low-grade inflammation and stress exposure using two large independent data sets. Functional couplings among the higher-order cognitive network system including the salience, default mode, and central executive networks were reduced in association with low-grade inflammation and stress exposure. This reduced functional coupling may also be related to subsequent posttraumatic stress symptom severity. The current findings propose functional couplings among the higher-order cognitive network system as neural correlates of low-grade inflammation and stress exposure, and suggest that low-grade inflammation, alongside with stress, may render individuals more vulnerable to PTSD.

### Fundamentals of neurogastroenterology: basic science [^7eef6124]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The focus of neurogastroenterology in Rome II was the enteric nervous system (ENS). To avoid duplication with Rome II, only advances in ENS neurobiology after Rome II are reviewed together with stronger emphasis on interactions of the brain, spinal cord, and the gut in terms of relevance for abdominal pain and disordered gastrointestinal function. A committee with expertise in selective aspects of neurogastroenterology was invited to evaluate the literature and provide a consensus overview of the Fundamentals of Neurogastroenterology textbook as they relate to functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This review is an abbreviated version of a fuller account that appears in the forthcoming book, Rome III. This report reviews current basic science understanding of visceral sensation and its modulation by inflammation and stress and advances in the neurophysiology of the ENS. Many of the concepts are derived from animal studies in which the physiologic mechanisms underlying visceral sensitivity and neural control of motility, secretion, and blood flow are examined. Impact of inflammation and stress in experimental models relative to FGIDs is reviewed as is human brain imaging, which provides a means for translating basic science to understanding FGID symptoms. Investigative evidence and emerging concepts implicate dysfunction in the nervous system as a significant factor underlying patient symptoms in FGIDs. Continued focus on neurogastroenterologic factors that underlie the development of symptoms will lead to mechanistic understanding that is expected to directly benefit the large contingent of patients and care-givers who deal with FGIDs.

### Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: an overview of inflammation-induced cellular changes [^b987eb66]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating disease that leads to poor neurological outcomes and is characterized by both vascular and neural pathologies. Recent evidence demonstrates that inflammation mediates many of the vascular and neural changes observed after SAH. Although most studies focus on inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, the ultimate effectors of inflammation in SAH are parenchymal brain and peripheral immune cells. As such, the present review will summarize our current understanding of the cellular changes of both CNS parenchymal and peripheral immune cells after SAH.

### Mitochondria and the link between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [^31bc415b]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

The innate immune response is thought to exert a dichotomous role in the brain. Indeed, although molecules of the innate immune response can promote repair mechanisms, during neuroinflammatory processes many harmful mediators are also released. Signs of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration represent a ubiquitous pathological finding during the course of several different neurological diseases. Interestingly, it has been proposed that mitochondria may exert a crucial role in the pathogenesis of both inflammatory and neurodegenerative central nervous system disorders. In this review, we describe the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation and mitochondrial impairment may synergistically trigger a vicious cycle ultimately leading to neuronal death. In particular, we describe the close relationship existing among neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial impairment in three different widely-diffused neurological diseases in which these pathogenetic events coexist, namely multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

### Cytokines as emerging regulators of central nervous system synapses [^6368c4d0]. Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

Cytokines are key messengers by which immune cells communicate, and they drive many physiological processes, including immune and inflammatory responses. Early discoveries demonstrated that cytokines, such as the interleukin family members and TNF-α, regulate synaptic scaling and plasticity. Still, we continue to learn more about how these traditional immune system cytokines affect neuronal structure and function. Different cytokines shape synaptic function on multiple levels ranging from fine-tuning neurotransmission, to regulating synapse number, to impacting global neuronal networks and complex behavior. These recent findings have cultivated an exciting and growing field centered on the importance of immune system cytokines for regulating synapse and neural network structure and function. Here, we highlight the latest findings related to cytokines in the central nervous system and their regulation of synapse structure and function. Moreover, we explore how these mechanisms are becoming increasingly important to consider in diseases-especially those with a large neuroinflammatory component.

### Neuroinflammation mechanisms of neuromodulation therapies for anxiety and depression [^1fc1c017]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Inflammatory biomarkers may serve as a reference for the evaluation of anxiety and depression and treatment selection. Neuromodulation therapy targeting neural circuit dysfunction to treat affective disorders by reducing neuroinflammation provides a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and objectively evaluates the efficacy of physical therapy.

### Role of IL-6 in the regulation of neuronal development, survival and function [^9753b64b]. Cytokine (2021). Medium credibility.

The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is emerging as a molecule with both beneficial and destructive potentials. It can exert opposing actions triggering either neuron survival after injury or causing neurodegeneration and cell death in neurodegenerative or neuropathic disorders. Importantly, neurons respond differently to IL-6 and this critically depends on their environment and whether they are located in the peripheral or the central nervous system. In addition to its hub regulator role in inflammation, IL-6 is recently emerging as an important regulator of neuron function in health and disease, offering exciting possibilities for more mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of mental, neurodegenerative and pain disorders and for developing novel therapies for diseases with neuroimmune and neurogenic pathogenic components.

### The role of astrocytes in CNS inflammation [^c523d60a]. Trends in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system (CNS), performing complex functions in health and disease. It is now clear that multiple astrocyte subsets or activation states (plastic phenotypes driven by intrinsic and extrinsic cues) can be identified, associated to specific genomic programs and functions. The characterization of these subsets and the mechanisms that control them may provide unique insights into the pathogenesis of neurologic diseases, and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In this article, we provide an overview of the role of astrocytes in CNS inflammation, highlighting recent discoveries on astrocyte subsets and the mechanisms that control them.

### Causes and MEchanisms foR non-atopic asthma in children (CAMERA) study: rationale and protocol [^f68c5553]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Childhood asthma is a major global public health burden with increasing prevalence in low-and-middle-income-countries (LMICs), and generally high (but varied) asthma prevalence across high-income countries (HICs). Asthma is now considered to be a heterogenous disease associated with multiple causal pathways that result in similar clinical effects including respiratory symptoms and variable airways obstruction. The mechanisms underlying different asthma phenotypes vary, and those associated with non-atopic disease remain poorly understood.

The concepts of atopic and non-atopic asthma have evolved since their introduction in the late 1940s by Rackemann, who referred to them as extrinsic and intrinsic asthma respectively. Atopic asthma (AA) is classified based on symptoms triggered by common allergens, and confirmed by serum specific IgE or a positive skin prick test (SPT) to relevant aeroallergens. It is often associated with Th2-mediated eosinophilic airway inflammation. On the other hand, the mechanisms underlying non-atopic asthma (NAA), remain unclear. While studies in the 1990s demonstrated elevated Th2 cytokines in some cases, non-Th2 pathways are also implicated, including neutrophilic inflammation associated with Th1 and Th17 responses and increased levels of IL-8, IL-17 A, and IL-1β in certain patient subgroups. However, there is often no clear evidence of any airway inflammation (i.e. paucigranulocytic), and, paradoxically, eosinophilic airway inflammation may be present. NAA can be exacerbated by triggers such as exercise and environmental exposures such as cold and dry air rather than allergens. Even though neural pathways, non-atopic, non-Th2 inflammatory processes and chronic stress are possible mechanisms underlying NAA, evidence for this is scant. This is likely to be because NAA has been relatively understudied; possibly due to high AA prevalence in HICs and the prevailing dogma over several decades that asthma is an allergic condition. However NAA is relatively common in LMICs compared to HICs. It is therefore important to understand the causes and mechanisms of NAA to identify potential risk factors and elucidate underlying mechanisms to enable the development of targeted disease management approaches in both HICs and resource-limited LMIC settings.

### The immunological response to traumatic brain injury [^b325a294]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in young adults in the developed world. The accuracy of early outcome-prediction remains poor even when all known prognostic factors are considered, suggesting important currently unidentified variables. In addition, whilst survival and neurological outcomes have improved markedly with the utilisation of therapies that optimise physiology, no treatments specifically modulate the underlying pathophysiology. The immunological response to TBI represents both a potential contributor to outcome heterogeneity and a therapeutically tractable component of the acute disease process. Furthermore, chronic inflammation has been linked with neurodegeneration, and may mark a bridge between acute brain injury and the subsequent neurodegenerative process seen in a proportion of patients following TBI. Given the complexity of the immune response and its varying functions ranging from repair of injury to bystander damage of healthy tissue, attempts at immunomodulatory intervention must necessarily be highly targeted towards the maladaptive facets of the inflammatory process. In this review we aim to provide an integrated description of the immunological processes triggered by TBI in both humans and animal models, in particular considering the interplay between the innate immune system, danger-associated molecular patterns and loss of self-tolerance leading to adaptive autoimmunity.

### Altered manifestations of skin disease at sites affected by neurological deficit [^1e529603]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The contribution of the nervous system to inflammation in general and inflammatory skin disease in particular has been underappreciated. It is now apparent that an intact neural component is required for the conventional clinical manifestations of many inflammatory skin diseases.

Objectives

To investigate the relationship between nerve damage and skin disease.

Methods

Previous individual reports since 1966 were collected systematically and the clinical observations described therein were placed within current concepts of neurogenic inflammation.

Results

We reviewed the literature and identified 23 cases of alterations in the appearance or distribution of skin disorders in patients with acquired central or peripheral neural damage or dysfunction. In 19 cases, near or complete resolution of pre-existing skin lesions occurred in areas directly or indirectly supplied by a subsequently injured nervous system. Exacerbation or new onset of skin lesions occurred in only four cases. The neural deficits described included damage within the peripheral or central nervous system resulting in pure sensory, pure motor or combined sensory and motor deficits.

Conclusions

These cases highlight the importance of neural innervation and neurogenic inflammation in the development of inflammatory skin disease and prompt further examination of the use of neural blockade as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses.

### Pathophysiology of pain and mechanisms of neuromodulation: a narrative review (A neuron project) [^6733f389]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Many of the drugs currently used for pain act to decrease neurogenic inflammation. Interestingly, opioids increase neurogenic inflammation by activating innate immune cells in the CNS. These inflammatory changes can also sensitize Lamina I cells to respond to non-noxious stimuli leading to allodynia. Vasic and Schmidt have studied hippocampal neurogenesis and have demonstrated that the inflammatory cytokines that are preferentially released in response to neurogenic inflammation can predict a patient's proclivity to develop chronic pain and can, in contrast, predict resilience to pain. These inflammatory processes can also initiate structural and functional changes that can lead to ectopic activation of nociceptive pathways.

### Inflammation promotes synucleinopathy propagation [^c8e8cd2c]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our current experimental system mimics the inflammatory microenvironment that triggers protein aggregation and other pathological changes, and we provide evidence that these phenotypes are led by microglia. These findings are in line with recent observations showing detrimental effects of immune cells and inflammation in synucleinopathy models. However, the opposite effects of immune cells have also been reported –. In the latter cases, immune cells adapted to the protective states, in which the scavenging activity was strong while detrimental inflammation was suppressed. It has become evident that the cells involved in brain innate immunity, including microglia and astrocytes, exist in many different states –. These cells may transform from one state to another, sensing the microenvironment. The mechanism by which these different states are switched is still unknown and remains one of the most important and challenging questions in neurobiology.

The results of this study clearly underscore the key role played by inflammatory processes in α-synuclein spreading. They also raise important new questions and suggest new pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of α-synuclein pathology. For example, during the development of proteinopathies, different aggregates with distinct conformations might generate different types of inflammatory microenvironments that would favor the formation of aggregates with corresponding structures. Another important question raised by the current study is how inflammation modulates aggregate propagation. One possibility is that soluble inflammatory factors released by glial cells promote the secretion of α-synuclein from neurons. Our recent study showed that TNF-α promoted neuronal senescence and secretion of α-synuclein through a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Another possibility is that the inflammatory microenvironment modulates neural activity, which in turn regulates the propagation of α-synuclein. Recently, Ueda et al. showed that suppression of neural activity using an antiepileptic drug caused a decreased cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein. This is consistent with the findings that secretion and uptake of α-synuclein is influenced by neural activity –.

### Inflammasomes in neurological diseases: emerging pathogenic and therapeutic concepts [^1f9ae907]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammasome activation in the central nervous system occurs in both health and disease. Inflammasomes are cytosolic protein complexes that sense specific infectious or host stimuli and initiate inflammatory responses through caspase activation. Assembly of inflammasomes results in caspase-1-mediated proteolytic cleavage and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, with initiation of pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death. Recent developments in the inflammasome field have uncovered novel molecular mechanisms that contribute to a broad range of neurological disorders including those associated with specific mutations in inflammasome genes as well as diseases modulated by inflammasome activation. This update focuses on recent developments in the field of inflammasome biology highlighting different inflammasome activators and pathways discovered in the nervous system. We also discuss targeted therapies that regulate inflammasomes and improve neurological outcomes.

### Persistent inflammation alters the function of the endogenous brain stem cell compartment [^82333004]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Endogenous neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) are considered a functional reservoir for promoting tissue homeostasis and repair after injury, therefore regenerative strategies that mobilize these cells have recently been proposed. Despite evidence of increased neurogenesis upon acute inflammatory insults (e.g. ischaemic stroke), the plasticity of the endogenous brain stem cell compartment in chronic CNS inflammatory disorders remains poorly characterized. Here we show that persistent brain inflammation, induced by immune cells targeting myelin, extensively alters the proliferative and migratory properties of subventricular zone (SVZ)-resident NPCs in vivo leading to significant accumulation of non-migratory neuroblasts within the SVZ germinal niche. In parallel, we demonstrate a quantitative reduction of the putative brain stem cells proliferation in the SVZ during persistent brain inflammation, which is completely reversed after in vitro culture of the isolated NPCs. Together, these data indicate that the inflamed brain microenvironment sustains a non cell-autonomous dysfunction of the endogenous CNS stem cell compartment and challenge the potential efficacy of proposed therapies aimed at mobilizing endogenous precursors in chronic inflammatory brain disorders.

### Ten unsolved questions about neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease [^234d73af]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease is a progressive and debilitating disorder that has so far eluded attempts to develop disease-modifying treatment. Both epidemiological and genetic studies support a role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Postmortem studies and experimental analyses suggest the involvement of both innate and adaptive immunity in the degenerative process. There is also some circumstantial evidence for effects of immune therapies on the disease. In the present article, we review 10 unanswered questions related to neuroinflammatory processes in Parkinson's disease with the goal of stimulating research in the field and accelerating the clinical development of neuroprotective therapies based on anti-inflammatory strategies. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Ketamine modulates fronto-striatal circuitry in depressed and healthy individuals [^dcea6d06]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Several inflammatory processes have recently been proposed to influence the function of this fronto-striatal circuit as well as motivational impairments in depression. Elevated peripheral markers of inflammation — as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) — have been associated with depression and with lower cortico-striatal functional connectivity. Experimentally induced inflammation in animals and humans has also been shown to cause motivational impairments and reduce striatal function. Inflammation may mediate motivational symptoms by dampening dopamine activity within reward circuitry, resulting in disrupted fronto-striatal functional connectivity. Inflammatory processes are therefore well situated to influence neural circuits underlying motivational symptoms. Interestingly, ketamine may affect dopaminergic function through glutamatergic downstream effects and may also influence inflammatory processes.

Although these studies lend credence to the hypothesis that fronto-striatal circuitry is important in ketamine's mechanism of action, this has never been directly tested. A secondary question is whether ketamine-induced fronto-striatal changes are mediated via inflammatory mechanisms. These questions were explored in the context of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ketamine in individuals with TRD and HVs that used rsfMRI to probe fronto-striatal circuitry and CRP measures to quantify peripheral inflammation. Given that ketamine has opposite effects on motivational symptoms in individuals with TRD and HVs, ketamine's effects on reward circuitry and inflammation — two important neurobiological mechanisms underlying motivational behaviors — may underlie these observations. The hypothesis was that ketamine would increase functional connectivity within the fronto-striatal circuitry of TRD participants but decrease it in HVs, and that these effects would be associated with ketamine-induced changes in inflammatory response.

### Neural regulation of hematopoiesis, inflammation, and cancer [^88732179]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Although the function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in mediating the flight-or-fight response was recognized decades ago, the crucial role of peripheral innervation in regulating cell behavior and response to the microenvironment has only recently emerged. In the hematopoietic system, the ANS regulates stem cell niche homeostasis and regeneration and fine-tunes the inflammatory response. Additionally, emerging data suggest that cancer cells take advantage of innervating neural circuitry to promote their progression. These new discoveries outline the need to redesign therapeutic strategies to target this underappreciated stromal constituent. Here, we review the importance of neural signaling in hematopoietic homeostasis, inflammation, and cancer.

### The neuroimmune response during stress: a physiological perspective [^de09ba3e]. Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Stress is an essential adaptive response that enables the organism to cope with challenges and restore homeostasis. Different stressors require distinctive corrective responses in which immune cells play a critical role. Hence, effects of stress on immunity should vary depending on the stressor. Indeed, epidemiologically, stress can induce either inflammation or immune suppression. However, in the absence of a conceptual framework, these effects appear chaotic, leading to confusion. Here, we examine how stressor diversity is imbedded in the neuroimmune axis. Stressors differ in the brain patterns they induce, diversifying the neuronal and endocrine mediators dispatched to the periphery generating a range of potential immune effects. Uncovering this complexity and diversity of immune responses to stressors will allow us to understand the involvement of stress in pathological conditions, identify ways to modulate it, and even harness the therapeutic potential embedded in an adaptive stress response.

### Brain inflammation and seizures: evolving concepts and new findings in the last 2 decades [^1ccbc824]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the animal models and clinical findings gathered over the last 2 decades confirmed the presence of brain inflammation in common epilepsies and shed new light on the consequences of this phenomenon for seizure generation and the associated neuropathology and comorbidities, also discovering some of the mechanisms involved. Importantly, the newly acquired data are reinforcing the early predictionthat drugs that modulate specific inflammatory pathways could be a new therapeutic approach for pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies. Indeed, repurposed anti-inflammatory drugs (ie, anakinra and canakinumab against IL-1β, tocilizumab against IL-6, adalimumab against TNF), as suggested by early work in animal models, are being used for rare epilepsy syndromes with encouraging results. These treatments could be extended to epileptic encephalopathies, refractory status epilepticus, or structural drug-resistant epilepsies either suspected or known to be associated with brain inflammation. Early anti-inflammatory intervention after diagnosis of pharmacoresistance may provide improvement of the human disease course as suggested by evidence of disease modifications. Preventative approaches will require refinement of targets and timing of interventions and await for prognostic biomarkers.

Overall, this field of research has progressed incrementally forward with breakthroughs mostly related to discovery of new pathways, and molecular and cellular mechanisms, and the first attempts of clinical translation based on experimental findings. Perception of the field for providing new treatments and biomarkers has increased over time among clinicians, and the enthusiasm of basic science and preclinical research for exploring novel targets or validating existing ones in additional models has not declined. Therefore, this field of research has gained further attention since my original Epilepsy Currents commentarywhich raises hopes for attaining a deeper understanding of this complex phenomenon and for new therapeutic interventions in eligible patients.

### Sick for science: experimental endotoxemia as a translational tool to develop and test new therapies for inflammation-associated depression [^69f81482]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Taken together, neuroimaging techniques can provide important insights into the neural pathways and physiological processes involved in behavioral and mood-related symptoms during endotoxin-induced inflammation. The above findings suggest that these symptoms are at least partially mediated by functional changes in subcortical and prefrontal brain regions. Importantly, the activation of these regions show a striking overlap to neural changes found in inflammation-associated depression, suggesting that the chronic alteration of these pathways by inflammation leads to the development of clinical depression. While there is some support for specific neural substrates of inflammation-associated depression, including alterations of ACC activity while processing negative affective stimuli, and inhibited activity of the ventral striatum during reward tasks (as outlined in ref.), future imaging studies implementing identical experimental tasks and techniques to compare behavioral and brain responses between healthy endotoxin-treated individuals, and patients with inflammation-associated and "typical" depression are suggested.

### Astrocyte barriers to neurotoxic inflammation [^72374f9f]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2015). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes form borders (glia limitans) that separate neural from non-neural tissue along perivascular spaces, meninges and tissue lesions in the CNS. Transgenic loss-of-function studies reveal that astrocyte borders and scars serve as functional barriers that restrict the entry of inflammatory cells into CNS parenchyma in health and disease. Astrocytes also have powerful pro-inflammatory potential. Thus, astrocytes are emerging as pivotal regulators of CNS inflammatory responses. This Review discusses evidence that astrocytes have crucial roles in attracting and restricting CNS inflammation, with important implications for diverse CNS disorders.

### Inflammasomes in neurological disorders-mechanisms and therapeutic potential [^c8cf7085]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammasomes are molecular scaffolds that are activated by damage-associated and pathogen-associated molecular patterns and form a key element of innate immune responses. Consequently, the involvement of inflammasomes in several diseases that are characterized by inflammatory processes, such as multiple sclerosis, is widely appreciated. However, many other neurological conditions, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, sepsis-associated encephalopathy and neurological sequelae of COVID-19, all involve persistent inflammation in the brain, and increasing evidence suggests that inflammasome activation contributes to disease progression in these conditions. Understanding the biology and mechanisms of inflammasome activation is, therefore, crucial for the development of inflammasome-targeted therapies for neurological conditions. In this Review, we present the current evidence for and understanding of inflammasome activation in neurological diseases and discuss current and potential interventional strategies that target inflammasome activation to mitigate its pathological consequences.

### Neurodegenerative disease and the neuroimmune axis (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and viral infections) [^7eccbe7e]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2004). Low credibility.

The appearance of activated immune cells and the accumulation of inflammation-associated proteins are common phenomena associated with neurodegenerative diseases. These inflammatory components of central nervous system (CNS) diseases have most often been described in the context of an immune response to damage and cell loss already occurring in the affected brain area. There has, however, been a renewed interest in how the neuroimmune axis might itself be involved in the etiology of these neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in cases involving slow, chronic, progressive neuropathology. This review addresses immune activation in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and brain viral infections that may be causative of, rather than responsive to, the observed neuronal loss in these pathologies.

### The neuroprotective role of inflammation in nervous system injuries [^a586d526]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The contribution of inflammation to the pathogenesis of several nervous system disorders has long been established. Other observations, however, indicate that both inflammatory cells and mediators may also have beneficial functions, assisting in repair and recovery processes. There is compelling evidence to indicate that in the injured nervous system, as in other tissues, macrophages are needed at an early stage after injury in order for healing to take place. Likewise, activated T cells of a particular specificity can reduce the spread of damage. This neuroprotective effect of T cells may be caused, at least in part, by the production of neurotrophic factors such as neurotrophin-3 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Interestingly, recent findings indicate that immune cells are able to produce a variety of neurotrophic factors which promote neuronal survival and may also mediate anti-inflammatory effects. Numerous cytokines are induced after nervous system injuries. Some cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IFN-gamma, are well known for their promotion of inflammatory responses. However, these cytokines also have immunosuppressive functions and their subsequent expression also assists in repair or recovery processes, suggesting a dual role for some pro-inflammatory cytokines. This should be clarified, as it may be crucial in the design of therapeutic strategies to target specific cytokine(s). Finally, there is a growing body of evidence to show that autoreactive IgM antibodies may constitute an endogenous system of tissue repair, and therefore prove of value as a therapeutic strategy. Available evidence would appear to indicate that the inflammatory response observed in several neurological conditions is more complex than previously thought. Therefore, the design of more effective therapies depends on a clear delineation of the beneficial and detrimental effects of inflammation.

### Value of the central sensitisation inventory in patients with axial spondyloarthritis [^ab7a3bd4]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is characterised by chronic inflammation, particularly in the sacroiliac joints and the spine, causing chronic pain and stiffness. This chronic back pain is considered the most important primary and early presenting symptom of axSpA, substantially impacting daily activities and health-related quality of life (QoL). Because pain is also considered an important indicator of disease activity, it is incorporated into the disease activity assessments Axial Spondyloarthritis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). ASDAS and BASDAI primarily rely on patient-reported items to assess symptoms related to disease activity. ASDAS additionally incorporates C reactive protein (CRP) levels as a biomarker of inflammation. To target inflammation, pharmacological therapy, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), is considered the cornerstone of axSpA treatment. However, pain and stiffness persist in 20%–40% of patients on long-term bDMARD therapy irrespective of the presence of inflammation. Consequently, it is hypothesised that non-nociceptive pain mechanisms beyond inflammation contribute to chronic pain in patients with axSpA.

Nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic pain represent distinct pain phenotypes. Inflammation is presumed to primarily cause nociceptive pain in axSpA. Neuropathic pain is a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system and nociplastic pain arises from altered nociception without clear evidence of tissue damage or disease or lesion of the somatosensory system. However, pain does not strictly adhere to these phenotypes; a combination is also possible, known as mixed pain. Within axSpA, chronic inflammation, for example, caused by proinflammatory TNF-α release, could result in neural hyperactivity, and therefore, be a potential source of developing central sensitisation (CS), whether or not remaining inflammation is present. CS is one of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of nociplastic painand is defined as 'an amplification of neural signalling within the central nervous system that elicits pain hypersensitivity'. Psychosocial factors play a role in the development and maintenance of CS, in which CS acts as a mediator between psychological factors and the experienced pain intensity. In patients with chronic low back pain, in addition to nociplastic pain mechanisms such as CS, psychosocial factors, including pain-related worrying, illness perceptions, depression and anxiety, are recognised as contributing factors to chronic pain.

### CNS remyelination and inflammation: from basic mechanisms to therapeutic opportunities [^f921687f]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

Remyelination, the myelin regenerative response that follows demyelination, restores saltatory conduction and function and sustains axon health. Its declining efficiency with disease progression in the chronic autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS) contributes to the currently untreatable progressive phase of the disease. Although some of the bona fide myelin regenerative medicine clinical trials have succeeded in demonstrating proof-of-principle, none of these compounds have yet proceeded toward approval. There therefore remains a need to increase our understanding of the fundamental biology of remyelination so that existing targets can be refined and new ones discovered. Here, we review the role of inflammation, in particular innate immunity, in remyelination, describing its many and complex facets and discussing how our evolving understanding can be harnessed to translational goals.

### The effect of inflammation and its reduction on brain plasticity in multiple sclerosis: MRI evidence [^f7af3c0c]. Human Brain Mapping (2016). Low credibility.

Indeed, experimental findings suggest that immune mediators, chronically over‐expressed in the MS inflammatory process, can affect the brain mechanisms underlying functional recovery by interfering with biochemical interactions, from a neuronal to a neurovascular level. Firstly, inflammation can influence the synaptic transmission, impairing the ability to encode and retain information [Di Filippo et al. 2014; Hauss‐Wegrzyniak et al. 2002; Min et al. 2009]. Electrophysiological studies support this mechanism [Mori et al. 2014; Nistico et al. 2013] and link it to clinically significant deficits [Mori et al. 2011]. Secondly, inflammation can damage connections between brain regions, hindering the spatial and temporal coherence of signal transmission [Allan and Rothwell, 2001; Di Filippo et al. 2008] necessary for plasticity to effectively drive recovery [Robertson and Murre, 1999]. Indeed, systems‐level plasticity relies on long‐range connections between brain regions. Damage to these connections occurs in MS [He et al. 2009; Petsas et al. 2013] and induces aberrant neural connectivity among widely distributed brain regions [Rocca et al. 2009]. Thirdly, inflammation can alter the neurovascular coupling [Girouard and Iadecola, 2006], a fundamental function of the brain that is the balance between energy demand imposed by neural activity and substrate delivery through blood flow, by interfering with the biochemical milieu that regulates the vasoactive chemicals supporting the normal neurovascular interactions.

As inflammation can interfere with brain plasticity in MS, its pharmacological modulation may restore plasticity by promoting desired patterns of brain functional reorganization. In this proof of concept study, we use advanced imaging methods to test whether brain plasticity is impaired as a result of MS inflammation and if a pharmacological reduction of inflammation through Interferon (IFN) beta may restore this plasticity. IFN beta reduces inflammatory activity in MS through a modulation of the pro‐inflammatory environment in the central nervous system (CNS) [Whitaker, 1994] that contributes to altered plasticity [Di Filippo et al. 2014]. In patients with MS, the effects of IFN beta on MRI disease activity can be detected 4 weeks after the beginning of high dose IFN beta [De Stefano et al. 2012], suggesting that an early anti‐inflammatory effect can be expected in patients.

### Roadmap for advancing pre-clinical science in traumatic brain injury [^9e34300d]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Accordingly, ample consideration should be given to the different aspects and timing of neuroinflammatory mechanisms that are likely contributing to both neurodegenerative and -reparative processes after TBI. To this end, accumulating evidence has provided a better understanding of the full spectrum of inflammation post-injury (including myeloid cells, lymphocytes, the microbiome, the vagal response, and spleen), and pre-clinical efforts with direct clinical applications have advanced these complex interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in the pathology and treatment of TBI.

Neuroinflammation persists in the brains of patients for years and even decades after moderate-to-severe TBI and is found in the presence of ongoing neurodegenerative changes, including progressive axon degeneration, white matter atrophy, tauopathies, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathologies. Although prolonged neuroinflammation (> 3 weeks after injury) has been observed in multiple pre-clinical models, including, but not limited to, non-penetrating blast injury, closed head injuries, and repetitive injuries, future pre-clinical work will be needed to continue to explore the chronic evolution of neuroinflammation and its potential roles in mitigating and/or promoting progressive neuropathological changes. This may provide therapeutic targets of specific neuroinflammatory responses across broad therapeutic windows of opportunity. For clinical translation, development of new tools and identification of appropriate patient populations (see Pugh and colleagues, this issue) will all be needed in order to effectively translate research findings in TBI-related neuroinflammation to the clinic. In sum, a number of studies have supported the use of pre-clinical animal models to define and target the chronic inflammatory consequences of TBI from single or multiple injuries, and this area merits considerable additional exploration.

### Development, maintenance and disruption of the blood-brain barrier [^a51f24c2]. Nature Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The interface between the blood circulation and the neural tissue features unique characteristics that are encompassed by the term 'blood-brain barrier' (BBB). The main functions of this barrier, namely maintenance of brain homeostasis, regulation of influx and efflux transport, and protection from harm, are determined by its specialized multicellular structure. Every constituent cell type makes an indispensable contribution to the BBB's integrity. But if one member of the BBB fails, and as a result the barrier breaks down, there can be dramatic consequences and neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration can occur. In this Review, we highlight recently gained mechanistic insights into the development and maintenance of the BBB. We then discuss how BBB disruption can cause or contribute to neurological disease. Finally, we examine how this knowledge can be used to explore new possibilities for BBB repair.

### Heat of the night: sleep disturbance activates inflammatory mechanisms and induces pain in rheumatoid arthritis [^f575dfb4]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Sleep has a homeostatic role in the regulation of the immune system and serves to constrain activation of inflammatory signalling and expression of cellular inflammation. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a misaligned inflammatory profile induces a dysregulation of sleep-wake activity, which leads to excessive inflammation and the induction of increased sensitivity to pain. Given that multiple biological mechanisms contribute to sleep disturbances (such as insomnia), and that the central nervous system communicates with the innate immune system via neuroendocrine and neural effector pathways, potential exists to develop prevention opportunities to mitigate the risk of insomnia in RA. Furthermore, understanding these risk mechanisms might inform additional insomnia treatment strategies directed towards steering and reducing the magnitude of the inflammatory response, which together could influence outcomes of pain and disease activity in RA.

### Modulating neuroplasticity for chronic pain relief: noninvasive neuromodulation as a promising approach [^8f71eca7]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of maladaptive neuroplasticity in chronic pain

Chronic pain is traditionally classified into nociceptive and neuropathic categories according to the integrity of the somatosensory nervous system. For nociceptive pain, prolonged or intense exposure to noxious stimuli triggers peripheral sensitization, characterized by changes in nociceptor thresholds and the upregulation of voltage-gated sodium channels. This peripheral sensitization leads to central sensitization in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It involves increased excitability, the recruitment of N -methyl — aspartate (NMDA) receptors and long-term changes in nociceptive circuits. Neuropathic pain, arising from damage or dysfunction within the somatosensory nervous system, involves distinct yet overlapping mechanisms. Peripheral nerve lesions cause ectopic activity in injured nerve fibers and trigger immune cell responses, leading to inflammation at injury sites. This peripheral inflammation signals to the CNS, where immune mediators activate microglia in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Once activated, microglia drive persistent changes in neuronal excitability and circuit function, thereby modulating pain processing through mechanisms of disinhibition and abnormal excitation. Prolonged microglial activation underlies a shift from protective to maladaptive neural plasticity, further reinforcing the chronic pain state.

The persistence of neuropathic pain long after the initial injury reflects fundamental changes in sensory information processing. Both nociceptive and neuropathic pain share common features of neural adaptation and plasticity that contribute to pain chronification. Importantly, these types of pain often coexist in patients with chronic pain, resulting in complex pain profiles that demand multifaceted treatment approaches. Central to this understanding is the concept of maladaptive neural plasticity: the nervous system's ability to reorganize its structure, function and connections in response to persistent pain signals, often in ways that perpetuate rather than alleviate the pain state. The development and persistence of chronic pain states are thus tightly linked to this neuroplasticity.

While neural plasticity is essential for normal function and adaptation, in chronic pain, it can become maladaptive, amplifying and sustaining pain signals. This maladaptive plasticity plays crucial roles in both the development and maintenance of chronic pain conditions.

Despite substantial advances in our understanding of chronic pain mechanisms, developing effective treatments remains a considerable challenge. In this review, current therapeutic approaches and potential new strategies based on the modulation of neural plasticity are discussed. By providing a comprehensive overview of maladaptive neuroplasticity in chronic pain, this review aims to stimulate further research into innovative approaches for chronic pain management and prevention. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing more effective interventions that can address the root causes of chronic pain rather than merely treating the symptoms.

### Neuro-immune interactions in inflammation and host defense: implications for transplantation [^e68625f1]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Sensory and autonomic neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) play a critical role in regulating the immune system during tissue inflammation and host defense. Recent studies have identified the molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional communication between the nervous system and the immune system. Here, we highlight the studies that demonstrate the importance of the neuro-immune interactions in health and disease. Nociceptor sensory neurons detect immune mediators to produce pain, and release neuropeptides that act on the immune system to regulate inflammation. In parallel, neural reflex circuits including the vagus nerve-based inflammatory reflex are physiological regulators of inflammatory responses and cytokine production. In transplantation, neuro-immune communication could significantly impact the processes of host-pathogen defense, organ rejection, and wound healing. Emerging approaches to target the PNS such as bioelectronics could be useful in improving the outcome of transplantation. Therefore, understanding how the nervous system shapes the immune response could have important therapeutic ramifications for transplantation medicine.

### Innate immune activation in neurodegenerative disease [^1dbbe5aa]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

The triggering of innate immune mechanisms is emerging as a crucial component of major neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia and other cell types in the brain can be activated in response to misfolded proteins or aberrantly localized nucleic acids. This diverts microglia from their physiological and beneficial functions, and leads to their sustained release of pro-inflammatory mediators. In this Review, we discuss how the activation of innate immune signalling pathways - in particular, the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome - by aberrant host proteins may be a common step in the development of diverse neurodegenerative disorders. During chronic activation of microglia, the sustained exposure of neurons to pro-inflammatory mediators can cause neuronal dysfunction and contribute to cell death. As chronic neuroinflammation is observed at relatively early stages of neurodegenerative disease, targeting the mechanisms that drive this process may be useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

### Increased inflammation and brain glutamate define a subtype of depression with decreased regional homogeneity, impaired network integrity, and anhedonia [^d17b0964]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Research on major depressive disorder (MDD) has been stymied by within- and between-subject variability. One approach to limiting this variability has been to identify patient subgroups based on pathophysiological processes such as increased inflammation –. Indeed, a distinct subtype of depression characterized by increased inflammation has been proposed. In the brain, inflammation triggers a broad array of neurotransmitter, molecular, neural, and behavioral effects –. For example, altered glutamate (Glu) neurotransmission in subcortical regions has been a key neurochemical target of inflammation in depression. Previously published data indicate that increased plasma concentrations of the systemic inflammatory marker c-reactive protein (CRP) among subjects with MDD predicted elevated Glu concentrations in left basal ganglia regions as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which in turn predicted greater anhedonia and decreased psychomotor speed, reaction-time, and information processing. Similar results were found among individuals treated with the inflammatory cytokine interferon-alpha –.

As to the mechanisms by which inflammation influences Glu neurotransmission, inflammatory cytokines increase spillover of Glu from the intra- into the extrasynaptic space by decreasing the ability of astrocytes to clear, buffer and contain Glu, while concurrently impairing mechanisms that remove Glu from the extracellular matrix. In addition, glial cells and trafficking macrophages increase surface expression of cystine/glutamate exchanger (Xc)-transporters that extrude Glu into the extrasynaptic space in exchange for cystine. Of note, these Xc- transporters release large volumes of Glu in dangerously close proximity to extrasynaptic receptor-binding sites. Finally, immune activation increases Glu-like molecules such as quinolinic acid, which can promote glial Glu release or impair its reuptake. Taken together, inflammation preferentially increases Glu in extrasynaptic compared to intrasynaptic locations. Extrasynaptic Glu freely diffuses into the extracellular space and binds to extrasynaptic N -methyl — aspartate (NMDA) receptors, leading to chaotic, noisy, incoherent signaling activity in the short-term, and synaptic toxicity by suppressing intracellular survival mechanisms in the long-term. Nonetheless, neural activity-based biosignatures associated with inflammation-induced Glu dysregulation are not well-characterized.

### Additive effects of depression and obesity on neural correlates of inhibitory control [^e9786627]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression and obesity are associated with impaired inhibitory control. Behavioral evidence indicates an exacerbating additive effect when both conditions co-occur. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Moreover, systemic inflammation affects neurocognitive performance in both individuals with depression and obesity. Here, we investigate additive effects of depression and obesity on neural correlates of inhibitory control, and examine inflammation as a connecting pathway.

Methods

We assessed inhibitory control processing in 64 individuals with obesity and varying degrees of depressed mood by probing neural activation and connectivity during an fMRI Stroop task. Additionally, we explored associations of altered neural responses with individual differences in systemic inflammation. Data were collected as part of the BARICO (Bariatric surgery Rijnstate and Radboudumc neuroimaging and Cognition in Obesity) study.

Results

Concurrent depression and obesity were linked to increased functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area and precuneus and between the inferior occipital and inferior parietal gyrus. Exploratory analysis revealed that circulating inflammation markers, including plasma leptin, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL-3 correlated with the additive effect of depression and obesity on altered functional connectivity.

Limitations

The observational design limits causal inferences. Future research employing longitudinal or intervention designs is required to validate these findings and elucidate causal pathways.

Conclusion

These findings suggest increased neural crosstalk underlying impaired inhibitory control in individuals with concurrent obesity and depressed mood. Our results support a model of an additive detrimental effect of concurrent depression and obesity on neurocognitive functioning, with a possible role of inflammation.

### Chronic neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury: Alzheimer disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or persistent neuroinflammation? [^c223cd4a]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

It has long been suggested that prior traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the subsequent incidence of chronic neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Among these, the association with Alzheimer disease has the strongest support. There is also a long-recognized association between repeated concussive insults and progressive cognitive decline or other neuropsychiatric abnormalities. The latter was first described in boxers as dementia pugilistica, and has received widespread recent attention in contact sports such as professional American football. The term chronic traumatic encephalopathy was coined to attempt to define a "specific" entity marked by neurobehavioral changes and the extensive deposition of phosphorylated tau protein. Nearly lost in the discussions of post-traumatic neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury has been the role of sustained neuroinflammation, even though this association has been well established pathologically since the 1950s, and is strongly supported by subsequent preclinical and clinical studies. Manifested by extensive microglial and astroglial activation, such chronic traumatic brain inflammation may be the most important cause of post-traumatic neurodegeneration in terms of prevalence. Critically, emerging preclinical studies indicate that persistent neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration may be treatable long after the initiating insult(s).

### A multi-modal MRI study of the central response to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis [^faa96284]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Conceptually, an acute inflammatory insult would be expected to impact established neural networks to promote short-term changes in behaviour — the classic repertoire of sickness behaviours. In RA, the transient surges in inflammation occur in the context of increased basal levels of inflammation, as well as many previous inflammatory events, especially if the disease has been poorly controlled. This means the neural pathways that transduce inflammation into behaviour and symptoms in chronic conditions such as RA likely involve a more fundamental pattern of reorganization. This distinction is suggested by studies that follow the administration of potent pro-inflammatory treatments in cancer patients: fatigue and lethargy tend to develop rapidly (i.e. within 2 weeks) while more obvious neurocognitive complaints do not appear until several weeks later. In the current study, we found an 'inflammation configuration' that was not particularly rich in brain regions meeting hub status — however, in individuals with higher ESR, these regions showed greater hub-like qualities, perhaps pointing to the hypothesized reorganization.

Cognitive processes supporting working memory, sustained attention and persistence through distraction involve complex interactions of neural networks. While the DMN is sometimes called a 'task-negative' network, it is becoming clear that DMN resources are recruited during complex tasks. It was recently shown that, as the complexity of a working memory task increases, the global modularity of the brain decreases, meaning that the brain's subnetworks are increasingly likely to change their configurations in response to the demands of the task. Furthermore, the DMN plays a major role in this network flexibility, and the nodes that make up the DMN, along with the DAN, and fronto-parietal task control network are some of the most likely to change patterns of connectivity in response to task demands. These are the same three subnetworks that comprise a significant portion of the configuration we find in the current analyses that become more positively connected to one another at higher levels of peripheral inflammation. It is possible then that the inflammation-linked changes in connectivity observed here serve a compensatory function — conscription of neural resources to perform normal cognitive tasks. This would seem to echo the overactivation seen in the aging brain during cognitive tasks. Though speculative, this network conscription mechanism would be consistent with an adaptive response to impairment that does not resolve within days or hours, as it does in studies of acute inflammation.
