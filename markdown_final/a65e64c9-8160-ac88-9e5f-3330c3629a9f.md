## Question

54 yo F with history of seizures on valproic acid, newly diagnosed with TB, started on standard 4-drug therapy (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol); now reports new-onset fatigue, confusion, mild jaundice, and rising LFTs after 2 weeks; neurology recommends switching from valproic acid to phenytoin due to possible hepatotoxicity — approve switch to phenytoin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether switching from valproic acid to phenytoin is appropriate in a 54-year-old woman with seizures who developed new-onset fatigue, confusion, jaundice, and rising liver tests after starting standard four-drug antituberculous therapy, and what the safest alternative antiseizure medication would be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely cause of the liver injury and whether valproate or the anti-TB drugs are the primary culprits. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic interaction between isoniazid and phenytoin and its clinical consequences. Next, I will evaluate valproate's hepatotoxic risk profile in adults and whether stopping it is justified. After that, I need to consider safer antiseizure alternatives with minimal hepatic metabolism and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise plan for switching therapy and monitoring, and state a clear recommendation with rationale.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and the timing, because that will anchor causality. The patient started isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol two weeks ago and now has fatigue, confusion, jaundice, and rising liver tests; this timeline fits drug-induced liver injury from anti-TB therapy, particularly isoniazid and pyrazinamide, which are well-known hepatotoxins, and the combination markedly increases DILI risk, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities or polypharmacy [^f9fbf88c] [^88724979].

> Wait, let me verify the competing hepatotoxin here. Valproic acid can cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, but the risk is highest in children under 2 years, those with mitochondrial disease, polytherapy, or congenital metabolic disorders; in adults without these risks, the incidence is much lower, and the timing of serious valproate hepatotoxicity is typically within the first 6 months of therapy, not after long-standing stable use, which makes valproate less likely as the primary cause in this 54-year-old after two weeks of new TB therapy [^29493bc6] [^1236bc21] [^0d10b471].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the drug–drug interaction that would make phenytoin dangerous now. Isoniazid is a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor and will decrease phenytoin clearance, leading to phenytoin toxicity with symptoms such as ataxia, nystagmus, confusion, and encephalopathy; clinically significant toxicity has been repeatedly reported when phenytoin is combined with isoniazid, and this risk is amplified in slow acetylators, which are common in many populations [^dd405710] [^38d40775].

> I need to ensure I'm choosing an alternative antiseizure medication with minimal hepatic metabolism and no meaningful interaction with isoniazid or rifampin. Levetiracetam is primarily renally cleared, not hepatically metabolized, and is not a substrate of CYP2C19, so it avoids the isoniazid–phenytoin interaction; it is also recommended as a first-line agent in patients with liver disease or when drug–drug interactions are a concern, and it has intravenous formulations for bridging if needed [^990cfa19].

> Let me consider other options briefly, but I should confirm they don't introduce new problems. Lamotrigine is hepatically metabolized but not via CYP2C19, so it avoids the isoniazid issue; however, rifampin is a strong inducer and can lower lamotrigine levels, potentially compromising seizure control, so if used, dose adjustments and closer monitoring would be required, which adds complexity during active TB treatment [^notfound]. Gabapentin is renally cleared and nonenzyme inducing, making it another reasonable alternative, though it is less broad-spectrum than levetiracetam for many seizure types [^990cfa19].

> Next, I should review a safe switching strategy and monitoring plan. I will taper valproic acid gradually to mitigate withdrawal seizure risk, initiate levetiracetam with a standard adult dose, and monitor seizure control and tolerability; given the active liver injury, I should check liver tests frequently and coordinate with infectious diseases or hepatology to manage the anti-TB regimen, which may involve holding or modifying isoniazid and/or pyrazinamide depending on severity and trajectory of LFTs, while ensuring TB treatment remains effective [^3f844cfc] [^99a3ab49].

> But wait, what if phenytoin is absolutely necessary due to prior efficacy or allergy considerations? I should confirm that if phenytoin is used with isoniazid, it requires very close therapeutic drug monitoring with preemptive dose reductions and frequent level checks, because toxicity can escalate quickly; even then, many experts advise choosing an alternative agent to avoid this high-risk interaction whenever possible [^dd405710] [^38d40775].

> In summary, I should not approve switching to phenytoin because isoniazid will inhibit its metabolism and precipitate toxicity; instead, I recommend switching from valproic acid to levetiracetam, which avoids hepatic CYP2C19 interactions and is preferred in the setting of liver injury and polypharmacy, with careful monitoring of seizures and liver tests during the transition and ongoing TB therapy [^dd405710] [^990cfa19] [^3f844cfc].

---

Do not switch to **phenytoin** because isoniazid inhibits CYP2C19, which increases phenytoin levels and risk of toxicity [^dd405710] [^38d40775]. Instead, switch to **levetiracetam**, which is not hepatically metabolized and has minimal drug interactions [^990cfa19]. If levetiracetam is not suitable, consider gabapentin or lacosamide as alternatives. Stop valproic acid now due to hepatotoxicity risk [^3f844cfc], and monitor LFTs closely during the transition.

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between isoniazid and phenytoin

Isoniazid **inhibits CYP2C19**, the main enzyme that metabolizes phenytoin, which increases phenytoin levels and toxicity risk (nystagmus, ataxia, encephalopathy) [^dd405710] [^38d40775]. This interaction is well documented and clinically significant, especially with prolonged isoniazid use.

---

## Hepatotoxicity risk with valproic acid and anti-tubercular drugs

Valproic acid carries a **boxed warning for hepatotoxicity**, with risk highest in the first 6 months and in adults on multiple agents or with hepatic disease [^1236bc21] [^29493bc6]. Anti-TB drugs — especially isoniazid and pyrazinamide — are also hepatotoxic; combining them with valproic acid increases the risk of severe liver injury [^f9fbf88c] [^88724979].

---

## Alternative antiepileptic drugs

Given the interaction and hepatotoxicity, **levetiracetam is preferred** because it is not hepatically metabolized and has minimal interactions [^990cfa19]. Gabapentin and lacosamide are also reasonable alternatives with minimal hepatic metabolism and interactions.

---

## Clinical recommendation

- **Stop valproic acid immediately** due to hepatotoxicity risk and the potential for serious liver injury [^3f844cfc].
- **Do not switch to phenytoin** because isoniazid will increase phenytoin levels and toxicity risk [^dd405710].
- **Initiate levetiracetam** as the preferred alternative, with gabapentin or lacosamide as second-line options if needed [^990cfa19].
- **Monitor LFTs closely** during the transition and throughout anti-TB therapy.

---

## Conclusion

Switching to **phenytoin is unsafe** due to isoniazid-mediated inhibition of phenytoin metabolism. Stop valproic acid and start levetiracetam or another non–hepatically metabolized AED, with close monitoring of liver function.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

General Information on Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.

Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, "Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease".

Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When valproic acid products are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^68a24e2e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to divalproex sodium tablets, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the Valproic Acid dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

WARNING: LIFE THREATENING ADVERSE REACTIONS

Hepatotoxicity General Population: Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate and its derivatives. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease. When valproic acid products are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.

Patients with Mitochondrial Disease: There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase γ (POLG) gene (e.g. Alpers Huttenlocher Syndrome). Valproic acid is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, valproic acid should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with valproic acid for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing. POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Simultaneous toxicities in a child on multiple anticonvulsants [^f8f5bc3b]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

It is rare to develop simultaneous toxicities while on anticonvulsants. This article presents a 3(1/2)-year-old child on valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenytoin who developed simultaneous hepatotoxicity and bone marrow toxicity during a parainfluenza virus type 3 infection. These toxicities resolved after the cessation of anticonvulsants, and her seizures were managed acutely with scheduled lorazepam. This article discusses the possibility that simultaneous use of valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenytoin could give this combination of toxicities and that concurrent viral infection may increase this risk.

### Prevention and treatment of tuberculosis among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus: principles of therapy and revised recommendations… [^59d0aa66]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

Because alternatives to the use of rifampin for antituberculosis treatment are now available, the previously recommended practice of stopping protease inhibitor therapy to allow the use of rifampin for TB treatment is no longer recommended for patients with HIV-related TB. The use of rifabutin-containing antituberculosis regimens should always include an assessment of the patient's response to treatment to decide the appropriate duration of therapy. Physicians and patients also should be aware that paradoxical reactions might occur during the course of TB treatment when antiretroviral therapy restores immune function. Adding to CDC's current recommendations for administering isoniazid preventive therapy to HIV-infected persons with positive tuberculin skin tests and to HIV-infected persons who were exposed to patients with infectious TB, this report also describes in detail the use of new short-course multidrug regimens to prevent TB in persons with HIV infection. Moreover, using a multivariate model that included age, history of previous TB, birth country, residence in New York City, and race/ethnicity, the investigators confirmed HIV-positive serostatus as a risk factor for resistance to at least isoniazid, for both isoniazid and rifampin resistance and for rifampin monoresistance. In retrospective studies, nonadherence with TB therapy has been associated with acquired rifampin monoresistance; and among a small number of patients, the use of rifabutin as prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex was associated with the development of rifamycin resistance.

However, the occurrence of TB relapse with acquired rifampin monoresistance also has been documented among patients with TB who initially had rifampin-susceptible isolates and who were treated with a rifampin-containing TB regimen by directly observed therapy. The mechanisms involved in the development of acquired rifampin monoresistance are not clearly understood but could involve the persistence of actively multiplying mycobacteria in patients with severe cellular immunodeficiency, selective antituberculosis drug malabsorption, and inadequate tissue penetration of drugs.

Paradoxical Reactions Associated with Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy During the Course of TB Therapy The temporary exacerbation of TB symptoms and lesions after initiation of antituberculosis therapy — known as a paradoxical reaction — has been described as a rare occurrence attributed to causes such as recovery of the patient's delayed hypersensitivity response and an increase in exposure and reaction to mycobacterial antigens after bactericidal antituberculosis therapy is initiated. Recently, a similar phenomenon was reported among patients with HIV-related TB. These reactions appear to be related more often to the concurrent administration of antiretroviral and antituberculosis therapy and occur with greater frequency than do paradoxical reactions associated primarily with the administration of antituberculosis therapy.

### Antiepileptic drugs and liver disease [^990cfa19]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Acute, symptomatic seizures or epilepsy may complicate the course of hepatic disease. Choosing the most appropriate antiepileptic drug in this setting represents a difficult challenge, as most medications are metabolized by the liver. This article focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of seizures in patients with advanced liver disease and reviews the hepatotoxic potential of specific antiepileptic drugs. Newer antiepileptic drugs without, or with minimal, hepatic metabolism, such as levetiracetam, lacosamide, topiramate, gabapentin, and pregabalin should be used as first-line therapy. Medications undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism, such as valproic acid, phenytoin, and felbamate should be used as drugs of last resort. In special circumstances, as in patients affected by acute intermittent porphyria, exposure to most antiepileptic drugs could precipitate attacks. In this clinical scenario, bromides, levetiracetam, gabapentin, and vigabatrin constitute safe choices. For the treatment of status epilepticus, levetiracetam and lacosamide, available in intravenous preparations, are good second-line therapies after benzodiazepines fail to control seizures. Hepatotoxicity is also a rare and unexpected side effect of some antiepileptic drugs. Drugs such as valproic acid, phenytoin, and felbamate, have a well-recognized association with liver toxicity. Other antiepileptic drugs, including phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, and the newer generations of antiepileptic drugs, have only rarely been linked to hepatotoxicity. Thus physicians should be mindful of the pharmacokinetic profile and the hepatotoxic potential of the different antiepileptic drugs available to treat patients affected by liver disease.

### A systematic review of second line therapies in toxic seizures [^8e14f82e]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Seizures are a common manifestation of toxic exposures requiring immediate and possibly ongoing management. Guidelines recommend benzodiazepines as first-line therapy for toxic seizures; however, there is a paucity of literature regarding optimal secondary treatment. We systematically evaluated the available literature for second-line treatment of toxic seizures.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from inception through August of 2018, following PRISMA Guideline. The MESH terms focused on identifying treatments for seizures induced by drugs or other potentially toxic substances. We excluded the articles if they involved animals, had seizures resulting from alcohol withdrawal, were case reports, or not peer-reviewed. Our primary outcome was seizure termination and/or suppression by the second-line agent as agreed upon by two authors. We used descriptive statistics for analysis.

Results

We identified six case series that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included case series contained nine to 235 patient cases each. The most common xenobiotic exposures were bupropion, isoniazid, and anti-psychotics. The description of seizure type and duration was diverse. First-line treatments were primarily benzodiazepines. Secondary treatments included propofol, barbiturates, phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. Patient outcomes differed, attributable to any of the following: mixed toxic substances, drug-drug interactions, inability to control seizures, or toxicity of the anti-epileptic drugs (AED) themselves. Few cases specifically discussed the success of secondary treatment administration to suppress or terminate seizures.

Conclusions

Available literature discussing second-line treatment for toxic seizures is of poor quality with high heterogeneity. Although the majority of articles used similar second-line agents, it is difficult to compare the efficacy of the regimens. Additional studies are necessary to identify the most efficacious second-line therapies in toxic seizures.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^fdff8b66]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects with immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment after a first unprovoked seizure in adults are reported to range from 7% to 31%, with no AED-related deaths or life-threatening allergic reactions reported; reported adverse events included psychiatric problems and were reversible when an affected patient is switched to another AED. Supporting studies note that initial AED monotherapy with either phenytoin or topiramate was associated with AEs leading to AED discontinuation in only 9% to 13% of patients, and another study found AEs were no more likely to occur than in untreated controls; overall, the conclusion is that AEs are predominantly mild and reversible and occur in approximately 7% to 31% of patients.

### Oxcarbazepine-induced liver injury after sensitization by valproic acid: a case report [^ccc635f3]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present case report is to describe a potential interaction between valproic acid and oxcarbazepine that resulted in hepatic injury.

Methods

We report the case of a 46-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder who was cross-titrated from valproic acid to oxcarbazepine because of liver injury.

Results

Initiation of oxcarbazepine four days after stopping valproic acid produced a significant elevation in liver enzymes that normalized with oxcarbazepine discontinuation and did not reappear with its reintroduction five days later.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that a longer washout period or another agent should be considered when transitioning from valproic acid to oxcarbazepine.

### Updated guidelines on the treatment of drug-susceptible… [^32629c21]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance The American Thoracic Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America published "Updates on the Treatment of Drug-Susceptible and Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: An Official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline" in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Dear Colleague Letter Dear Colleagues, Treating tuberculosis disease improves individual health, minimizes risk for death and disability, and reduces transmission of TB to others. On December 31, 2024, the American Thoracic Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America published "Updates on the Treatment of Drug-Susceptible and Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: An Official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline" in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

A panel of experts from ATS, CDC, ERS, IDSA, and We Are TB authored the updates, incorporating clinical guidance resulting from the results of recent clinical treatment trials, including CDC's TB Clinical Trials Consortium. The updated guidelines offer patients and health care providers shorter, safer, and more effective regimens with fewer pills and injections. Highlights Adults and adolescents with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB disease can be treated in four months instead of six. The panel recommends two months of isoniazid, rifapentine, pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin, followed by two months of isoniazid, rifapentine, and moxifloxacin for people aged 12 years or older. Most children with non-severe TB disease can be treated in four months instead of six.

The panel recommends two months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by two months of isonaizid and rifampin for children and adolescents between three months and 16 years of age with non-severe pulmonary TB disease. New all-oral regimens for multidrug- and rifampin-resistant TB disease shorten treatment duration from fifteen months to six months.
- The panel recommends a six-month treatment regimen of bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin for people aged 14 years or older with rifampin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-susceptible pulmonary TB disease.
- The panel recommends a six-month treatment regimen of bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid for people aged 14 years or older with rifampin-resistant pulmonary TB disease and fluoroquinolone resistance or intolerance.
- These regimens are also treatment options for people with an intolerance of rifampin.

The guidelines are meant for low-incidence settings where mycobacterial cultures, molecular and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests, and radiographic studies, among other diagnostic tools, are available on a routine basis. Directly observed therapy and integrated case management remain the standard of care. I encourage you to read the guidelines for information about patient eligibility, clinical evaluation and monitoring, and regimen administration. State and local TB programs, and the TB Centers of Excellence for Training, Education, and Medical Consultation can provide assistance and support in treating people with TB disease. Thank you for your work and commitment to eliminate TB in the United States. Sincerely, Philip LoBue, MD, FACP, FCCP Director Division of Tuberculosis Elimination National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.

### Valproate sodium [^dd4027c8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversion to Monotherapy

Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Valproate Sodium Injection therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.

Adjunctive Therapy

Valproate Sodium Injection may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Common drug-related adverse reactions — hepatotoxicity management during therapy includes stopping medication immediately if concerning clinical signs or symptoms occur and arranging clinician-directed evaluation; transaminases should be assessed and, if elevated, measured weekly until resolution or concern prompting gastroenterology consultation. Resolution of clinical symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities may allow rechallenge with the same regimen, but if abnormalities do not resolve after discontinuation or resurface at rechallenge, a different regimen not containing the suspected offending drug should be started. Many patients who eventually suffer severe hepatotoxicity had continued medications even after symptoms became apparent.

### TB-related MMWRs… [^468d48d5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

TB-Related MMWRs Background: Severe and Fatal Liver Injury Connected to Latent TB Treatment Guidelines for the Treatment Of Latent TB Infection Revised The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has investigated reports of 21 patients who were hospitalized because of severe liver injury associated with a two-month treatment regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide for latent TB infection. Sixteen of the patients recovered and five died. Findings from the investigations into these cases are included in the August 31 edition of CDC's. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reportpdf icon. CDC previously published findings from an investigation into two cases of severe liver damage associated with RIF-PZA. Only one of the patients recovered. These cases were outlined in the April 20 edition of the MMWR, at which time CDC requested reports of additional cases.

CDC and ATS Revise Guidelines for Latent TB Treatment As a result of these investigations, CDC and the American Thoracic Society are issuing revised treatment guidelines for LTBI to limit the circumstances in which the combination of RIF-PZA is prescribed and to strengthen the level of patient counseling and monitoring recommended for LTBI treatment regimens. For most individuals with LTBI, the new guidelines recommend the nine-month regimen of daily INH as the preferred treatment. CDC recommends providers use RIF-PZA with caution, especially in those currently taking other medications that have been associated with liver injury, and those with alcoholism even if alcohol usage is discontinued during treatment. However, with careful clinical and laboratory monitoring as outlined in the recommendations, RIF-PZA remains an option for patients at high risk of developing active TB disease and who are unlikely to complete a nine-month regimen of isoniazid.

For HIV-negative individuals with LTBI, the new guidelines recommend the nine-month regimen of daily INH as the standard treatment. While available data do not suggest excessive risk of severe side effects associated with RIF-PZA among HIV-positive individuals, providers should consider the use of INH when completion of this longer regimen can be assured. Patients co-infected with HIV and LTBI are at increased risk for developing active TB disease. Guidelines Emphasize TB Testing and Treatment for People at High Risk. The goal of testing people for TB is to find and treat those who have LTBI and are at high risk of developing active TB disease. Those at high risk include individuals with LTBI who are HIV-infected, were recent contacts of someone with active TB, injection drug users, and residents or employees of high-risk congregate settings, which include correctional facilities, nursing homes, homeless shelters, hospitals, and other health care facilities.

Furthermore, providers are reminded that treatment is recommended for foreign-born people with LTBI who have lived in the United States for less than five years and who were born in countries with high rates of TB. After five years, treatment decisions should be made on the same basis as other patients. Because all regimens for treating LTBI have been associated with liver injury, careful monitoring during treatment is important to avoid severe damage. Any additional cases of severe liver damage associated with treatment of LTBI should be reported to the CDC's Division of TB Elimination. These recommendations should not affect patients receiving treatment for active TB.

### Tuberculosis (TB)-adverse events… [^99a3ab49]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse Events During Treatment Patients on treatment for latent TB infection or TB disease should report any signs and symptoms of adverse drug reactions to their health care provider, including
- Unexplained loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, brown urine, or jaundice
- Persistent tingling, numbness, or burning of hands or feet
- Persistent weakness, fatigue, fever, or abdominal tenderness
- Easy bruising or bleeding
- Blurred vision or changed vision. Patients taking rifampin or rifapentine should be informed that they will notice an orange discoloration of urine and possibly other body fluids. This is normal. Patients should provide a list of current medications to avoid drug interactions. Some interactions to note:

- Isoniazid increases blood levels of phenytoin and disulfiram
- RIF and RPT decrease blood levels of many drugs including oral contraceptives, warfarin and some other anticoagulants, sulfonylureas, and methadone.
- RIF and RPT are contraindicated in HIV-infected individuals being treated with protease inhibitors and most nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Healthcare providers treating patients with the combination regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine in 12 once-weekly doses should.
- Inform the patient about possible adverse effects and instruct them to seek medical attention when symptoms of possible adverse effects first appear.
- Conduct monthly evaluations for the findings of treatment-associated adverse events.
- Order baseline liver chemistry blood tests for patients with specific conditions: HIV infection, liver disorders, postpartum period, regular alcohol usage, injection drug usage, or taking medications with known possible interactions with either isoniazid or rifapentine. Consider a baseline liver chemistry blood test for older patients on an individual basis, especially for those taking medications for chronic medical conditions.
- Conduct blood tests at the next clinical visit for patients whose baseline testing is abnormal and for others at risk for liver disease. Discontinue 3HP if a serum ALT/AST concentration is ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal in the absence of symptoms, or ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms.
- Be vigilant for drug hypersensitivity reactions, particularly hypotension or thrombocytopenia.
- In case of a possible severe adverse reaction, discontinue 3HP and provide supportive medical care.
- In case of mild to moderate adverse reaction, use conservative management, conduct clinical and laboratory monitoring, and consider continuing 3HP treatment under observation. Related Links For Patients

### Phenytoin toxicity caused by a drug-to-drug interaction between phenytoin and antitubercular therapy [^dd405710]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Phenytoin is one of the most used antiepileptic drugs. Isoniazid, a first-line antitubercular drug, blocks the CYP2C19 enzyme, preventing phenytoin from being metabolised. Concomitant use of phenytoin and isoniazid predisposes to phenytoin toxicity. Here, we present the case of a female in her mid-30s with a known seizure disorder on phenytoin monotherapy. She was also started on antitubercular therapy, including isoniazid, after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis recently. This led to a catastrophic sequence of events including progressive loss of balance, psychosis, nystagmus, hyperreflexia and later, stupor. Her serum phenytoin level was found to exceed 40mg/L. Her symptoms improved when phenytoin was switched to levetiracetam. Ours is the first case report of such an interaction in over 10 years and highlights the need to be extra-cautious while prescribing phenytoin and antitubercular therapy concomitantly, especially in a populations dominated by slow acetylators.

### Valproic acid overdose: case report and literature review [^61b5e7c2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Valproic acid (VPA) is a common antiepileptic drug that is also used routinely for various psychiatric disorders. VPA toxicity typically manifests as central nervous system depression, while hyperammonemic encephalopathy and hepatotoxicity are potentially life-threatening complications.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 56-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after an intentional VPA overdose, was found to have hyperammonemia, and was treated with L-carnitine exclusively. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital for monitoring and serial laboratory testing. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although VPA toxicity has conventionally been managed by gastric decontamination, L-carnitine, and, in severe and refractory cases, extracorporeal removal, recent literature supports the use of carbapenem antibiotics, particularly meropenem. Thus, we report the details of current treatment modalities for VPA toxicity by reviewing current literature.

### Valproic acid management of acute alcohol withdrawal [^d1c3cf3c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of valproic acid in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-February 2006), EMBASE (1980-February 2006), and PubMed (1966-February 2006) searches identified pertinent studies that were conducted in humans and published in English. Key words used for identification of articles included valproic acid, ethanol, alcohol, alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol withdrawal seizures, and substance withdrawal syndrome. References of identified articles were manually searched.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of valproic acid for the management of AWS in humans were included.

Data Synthesis

Comparisons were made among various regimens of valproic acid and traditional therapy with benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine agents. Only 2 of 6 trials reported a statistically significant difference in favor of valproic acid on endpoints of AWS. However, these differences were of marginal clinical significance. The number of patients included in these studies did not allow for adequate evaluation of safety.

Conclusions

The existing limited efficacy and safety data suggest that valproic acid should not replace conventional therapy or be used as adjunct therapy for management of mild-to-moderate AWS.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^665cce9c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1

The second study assessed the capacity of divalproex sodium to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. The study compared the incidence of CPS among patients randomized to either a high or low dose treatment arm. Patients qualified for entry into the randomized comparison phase of this study only if 1) they continued to experience 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8 to 12 week long period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or primidone) and 2) they made a successful transition over a two week interval to divalproex sodium. Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50% of the patients randomized, however, completed the study. In patients converted to divalproex sodium monotherapy, the mean total valproate concentrations during monotherapy were 71 and 123 mcg/mL in the low dose and high dose groups, respectively.

The following Table presents the findings for all patients randomized who had at least one post-randomization assessment.

Figure 2 presents the proportion of patients (X axis) whose percentage reduction from baseline in complex partial seizure rates was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the monotherapy study. A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for a more effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for a less effective treatment. This Figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction was consistently higher for high dose divalproex sodium than for low dose divalproex sodium. For example, when switching from carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone monotherapy to high dose divalproex sodium monotherapy, 63% of patients experienced no change or a reduction in complex partial seizure rates compared to 54% of patients receiving low dose divalproex sodium.

### Valproic acid [^1236bc21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of valproic acid PO:
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of life-threatening pancreatitis.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of hepatic failure. Obtain LFTs before treatment and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first 6 months. Use extreme caution in pediatric patients aged < 2 years, especially with congenital metabolic disorders, severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, organic brain disease, or receiving multiple anticonvulsants. Do not use in patients with mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ and in children < 2 years of age with suspected mitochondrial disorder.
- **Neural tube defects**: the use of valproic acid during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, other structural abnormalities (craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations), neurodevelopmental disorders, and decreased IQ. Do not use valproic acid for epilepsy or bipolar disorder in pregnant patients or patients contemplating pregnancy unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. Do not use valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis in pregnant patients and in female patients of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. Do not use valproic acid in females of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^ce8a07bb]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Post-traumatic seizure (PTS) prophylaxis in TBI — Levetiracetam is an ASM with a better pharmacokinetic profile and minimal ADRs relative to phenytoin, but behavioral ADRs were observed in pediatric and adult patients, particularly those with TBI, and pyridoxine 50–100 mg daily supplementation may limit these behavioral ADRs. Valproic acid is not recommended for early PTS prophylaxis due to an increased risk of death compared to phenytoin. Do not continue PTS prophylaxis for more than 7 days in patients with no clinical or EEG seizure activity or with seizure activity only within the first 24 hours postinjury, and seizure prophylaxis may be continued if seizure activity occurs beyond 24 hours or if the patient was previously receiving medication for a known seizure disorder.

### Valproate sodium [^70f0663f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General Information on Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.

Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, "Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease".

Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When Valproate Sodium Injection is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Use of Valproate Sodium Injection has not been studied in children below the age of 2 years.

In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^fc17414a]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked first seizure in adults — evidence gaps in antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy and discontinuation are noted. Existing studies of AED adverse events (AEs) use mostly older AEDs, and the text states that updated studies utilizing newer AEDs for initial therapy are warranted and encouraged. Research on AED discontinuation after a first unprovoked seizure or recurrence is also lacking. It is important for patients to appreciate how long they may need to be on an AED and the risks of AED discontinuation to help guide decision-making about AED initiation, and there are some data from mixed patient groups that may not apply to individuals who experience only an initial seizure; therefore, further studies are warranted.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1e9afb3f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — states gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient's ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder; if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives; and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, with the instruction that before using an adjunct clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. It also states valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential and that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The discussion adds that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium; it notes carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and that gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment.

### Phenytoin versus valproate monotherapy for partial onset seizures and generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures [^73c328db]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the previously published Cochrane review (Issue 4, 2009)Worldwide, phenytoin and valproate are commonly used antiepileptic drugs. It is generally believed that phenytoin is more effective for partial onset seizures, and that valproate is more effective for generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types.

Objectives

To review the best evidence comparing phenytoin and valproate when used as monotherapy in individuals with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (19 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, The Cochrane Library, January 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to 18 February 2013), SCOPUS (19 February 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (19 February 2013), and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (19 February 2013). We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of valproate monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual patient data review. Outcomes were time to (a) treatment withdrawal (b) 12-month remission (c) six-month remission and (d) first seizure post randomisation. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with the generic inverse variance method used to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

Individual patient data were available for 669 individuals out of 1119 eligible individuals from five out of 11 trials, 60% of the potential data. Results apply to generalised tonic-clonic seizures, but not absence or myoclonus seizure types. For remission outcomes, HR > 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes HR > 1 indicates an advantage for valproateThe main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type, 95% CI) were time to (a) withdrawal of allocated treatment 1.09 (0.76 to 1.55); (b) 12-month remission 0.98 (0.78 to 1.23); (c) six-month remission 0.95 (0.78 to 1.15) and (d) first seizure 0.93 (0.75 to 1.14). The results suggest no overall difference between the drugs for these outcomes. No statistical interaction between treatment and seizure type (partial versus generalised) was found, but misclassification of seizure type may have confounded the results of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between phenytoin and valproate for the outcomes examined in this review. However misclassification of seizure type may have confounded the results of this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus seizure types. No outright evidence was found to support or refute current treatment policies.

### Valproate sodium [^a4344d92]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance

Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.

In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.

Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.

The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

Aspirin

A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate.

Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The β-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin. Caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.

Carbapenem Antibiotics

A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

### Extended phenytoin sodium [^699564ea]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

General:

The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.

A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be due to limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined.

Phenytoin should be discontinued if a skin rash appears (see WARNINGS section regarding drug discontinuation). If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous or if lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS section.) If the rash is of a milder type (measles-like or scarlatiniform), therapy may be resumed after the rash has completely disappeared. If the rash recurs upon reinstitution of therapy, further phenytoin medication is contraindicated.

Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Additionally, caution should be exercised if using structurally similar compounds (eg, barbiturates, succinimides, oxazolidinediones, and other related compounds) in these same patients.

Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients.

Osteomalacia has been associated with phenytoin therapy and is considered to be due to phenytoin's interference with vitamin D metabolism.

Phenytoin is not indicated for seizures due to hypoglycemic or other metabolic causes. Appropriate diagnostic procedures should be performed as indicated.

Phenytoin is not effective for absence (petit mal) seizures. If tonic-clonic (grand mal) and absence (petit mal) seizures are present, combined drug therapy is needed.

Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the optimal range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, plasma levels are recommended. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if plasma levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended. (See WARNINGS section.)

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^78bc4c32]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — reports that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium. Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and are appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contraindication. Gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment, improving rates of abstinence and reducing heavy drinking days compared with placebo during the maintenance phase. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an appropriate therapy for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal. While valproic acid is promising, more evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy; its use as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is supported, and it should not be used in patients with hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment or in women of childbearing potential because of teratogenic risk.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see Boxed Warning]. When Valproic Acid is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2 years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.

Younger children, especially those receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.

The variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid concentrations. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors that affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding.

Pediatric Clinical Trials

Divalproex sodium was studied in seven pediatric clinical trials.

Two of the pediatric studies were double-blinded placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of divalproex sodium ER for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on divalproex sodium ER) and migraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on divalproex sodium ER). Efficacy was not established for either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania. The most common drug-related adverse reactions (reported > 5% and twice the rate of placebo) reported in the controlled pediatric mania study were nausea, upper abdominal pain, somnolence, increased ammonia, gastritis and rash.

### Valproic acid-associated vanishing bile duct syndrome [^ded9410d]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatotoxicity as a result of valproic acid therapy is well documented. Elevation in aminotransferase activities is rarely associated with symptoms. It sometimes manifests as acute liver failure. Here, we report a 8-year-old girl who was referred for unresolving jaundice and itching for 3 months. Past history revealed afebrile convulsion 5 months previously and beginning of valproic acid treatment. Valproic acid was discontinued after the development of jaundice. Physical examination revealed ichterus, xanthomas on extensor surfaces of extremities, and hepatomegaly without any sign of chronic liver disease. Total and direct bilirubin levels were 20.2 and 12.9 mg/dL, respectively. Enzyme activities indicating cholestasis were increased together with blood cholesterol. Tests for infectious and autoimmune, metabolic, and genetic disorders were not informative. Liver biopsy revealed portal inflammation, severe bile duct loss, and cholestasis. The patient was considered to have valproic acid-associated vanishing bile duct syndrome, which has not been reported previously.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^0e9185c9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate.

Phenytoin

Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin. Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate. Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.

In patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the combination of valproate and phenytoin. The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by the clinical situation.

Propofol

The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol. Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate. Monitor patients closely for signs of increased sedation or cardiorespiratory depression.

Rufinamide

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate. Rufinamide concentrations were increased by < 16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate). Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).

Antiepileptic drug (AED)–antiretroviral agent (ARV) interactions — abstract results and recommendations state that AED-ARV administration may be indicated in up to 55% of people taking ARVs. Patients receiving phenytoin may require a lopinavir/ritonavir dosage increase of ~50% to maintain unchanged serum concentrations (Level C), and patients receiving valproic acid may require a zidovudine dosage reduction to maintain unchanged serum zidovudine concentrations (Level C). Coadministration of valproic acid and efavirenz may not require efavirenz dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients receiving ritonavir/atazanavir may require a lamotrigine dosage increase of ~50% to maintain unchanged lamotrigine serum concentrations (Level C), whereas coadministration of raltegravir/atazanavir and lamotrigine may not require lamotrigine dosage adjustment (Level C). Coadministration of raltegravir and midazolam may not require midazolam dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients may be counseled that it is unclear whether dosage adjustment is necessary when other AEDs and ARVs are used or changed (Level U). It may be important to avoid enzyme-inducing AEDs in people on ARV regimens that include protease inhibitors or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as pharmacokinetic interactions may result in virologic failure, which has clinical implications for disease progression and development of ARV resistance; if such regimens are required for seizure control, patients may be monitored through pharmacokinetic assessments to ensure efficacy of the ARV regimen (Level C).

Status epilepticus pharmacotherapy — prospective nonrandomized studies report seizure control with valproate, phenytoin, and levetiracetam with specified dosing and time-to-cessation outcomes. Patients with refractory convulsive status epilepticus who failed IV diazepam and IM phenobarbital were given valproate 30 mg/kg IV at 6 mg/kg/h, with cessation of motor activity within 1 h of starting infusion and valproate controlled seizures within 1 h in 88% (95% CI 78% to 97%). In a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, controlled study of patients with status epilepticus or acute repetitive seizures receiving either IV phenytoin 18 mg/kg or valproate 30 mg/kg, the outcome was cessation of seizures within 20 min and enrolled 74 patients, with control of seizures in 88% regardless of treatment group. In a prospective nonrandomized trial assigning refractory status epilepticus to IV valproate 30 mg/kg vs levetiracetam 30 mg/kg, with cessation of seizure (electroencephalogram [EEG]) after infusion as the outcome, 82 patients entered, with equal efficacy between the 2 treatments; valproate 68% vs levetiracetam 73%.

Urgent control therapy selection for status epilepticus — preferred top tier agents "are IV fosphenytoin/phenytoin, valproate sodium, phenobarbital, levetiracetam, or continuous infusion midazolam". Among these, "fosphenytoin may be preferred for most patients with the exception of patients (particularly children) with a history of primary generalized epilepsy, where valproate sodium would be the best choice". The general principle is "rapid administration of an AED that will quickly reach a therapeutic level requires selection of an intravenously administered compound", and "it is reasonable to provide an IV bolus of this AED, if available, prior to initiating an additional agent", which "may include additional boluses that will result in higher than normal target concentrations of the AED to achieve the desired therapeutic response (i.e., cessation of seizure activity)".

### Clinically important drug interactions in epilepsy: interactions between antiepileptic drugs and other drugs [^38d40775]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly prescribed for long periods, up to a lifetime, and many patients will require treatment with other agents for the management of concomitant or intercurrent conditions. When two or more drugs are prescribed together, clinically important interactions can occur. Among old-generation AEDs, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone are potent inducers of hepatic enzymes, and decrease the plasma concentration of many psychotropic, immunosuppressant, antineoplastic, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular drugs, as well as oral contraceptive steroids. Most new generation AEDs do not have clinically important enzyme inducing effects. Other drugs can affect the pharmacokinetics of AEDs; examples include the stimulation of lamotrigine metabolism by oral contraceptive steroids and the inhibition of carbamazepine metabolism by certain macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, verapamil, diltiazem, and isoniazid. Careful monitoring of clinical response is recommended whenever a drug is added or removed from a patient's AED regimen.

### The pharmacogenomics of valproic acid [^af855a54]. Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Adverse effects of valproic acid are rare, but hepatotoxicity is severe in particular in those younger than 2 years old and polytherapy. During valproic acid treatment, it is difficult for prescribers to predict its individual response. Recent advances in the field of pharmacogenomics have indicated variants of candidate genes that affect valproic acid efficacy and safety. In this review, a large number of candidate genes that influence valproic acid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are discussed, including metabolic enzymes, drug transporters, neurotransmitters and drug targets. Furthermore, pharmacogenomics is an important tool not only in further understanding of interindividual variability but also to assess the therapeutic potential of such variability in drug individualization and therapeutic optimization.

Severe traumatic brain injury — valproate versus phenytoin/placebo for PTS prevention: A randomized, double-blinded study compared phenytoin to valproate for early PTS and valproate to placebo for late PTS; the incidence of early PTS was similar with either valproate or phenytoin. Late PTS incidence was similar among patients treated with phenytoin for 1 week then placebo, valproate for 1 month then placebo, or valproate for 6 months, and there was a trend toward higher mortality in patients treated with valproate. A secondary analysis of 279 patients assessed neuropsychological function at 1, 6, and 12 months post-injury and found no beneficial or adverse effects of valproate compared with phenytoin or placebo.

### Valproate-is withdrawal worth it? [^5038c953]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

This publication reinforces the importance of addressing potential risks of valproate withdrawal in both women and men and emphasizes the need for more informed discussions. While valproate should not be the first-line option in young women of childbearing potential, it is still used, and for some, it's the only drug that provides significant seizure control. The risk of never offering this medication to patients who have poorly controlled epilepsy warrant discussion as well. This commentary enforces our need to gather as much information as possible to help make joint patient/provider informed choices. All patients should be counseled not only about the risks to fertility and increased teratogenicity while remaining on valproate, but also on potential harms associated with valproate withdrawal, including the risks of increased ED attendance/hospital admissions, falls, injuries, burns, and new-onset depression. Further studies are needed to fully understand whether mortality increases in association with valproate withdrawal, as a difference was not found to be statistically significant. Additionally, studies are needed to clarify the rate of seizure increase or recurrence following valproate withdrawal. Overall, this study highlights the necessity and complexity of shared decision-making surrounding valproate withdrawal in young men and women, emphasizing that there are risks in both directions that need to be thoroughly considered.

7.1 Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance

Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.

In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.

Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.

The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed

Aspirin

A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n = 6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The β-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin. Caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see Boxed Warning]. When valproic acid is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2 years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.

Younger children, especially those receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.

The variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid concentrations. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors that affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding.

Pediatric Clinical Trials

Divalproex sodium was studied in seven pediatric clinical trials.

Two of the pediatric studies were double-blinded placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on divalproex sodium extended-release tablets) and migraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on divalproex sodium extended-release tablets). Efficacy was not established for either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania. The most common drug-related adverse reactions (reported > 5% and twice the rate of placebo) reported in the controlled pediatric mania study were nausea, upper abdominal pain, somnolence, increased ammonia, gastritis and rash.

### Acute changes in liver function tests during initiation of ketogenic diet [^94edf7e1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Liver function tests typically include alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl-transferase, serum bilirubin, and albumin, among others. Abnormal liver function tests can be classified into 2 broad patterns: hepatocellular pattern (disproportionate elevation in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and cholestatic pattern (disproportionate elevation in alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl-transferase, and bilirubin).

Although studies have shown elevated liver enzymes in patients on ketogenic diet long term, to our knowledge, there is no definitive data directly implicating ketogenic diet in acute derangements in liver function tests during initiation.

One case reportdescribed an 18-month-old girl who showed a remarkable elevation in liver enzymes 2 days after discharge. However, this patient was also on valproic acid valproic acid and had a concurrent febrile illness and tolerated the ketogenic diet later once the illness resolved and valproic acid was discontinued. Other studies, have shown elevated transaminases in a minority (2.1% and 2.3% respectively) of patients on ketogenic diet only after 1 month of initiation of therapy.

Patient 1 was on a combination of valproic acid, clobazam, and cannabidiol. All these antiseizure medications individually and in combinationhave been shown to elevate liver enzymes. Because this combination had resulted in significant improvement of seizures and past attempts at withdrawal of medications had resulted in status epilepticus, the team felt it was safer to continue the current combination of medications and reintroduce ketogenic diet later if valproic acid was able to be weaned off.

Ketogenic diet and valproic acid both have been known to cause chronic hepatotoxicity independently. There have been publications both in favor of and against the concomitant use of these two agents.

The mechanism of this hepatoxicity is not clearly known. There are several proposed hypotheses:
Elevated plasma concentration of fatty acids are seen in patients on ketogenic diet and this may compete with valproic acid (which itself is a fatty acid) for binding sites leading to an increase in valproic acid levels.
Both ketogenic diet and valproic acid can cause liver injury through causing carnitine deficiency, which is important in long-chain fatty acid metabolism. 9
Inhibition of mitochondrial beta oxidative phosphorylation by valproic acid, especially in choline-deficient states.
Chronic ketogenic diet usage causes an increase in hepatocyte inflammatory markers through various mechanisms; however, if the same holds true in the acute state is unknown.

Carbapenem Antibiotics

A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Cholestyramine

Cholestyramine, when concurrently administered with valproic acid, led to, on average, a 14% decrease in plasma levels of valproic acid in a study conducted in 6 healthy subjects administered valproic acid and cholestyramine. Delaying the administration of cholestyramine relative to valproic acid administration by 3 hours may lessen the interaction.

Estrogen-Containing Hormonal Contraceptives

Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen containing products.

Felbamate

A study involving the co-administration of 1200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.

### Which psychotropic medications induce hepatotoxicity? [^a5502a22]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Safe prescribing practices to minimize pharmaceutically induced liver damage or worsening of preexisting conditions require knowledge about medicines with hepatotoxic potential. This paper reviews psychotropic medications and their effects on the liver.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed utilizing the phrase "drug-induced liver injury" with various categories of psychiatric drugs. Only articles written in English were utilized.

Results

Hepatotoxicity can be acute or chronic in nature. Medication discontinuation is necessary in acute forms, while close monitoring is required in milder forms of medication-induced chronic liver damage. Nefazodone, pemoline and/or tacrine are the highest offenders. Carbamazepine and valproate products (e.g., divalproex) can lead to this adverse event and should be avoided in patients with liver disease, persons with alcohol misuse or those consuming high doses of acetaminophen.

Conclusion

Knowing the risk levels associated with various medicines is important; prescribing multiple drugs with hepatotoxic effects should be avoided. One should educate patients about early warning signs of liver injury. Always provide clinical and laboratory monitoring before and during the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Clinical features and laboratory results govern medication prescribing with ongoing risk-to-benefit ratio assessment during pharmacotherapy.

### Valproic acid therapy inducing absence status evolving into generalized seizures [^fb89a172]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The authors herein present two children with mild absence epilepsy, having intermittent absences, who developed absence status evolving into atonic generalized seizures and drop attacks along with progressive disorientation induced by relatively small doses of valproic acid. Consciousness and awareness were intact before the introduction of valproic acid. Both children, after the first dose of valproic acid, developed prolonged and recurrent clusters of absences, which became prolonged, with drop attacks occurring in one patient associated with progressive disorientation. The electroencephalogram concurrently demonstrated prolonged spike-wave discharges, along with disturbance of background activity. Discontinuation of valproic acid resulted in immediate cessation of the prolonged and repetitive clusters of absence episodes and disappearance of drop attacks, along with sensorium clearing. In conclusion, although uncommon, a possible induction of absence status and even atonic seizures by valproic acid should be taken into account and properly managed by abrupt discontinuation of the drug.

### Epilepsy management in pregnant HIV + women in sub-saharan Africa, clinical aspects to consider: a scoping review [^d0f406a4]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Compared to these EI-AEDs, second-line broad-spectrum non-EI-AEDs including levetiracetam and lamotrigine have fewer drug interactions. However, these second-line AEDs for generalized and partial seizures are not widely available in SSA. Currently, the only second-line AED for partial and generalized seizures for pregnant women in the WHO Essential List of Medicines is lamotrigine, which undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver.

Apart from drug interactions with HAART and anti-infective agents, first-line EI-AEDs are significantly more teratogenic than second-line AEDs. The WHO recommends carbamazepine for pregnant women with epilepsy (WWE) if no second-line AED is available, due to its slightly lower prevalence of congenital malformation (CM) (5.5%), compared to phenobarbital (6.5%), and lamotrigine and levetiracetam (2.9% and 2.8%, respectively) (Table 1).

2 Tomson et al.

When treating WWE, clinicians face the additional dilemma that valproic acid, a first-line AED recommended for HIV+ individuals in LIC as it is not enzyme inducing, is associated with the highest prevalence of CM (10.3%). In addition, given the geographic overlap with other endemic diseases, a non-negligible proportion of pregnant HIV+ WWE may concomitantly receive treatment with other potentially teratogenic drugs, including anti-TB drugs. Therefore, epilepsy management during pregnancy, particularly in HIV+ women, requires an equilibrium between seizure control, viral load control, co-infection prevention, and risk minimization for the WWE and their fetuses.

With a large number of HIV+ women who will be on HAART prior to getting pregnant and HIV+ pregnant women embarking on PMTCT programs, there is a need to develop evidenced-based clinical guidelines on epilepsy management in pregnant HIV+ women. This review seeks to identify aspects to be considered in clinical management of epilepsy in pregnant HIV+ women in SSA. Specifically, it explores clinical aspects which intersect between HIV, HAART, AED, and pregnancy.

### Phenytoin versus valproate monotherapy for partial onset seizures and generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures: an individual participant data review [^b20ecf92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, phenytoin and valproate are commonly used antiepileptic drugs. It is generally believed that phenytoin is more effective for partial onset seizures, and that valproate is more effective for generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. This is the latest updated version of the review first published in 2001 and updated in 2013.

Objectives

To review the time to withdrawal, remission and first seizure of phenytoin compared to valproate when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures or generalised tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (19 May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to 19 May 2015), SCOPUS (19 February 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (19 May 2015), and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (19 May 2015). We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures with a comparison of valproate monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Outcomes were time to: (a) withdrawal of allocated treatment (retention time); (b) achieve 12-month remission (seizure-free period); (c) achieve six-month remission (seizure-free period); and (d) first seizure (post-randomisation). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

IPD were available for 669 individuals out of 1119 eligible individuals from five out of 11 trials, 60% of the potential data. Results apply to partial onset seizures (simple, complex and secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures), and generalised tonic-clonic seizures, but not other generalised seizure types (absence or myoclonus seizure types). For remission outcomes: HR > 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes: HR > 1 indicates an advantage for valproate. The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were time to: (a) withdrawal of allocated treatment 1.09 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.55); (b) achieve 12-month remission 0.98 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.23); (c) achieve six-month remission 0.95 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.15); and (d) first seizure 0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.14). The results suggest no overall difference between the drugs for these outcomes. We did not find any statistical interaction between treatment and seizure type (partial versus generalised).

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between phenytoin and valproate for the outcomes examined in this review. However misclassification of seizure type may have confounded the results of this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus seizure types. No outright evidence was found to support or refute current treatment policies.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^f9fbf88c]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to risk factors, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- the daily dose of a medication, its lipophilicity, and the extent of hepatic metabolism influence the risk of causing DILI

- insufficient evidence to confirm subject age, gender, race, and ethnicity as reliable risk factors for DILI susceptibility

- some drugs are more likely to cause DILI in older patients (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, isoniazid), whereas others are more commonly implicated in pediatric patients (such as valproate, minocycline)

- medical comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, are associated with increased incidence and severity of DILI with specific drugs

- insufficient evidence regarding the role of alcohol, tobacco, and diet in DILI susceptibility

- patients with preexisting liver disease are at increased risk of developing liver injury with selected drugs (such as methotrexate and anti-tuberculosis therapy) and poor outcomes with a DILI episode

- PTPN22 gene polymorphism is a risk factor for DILI across multiple drugs and major ethnic groups.

### Valproic acid poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^cc6df274]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 9000 ingestions of valproic acid. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected ingestion of valproic acid by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of valproic acid might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of valproic acid ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to the acute ingestion and acute-on-chronic ingestion of immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms of valproic acid, divalproex, and valproate sodium alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This review focuses on the ingestion of more than a single therapeutic dose and the effects of an overdose. Although therapeutic doses of valproic acid can cause adverse effects in adults and children, some idiosyncratic and some dose-dependent, these cases are not considered. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in whom a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who are symptomatic (more than somnolence or exhibiting coma or seizures) after a valproic acid ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Asymptomatic patients with an unintentional acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more or asymptomatic patients who are taking the drug therapeutically and who take an additional single acute ingestion of 50 mg/kg or more of any valproic acid formulation should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 4) Patients with unintentional ingestions of immediate-release valproic acid formulations, who are asymptomatic, and more than 6 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 5) Patients with unintentional ingestions of delayed-release or extended-release formulations of valproic acid who are asymptomatic, and more than 12 hours has elapsed since the time of ingestion, can be observed at home (Grade C). 6) Pregnant women who ingest below the dose for emergency department referral and do not have other referral conditions should be directed to their primary care obstetrical provider for evaluation of potential maternal and fetal risk. Routine referral to an emergency department for immediate care is not required (Grade D). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade C). 8) Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested valproic acid within the preceding hour (Grade C). Prehospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Poison centers should follow local protocols and experience with its use. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grades D). 9) In patients who have ingested valproic acid and who are comatose, naloxone can be considered for prehospital administration in the doses used for treatment of opioid overdose, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) A benzodiazepine can be administered by EMS personnel if convulsions are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction, expressed by written treatment protocol or policy, or if there is direct medical oversight (Grade C).

Several anti-seizure medication may decrease neuronal firing by inhibiting sodium or calcium channels while others may increase inhibition. Phenobarbital, a first-generation ASM, increases GABA levels and GABA activity with the former acting as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase and the latter directly facilitating increased GABA release. Furthermore, it functions as a form of prophylactic or preventative therapy rather than as an abortive therapy for already ongoing seizures. Valproate is another first-generation ASM frequently used and is a first-line long-term treatment for tonic-clonic generalized seizures as well as focal seizures and established status epilepticus. Valproate can be taken orally and is dosed with the goal of remaining within the therapeutic index. To assess if an individual is within the therapeutic index for the drug serum concentration of valproate can be measured using a serum valproic acid test. It is typically ordered at the beginning of treatment with the medication, is not routinely monitored but can be assessed in the case of suspected toxicity. Valproate toxicity often presents with encephalopathy, hepatotoxicity, and electrolyte abnormalities. It also carries the adverse effects of pancreatitis, alopecia, tremor, agranulocytosis, and teratogenicity as well as, inhibiting cytochrome P450 leading to increased serum levels of other drugs such as warfarin. Phenobarbital is a direct agonist of GABA by increasing the length of time that the chloride channels that facilitate GABA release are open. Phenobarbital must be dosed carefully as it has the risk of causing respiratory and cardiac depression, sedation, dependency, and tolerance. Following the initial administration or increases in dosage, the peak serum level of phenobarbital will need to be measured and is done so 2–8 h following intake. Expert judgment should be used when increasing the dose of phenobarbital as tolerance to the drug can display individuals requiring larger doses for the same degree of seizure control. As the maximum dose is approached other pharmacologic methods for seizure prophylaxis may need to be explored. Another first-generation ASM, carbamazepine, is effective as a prophylactic anti-seizure medication. Carbamazepine has two important mechanisms of action that allow it to prevent and dampen seizure activity. It impacts synaptic transmission increasing GABA release and decreasing glutamate release and reducing the high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials that are responsible for seizure activity. Carbamazepine does this by increasing the inactivation of the sodium channels that enable action potentials. Monitoring of serum levels of carbamazepine is obligated for anyone on the medication as the adverse effects of this drug directly correlate with the serum levels. The increase in serum levels will often precede the observation of the drug's adverse effects and can prompt necessary modifications to an individual's drug regimen before severe effects occur. Serum levels should be measured often and at regular intervals such as every 3 weeks following the initiation of the drug and then the interval between serum-drug level measurement can be increased to approximately every 3 months or soon after beginning a medication that induces or inhibits the cytochrome. Adverse effects of carbamazepine that can occur with a serum level elevated above the therapeutic index include rash, agranulocytosis, toxicity, ataxia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, Steven-Johnson syndrome, and teratogenicity. Additionally, carbamazepine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 decreasing the serum concentration of drugs that are metabolized by this cytochrome.

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodiumDelayed-release) [^b4e2aaa3]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of

these symptoms. Liver function tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.

Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When divalproex sodium is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above this age group, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.

The drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Birth Defects

Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations involving various body systems). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other antiseizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.

### Valproic acid [^a048796d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of valproic acid PO:
- **Decreased body temperature**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of hypothermia, both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia.
- **Decreased platelet count, coagulopathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Obtain CBC and coagulation tests before treatment and at periodic intervals during treatment. Monitor CBC and coagulation parameters before planned surgery.
- **Decreased serum valproate levels**: use caution in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics. Monitor serum valproate concentrations after initiating carbapenem therapy.
- **DRESS syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of DRESS syndrome.
- **Increased blood ammonia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of hyperammonemia. Suspect hyperammonemia in patients developing unexplained lethargy, vomiting, changes in mental status, or hypothermia.
- **Increased blood ammonia**: use caution in patients receiving concomitant topiramate or in patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity.
- **Increased urine ketones**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite and may lead to false-positive results in urine ketone tests.
- **Somnolence**: use caution in elderly patients. Titrate slowly with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid, have been associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Valproic acid with efavirenz and zidovudine: In a Class II study in 11 HIV-positive subjects taking efavirenz 600 mg/day, efavirenz AUC was not significantly affected (mean change 0%, CI −15% to 17%) after administration of valproic acid 500 mg/day for 7 days. In a Class III open-label study, adding valproic acid 250 mg every 8 hours on days 6–9 to zidovudine 100 mg every 8 hours led to a mean zidovudine AUC increase from 0.65 to 1.17 mg/L h (p < 0.05). Additionally, valproic acid levels did not differ significantly between subjects not receiving efavirenz and those comedicated with efavirenz 600 mg/day; equivalence criteria were not defined.

### Valproic acid [^ca0dbb53]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbapenem Antibiotics

A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Cholestyramine

Cholestyramine, when concurrently administered with valproic acid, led to, on average, a 14% decrease in plasma levels of valproic acid in a study conducted in 6 healthy subjects administered valproic acid and cholestyramine. Delaying the administration of cholestyramine relative to valproic acid administration by 3 hours may lessen the interaction.

Estrogen-Containing Hormonal Contraceptives

Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen containing products.

Felbamate

A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.

### Seizures from valproate-carbapenem interaction [^72c57a01]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic medication interactions can complicate the management of epilepsy, by either increasing or reducing the effective serum concentrations thereby causing adverse effects or loss of seizure control.

Results

A 14-year-old girl with well-controlled juvenile absence epilepsy lost control of her seizures acutely following the administration of carbapenem for pneumonia. Serum valproate concentrations fell by 90% within 48 hours following carbapenem and returned to baseline following its discontinuation.

Conclusions

Awareness of this clinically significant interaction alters clinical practice by avoiding carbapenem or temporary use of adjunctive medication to prevent the clinical consequences of this significant drug interaction.

### Anticonvulsant and antiretroviral interactions [^f2245fc4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical significance of interactions between anticonvulsant and antiretroviral agents and provide recommendations regarding their concurrent use.

Data Sources

A PubMed search (1966 to April 2003) was conducted using individual anticonvulsant and antiretroviral drug names and the following key search terms: anticonvulsant, antiepileptic, antiretroviral, protease inhibitor, and pharmacokinetic. Abstracts from scientific meetings that pertained to drug interactions were manually reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles identified by the PubMed search were examined. Articles and abstracts from scientific meetings with relevant information were included.

Data Synthesis

Six case reports were identified that describe interactions between anticonvulsant agents and protease inhibitors. In several reports, carbamazepine serum concentrations increased by approximately two- to threefold with concurrent ritonavir, resulting in carbamazepine-related toxicity. Carbamazepine was also associated with loss of viral suppression when combined with indinavir. Phenytoin serum concentrations were decreased with nelfinavir in a patient who developed recurrent seizures. The effect of ritonavir on phenytoin was variable; a 30% reduction in phenytoin serum concentration occurred in one patient, while no apparent change was observed in another. Interactions with nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors are poorly characterized because existing data involve concurrent protease inhibitor therapy. The utility of newer anticonvulsant agents is explored. Experience with newer anticonvulsant agents in 2 patients at our site is also described.

Conclusions

Limited data exist regarding interactions between anticonvulsant and antiretroviral agents. Valproic acid and newer anticonvulsant agents may provide useful alternatives to first-generation agents. Clinicians need to be diligent when monitoring for anticonvulsant-antiretroviral interactions because of the potential for toxicity, loss of seizure control, and incomplete viral suppression.

### Sodium valproate versus phenytoin monotherapy for epilepsy: an individual participant data review [^7e5809bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free, and to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy. Worldwide, sodium valproate and phenytoin are commonly used antiepileptic drugs for monotherapy treatment. It is generally believed that phenytoin is more effective for focal onset seizures, and that sodium pvalproate is more effective for generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. This is the latest updated version of the review first published in 2001, and updated in 2013 and 2016.

Objectives

To review the time to treatment failure, remission and first seizure of sodium valproate compared to phenytoin when used as monotherapy in people with focal onset seizures or generalised tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP on 19 February 2018. We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing monotherapy with either sodium valproate or phenytoin in children or adults with focal onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to treatment failure and our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post-randomisation, time to six-month, and 12-month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.

Main Results

We included 11 trials in this review and IPD were available for 669 individuals out of 1119 eligible individuals from five out of 11 trials, 60% of the potential data. Results apply to focal onset seizures (simple, complex and secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures), and generalised tonic-clonic seizures, but not other generalised seizure types (absence or myoclonus seizure types). For remission outcomes, a HR of less than 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin, and for first seizure and treatment failure outcomes a HR of less than 1 indicates an advantage for sodium valproate. The main overall results were: time to treatment failure for any reason related to treatment (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.27; 5 studies; 528 participants; moderate-quality evidence), time to treatment failure due to adverse events (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.37; 4 studies; 418 participants; moderate-quality evidence), time to treatment failure due to lack of efficacy (pooled HR for all participants 1.16 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.89; 5 studies; 451 participants; moderate-quality evidence). These results suggest that treatment failure for any reason related to treatment and treatment failure due to adverse events may occur earlier on phenytoin compared to sodium valproate, while treatment failure due to lack of efficacy may occur earlier on sodium valproate than phenytoin; however none of these results were statistically significant. Results for time to first seizure (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; 5 studies; 639 participants; low-quality evidence) suggest that first seizure recurrence may occur slightly earlier on sodium valproate compared to phenytoin. There were no clear differences between drugs in terms of time to 12-month remission (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.28; 4 studies; 514 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and time to six-month remission (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; 5 studies; 639 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Limited information was available regarding adverse events in the trials and we could not make comparisons between the rates of adverse events on sodium valproate and phenytoin. Some adverse events reported with both drugs were drowsiness, rash, dizziness, nausea and gastrointestinal problems. Weight gain was also reported with sodium valproate and gingival hypertrophy/hyperplasia was reported on phenytoin. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, however four out of the five trials providing IPD for analysis were of an open-label design, therefore all results were at risk of detection bias. There was also evidence that misclassification of seizure type may have confounded the results of this review, particularly for the outcome 'time to first seizure' and heterogeneity was present in analysis of treatment failure outcomes which could not be explained by subgroup analysis by epilepsy type or by sensitivity analysis for misclassification of seizure type. Therefore, for treatment failure outcomes we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate to low, for 'time to first seizure' we judged the quality of the evidence to be low, and for remission outcomes we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between valproate and phenytoin for any of the outcomes examined in this review. However detection bias, classification bias and heterogeneity may have impacted on the results of this review. We did not find any outright evidence to support or refute current treatment policies. We recommend that future trials be designed to the highest quality possible with consideration of masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.

### Valproate: not all boxed warnings are created equal [^0d10b471]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Valproate has undergone significant changes in labeling to the boxed warnings associated with it. This review will analyze evidence regarding the valproate-boxed warnings for teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatitis, with a particular emphasis on the fetal risk.

Data Sources

A review of Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register, Google Scholar, manufacturer websites, and product labeling was performed from 1963 to February 2022, using the following search terms: valproate, valproic acid, depakote, teratogenicity, birth defects, fetal risk, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatitis. Relevant English-language studies and those conduced in humans were considered. Product labeling was also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

There is a significant fetal risk following in utero valproate exposure (risk of malformation development: 8.6% in 360 women in North America). Current labeling in the United States recommends co-prescribing effective contraception for women of childbearing age. The risk of hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis is much lower in the general population (1/20000 and 1/40000 patients, respectively) compared with those patients with certain risk factors who are taking valproate (1/500).

Conclusions

Overstated monitoring recommendations for the potential risk of hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis distracts from a much more common and severe risk of fetal harm. Clinicians must be diligent about discussing this risk with patients and documenting when this discussion occurs. Changes to the current recommendations for monitoring of the boxed warnings associated with valproate therapy should be considered, such as more stringent monitoring requirements for the inherent fetal risk. This could be accomplished through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program or through institution-based policies and procedures. In addition, monitoring recommendations for the risk of hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis should account for contributing risk factors.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

General Information on Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-‑specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.

Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, "Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease".

Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.

Intravenous (IV) valproate for status epilepticus — compared with phenytoin, as a second-line agent seizure control was achieved in 79% (15/19) with valproate versus 25% (3/12) with phenytoin, an absolute risk reduction of 54% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23% to 85%; number needed to treat [NNT] 1.9). In another Class II randomized study of patients refractory to 20 mg of IV diazepam, 20 mg/kg valproate (40 mg per minute) or phenytoin (50 mg per minute) produced equal seizure cessation within 20 minutes (88% with valproate and 84% with phenytoin), but hypotension occurred in 12% with phenytoin versus none with valproate. Additional Class III data include a case series of 102 adults given IV valproate 4 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg with 77% responding within 15 minutes for status epilepticus and an 85% response for repeated seizures; a cohort of 63 adults treated with an average 30 mg/kg at a rate up to 500 mg per minute with cessation in more than half of cases (63%); a series where 30 mg/kg infused at 6 mg/kg per hour stopped seizures within an hour in 88% of refractory cases; and a randomized comparison of valproate 30 mg/kg versus phenytoin 18 mg/kg over 20 minutes in which, of 74 patients, 88% in each group had resolution within 20 minutes. Valproate appears to be safe and effective in refractory status epilepticus, was not associated with hypotension, and IV valproate is described as an acceptable treatment option that may work as well as phenytoin.

### Tuberculosis infection in children and adolescents: testing and treatment [^44b5d3a0]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

General principles — laboratory monitoring and hepatotoxicity considerations: laboratory testing before or during treatment is not necessary in otherwise healthy pediatric patients. The use of isoniazid monotherapy for pediatric TBI causes low rates of hepatotoxicity (< 1%), and alternate regimens, which may include 2 drugs but for a shorter duration, are even less hepatotoxic than the 9 months of isoniazid monotherapy. Increased hepatotoxicity risk occurs in children who are obese and have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, are taking other potentially hepatotoxic medications (especially anticonvulsants), are pregnant in the first 12 weeks of gestation, or have underlying liver disease, and these children should have baseline hepatic function tests.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^88724979]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Genetic and nongenetic risk factors for DILI — Understanding of genetic risk factors is limited and causative agents vary with age; age may confer susceptibility in a drug-specific fashion, with central nervous system agents and antimicrobials more common in children, and infants and children susceptible to valproate and at increased risk of Reye syndrome from aspirin; although PTU may cause DILI in all age groups, children are more susceptible to severe and fatal hepatotoxicity due to PTU. With increasing age, risk of liver injury rises with medications such as isoniazid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and nitrofurantoin. There is no evidence to suggest that women are at higher risk of all-cause DILI, but they seem to be at higher risk of liver injury from minocycline, methyldopa, diclofenac, and nitrofurantoin. DILI is a rare cause of acute liver injury in pregnant women; there is no evidence to suggest that pregnancy by itself increases the susceptibility to DILI caused by any agents other than tetracycline, common causes in pregnancy include methyldopa, hydralazine, antimicrobials including antiretroviral agents, and PTU, and most cases resolve upon stopping the agent although liver transplantation and maternal death have rarely been reported. Diabetes mellitus shows no evidence of increased risk for all-cause DILI in humans, though injury due to methotrexate and anti-TB medications may be increased in individuals with diabetes, and in DILIN, underlying diabetes was independently associated with death or liver transplantation (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–3.5). Although alcohol consumption is included in RUCAM, there is no evidence to suggest that chronic alcohol consumption is a risk factor for all-cause DILI; however, heavy alcohol consumption is a risk factor for DILI with APAP, methotrexate, and isoniazid, and package labeling recommends avoiding duloxetine with substantial alcohol consumption.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^df6d66d0]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD idiosyncratic DILI — adjunct and drug-specific therapies — Ursodeoxycholic acid is not an established therapy for patients with DILI but is presumably safe to administer; it may improve pruritus and hasten recovery, though large, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine optimal dosing and duration. For selected scenarios, uncontrolled data suggest benefit with L-carnitine for children with hyperammonemia due to valproate hepatotoxicity, and cholestyramine may be of value for leflunomide hepatotoxicity because of prolonged half-life and enterohepatic circulation.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^1b65a407]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — urgent control, refractory therapy, and monitoring specifies that urgent control AED therapy recommendations include use of fosphenytoin/phenytoin, valproic acid, or levetiracetam (strong recommendation, moderate quality). For refractory SE, therapy recommendations should consist of continuous infusion AEDs, but vary by the patient's underlying condition (strong recommendation, low quality), and dosing of continuous infusion AEDs for RSE should be titrated to cessation of electrographic seizures or burst suppression (strong recommendation, very low quality). A period of 24–48 h of electrographic control is recommended prior to slow withdrawal of continuous infusion AEDs for RSE (weak recommendation, very low quality), and during the transition from continuous infusion AEDs in RSE, it is suggested to use maintenance AEDs and monitor for recurrent seizures by cEEG during the titration period; if the patient is being treated for RSE at a facility without cEEG capabilities, consider transfer to a facility that can offer cEEG monitoring (strong recommendation, very low quality).

Valproic acid is an effective anti-epileptic medication often used for long-term control of seizure disorders that has been implicated in hematological toxicities, including rare reports of myelodysplasia and acute leukemia. Here, we report a case of valproic acid-related leukemia-like syndrome with a t(8;16) chromosomal translocation. After discontinuing valproic acid, the hematological findings completely resolved.

Rechallenge after suspected hepatotoxicity — In general, readministration of a suspected hepatotoxic drug in a patient with ongoing or previous DILI is best avoided, and we strongly recommend against re-exposure to a drug thought likely to have caused hepatotoxicity, especially if the initial liver injury was associated with significant aminotransferase elevation (e.g., > 5xULN, Hy's law, or jaundice); an exception to this recommendation is in cases of life-threatening situations, where there is no suitable alternative (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Valproic acid overdose review of a case with electrocardiographic changes [^418cdb24]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Valproic acid (VPA) is increasingly used to treat a variety of medical disorders, such as seizures, psychiatric disorders, and headaches. Therefore, accidental and intentional ingestions with valproic acid are increasing.

Objectives

A case is presented in an adolescent with ischemic electrocardiographic changes after an acute overdose with VPA.

Discussion

Major features of a valproic acid overdose include respiratory depression, progressive coma, hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and hemodynamic instability. Electrocardiographic abnormalities usually consist of tachycardia and nonspecific changes. Supportive care is indicated in most overdoses and involves the monitoring and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, coagulopathies, and acid-base imbalances. Treatment may include activated charcoal, naloxone, l-carnitine, and extracorporeal detoxification.

Conclusions

Valproic acid overdose is a relatively rare and electrocardiographic changes usually consist of tachycardia and nonspecific changes, but ischemic changes may occur and usually transient and require only recognition.
