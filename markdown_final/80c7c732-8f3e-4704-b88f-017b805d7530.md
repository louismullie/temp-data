## Question

What are the clinical manifestations of a hepatic hemangioma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the clinical manifestations of hepatic hemangioma are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline natural history and how often these lesions are asymptomatic. Then, I should categorize symptomatic presentations by mechanism, review pain and mass-effect features, examine hematologic and hemodynamic complications, consider rupture and inflammatory syndromes, identify special anatomic variants, clarify size-related nuances, and finally differentiate population-specific patterns in adults, infants, and pregnancy while cross-checking diagnostic caveats so symptoms are not misattributed to a mimicker.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: most hepatic hemangiomas are asymptomatic and found incidentally, and in typical cases no follow-up is needed once the diagnosis is secure; I should double-check that against both guideline sources and narrative reviews to avoid over-calling symptoms as causally related to the hemangioma rather than coincidental conditions [^111AWUYz] [^112uzvsS] [^114Ddo87].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiologic buckets that can generate symptoms; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before outlining them clearly: mass effect from mechanical compression or capsular distension, hematologic consequences from intralesional thrombosis and consumption, vascular shunting with systemic hemodynamic impact, and lesion-related complications like rupture or, in rare morphologies, torsion or infarction; this framework will keep the phenotypes organized and will help me map symptoms to mechanisms coherently [^113whwUz] [^113X7QkX].

> I will now examine pain and mechanical symptoms; abdominal discomfort is the most common reported symptom in symptomatic cohorts, often dull RUQ or epigastric pain, sometimes with palpable mass, hepatomegaly, early satiety, nausea, or dyspepsia from organ compression; wait, let me verify the causality data because pain is frequently multifactorial and may be incidental rather than driven by the hemangioma itself; indeed, one study found pain correlated with coexisting IBS or other GI disease and not with hemangioma size, number, or location, which cautions me against attributing nonspecific abdominal pain to the hemangioma without other supportive features [^113whwUz] [^113whwUz].

> I need to check hematologic complications next; consumptive coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and DIC can occur in large lesions; wait, Kasabach-Merritt is classically linked to kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma, not common infantile hemangioma, but adult and pediatric liver guidelines still use the term when a hemangioma is associated with a severe consumptive coagulopathy phenotype; either way, the clinical manifestation is bleeding diathesis and bruising with abnormal labs that may mandate urgent intervention and specialized referral [^113X7QkX] [^113whwUz].

> I should now consider vascular shunting and hemodynamic effects; in infants, high-flow intrahepatic shunts can drive high-output cardiac failure with tachypnea, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, and sometimes pulmonary hypertension, and I need to ensure I screen for hypothyroidism due to type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase activity causing consumptive hypothyroidism; let me double-check the populations: these severe manifestations are predominantly infantile or congenital hepatic hemangioma presentations, often with multifocal or diffuse disease, and infants with five or more cutaneous infantile hemangiomas warrant abdominal ultrasound screening for hepatic involvement given the higher risk [^1123Bdaw] [^1142uitt] [^112Fe1HR] [^112Jy5F7].

> But wait, what about rupture and intralesional hemorrhage; I should confirm how they present and when they drive management; acute severe abdominal pain with hemodynamic instability and signs of hemoperitoneum is the typical clinical picture of rupture, and guidelines specifically list rupture or intralesional hemorrhage as complications prompting resection; hold on, I should verify pregnancy nuances so I do not overstate risk — despite occasional growth during pregnancy, routine surveillance is not recommended for asymptomatic, typical hemangiomas in pregnancy, which underscores that frank rupture is exceptional in this context [^112HcR5U] [^1152vCT9] [^114K7dTX].

> Let me consider systemic inflammatory manifestations; although rare, a giant hemangioma can be associated with fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and constitutional symptoms, presumably from cytokine release — this atypical inflammatory presentation should remain on my differential when fever of unknown origin coexists with a large vascular liver mass, but I must confirm the imaging phenotype before inferring causality [^113NNRLe].

> I will now examine special anatomic variants; pedunculated hemangiomas, although extremely uncommon, may undergo torsion and infarction, producing an acute abdomen that can mimic appendicitis or other surgical causes; hmm, wait a minute, this is a high-stakes mimic and requires intraoperative recognition if preoperative imaging is non-diagnostic, so a torsed pedunculated hemangioma should be in the back of my mind in unexplained right lower quadrant pain with normal appendix at exploration [^112upB6a].

> Hold on, I should verify size-related nuances without oversimplification; giant hemangiomas are more likely to cause symptoms via mass effect and hemorrhagic complications, yet pain itself may not correlate with size, and tumor diameter alone was not an independent predictor of postoperative complications; I need to emphasize that growth can occur over time, often slowly, so documenting the natural history helps distinguish expected growth from atypical behavior that might suggest an alternative diagnosis or a complication [^113whwUz] [^114Ddo87] [^112yFZcd] [^116rEx9n].

> Next, I should differentiate population-specific patterns; in adults, most lesions are asymptomatic and manifestations are usually limited to nonspecific pain or mass effect with rare rupture, and once diagnosis is established no routine follow-up is needed in otherwise low-risk livers; in infants and children, I must watch for high-output cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension, hypothyroidism, hepatomegaly, and cutaneous hemangiomas as external clues, with screening ultrasound indicated when there are five or more cutaneous lesions; in pregnancy, I should remember that growth can occur but most lesions remain indolent and guidelines recommend no routine surveillance when asymptomatic, so any new pain or acute abdomen still warrants standard obstetric-hepatic evaluation rather than reflex hemangioma-directed imaging [^112uzvsS] [^1123Bdaw] [^1142uitt] [^114K7dTX].

> I need to ensure that manifestations are not misattributed to a hemangioma mimicker; let me first confirm that typical imaging features are present — peripheral, globular nodular arterial enhancement with progressive centripetal fill-in on CEUS, CT, or MRI is reassuring, and when features are typical, biopsy should be avoided due to bleeding risk; next, I should review that in indeterminate settings or in at-risk livers, multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT or CEUS is appropriate for characterization, and that atypical patterns or oncologic contexts warrant careful multiparametric assessment to exclude mimickers whose symptoms may be driving the presentation [^116ZoTEC] [^116eERKL] [^114AoNZg] [^111Z2tke].

> Finally, I should tie manifestations to action thresholds, but hold on, I should verify I am not drifting into a management treatise; the reason this matters is that some manifestations are red flags defining complicated disease: consumptive coagulopathy, symptomatic compression of organs or vessels, intralesional hemorrhage, and rupture are the canonical complication-driven indications for surgical or procedural consideration, so explicitly recognizing these clinical phenotypes prevents delay when a benign lesion becomes clinically significant [^112HcR5U] [^113X7QkX].

---

Hepatic hemangiomas are usually **asymptomatic** and found incidentally [^113whwUz]. When symptomatic, the most common features are **right upper quadrant pain or fullness** [^115YKGoD], early satiety [^113whwUz], nausea, and a palpable mass, typically with lesions > 5 cm [^114Ddo87]. Rare complications include rupture [^112HcR5U] with acute abdominal pain and shock, Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy) [^113X7QkX], and compressive symptoms such as jaundice or portal hypertension [^112HcR5U]. Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) are uncommon [^113whwUz] and usually indicate complications or alternative diagnoses.

---

## Asymptomatic presentation

Most hepatic hemangiomas are **asymptomatic** [^113whwUz]. They are typically **detected incidentally** during imaging for unrelated reasons [^1159PRBN].

---

## Symptomatic presentation

Symptomatic hepatic hemangiomas usually cause **nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms** [^113whwUz], often related to lesion size and location.

---

### Common symptoms

- **Abdominal pain or discomfort**: Most frequent symptom [^115YKGoD], usually dull or aching, localized to the right upper quadrant or epigastric region [^113whwUz].

- **Abdominal fullness or distension**: Sensation of fullness or bloating [^113whwUz], especially with larger lesions (> 5 cm) [^114Ddo87].

- **Early satiety**: Feeling full after small meals due to mass effect on the stomach [^113whwUz].

- **Nausea and dyspepsia**: Nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, often related to mass effect or compression of adjacent structures [^113whwUz].

- **Palpable abdominal mass**: Occasionally, a large hemangioma may be palpable on physical examination [^113whwUz].

---

### Rare complications and associated symptoms

Although rare, hepatic hemangiomas can lead to **significant complications**, which present with more severe symptoms:

- **Rupture and hemorrhage**: Sudden severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and shock due to intraperitoneal bleeding [^113X7QkX] [^112HcR5U].

- **Kasabach-Merritt syndrome**: Consumptive coagulopathy characterized by thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and prolonged coagulation times, potentially leading to bleeding complications [^113X7QkX] [^112HcR5U].

- **Compression of adjacent structures**: Large hemangiomas may compress bile ducts (causing jaundice), portal veins (leading to portal hypertension), or inferior vena cava (causing lower extremity edema) [^112HcR5U] [^113X7QkX].

---

## Systemic symptoms

Systemic symptoms — such as fever, weight loss, or malaise — are **uncommon** in hepatic hemangiomas and, when present, usually indicate complications or an alternative diagnosis [^113whwUz]. Rarely, giant hemangiomas cause systemic inflammatory manifestations, including fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and weight loss [^113NNRLe].

---

## Factors influencing symptom severity

Several factors **influence symptom severity and likelihood** in hepatic hemangiomas:

- **Lesion size**: Larger lesions (> 5 cm) are more likely to cause symptoms due to mass effect and compression of adjacent structures [^113whwUz] [^114Ddo87].

- **Location**: Lesions near the liver capsule or adjacent to critical structures (bile ducts, blood vessels) are more likely to cause symptoms [^113whwUz].

- **Growth rate**: Rapidly growing lesions may cause acute symptoms due to sudden expansion or rupture.

- **Patient demographics**: Female patients and those with underlying liver disease may be more likely to experience symptoms.

Although conservative management is generally recommended for asymptomatic hepatic hemangiomas, factors affecting the disease course remain not well understood.

- **Aim**: To determine disease characteristics of cavernous hemangioma and factors affecting its progression in patients from a general hepatology clinic in Tehran, Iran.

- **Methods**: We reviewed medical records of 198 patients with cavernous hemangioma of the liver visiting a large private hepatology clinic in Tehran from 1997 to 2007. Of a total of 198 cases, 129 could be followed up for a period of 3.2 ± 2.5 years, and 80 of these had 1–5 repeated sonographies.

- **Results**: Patients were between 27 and 84 years old (mean age: 44.3 ± 10.9 years), and 131 (66.2%) were female. Thirty-six patients (18.2%) had giant hemangiomas. Abdominal pain was the primary reason for evaluation in 100 (50.5%) patients. Abdominal pain at the beginning of the follow-up was significantly associated with having irritable bowel syndrome [odds ratio (OR) = 8.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1–28.7] or other gastrointestinal diseases (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 2.6–10.2), but not with hemangioma size, number, or location. During follow-up, having a single giant lesion at the time of diagnosis, adjusted for age, sex, and presence of irritable bowel syndrome, was a strong predictor of persistent pain during follow-up (OR = 11.1; 95% CI: 3.2–38.6). In repeated sonographies, 35% showed an increased size, which was significantly associated only with having a single lesion (P = 0.04).

### Atypical giant haemangioma of liver with systemic inflammatory manifestations [^113NNRLe]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Haemangioma is the most common benign tumour of the liver. Most are small in size (less than 4 cm), often asymptomatic, and discovered incidentally on modern diagnostic imaging. Lesions with a diameter larger than 4 cm are called giant haemangiomas, usually located in the right hepatic lobe. Although haemangioma is the most frequent benign tumour of the liver, 'giant' haemangiomas are rare. Such lesions may give rise to symptoms requiring treatment.

In this case report, we describe the case of a 50-year-old Indian man who presented with a giant liver haemangioma and systemic inflammatory manifestations.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^116Nynwm]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Liver hemangiomas have many benign and malignant mimickers, showing one or more imaging features resembling hemangiomas, but all of them also show imaging features that enable avoidance of misinterpretation. The main difficulties in the differential diagnosis between liver hemangiomas and their benign mimickers arise on ultrasound (US) examination; in these cases, contrast material administration is fundamental to avoid pitfalls.

Malignant mimickers, on the other hand, mostly show misleading features on contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. In these cases, a comprehensive "multiparametric" evaluation of the available imaging features is crucial to achieve a correct diagnosis.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^1145YTew]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Liver hemangiomas represent the most common primary benign liver tumor, with a prevalence of 2–20% in autoptic studies and a female-to-male ratio of 2:1–5:1. Hemangiomas are increasingly encountered in everyday clinical practice because of the large number of imaging studies performed. According to published series, hemangiomas may be detected in 5% of CT examinations and in 2–4% of ultrasound examinations. They have distinct imaging features that allow for accurate diagnosis using contrast-enhanced imaging modalities. No percutaneous biopsy or surgical resection is necessary for lesions with typical ultrasound appearance in non-oncological patients with a "healthy liver", as well as in lesions with a typical enhancement pattern. However, many benign and malignant liver lesions may exhibit misleading imaging features that radiologists need to be aware of in order to prevent misdiagnosis.

In this article, we review the multimodality imaging features of liver hemangiomas and present a series of potential hemangioma mimickers.

### Postnatal treatment and evolution patterns of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma: A case series of 29 patients [^111YbePU]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The management of GFHH is based on clinical presentation and includes observational, medical, surgical, and radiological interventional treatment options.

- **Diagnosis**: The identification of a unifocal congenital liver mass alongside suspicion of CHH through clinical history and imaging initially prompts conservative treatment and follow-up with serial ultrasounds in asymptomatic patients. When an expert panel of radiologists experienced in liver disease imaging cannot conclude a clear diagnosis or detects growth of the lesion in consecutive evaluations, a biopsy is performed to rule out malignancy, leading to a definite diagnosis. CHHs are classified into three groups according to the lesion range postpartum: focal type, multiple types, and diffuse type.

- **Treatment**: Children with insignificant postpartum symptoms were observed conservatively (observation group). Children with complications such as postnatal shortness of breath, vomiting due to abdominal distension, and cardiac insufficiency were treated (treatment group). Propranolol was used as the first-line treatment for the treatment group, starting at 0.5 mg/(kg-d) and increasing to 2 mg/(kg-d) for at least six months. In cases of cardiac insufficiency, cardiac diuretics were used to improve pulmonary hypertension. For combined anemia, platelet depletion, and significant coagulation abnormalities, methylprednisolone was used in combination for a short period, with the dosage gradually reduced.

If there is no significant response, further treatment strategies are considered.

### Spectrum of hepatic hemangiomas: Management and outcome [^1123Bdaw]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Infants with multiple cutaneous hemangiomas often present with hepatic hemangiomas, which can follow a benign clinical course or require complex management. We reviewed our experience in the management of hepatic hemangiomas.

We performed a retrospective review of patients (1996–2007) with hepatic hemangiomas treated in our institution. Twenty-six patients were diagnosed with hepatic hemangiomas as follows: 8 focal, 12 multiple, and 6 diffuse lesions. Nineteen (73%) patients had associated cutaneous hemangiomas. Sixteen patients had multiple and 3 patients had single cutaneous hemangiomas.

All patients with multiple or diffuse liver lesions were screened for heart failure and hypothyroidism. Congestive heart failure developed in 4 patients, 3 out of 4 of these patients had diffuse lesions. Two patients required thyroid replacement because of elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone. Due to progression of the disease, 9 patients required steroid treatment. Two patients were treated with vincristine, and 3 patients received alpha-interferon due to a poor response to steroid treatment. Two patients underwent surgical resection for failure to respond to medical management and worsening heart failure, leading to left lobectomy and liver transplant. Both patients had uncomplicated postoperative courses.

Five patients had a previously undescribed constellation of rapidly involuting cutaneous hemangiomas (disappearing by 3 months, glut-1-negative) with associated liver lesions also resolving at a faster pace (mean resolution of cutaneous hemangiomas, 1.9 vs. 7.9 months; p = 0.001).

### Torsion of a giant pedunculated liver hemangioma mimicking acute appendicitis: a case report [^112upB6a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hemangiomas are the most common benign neoplasms affecting the liver, with an incidence of 0.4–20% in autopsy series. Women are affected more often than men, with a female-to-male ratio of 5:1 to 6:1. They occur at all ages, and most cases are asymptomatic and do not require any treatment. However, pedunculated hemangiomas are extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature.

Herein, we report the case of a torsioned giant pedunculated liver hemangioma that mimicked acute appendicitis.

### Assessing normal growth of hepatic hemangiomas during long-term follow-up [^116rEx9n]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Few long-term data describe the natural history of hepatic hemangiomas. Because these lesions are frequently imaged repetitively on studies performed for other indications, health care professionals are commonly confronted with the problem of a growing hemangioma. As the rate and magnitude of normal growth are not well characterized, it becomes challenging to recognize lesions growing at an abnormal rate, which may require further evaluation or intervention.

- **Objectives**: To establish quantitatively the expected growth rate of hepatic hemangiomas and to define a measure of hemangioma growth that could be used clinically to help identify hemangiomas for which growth is more than expected.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Retrospective cohort study at an academic hospital tertiary referral center evaluating the growth rate of hepatic hemangiomas on cross-sectional imaging studies during a 10-year period (1997–2007). The mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.7 (1.9) years. The radiology information system was searched in a 10-year period for hemangioma cases. Patients with hepatic hemangiomas that were 1 cm or larger as seen on cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and with intervals of 1 year or more between imaging, were selected. Images with the longest interval between studies were reviewed further. Each study was reevaluated for diagnostic confirmation and to ensure consistency in measurement technique. Lesions were remeasured in three dimensions, and volumes were calculated using three-dimensional software.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis and follow-up of a special type of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma [^112aZXm9]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Liver tumors in the fetal and neonatal periods are rare, comprising approximately 5% of all tumors. Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors, often detected incidentally on prenatal ultrasound. While small-to-medium-sized hemangiomas usually resolve spontaneously, giant fetal hepatic hemangiomas with diameters over 40 mm can cause serious complications such as fetal hydrops, heart failure, coagulation disorders, and tumor rupture, which are potentially life-threatening. This study presents a case of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound at 37 weeks gestation and discusses the treatment and regression in newborns, providing valuable insights for the prenatal diagnosis, counseling, and management of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma.

### An unusual case of neonatal high-output heart failure: Infantile hepatic hemangioma [^112Jy5F7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) is a rare but life-threatening disorder that must be considered in the newborn presenting with high-output heart failure (HF). IHH is a tumor comprised of large vascular beds, which require a significant increase in blood flow as the lesion grows. This, in turn, creates an undue burden on the cardiovascular system, leading to high-output HF and potentially respiratory distress. Recent changes have been made in the classification of certain hepatic hemangiomas and their treatments.

- **Case report**: A 10-day-old girl presented to the Emergency Department with increased respiratory effort and an episode of apnea and cyanosis. A chest x-ray study was obtained, showing cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema concerning for HF. The patient was promptly admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, where advanced imaging revealed findings consistent with IHH.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** HF in an infant is a critical condition often requiring prompt intervention and rapid diagnosis of the correct etiology to save a life. IHH is an example of an extrathoracic etiology of pediatric HF that has undergone recent changes in terminology and diagnosis. Increased awareness among emergency physicians of this disease process and its treatments can lead to expeditious diagnosis and treatment of this potentially life-threatening illness.

### Guidance document for hepatic hemangioma (infantile and congenital) evaluation and monitoring [^115fMZWv]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

To define the types of hepatic hemangiomas, this study utilizes the updated International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification and creates a set of guidelines for their diagnostic evaluation and monitoring.

- **Study design**: We used a rigorous, transparent consensus protocol defined by an approved methodology, with input from multiple pediatric experts in vascular anomalies from hematology-oncology, surgery, pathology, radiology, and gastroenterology.

- **Results**: In the first section, we define the subtypes of hepatic hemangiomas based on the clinical course, histology, and radiologic characteristics. We recommend against using the term "hemangioma" for any vascular malformations affecting the liver or any hypervascular tumors that do not align with the approved definitions. We also advise against using the term "hemangioendothelioma" for infantile or congenital hemangioma. The following two sections, dedicated to infantile hepatic hemangioma and congenital hepatic hemangioma, describe these subtypes in further detail, including complications to be considered during monitoring and the respective recommended screening evaluations.

- **Conclusions**: Although institutional variations may exist for specific clinical details, having a clear understanding of the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas affecting children and the possible complications that require screening during the monitoring period should be standard. As children with hepatic hemangiomas are managed by different medical and surgical specialties, we offer an expert opinion multidisciplinary consensus.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of a small vessel hepatic hemangioma in a cirrhotic patient with histopathologic correlation [^115BPqvj]. Clinical Imaging (2015). High credibility.

The authors report and discuss a rare case of a small vessel hepatic hemangioma in a 59-year-old patient with liver cirrhosis, which was pre-procedurally characterized as indeterminate due to atypical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. This manuscript reviews the MRI features with pathologic correlation, emphasizes the importance of accurate characterization of liver lesions, and discusses the role of biopsy. This is believed to be the first reported case of a small vessel hemangioma in liver cirrhosis with imaging and histopathologic correlation.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^115SFBF5]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Typical MRI findings in cavernous hemangioma reveal that liver hemangiomas appear markedly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, determining a shine-through artifact on high b-value DWI without true diffusion restriction on the ADC map. The lesion appears hypointense on T1-weighted images, shows globular peripheral enhancement in the arterial phase, and appears hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase.

In non-oncologic patients with a "healthy liver", ultrasound (US) is sufficient for diagnosing characteristic lesions smaller than 3 cm. However, contrast-enhanced imaging (CEUS, CT, or MRI) is mandatory for US-atypical lesions and in oncologic patients or patients with underlying liver disease. Imaging follow-up is not indicated once the diagnosis is established.

- **Atypical imaging features**:
	- Liver hemangiomas may exhibit atypical imaging patterns that do not allow for definitive radiological diagnosis and often lead to biopsy to rule out malignancy. The most common atypical hemangioma is the sclerosed subtype, which shows extensive fibrosis substituting vascular spaces, resulting in reduced signal intensity on T2-weighted images. On contrast-enhanced studies, there is a loss of the typical peripheral globular enhancement. Additionally, massive fibrotic reactions may cause capsular retraction.

### Liver haemangioma: Common and uncommon findings and how to improve the differential diagnosis [^115UkWHp]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Haemangiomas are common focal liver lesions generally detected during the work-up of asymptomatic patients. Pathologically, they can be classified as small (capillary) or large, with cavernous vascular spaces that may exhibit thrombosis, calcifications, and hyalinisation. The polymorphic imaging appearance of haemangiomas depends on their histological features and flow pattern. The widespread use of cross-sectional imaging has increased the detection rate and improved the characterization of this benign tumor.

Recent developments in ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which provide high spatial and temporal resolution, coupled with the use of new contrast agents and/or pulse sequences, have broadened the spectrum of imaging findings. This contributes to diagnostic refinement in difficult cases. The scope of the present article is to provide an overview of the range of appearances of haemangiomas explored with recent cross-sectional imaging modalities, emphasizing their atypical findings as revealed by temporally resolved contrast-enhanced imaging.

### The humbling hemangioma: Uncommon CT and MRI imaging features and mimickers of hepatic hemangiomas [^114kefDs]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Cavernous hemangiomas are among the most common liver lesions encountered in abdominal imaging. While classical imaging characteristics usually aid the radiologist in confidently arriving at its diagnosis, atypical hemangiomas can prove to be difficult to distinguish from other more worrisome hepatic lesions such as metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, some malignant lesions can display features that simulate hemangiomas. The radiologist must be aware of these pitfalls to make an accurate diagnosis, when possible.

### Postnatal treatment and evolution patterns of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma: a case series of 29 patients [^111VHYFm]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Patient characteristics**: All 29 children were identified by routine prenatal ultrasound, and three were further identified by prenatal MRI. After birth, they all received ultrasound and CT (or MR), with diagnosis confirmed by typical imaging in 27 cases and by histopathology in two cases. The first prenatal ultrasound diagnosis occurred at a gestational age of 34.0 ± 4.3 weeks, ranging from 22 to 39 weeks.

- **Perinatal**: Among the 29 patients, 18 (62%) were male, and 11 (38%) were female. All were delivered at term, with a gestational age of 38.6 ± 1.4 weeks (range: 36 weeks + 6 ~ 41 weeks) and birth weight of 3181 ± 310 g (range: 2650 g ~ 4000 g). Nineteen cases (66%) were delivered vaginally, while 10 cases (34%) by cesarean section, with three cases due to a significant increase in fetal cardiothoracic ratio, fetal heart failure, and excessive amniotic fluid caused by tumor factors. One case was delivered due to a rapid increase in tumor size, and the remaining six cases were delivered due to other obstetric factors.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^117WCPjF]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Focal liver lesions are frequently encountered during imaging studies, with hemangiomas representing the most common solid liver lesion. Liver hemangiomas usually exhibit characteristic imaging features that allow characterization without the need for biopsy or follow-up. However, numerous benign and malignant liver lesions may present one or more imaging features resembling those of hemangiomas, which radiologists must be cognizant of. In this article, we review the typical imaging features of liver hemangiomas and present a series of potential mimickers, providing radiologists with insights for improving differential diagnoses.

- **Critical relevance statement**: The knowledge of imaging features of potential liver hemangiomas mimickers is fundamental to avoid misinterpretation.

- **Key points**:
	- Liver hemangiomas typically exhibit imaging features that help avoid the need for a biopsy.
	- Many benign and malignant liver lesions display imaging features resembling those of hemangiomas.
	- Radiologists must understand the potentially misleading imaging features of hemangiomas' mimickers.

### Cutaneous haemangioma: Prevalence and sonographic characteristics of associated hepatic haemangioma [^1176pHYD]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the prevalence of hepatic haemangiomas (HH) occurring with multiple or large cutaneous haemangiomas (CH) and to compare the ultrasound (US) characteristics of HH with the morphology of CH.

Retrospective and prospective sonographic and clinical analyses were undertaken on 69 patients referred for US to exclude silent HH. This comprised 62 patients referred over six years with six or more CH or one large CH (≥ 5 cm), and seven patients referred over one year with three to five small CH.

Results indicated that HH occurred in 45% of cases with miliary CH and 40% cases with mixed small and large CH. HH was also observed in 12–14% of patients with one large or three or more small CH. Notably, none showed HH progression. An association was found between HH sonographic characteristics and CH number and morphology.

Clinically silent HH occurred in nearly one in four infants presenting with six or more small CH or a large CH. Although previous studies have documented HH mortality between 18% and 80%, this was not observed in our study. Therefore, if clinical suspicion exists, US is indicated to enable early steroid treatment if significant HH are present.

### Diagnosis and management of solid benign liver lesions [^1159PRBN]. Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

More and more asymptomatic benign liver tumors are discovered incidentally and can be divided into regenerative lesions and true neoplastic lesions. The most common regenerative lesions include hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver. Neoplastic lesions include hepatocellular adenomas and angiomyolipomas. Regenerative lesions rarely increase in volume, do not yield a higher risk of complications, and usually do not require treatment.

By contrast, hepatocellular adenomas and angiomyolipomas can increase in volume and are associated with a risk of complications. Large hepatocellular adenomas (> 5 cm in diameter) are undoubtedly associated with a risk of bleeding and malignant transformation, particularly the inflammatory (also known as telangiectatic) and β-catenin mutated subtypes. Accurate diagnosis needs to be obtained to select patients eligible for surgical resection. MRI has markedly improved diagnosis and can identify the major hepatocellular adenomas subtypes. The use of biopsy results to inform the indication for resection remains questionable. However, when diagnosis remains uncertain after imaging, percutaneous biopsy could help improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Torsion of a giant pedunculated liver hemangioma mimicking acute appendicitis: a case report [^114bKqxk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hemangiomas are the most common benign neoplasms affecting the liver, occurring at all ages. Most cases are asymptomatic and do not require any treatment. Rarely, hemangiomas can be pedunculated. If they undergo torsion and infarction, they become symptomatic.

Herein, we report the case of a 31-year-old male presenting with features of acute appendicitis: continuous right iliac fossa pain, rebound, guarding tenderness at McBurney's point, nausea, anorexia, shifted white blood cell count, and a Mantrels score of 6. At laparotomy, a normal appendix was observed, and a torsioned pedunculated liver hemangioma turned out to be the cause.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^1124JUhX]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Hemangioendothelioma is a rare, malignant sarcomatous tumor of endothelial origin. Histologically, the vacuolated endothelial cells are arranged in short cords and strands in a background of myxohyaline stroma. Multiple lesions are usually present at the time of diagnosis.

- **Typical imaging features**: The lesions usually show heterogeneous density on CT and heterogeneous signal intensity on MRI. On contrast-enhanced imaging, various patterns have been described: (a) peripheral nodular arterial enhancement followed by wash-out, (b) rim-like arterial enhancement with wash-out during the portal venous phase, and (c) inversed target sign with/without wash-out during the portal venous phase.

- **Misleading imaging features**: Enhancement pattern during the arterial phase may be misinterpreted.

- **Tricks to avoid misinterpretation**: Large avascular lacunae are usually present. The enhancement pattern is not globular.

- **Fig. 12 explains**: Hemangioendothelioma (biopsy-proven). Three markedly hypodense lesions with moderate peripheral enhancement are appreciable in late arterial phase CT (a); mild progressive centripetal filling is recognizable in portal venous (b) and delayed (c) phase, with persisting large hypodense areas.

### Clinically significant ascites as an indication for resection of rapidly involuting congenital hepatic hemangiomas [^1136Eb5F]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors of infancy and are divided into two main types: rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas (RICH) and non-involuting congenital hemangiomas. RICH typically involute by 12 months and are often asymptomatic. Surgical resection is rare. Indications for surgical resection include rupture, rapid growth, consumptive coagulopathy, and abdominal pain.

We present two patients from different institutions who both developed clinically significant ascites as the RICH involuted, prompting surgical resection. This is a new indication for resection.

### Giant liver hemangioma: Therapy by enucleation or liver resection [^111neBVS]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Hemangioma is the most common primary tumor of the liver. The widespread use of ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT) has made the diagnosis more common. Although the vast majority of hemangiomas are diagnosed incidentally and are asymptomatic, treatment is still controversial. Surgery is the treatment of choice, especially in giant, symptomatic hemangiomas and uncertainty of diagnosis.

Twenty-two patients (median age: 46 years) underwent resection (n = 12) or enucleation (n = 10) for liver hemangioma from 1989 to 2002. The primary indication for surgery was abdominal pain. Ten patients who were treated by enucleation were compared with twelve patients who were treated by liver resection. Mean tumor size was 90 mm, with a range of 40–270 mm. There were no statistically significant differences in tumor size, preoperative liver function tests, hemoglobin levels, and platelet counts between the two groups.

- **Operative time**: The operative time was longer in the resection group, with the difference being statistically significant (p = 0.048).

- **Blood transfusion and blood loss**: Blood transfusion requirement and blood loss during the intraoperative period were higher in the resection group (p = 0.025, p = 0.01, respectively).

- **Postoperative complications**: There were three postoperative complications: one in the enucleation group (pleural effusion) and two in the resection group (liver abscess and wound infection).

There was no surgery-related mortality in either group. Although most hemangiomas can be removed by enucleation or liver resection with low morbidity and mortality, if the location and number of hemangiomas are appropriate, enucleation is the preferred choice.

Angiosarcoma

- **Histopathologic features**: Angiosarcoma is a rare mesenchymal hepatic malignant tumor, accounting for less than 2% of all primary liver neoplasms. Histologically, it consists of fusiform or pleomorphic cells developing in pre-existing vascular spaces. Angiosarcoma is often multifocal at the time of diagnosis, with extra-hepatic localizations typically within the spleen and lungs.

- **Typical imaging features**: In the US, angiosarcoma appears heterogeneously hyperechoic, and intralesional cystic spaces are usually present. On CT, angiosarcoma appears heterogeneously hypodense and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with a heterogeneous increase of diffusion restriction. The lesions show irregularly shaped intralesional or peripheral foci of enhancement during the arterial phase, with progressive incomplete enhancement on portal venous and delayed phases, both on CT and MRI.

- **Misleading imaging features**: The foci of arterial enhancement might in some way simulate liver hemangiomas' enhancement globules both on CT and MRI.

Figure 11: Angiosarcoma (biopsy-proven). B-mode US (a) shows an ill-defined hyperechoic lesion with multiple cystic lacunae. Multiple discrete foci of increased enhancement are appreciable on arterial phase CT (b). On T2-weighted images (c), two large heterogeneously hyperintense lesions and at least two homogeneously hyperintense satellite nodules are appreciable. The lesions show peripheral foci of increased enhancement in the arterial phase (d), followed by centripetal filling with multiple avascular lacunae.

### Imaging and pathologic findings of hepatic small vessel hemangioma [^114nd4UJ]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic small vessel hemangioma represents a distinct yet very rare pathologic entity of the liver. This entity has also been previously referred to as adult capillary hemangioma of the liver and congenital noninvoluting hemangioma. Imaging findings are not definitive, and biopsy or resection is ultimately necessary. Pathologically, these represent vasoformative abnormalities with infiltrative margins that can potentially mimic hepatic angiosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry can help differentiate hepatic small vessel hemangioma from angiosarcoma. Given the infiltrative growth pattern and unknown outcomes, resection and/or close follow-up has been recommended. Recently, the term hepatic small vessel neoplasm has been coined in view of the unknown outcomes and some concerning findings on molecular analysis. We report two cases of this unusual entity and describe its imaging, gross pathologic, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features.

### Diagnosis, management, and outcomes of 115 patients with hepatic hemangioma [^115YKGoD]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatic hemangiomas are congenital vascular malformations and the most common benign hepatic tumors. As the use of cross-sectional imaging increases, benign hepatic tumors, particularly hemangiomas, are encountered more frequently; therefore, clinicians should be familiar with the most appropriate diagnostic tests, management, and outcomes for patients with hepatic hemangioma.

- **Study design**: All patients with a primary diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma referred for surgical evaluation at our institution between January 1992 and December 2000 were identified from a prospective database. Demographics, presentation, tumor characteristics, diagnostic studies, surgical procedures, and outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: Of the 115 patients in the study, nearly half were asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients, abdominal pain or discomfort was the most common presenting symptom. At our institution, the diagnosis of hemangioma was established by ultrasonographic studies in 57% of patients tested, by CT scan in 73%, and by MRI in 84%. In patients with large tumors considered for resection, direct angiography or, more recently, CT angiography confirmed the diagnosis in 27 of 29 patients (93%). Enucleation was performed in 31 (60%) of the 52 patients who underwent surgical resection; 63 patients were observed. Postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (25%), and there were no perioperative deaths. Of the patients with symptoms before resection, 96% experienced resolution of symptoms after the operation.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^111Z2tke]. Insights into Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) represents an excellent problem-solving technique in newly US-detected liver hemangiomas. Cavernous hemangiomas typically show peripheral discontinuous globular enhancement during the arterial phase, followed by progressive centripetal filling during the portal venous phase leading to iso-enhancement relative to adjacent vessels in the late phase; avascular lacunae may be present. Capillary hemangiomas show rapid centripetal complete enhancement during the arterial phase. Atypical enhancement patterns may be observed, especially in lesions showing atypical features at the basal US.

On CT, liver hemangiomas typically appear hypodense compared to the adjacent parenchyma on unenhanced acquisitions, showing density values similar to hilar vessels because of their vascular lacunae. On post-contrast acquisitions, they typically show the same enhancement pattern described for CEUS, i.e. peripheral discontinuous globular arterial enhancement with progressive centripetal filling in cavernous hemangiomas and complete arterial filling in capillary hemangiomas. The enhancing globules must show density values like the adjacent vessels. No satellite nodules should be observed, whereas a transient hepatic attenuation difference (THAD) may surround small flash-filling hemangiomas, probably because of the presence of intralesional artero-portal shunts.

Benign mimickers: Focal nodular hyperplasia

- **Histopathologic features**: Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the second most common benign solid liver lesion and is often incidentally detected during imaging studies. According to the WHO, FNH should not be considered a benign neoplasm, but rather a hyperplastic response of hepatocytes to a pre-existing vascular anomaly. A prominent central feeding artery is usually observed, surrounded by a fibrotic radial fibrous scar and hypertrophic hepatocytes. The biliary drainage system is often malformed and insufficient.

- **Typical imaging features**: Given its histological composition, FNH has echogenicity, density, and signal intensity similar to adjacent normal liver tissue. On ultrasound (US), FNH is often barely recognizable, appearing slightly hypoechoic compared to the adjacent liver. The so-called spoke-wheel pattern may be observed on color-Doppler. On unenhanced CT, FNH is usually slightly hypodense, whereas on unenhanced MRI, it is often recognizable only on T2-weighted images as a slightly hyperintense lesion. On contrast-enhanced studies, FNH shows hyperenhancement in the arterial phase with a relatively hypo-enhancing central scar, followed by substantial iso-enhancement in the subsequent phases of the dynamic study, with central scar relative hyperenhancement. Thanks to its real-time evaluation, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may enable the highlighting of the centrifugal arterial filling of the lesion. On the other hand, MRI with the use of hepatospecific contrast material allows for confirmation of the presence of functioning hepatocytes in the lesion.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of histologically proven liver hemangiomas [^112EEyjs]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Differentiation of small and atypical hemangiomas from other hepatic masses using imaging methods can be difficult, especially in patients with underlying malignant disease. Therefore, contrast-enhanced ultrasound was assessed in patients with histologically confirmed hemangiomas, focusing on contrast-enhancing kinetics and tumor characteristics.

In a study involving 58 patients with indeterminate hepatic lesions identified by at least two imaging methods (ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging), ultrasound-guided liver biopsy confirmed hemangioma. These patients were suspected of having hepatic neoplasm due to underlying malignant disease (n = 41), liver cirrhosis (n = 15), or lesion growth (n = 2). All underwent nonlinear, low mechanical index real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound scanning with bolus injections of SonoVue.

Peripheral nodular arterial enhancement was detected in 43 patients (74%), while the typical metastatic peripheral rim-like enhancement was not observed. Strong homogenous arterial enhancement was found in 9 out of 58 (16%) patients. In 6 patients (10%), the arterial contrast enhancement pattern could not be determined due to the very small size of the lesions or fibrotic nodules. Forty-five (78%) of the hemangiomas showed homogenous centripetal filling within 180 seconds.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound demonstrates typical hemangioma imaging characteristics, such as peripheral nodular contrast enhancement and the iris-diaphragm sign, in a high percentage of patients with undetermined lesions.

### Hepatic hemangiomas: Subtype classification and development of a clinical practice algorithm and registry [^117TsTvz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Hepatic hemangiomas, though histologically benign, may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in afflicted infants. The literature presents much confusion regarding the natural history and treatment options for hepatic hemangiomas. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic, self-limiting lesions to congestive heart failure associated with high-volume vascular shunting to fulminant hepatic failure with hypothyroidism, abdominal compartment syndrome, and death. There has been little rationale to choose among observation, corticosteroid, other pharmacologic agents, arterial embolization, hepatic artery ligation, resection, or liver transplantation for any given patient.

We analyzed several recent retrospective radiologic analyses and pathologic studies to determine whether hepatic hemangiomas could be categorized, allowing prediction of their natural history and rational choice of therapies based on their clinical presentation and radiographic appearance.

We propose that hepatic hemangiomas do not represent a single entity but rather three principal categories of lesions: focal, multifocal, and diffuse. Because these categories represent different anatomical and physiological variants, they may respond differently to previously anecdotally applied treatment regimens. With input from international multidisciplinary authorities on hemangiomas, we developed and proposed a clinical practice algorithm for the evaluation and management of hepatic hemangiomas. Toward that end, we propose a plan to institute a web-based intern registry to facilitate data collection and analysis.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a rare but serious condition that often requires immediate intervention and quick diagnosis of the correct etiology to prevent mortality. Congenital hepatic hemangioma (CHH) is an example of an extrathoracic etiology of PH. Herein, we report the case of a newborn with a giant liver hemangioma, who presented with an early onset of PH and was successfully treated with intra-arterial embolization.

This case illustrates the importance of suspicion and prompt evaluation of CHH and related systemic arteriovenous shunts among infants with unexplained PH.

### Postnatal treatment and evolution patterns of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma: A case series of 29 patients [^1146gUD7]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

This series of observations of 29 patients with giant fetal hepatic hemangioma (GFHH) is the largest yet reported and is the first to have a long enough follow-up to allow comparison between the untreated and treated groups, with quantification of tumor volume over time in a large cohort of patients.

- **Clinical characteristics and outcome**: In our study, we present 29 cases of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma diagnosed prenatally using two-dimensional ultrasound between 22 and 39 weeks gestation, all identified as isolated in apparently asymptomatic routine second- and third-trimester scans. The most striking prenatal ultrasound feature was the incidental detection of a huge solid mass in the fetal liver. Additionally, fetal MRI was used as a diagnostic technique in three cases, as it has been reported as an additional tool for the study of hepatic infantile hemangiomas in the fetus. All cases were evaluated using postnatal color Doppler ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or MRI. Twenty-seven cases were finally diagnosed by typical imaging findings, all of which were focal type. One of these lesions was resected at the age of 3 months because postnatal contrast-enhanced CT and MRI suggested hepatoblastoma with AFP increase. One patient experienced thrombocytopenia and anemia, and propranolol and methylprednisolone failed to shrink the tumor. Enhanced CT at the age of 7 months showed a large malignant tumor in the abdomen and pelvis, with doubtful multiple metastases in the liver and peritoneum. Splenic cavernous hemangioma and liver hemangioma were found on postoperative pathology.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^115fikD2]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Peliosis hepatis is an extremely rare condition characterized by the presence of multiple blood-filled cysts in the liver parenchyma. It is the consequence of hepatocellular necrosis that determines sinusoids' wall damage and central vein dilatation.

- **Histopathologic features**: Given the rarity of these lesions, variable imaging features have been described in different case reports. In the US, the vascular lakes appear hypo-/anechoic with possible flow signal on Doppler examination. On unenhanced CT, the lesions have been mostly described as hypodense, whereas on MRI they usually appear hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted ones. After contrast material injection, progressive centrifugal enhancement has been mostly described, but the centripetal pattern may also be observed.

- **Misleading imaging features**: Given the variable imaging appearance described in the literature, it is not possible to identify peculiar misleading features.

- **Tricks to avoid misinterpretation**: Among the variable imaging features that have been described for peliosis, globular centripetal enhancement has never been observed; therefore, its absence in lesions larger than 2 cm enables ruling out hemangiomas.

### Huge fetal hepatic hemangioma: Prenatal diagnosis on ultrasound and prognosis [^114nAkui]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Fetal tumors are a diverse but rare group of conditions with significant implications for the health of both mother and fetus. Approximately 15% of fetal tumors are hemangiomas, which usually appear on the face, neck, and limbs. Fetal hepatic hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors present at birth, distinct from vascular malformations. They are characterized as either rapidly involuting or non-involuting based on their clinical progression. Fetal hepatic hemangiomas are rarely reported; hence, their exact incidence rate remains undetermined.

Parents and clinicians are advised to regularly monitor congenital hepatic hemangiomas, which reach maximum size at birth and, in some cases, gradually disappear. Small hepatic hemangiomas are often asymptomatic and seldom require treatment. In contrast, huge hepatic hemangiomas (mean diameter > 4 cm) are less frequently reported than small hepatic hemangiomas and can cause serious complications. Without prompt intervention, neonatal mortality rates reach 30–100%.

Hence, studies on the prenatal diagnosis of huge hepatic hemangiomas are important. Information gained by systematically monitoring fetuses for tumor progression and related complications will help obstetricians decide on timely delivery and appropriate neonatal treatments. This retrospective study examined the ultrasound characteristics and prognosis of six huge fetal hepatic hemangiomas in South China. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the incidence of this disease in South China and the successful use of propranolol as treatment.

### Liver imaging and pregnancy: What to expect when your patient is expecting [^112iTkXg]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

During or after pregnancy, hemangiomas can grow (Fig. 11) but they are indolent. Spontaneous hepatic rupture is exceptional. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is asymptomatic, does not grow, and does not require follow-up.

- **Figure 11**: During a routine US (a), hyperechoic hepatic lesions (arrows) were seen in a 37-year-old pregnant woman. These lesions showed no vascularization on Doppler US nor stiffness, and the liver had no signs of chronic liver disease, so they were classified as hemangiomas. Months later, one lesion slightly grew, and an unenhanced MR was performed (b), showing high T2 signal with low T1 signal (upper row) and no diffusion restriction (lower row), thus confirming the diagnosis of hemangiomas.

If an unknown lesion presents fat, hepatic adenoma (HCA) is suggested. HCAs have non-specific imaging characteristics on US and CT; therefore, MRI should be performed. If malignancy is suspected, breast cancer should be suspected as it is the most common primary cancer in pregnancy, characterized by hypoenhancing liver metastases. Cystic components may suggest a mucinous gastrointestinal or ovarian primary, while hyperenhancing lesions suggest a metastatic choriocarcinoma, sarcoma, and renal or neuroendocrine tumor. US surveillance is recommended each trimester in pregnant patients with a history of extrahepatic cancers known to metastasize to the liver. Biopsy may also be considered whenever needed in incidental focal lesions, severe liver dysfunction in transplanted patients, or in cases of severe liver disease. Liver biopsy appears to be safe and well tolerated in the first trimester.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^114s8Y63]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Liver hemangiomas are common lesions found in the liver, which are characterized by distinct histopathologic features. At pathology, liver hemangiomas appear as well-delineated blue-red lesions that tend to collapse on sectioning. They consist of blood-filled vascular spaces lined by a flattened endothelium and supported by fibrous septa.

Three histological subtypes of liver hemangiomas have been described:

- **Cavernous hemangiomas**: These are the most common histological subtype and may become very large. They are prevalently constituted by large vascular spaces with minimal amounts of fibrous septa. Thrombosis and calcification may be observed, typically in larger lesions.
- **Capillary hemangiomas**: These are usually small (less than 2 cm) and are characterized by small vascular spaces surrounded by extensive connective tissue.
- **Sclerosed hemangiomas**: These are the consequence of extensive fibrosis following thrombosis and obliteration of vascular spaces. They are also known as thrombosed or hyalinized hemangiomas.

US is often the first-line imaging modality for evaluating liver hemangiomas. In the US, hemangiomas usually appear as homogeneously hyperechoic solid masses with sharp margins and posterior acoustic enhancement. This pattern is typical for cavernous hemangiomas because of the high number of interfaces between vascular spaces and fibrous septa and of the slow blood flows, but capillary and sclerosed hemangiomas may appear iso-hypoechoic. Large lesions usually show lobulated margins and tend to become inhomogeneous because of degenerative changes and thrombosis. The adjacent liver parenchyma shows normal echogenicity.

### Screening for infantile hepatic hemangioma in patients with cutaneous infantile hemangioma: A multicenter prospective study [^1142uitt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasonography has been proposed to screen for infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) in patients with multiple cutaneous infantile hemangiomas (IHs). The aim of this study was to establish the optimal cutoff point for the number of cutaneous IHs needed to screen for IHH.

We performed a prospective, multicenter study to screen for IHH in patients younger than 9 months who had multiple cutaneous IHs (n ≥ 3) on ultrasonography. For comparison, a group of patients with 1 or 2 focal cutaneous IHs was also recruited.

In total, 676 patients with at least 3 cutaneous IHs and 980 patients with 1 or 2 focal cutaneous IHs were enrolled. Thirty-one patients were found to have IHH. A higher number of cutaneous IHs was associated with an increased risk of IHH (R = 0.973; P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that 5 cutaneous IHs was the optimal cutoff point to screen for IHH, with an area under the curve of 0.872 (P < .001; 95% confidence interval, 0.789–0.955).

This was an uncontrolled study. Screening for IHH is recommended in patients younger than 9 months who present with 5 or more cutaneous IHs.

### Invasive management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma [^113zAM5P]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Hepatic hemangioma is common among benign liver tumors and usually grows slowly. About 50–70% of hepatic hemangiomas are asymptomatic, and management is not necessary; however, management should be considered in symptomatic patients. The optimal management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma depends on multiple factors. Invasive management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma mainly consists of surgery and interventional radiology, including transarterial embolization, ablation, percutaneous sclerotherapy, and percutaneous argon-helium cryotherapy. Although both surgery and interventional radiology are promising in the management of symptomatic hepatic hemangioma, multiple and/or giant hemangiomas represent a clinical dilemma because the complication rate and recurrence rate are relatively high, and symptom relief is not always achieved. However, a review of recent advances in treatment is lacking. We therefore summarized the invasive management techniques for symptomatic hepatic hemangioma to potentially facilitate clinical decision-making.

### Management of hepatic haemangioma in pregnancy [^1134Gaqk]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Hepatic cavernous haemangioma is a benign tumour of vascular origin found within the liver. Often incidentally diagnosed, the management of these vascular masses is frequently determined by the size of the mass and the symptoms associated with its compression of adjacent structures. Tumours greater than 10 cm are known as giant haemangiomas and are associated with increased risks of compression symptoms, coagulopathies, and haemorrhage. Known to express hormone receptors for oestrogen, intervention for these masses remains controversial in the setting of pregnancy, where concerns for tumour growth and life-threatening complications are increased. Here we present the case of a woman in her 30s, recently diagnosed with a giant haemangioma and found to be pregnant, their management, and a review of the literature.

### Postnatal treatment and evolution patterns of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma: A case series of 29 patients [^112y6Ea9]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Of the 29 children, 25 were referred to our hospital immediately after birth, and the remaining four had a history of previous visits to other hospitals. The age at postnatal presentation was 17 ± 13 days. Five children had varying degrees of heart failure immediately after birth; two had cutaneous hemangiomas on the left or right eyelid.

- **Imaging features**: The maximum diameter of the first postnatal ultrasound was 6.4 ± 1.8 cm. Twenty-eight neonates had solitary lesions, whereas only one had multiple lesions combined with splenic and retroperitoneal hemangioma. Twenty-two lesions were located in the right lobe of the liver, four lesions in the left, and three lesions at the junction. There were 8 cases with echocardiography evidence of pulmonary hypertension, 11 cases had a cardiothoracic ratio > 0.6, and 4 cases had hepatic arteriovenous fistula (AVF).

- **Laboratory testing**: Four neonates had elevated TSH, four had anemia, six had thrombocytopenia, 19 had coagulation abnormalities, and 19 had elevated liver enzymes. Albumin levels were 34.0 ± 4.1 g/l, and methemoglobin levels were 48,209 ± 36,537 ng/ml.

Demographics and clinical features of the patients are shown in the table.

Table 1: Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Study Population

- **Group management results**: All were evaluated by using postnatal color Doppler ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or MRI. Twenty-seven patients with focal hepatic hemangioma diagnosed by typical imaging findings were divided into an observation group and a treatment group.

### Huge fetal hepatic hemangioma: Prenatal diagnosis on ultrasound and prognosis [^113zoQ5t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Our results suggest that accurate prenatal diagnosis and regular monitoring of fetuses with huge hepatic hemangiomas may improve prognosis and help avert serious complications. Basing postnatal treatments on prenatal imaging findings may help reduce the perinatal mortality rate due to this condition. Our findings may assist physicians in choosing the best mode and time of delivery, as well as the appropriate treatment for these fetuses and neonates. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the incidence rate (0.64/10,000) of huge congenital hepatic hemangiomas in South China. We intend to perform a prospective, controlled study to further investigate whether oral propranolol, with or without dexamethasone, is effective for the management of huge congenital hepatic hemangiomas.

### Hepatic cavernous hemangioma with atypical peripheral rim activity on hepatic blood pool imaging [^116ksHeV]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Hemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor. Hepatic blood pool imaging is an effective technique with a specificity approaching 100%. Typically, hemangiomas are completely filled on hepatic blood pool imaging. However, incomplete fill-in can be seen in larger hemangiomas complicated with thrombosis, fibrosis, or bleeding. We report a hepatic cavernous hemangioma with atypical peripheral rim activity.

Hepatic cavernous hemangiomas are usually small and asymptomatic. They are typically discovered incidentally, and only a few require treatment. However, giant hemangiomas may cause symptoms, which indicate the need for treatment. This study describes four cases of symptomatic giant hepatic hemangiomas successfully treated with transcatheter arterial embolization, using polyvinyl alcohol particles. There were no complications. Follow-up with clinical and imaging examinations showed a disappearance of symptoms and a decrease in the size of lesions.

### I thought it was a hemangioma! A pictorial essay about common and uncommon liver hemangiomas' mimickers [^115bVkKG]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Tricks to avoid misinterpretation:

- **Focal nodular hyperplasias (FNHs)**: FNHs' enhancement has no globular pattern; in lesions larger than 2 cm, this feature enables safely excluding the diagnosis of a hemangioma. Moreover, FNHs appear hypointense in comparison to adjacent vessels in portal venous and equilibrium phases, and isointensity is appreciable on hepatobiliary phase MR images. Substantial iso-intensity/density on unenhanced imaging and the absence of a "light bulb sign" on T2-weighted images enable the exclusion of a hemangioma diagnosis in lesions of every size. In the US, FNHs show no hyperechogenicity, and centripetal enhancement may be depicted on CEUS.

- **Focal hepatic steatosis**:
	- **Histopathologic features**: Focal steatosis refers to an area of increased intrahepatocyte fat content within the liver parenchyma. The most probable pathophysiologic mechanism underlying focal steatosis is the presence of an aberrant vein communicating with intrahepatic portal branches, leading to a focal perfusion change with subsequent metabolic alterations.

	- **Typical imaging features**: Focal steatosis appears as an ill-defined area of increased echogenicity in the US, usually in a subcapsular location. On unenhanced CT, focal steatosis shows slight hypodensity compared to a healthy liver. A signal intensity drop is observed on out-of-phase T1-weighted images, whereas the lesion appears isointense to the adjacent liver on all other MRI sequences. In contrast-enhanced imaging studies, focal steatosis shows the same enhancement dynamic as the adjacent liver in every phase.

- **Misleading imaging features**: Focal hyperechogenicity can be challenging to interpret correctly.

### Congenital hepatic hemangioma: An unusual case report of pulmonary hypertension [^1147sXtD]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

The newborn in the case study presented with symptoms and signs consistent with pulmonary hypertension (PH), although she had no severe lung diseases or structural cardiovascular system abnormalities. She had a noncardiac cause of PH secondary to extracardiac shunting from arteriovenous malformations in the liver. Hepatic tumors among pediatric patients are rare, accounting for only 2% — 3% of all pediatric solid tumors. Infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) is the most common hepatic tumor occurring in infancy. However, congenital hepatic hemangioma (CHH) is a rare condition. The precise incidence is unknown, but it likely occurs in less than 1% of all infants.

The mean age of onset of PH due to congenital arteriovenous malformations in the liver is reported to be 4 — 5 years of age; nevertheless, both can be discovered during the neonatal and early infantile periods. Furthermore, the shunt vessel size in CHH does not correlate with the emergence of PH. The mortality rate of PH caused by CHH is approximately 40–50% in utero and generally reaches its peak size before or at birth. Newborns may present with thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, intratumoral bleeding, and anemia after birth. Meanwhile, CHH can act as an arteriovenous fistula causing life-threatening high-output cardiac failure and respiratory distress.

Similarly, our patient had symptoms characteristic of PH, tachypnea, and cardiomegaly after birth. Liver ultrasonography is the most often performed initial diagnostic test for the radiologic diagnosis of CHH, but MRI and CT are the modalities of choice for radiologic confirmation of CHH. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis and follow-up of a special type of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma [^1145eRpe]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the dynamic monitoring and treatment of hepatic hemangiomas, and management is tailored to tumor classification and the newborn's clinical condition. Fetuses with hepatic hemangiomas should have an ultrasound scan immediately after birth, particularly for giant fetal hepatic hemangioma. Asymptomatic infants are generally monitored for at least one year, as most hemangiomas regress spontaneously by age one year. Symptomatic cases presenting with dyspnea, heart failure, or hypothyroidism require medical treatment, transhepatic arterial embolization, or surgical resection. Propranolol is the first choice for treating hepatic hemangiomas in infants and children. In addition, combining rapamycin with propranolol and glucocorticoids may enhance therapeutic outcomes; however, their side effects are relatively significant. In children with a poor response to medical treatment, high-flow arteriovenous shunting, and rapidly deteriorating cardiac function, urgent transcatheter hepatic arteriovenous fistula embolization is highly effective. When medical treatment fails and symptoms are severe, with focal or multiple lesions, surgical resection is effective.

Regardless of the treatment plan, regular follow-up evaluations should be conducted through ultrasound examination to make the most reasonable adjustments promptly. Ultrasound is non-invasive, effective, inexpensive, and practical for diagnosing hepatic hemangiomas. Its continuous dynamic scanning and color Doppler ultrasound provide detailed insights into the blood supply of the tumor and the function of other blood vessels in the body.

### Congenital hepatic hemangioma: An unusual case report of pulmonary hypertension [^111UHdCb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a rare but serious condition that often requires immediate intervention and quick diagnosis of the correct etiology to prevent mortality. Congenital hepatic hemangioma (CHH) is an example of an extrathoracic etiology of PH. Herein, we report the case of a newborn with a giant liver hemangioma, who presented with an early onset of PH and was successfully treated with intra-arterial embolization. This case illustrates the importance of suspicion and prompt evaluation of CHH and related systemic arteriovenous shunts among infants with unexplained PH.

### Tumor size is not a criterion for resection during the management of giant hemangioma of the liver [^112yFZcd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors. The management of giant (≥ 5 cm) hemangioma of the liver remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of tumor size on postoperative outcomes after hepatectomy in patients with giant hemangioma of the liver.

- **Methods**: Patients who were subjected to resection because of giant liver hemangioma between December 2006 and July 2012 were grouped by largest tumor size: 5–10 cm (group A) and 10–15 cm (group B). All patients underwent detailed preoperative assessments. Clinicopathologic features were analyzed, and univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors that correlated independently with any complication, as well as the intraoperative red blood cell transfusion requirement. Long-term outcomes were assessed with a median follow-up of 56 months.

- **Results**: One hundred and ninety patients, mean age 46 years, were included. The 146 patients with tumors 5–10 cm in size were compared with the remaining 44 patients with tumors 10–15 cm in size. The differences in postoperative morbidity (29.86% vs. 41.30%, P = 0.150) and duration of hospitalization (11.06 ± 7.02 days vs. 12.17 ± 7.74 days, P = 0.465) between group A and group B did not reach statistical significance. Operation time, blood loss, and transfusion volume of group B were greater than those of group A. No perioperative deaths occurred and no recurrences were registered during follow-up in both groups. The results of univariate and multivariate analysis showed that diameter was not an independent risk factor of postoperative complications.
