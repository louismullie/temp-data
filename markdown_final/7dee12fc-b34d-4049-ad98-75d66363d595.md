## Question

How does acute suppurative otitis media differ from serous otitis media?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how acute suppurative otitis media (AOM/ASOM) differs from serous otitis media (OME), clarifying definitions, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic otoscopic criteria, management, natural history, complications, and the key distinguishing features that guide treatment decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and terminology. Then, I should review pathophysiology and typical etiologies. Next, I will contrast clinical presentation, followed by the otoscopic and adjunctive diagnostic findings that separate AOM from OME. After that, I need to outline evidence-based management for each condition. Finally, I'll synthesize natural history, complications, and a succinct rule-in/rule-out summary anchored in guideline criteria [^113LJRNc] [^112QStUz] [^112YAxw6] [^1142nRLf].

> Let me first confirm the definitional framework to avoid conflating entities. Acute suppurative otitis media is essentially acute otitis media, an infection of the middle ear with purulent inflammation and acute signs of middle ear inflammation, whereas serous otitis media refers to otitis media with effusion, that is, fluid in the middle ear without the acute inflammatory signs or symptoms of infection and is often termed "glue ear" in common parlance [^117FxXQs] [^112YAxw6] [^11378QAH].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology and etiology to ensure the clinical distinctions rest on biologic plausibility. AOM represents an active infectious process, most often bacterial, commonly following a viral upper respiratory infection that impairs Eustachian tube function and permits bacterial ascent from the nasopharynx; typical pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [^117FxXQs] [^112jaiYY]. By contrast, OME reflects middle ear effusion from Eustachian tube dysfunction and lingering mucosal inflammation without acute infection; it frequently follows AOM as a postinflammatory sequela rather than representing a new bacterial infection per se [^11378QAH] [^115BYjSY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before anchoring on symptoms. AOM presents with acute onset of ear pain and systemic inflammatory features such as fever and irritability; moderate to severe otalgia, otalgia lasting at least 48 hours, or temperature above 39 °C signals severe disease that affects management decisions, and analgesia should be prioritized in all cases [^112QStUz] [^114pQr6t] [^117FxXQs]. In OME, I should expect an indolent pattern without acute pain or fever; the predominant complaint is often conductive hearing loss noticed by caregivers or teachers, with possible balance problems or school and behavioral effects, and the absence of acute inflammatory symptoms is a key differentiator from AOM [^112YAxw6] [^112WmHSJ] [^115pv7Js].

> I will now examine the diagnostic otoscopic criteria because that is the crux of accurate classification. For AOM, moderate-to-severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not due to otitis externa are the key diagnostic criteria, and bulging is the main discriminating sign observed in the vast majority of AOM cases; pneumatic otoscopy will show reduced TM mobility due to pressurized effusion, and tympanometry is typically flat (Type B) during acute effusion [^113LJRNc] [^111mFeTC]. For OME, the membrane is usually not bulging; instead, one sees opacification, air-fluid levels, or retraction with impaired mobility on pneumatic otoscopy, and tympanometry may be Type B if effusion is present or Type C with negative pressure reflecting Eustachian tube dysfunction; wait, I should not overstate Type C as proof of effusion — Type B correlates best with effusion, whereas Type C primarily indicates negative middle ear pressure without necessarily confirming fluid, so pneumatic otoscopy remains the primary method to document effusion when diagnosing OME [^116UGv3G] [^113jTFdS] [^111mFeTC].

> Let me think about management of AOM, and I need to ensure alignment with guideline thresholds. First, treat pain early and adequately in all children with AOM; then, use immediate antibiotics for those 6 months or older with severe signs or symptoms, while offering observation with close follow-up for selected children 24 months or older without severe illness, initiating antibiotics if no improvement within 48–72 hours; when antibiotics are indicated, high-dose amoxicillin is generally first line, with amoxicillin-clavulanate favored in selected scenarios such as recent amoxicillin exposure or concurrent conjunctivitis, and randomized trials using strict diagnostic criteria have shown that amoxicillin-clavulanate reduces treatment failure at early follow-up compared with placebo [^114pQr6t] [^112QStUz] [^111eTJjM] [^1142CsAh] [^112KSmBB].

> I should confirm the contrasting management for OME so I don't conflate AOM practices with effusion care. For not-at-risk children with OME, watchful waiting for 3 months from onset or diagnosis is recommended, without routine antibiotics; if effusion persists for 3 months or if the child is at risk, obtain age-appropriate hearing testing and consider tympanostomy tubes for chronic effusion with hearing loss or developmental/learning concerns, with adenoidectomy typically considered when surgery is performed in children aged 4 years and older; shared decision-making and surveillance are emphasized to reflect the favorable natural history and the limited role of medical therapy in OME [^1142nRLf] [^112WmHSJ] [^112YAxw6] [^113zjiVd] [^11378QAH].

> But wait, what about the natural history and risk of complications — do these differ meaningfully and influence thresholds for intervention? Many AOM cases are self-limiting with high short-term clinical success under close observation, yet complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, mastoiditis, or progression to chronic suppurative otitis media can occur, particularly with recurrent or severe disease, which is why accurate diagnosis and follow-up remain critical [^115X3cjw] [^116LN84F]. In OME, most effusions resolve spontaneously within 3 months, but the condition is highly prevalent and can persist, leading to conductive hearing loss and potential adverse effects on speech, language, and school performance if chronic, thereby driving indications for audiologic assessment and possible tympanostomy in selected children [^1142nRLf] [^115BYjSY] [^115pv7Js].

> I should double-check the key distinguishing features to ensure the practical takeaway is crisp. In short, AOM is defined by acute symptoms and hallmark otoscopy with bulging TM or otorrhea, often requiring analgesia and, when severe or in select populations, antibiotics, whereas OME is defined by middle ear fluid without acute inflammatory symptoms, best confirmed by pneumatic otoscopy with supportive tympanometry, and is managed primarily with observation and hearing surveillance, reserving surgery for chronic, symptomatic effusions or at-risk children [^113LJRNc] [^112QStUz] [^116UGv3G] [^113jTFdS] [^1142nRLf] [^112WmHSJ] [^112YAxw6].

Acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM) is an **acute bacterial infection** of the middle ear with **purulent effusion** [^117FxXQs] that presents with ear pain, fever, and a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane [^113LJRNc]; management requires antibiotics and analgesia [^112QStUz] [^114pQr6t], with tympanostomy for recurrent or persistent cases. Serous otitis media (SOM), or otitis media with effusion [^112YAxw6], is a **non-infectious effusion** [^11378QAH] without acute symptoms and is managed with watchful waiting [^1142nRLf] and hearing monitoring [^112WmHSJ]; tympanostomy is considered if effusion persists ≥ 3 months with hearing loss or developmental risk [^112YAxw6]. Accurate diagnosis relies on **pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry** [^116UGv3G] [^113jTFdS] to distinguish ASOM [^113LJRNc] from SOM [^111dRzAJ] and guide appropriate treatment.

### Otitis media [^11378QAH]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Otitis media (OM), or middle ear inflammation, encompasses a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear'), and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss.

OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during 'colds', viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME. Diagnostic modalities include pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, and audiometry.

- **Treatment and management**: Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent, or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays, or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study.

- **Surgical interventions**: Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, further study is needed to fully understand these trends.

### A cost-utility analysis of 5 strategies for the management of acute otitis media in children [^111abAcB]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether antimicrobial therapy in young children with acute otitis media reduces the time to resolution of symptoms, overall symptom burden, and persistence of otoscopic evidence of infection. The researchers used a cost-utility model to evaluate whether immediate antimicrobial treatment seems to be worthwhile, and if so, which antimicrobial agent is most cost-effective.

- **Study design**: The study compared the cost per quality-adjusted life-day of five treatment regimens in children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media: immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, immediate amoxicillin, immediate cefdinir, watchful waiting, and delayed prescription (DP) for antibiotics.

- **Results**: The five treatment regimens, listed in order from least effective to most effective, were DP, watchful waiting, immediate cefdinir, immediate amoxicillin, and immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate. Listed in order from least costly to most costly, the regimens were DP, immediate amoxicillin, watchful waiting, immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, and immediate cefdinir. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin compared with DP was $101.07 per quality-adjusted life-day gained, while the incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate compared with amoxicillin was $2331.28 per quality-adjusted life-day gained.

- **Conclusions**: In children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media and no recent antibiotic exposure, immediate amoxicillin seems to be the most cost-effective initial treatment.

### Management of acute otitis media after publication of the 2004 AAP and AAFP clinical practice guideline [^115uLH6b]. Pediatrics (2010). High credibility.

Observation without initial antibiotic therapy was accepted as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline. The guideline also recommended amoxicillin as the first-line treatment for most children and analgesic treatment to reduce pain if it was present. Our objective was to compare the management of AOM after the publication of the 2004 guideline.

- **Patients and methods**: We analyzed the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2002–2006 (N = 1114), which occurred in US physicians' offices. The patients were children aged 6 months to 12 years who were diagnosed with AOM. The time comparisons were the 30-month periods before and after the guideline. The main outcome was the encounter rate at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported. Secondary outcomes were the identification of factors associated with encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported and antibiotic- and analgesic-prescribing rates.

- **Results**: The rate of AOM encounters at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported did not change after guideline publication (11%-16%; p = 0.103). Independent predictors of an encounter at which no antibiotic-prescribing was reported were the absence of ear pain, absence of reported fever, and receipt of an analgesic prescription. After guideline publication, the rate of amoxicillin-prescribing increased (40%-49%; p = 0.039), the rate of amoxicillin/clavulanate-prescribing decreased (23%-16%; p = 0.043), and the rate of cefdinir-prescribing increased.

### Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis [^112jaiYY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are two of the most common indications for antimicrobial agents in children, responsible for billions of dollars in health care expenditures. The pathogenesis of these conditions is identical. In most cases, a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes children to the development of the acute bacterial complication. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infections predispose the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases.

Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis requires tympanocentesis for acute otitis media and sinus aspiration for acute bacterial sinusitis. Identification of a virus from the nasopharynx does not eliminate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not predictive of the culture results of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.

### Development of an algorithm for the diagnosis of otitis media [^111mFeTC]. Academic Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The relative importance of signs and symptoms in the diagnosis of otitis media has not been adequately evaluated. This has led to a large degree of variation in the criteria used to diagnose otitis media, which has resulted in inconsistencies in clinical care and discrepant research findings.

- **Methods**: A group of experienced otoscopists examined children presenting for primary care. We investigated the signs and symptoms that these otoscopists used to distinguish acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and no effusion. We used recursive partitioning to develop a diagnostic algorithm. To assess the algorithm, we validated it in an independent dataset.

- **Results**: Bulging of the tympanic membrane (TM) was the main finding that otoscopists used to discriminate AOM from OME; information regarding the presence or absence of other signs and symptoms added little to the diagnostic process. Overall, 92% of children with AOM had a bulging TM compared with 0% of children with OME. Opacification and/or an air-fluid level was the main finding that the otoscopists used to discriminate OME from no effusion; 97% of children diagnosed with OME had an opaque TM compared with 5% of children diagnosed with no effusion. An algorithm that used bulging and opacification of the TM correctly classified 99% of ears in an independent dataset.

- **Conclusions**: Bulging of the TM was the finding that best discriminated AOM from OME. The algorithm developed here may prove to be useful in clinical care, research, and education concerning otitis media.

### Acute otitis media [^117FxXQs]. Canadian Family Physician Médecin de Famille Canadien (2007). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis media:

- **Definition**: AOM is defined as an infection of the middle ear space.

- **Pathophysiology**: AOM is mostly caused by bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) followed by viruses.

- **Disease course**: The inflammatory disease due to middle ear space infection, with particular involvement of the tympanic membrane, results in AOM. It presents with clinical symptoms such as earache, otorrhea, headache, fever, general malaise, and hearing impairment. AOM is a self-limiting condition.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AOM is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Antipyrine and benzocaine [^112kYfSn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Antipyrine and benzocaine are indicated for acute otitis media of various etiologies. They provide prompt relief of pain and reduce inflammation in the congestive and serous stages. Additionally, they serve as adjuvant therapy during systemic antibiotic administration for the resolution of the infection. Due to the close anatomical relationship of the eustachian tube to the nasal cavity, otitis media is a frequent problem, especially in children, where the tube is shorter, wider, and more horizontal than in adults.

The application of these substances also facilitates the removal of excessive or impacted cerumen.

### Otitis media with effusion [^117WBZDL]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children 1 to 3 years old with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced-practice nursing to revise the OME guideline.

- **Primary diagnostic method**: The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media.

- **Documentation and assessment**: The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should (1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME; and (2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and evaluate hearing, speech, l

### Panel 7: Otitis media: Treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of recurrent acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media, and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing).

- **Review methods**: All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1,122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary.

- **Conclusions**: Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and the duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age-dependent. Topical antibiotics are the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments.

- **Implications for practice**: Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is essential.

### Panel 1: Epidemiology, natural history, and risk factors [^116jMN93]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The First International Symposium on Recent Advances in Otitis Media (OM) with Effusion was held in Columbus, Ohio, in 1975. The symposium has been organized in the United States every four years since, followed by a research conference to: (a) assess major research accomplishments, (b) identify important research questions and opportunities, (c) develop consensus on definitions and terminology, and (d) establish priorities with short- and long-term research goals. One of the principal areas reviewed quadrennially is epidemiology, natural history, and risk factors.

- **Objective**: To provide a review of recent literature on the epidemiology, natural history, and risk factors for OM.

- **Data sources and review methods**: A search of OM articles in English published from July 2007 to June 2011 was conducted using PubMed and related databases. Those with findings judged important for epidemiology, public health, and/or statistical methods were reviewed.

- **Results**: The literature has continued to expand, increasing understanding of the worldwide burden of OM in childhood, complications from treatment failures, and comorbidities. Novel risk factors, including genetic factors, have been examined for OM susceptibility. Population-based studies in Canada, the United States, and other countries confirmed reductions in OM prevalence. Although most studies concentrated on acute OM (AOM) or OM with effusion (OME), a few examined severe chronic suppurative OM (CSOM), a major public health problem in developing countries and for certain indigenous populations around the world.

- **Conclusions**: The review provides significant insights into the epidemiology and risk factors associated with OM, highlighting ongoing research needs in this field.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® inflammatory ear disease [^112vZAq1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

This document provides evidence-based guidelines for the appropriateness of imaging modalities in cases of inflammatory ear disease, covering both acute and chronic, uncomplicated and complicated otitis media, and otitis externa in adults. Imaging recommendations for initial imaging and postoperative surveillance of cholesteatoma in adults have also been addressed. This document provides guidance for physicians in the choice of imaging while managing cases of complicated or uncomplicated inflammatory conditions of the ear and managing initial presentation or postoperative cases of cholesteatoma.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Evidence assessment of management of acute otitis media: I. The role of antibiotics in treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media [^116AVPji]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

In 1995, more than 5 million episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) accounted for $3 billion in health care expenditures.

- **Objectives**: To synthesize the literature on the natural history of AOM, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated AOM, and the relative effectiveness of specific antibiotic regimens.

- **Data sources**: Seven electronic databases for articles published between 1966 and March 1999, along with reference lists in proceedings, published articles, reports, and guidelines.

- **Study selection**: Two physicians independently assessed each article. Studies addressing AOM in children aged 4 weeks to 18 years old were included; those addressing children with immunodeficiencies or craniofacial abnormalities were excluded. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were used to assess antibiotic effectiveness, and RCTs and cohort studies were used to assess the natural history of AOM. Among the 3491 citations identified, 80 (2.3%) met our inclusion criteria.

- **Data extraction**: Two physicians independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of studies using a validated scale for RCTs and eight quality components for cohort studies.

- **Data synthesis**: Random-effects estimates of pooled absolute rate differences of outcomes were derived, and heterogeneity of both the rates and rate differences was assessed. Children with AOM not treated with antibiotics experienced a 1- to 7-day clinical failure rate of 19% (95% confidence interval: 0.10–0.28) and few suppurative complications. When patients were treated with amoxicillin, the 2- to 7-day clinical failure rate was reduced to 7%.

### Panel 7: Treatment and comparative effectiveness research [^11774gMz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment in children. Controversies regarding antibiotic treatment for OM have accumulated in the past decade, leading to more dilemmas than certainties. The objectives of this article are to provide a state-of-the-art review on achievements in the treatment of all different stages of OM, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media, and to outline future research areas.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Database, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing).

- **Review methods**: All types of articles related to OM treatment published in English between January 2007 and June 2011 were identified. A total of 286 articles related to OM treatment were reviewed by the panel members; 114 relevant quality articles were identified and summarized.

- **Results**: New evidence emerged on the beneficial results of antibiotic treatment compared with observation of AOM in young children who were diagnosed based on stringent criteria. In OME, the main results were related to a nonsignificant benefit of adenoidectomy versus tympanostomy tube placement alone in the treatment of chronic OME in younger children. Other modalities of OM treatment were studied and described herein.

- **Conclusions and implications for practice**: Significant progress has been made in advancing knowledge on the treatment of OM. Areas of potential future research have been identified and outlined.

### A systematic review of patient-reported outcome measures for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1125izsq]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review was to systematically appraise the world literature to identify existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for the assessment of outcomes in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media, to verify the diversity of the individual questionnaire items, to report the methods employed to evaluate the questionnaires, and to identify areas for development in the future.

- **Data sources**: Embase (January 1980-November 2014), MEDLINE (January 1946-November 2014), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (January 1981-November 2014), and PsycINFO (January 1806-November 2014).

- **Review methods**: A systematic literature search was independently undertaken by the two authors according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

- **Results**: Nine original articles were identified, which overall outlined the evaluation of four different questionnaires.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic appraisal of the world literature has identified four PROM questionnaires for use in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media. All four questionnaires evaluate reliability and validity using different psychometric methods. The Chronic Ear Survey questionnaire has been most broadly evaluated and disseminated. All four questionnaires assess static health status. There are many advantages to developing a dynamic one-hit questionnaire to assess the health status of patients having undergone an intervention for chronic suppurative otitis media.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^114LmLKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency.

### Acute otitis media severity of symptom score in a tympanocentesis study [^112iMm7s]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We followed symptoms of children with acute otitis media (AOM) who were enrolled in a clinical trial that included a baseline tympanocentesis. We observed marked and rapid improvement in symptom scores after tympanocentesis. Although symptom scores, measured by the AOM-SOS, correlated with overall clinical assessment and bacteriologic outcome, the early effect of tympanocentesis rendered the AOM-SOS less useful as a primary outcome measure.

### Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: Prospective clinical cohort study [^11543QEb]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The major suppurative complications of acute sore throat, such as quinsy, otitis media, sinusitis, impetigo, or cellulitis, occurred in approximately 1% of patients regardless of whether they were given antibiotics, not given antibiotics, or given delayed antibiotics. We recruited 7,161 patients who did not receive immediate antibiotics, exceeding our minimal sample size calculation. Clinical differences were noticeable between those not prescribed antibiotics, those prescribed antibiotics immediately, and those given delayed antibiotics, for example, purulence, fever, and tonsillar inflammation.

In multivariate analysis, predictors of complications included severe tonsillar inflammation, documented among 13.0% (1,652/12,717) with an odds ratio of 1.92 (95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.89), and severe earache, documented among 5.0% (667/13,323) with an odds ratio of 3.02 (95% confidence interval 1.91 to 4.76). However, the model with both variables had modest prognostic utility, with a bootstrapped area under the receiver operator curve of 0.61 (0.57 to 0.65), and 70% of complications (124/177) occurred where neither was present. The bootstrapped area under the receiver operator curve for a simple clinical score, generated using the sum of these two variables (a score taking the value 0, 1, or 2), was similar at 0.61 (0.57 to 0.65). The predictive value of severe earache was unlikely to be simply an incorrect initial diagnosis, such as a missed diagnosis of otitis media, because severe earache significantly predicted all complications, including quinsy and otitis media.

### Bacterial eradication in the treatment of otitis media [^115awQah]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Drugs differ in their ability to eradicate various pathogens from the middle-ear cavity during acute otitis media (AOM), and these differences clearly affect clinical outcome. Outcome is derived from differences in the association between concentrations of the drugs at the site of infection and the antimicrobial effect (termed pharmacodynamics). These differences are even more marked in the present era of antimicrobial resistance. However, since AOM is a self-limiting disease in most cases, differences in clinical outcome are more difficult to ascertain than those of bacteriological outcome, which is measured within 3–5 days. A favourable clinical outcome, regardless of the bacteriological effect of the drug, can result in false optimism when less-effective antibiotics are used. Inappropriate study design and manipulation of clinical results add to this confusion. In this review, we attempt to highlight the evidence regarding bacteriological response to antibiotics in AOM and to draw attention to potential flaws that may mislead clinicians.

### Effects of Covid-19 lockdown on otitis media with effusion in children: Future therapeutic implications [^115BYjSY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME), also known as serous or secretory otitis media, is one of the most frequent diseases in childhood. An estimated 80% of all children have had at least one episode of OME by the age of 10 years, with a peak prevalence in the first two years of life. It is characterized by the presence of fluid behind an intact tympanic membrane, without signs and symptoms of acute infection, and is defined as chronic when the middle ear effusion persists for more than three months.

OME is commonly a self-limiting condition, but it can be recurrent and chronic in approximately one-third and one-quarter of affected children, respectively. Chronic OME is potentially associated with conductive hearing loss and middle ear complications, often leading to speech and behavioral problems and poor school performance. It represents the most common cause of hearing impairment in children in the developed world, negatively affecting quality of life.

The high prevalence of OME in young children has been associated with the anatomic and functional immaturity of the eustachian tube, a higher rate of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) due to exposure to viruses and bacteria in day care centers, and the often concomitant hypertrophy of the adenoid tissue. The forced isolation of children at home during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has provided an opportunity to verify the impact of nonattendance at day care centers and schools on the prevalence of OME.

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the prevalence of OME before…

### Compositional difference in middle ear effusion: mucous versus serous [^114jy5jY]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Serous otitis media is usually responsive to medical treatment, whereas mucoid otitis media is not. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the compositional difference between serous and mucoid effusion and to investigate whether MUC5AC acts as a major mucin in the middle ear mucosa with mucoid otitis media.

- **Study design**: This study involved a chemical analysis of middle ear effusion and immunostaining of the middle ear mucosa.

- **Methods**: Middle ear effusion samples were collected from 27 patients with mucoid otitis media and 18 patients with serous otitis media. The levels of mucin, lysozyme, secretory immunoglobulin A, and interleukin-8 were measured by dot blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Periodic acid-Schiff and immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal anti-MUC5AC antibody were performed on serial sections of middle ear mucosa with mucoid otitis media.

- **Results**: Mucoid effusions contained higher levels of mucin, lysozyme, secretory immunoglobulin A, and interleukin-8 than did serous effusions. The immunohistological study revealed that MUC5AC mucin was expressed in only a small portion of the goblet cells of middle ear mucosa with mucoid otitis media.

- **Conclusions**: The study suggests that both serous secretions and mucin might make the middle ear effusion more viscous and that mucins other than MUC5AC might have a major role in the viscosity of middle ear effusion. Further study is necessary to identify the major mucins in the middle ear effusion of otitis media with effusion.

### Reducing the frequency of acute otitis media by individualized care [^1172ndJU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

We sought to determine if the use of more stringent diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media (AOM) than currently advocated by the American Academy of Pediatrics, along with tympanocentesis and pathogen-specific antibiotic treatment (individualized care), would result in reducing the incidence of recurrent AOM and consequent tympanostomy tube surgery.

- **Methods**: A 5-year longitudinal, prospective study in Rochester, NY, was conducted from July 2006 to July 2011 involving 254 individualized care children. When this individualized care group developed symptoms of AOM, strict diagnostic criteria were applied, and tympanocentesis was performed. Pathogen resistance to empiric high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (80 mg/kg of the amoxicillin component) led to a change in antibiotics to an optimized choice. Legacy controls (n = 208) were diagnosed using the same diagnostic criteria by the same physicians as the individualized care group and received the same empiric amoxicillin/clavulanate (80 mg/kg of the amoxicillin component) but did not undergo tympanocentesis or antibiotic change. Community control children (n = 1020) were diagnosed according to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines and treated with high-dose amoxicillin (80 mg/kg) without tympanocentesis, as recommended by the guidelines.

- **Results**: 5.9% of children in the individualized care group compared to 14.4% of legacy controls and 27.3% of community controls became otitis prone, defined as three episodes of AOM within a 6-month span or four AOM episodes within a 12-month span (P < 0.0001). 2.4% of the individualized care group compared.

### Diagnostic inaccuracy and subject exclusions render placebo and observational studies of acute otitis media inconclusive [^117T169X]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy and appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria representative of children at greatest risk are of paramount importance in trials evaluating placebo or observation as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management.

- **Methods**: Twelve observational studies spanning the time frame 1958–2005 and 13 natural history studies spanning the time frame 1968–2006 were evaluated for the diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria applied within the study design.

- **Results**: Although a bulging or full tympanic membrane (TM) with effusion is the best indication of a diagnosis of bacterial AOM based on tympanocentesis findings, few observational and natural history studies required a bulging TM. Examination of subject inclusion criteria showed that many subjects did not have AOM but rather had no middle ear disease at all, or they had otitis media with effusion. Exclusion criteria of subjects were also remarkable. Frequently, children under 2 years old were excluded; the mean age among the studies reflected an older age group, unlike the true epidemiology of AOM. Otitis-prone children, those with severe disease, a bulging TM, fever, a definite need for antibiotics, recent antibiotic treatment, recent AOM, or perforation of the TM were often excluded.

- **Conclusions**: Guidelines and some authorities have overlooked or discounted the importance of issues such as inaccurate diagnosis on study entry, broad inclusion criteria, and the creation of bias in exclusion criteria among placebo/natural history trials in AOM.

### Current approaches to otitis media [^111qtShY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed illness in children and is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is increasing among the bacteria implicated in acute otitis media, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. This evolution should stimulate changes in the management of acute otitis media, particularly in the following areas:

- **Improvement in diagnostic accuracy**: Enhanced diagnostic techniques are necessary to identify the exact pathogens.
- **Reduction in antibiotic use**: Limiting unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions can help combat resistance.
- **Selection of the most appropriate drugs at the appropriate dosage**: Careful selection and dosing of antibiotics are crucial for effective treatment.
- **Reduction in duration of treatment**: When possible, reducing treatment duration may be beneficial.
- **Implementation of new vaccines**: New vaccines should be adopted to prevent infections effectively.

These strategies are essential to improve patient outcomes and address the growing issue of antibiotic resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). High credibility.

This update of a 2004 guideline, co-developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME). OME is defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from four new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials.

There is an enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (e.g. steroids, antihistamines, decongestants).

Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without development.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^1142CsAh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment in children with acute otitis media remains controversial.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind trial, children 6 to 35 months of age with acute otitis media, diagnosed using strict criteria, received amoxicillin-clavulanate (161 children) or placebo (158 children) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure from the first dose until the end-of-treatment visit on day 8. The definition of treatment failure was based on the overall condition of the child (including adverse events) and otoscopic signs of acute otitis media.

- **Results**: Treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, compared with 44.9% of the children who received placebo (P < 0.001). The difference between the groups was already apparent at the first scheduled visit (day 3), where 13.7% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, compared with 25.3% of those who received placebo, experienced treatment failure. Overall, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced the progression to treatment failure by 62% (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.59; P < 0.001) and the need for rescue treatment by 81% (6.8% vs. 33.5%; hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Analgesic or antipyretic agents were given to 84.2% and 85.9% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were significantly more common in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group than in the placebo group. A total of 47.8% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group…

### Knowledge and practices relating to the 2004 acute otitis media clinical practice guideline: A survey of practicing physicians [^115FsrYS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify primary care physicians' familiarity with the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) clinical practice guideline and compare their practices with its recommendations.

This was a mail survey conducted between October and December 2004, targeting all active physician members of the Slone Center Office-based Research Network, a national, practice-based, pediatric research network.

The results indicated that the response rate was 276 of 469, or 58.8%. Overall, 90.5% of respondents had read the guideline or summaries of it. Pneumatic otoscopy was consistently used by 16.2% of physicians, used half the time or more by 23.1%, used less than half the time by 34.6%, and never used by 26.2%. Observation was considered a reasonable option for some AOM cases by 88.0% of respondents; over the previous three months, these physicians used observation a median of 10% of the time, with the 25th and 75th percentiles at 5% and 25%, respectively. Regarding concerns that the observation option may increase AOM complications, 75.6% were not at all or only slightly concerned, while 24.4% were moderately or very concerned. Generally, these physicians have altered their antibiotic prescribing practices for AOM to align with the guideline's recommendations since its publication. However, deviations in antibiotic choices were noted, particularly in cases of AOM with severe illness, where only 17.9% followed the recommendation for high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate, and in cases of children who failed treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, where only 27.7% opted for the recommended intramuscular ceftriaxone.

In conclusion, most physicians in this survey are familiar with the AOM guideline, but many do not fully adhere to its recommendations.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113qN9za]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children aged 2 months to 12 years with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM). The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious diseases. This subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other data sources were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations.

The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM but is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making.

### Attenuated TLRs in middle ear mucosa contributes to susceptibility of chronic suppurative otitis media [^113w2eHd]. Human Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

The variability in the recovery of otitis media (OM) is not well understood. Recent data have shown a critical role for toll-like receptors (TLRs) in inflammatory responses to bacteria. It remains unclear whether TLRs-mediated mucosal immunity plays a role in OM recovery. The etiology, pathological profile, and expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, and proinflammatory cytokines were measured in human middle-ear mucosae sampled from three subject groups: non-OM group, chronic otitis-media (COM) group, and chronic suppurative otitis-media (CSOM) group. Of the 72 ears examined, 86.11% of CSOM patients were positive for bacteria.

The cellular makeup of the middle ear mucosa differs among the three groups. Mucosae from the CSOM group presented chronic inflammation or suppurative inflammation in the rudimentary stroma, mainly with infiltration of monocytes and macrophages. The mRNA and protein levels of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 exhibited no difference between the non-OM and COM groups but were significantly lower in the CSOM group. Conversely, there was no significant difference in the TLR9 level among the three groups. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-6 were up-regulated in the CSOM group. This study provides evidence that the variability in clinical otitis media recovery might be associated with the variability in the expression of mucosal TLRs. Reduced TLR levels in the middle-ear mucosa might cause weak host response to bacteria, persistent inflammation, and susceptibility to CSOM.

### Appropriateness of diagnosis and management for otitis media with effusion in pediatric urgent care clinics [^1163asnq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Low credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME)'s clinical presentation is often confused with acute otitis media (AOM) by clinicians. Despite OME guidelines recommending watchful waiting with no antibiotics, rates of antibiotic use remain elevated. The aim of this study was to determine the clinician diagnosis validity and the rates of antibiotics prescribed among pediatric OME patients evaluated in three urgent care clinics within a pediatric health care system.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed a random sample of encounters for children aged 0 to 18 years with a billing diagnosis of OME in 2019. We recorded clinical symptoms, antibiotics prescribed, and the clinicians' diagnosis. We used the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines to assign an AOM diagnosis and compared those with the clinicians' final diagnoses using Pearson χ².

- **Results**: Of the 912 eligible charts, clinicians' final diagnoses were as follows: AOM for 271 (29.7%) patients, OME for 638 (70.0%) patients, and no ear pathology for 3 (0.3%) patients. Antibiotics were prescribed for 519 (56.9%) patients; of those, only 242 (46.6%) had a final clinician diagnosis of AOM. Antibiotic prescribing rates were higher when a clinician diagnosed AOM compared with OME (89.3% vs. 43.2%; P < 0.001). Per American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, up to 273 (29.9%) patients qualified for an AOM diagnosis, but those were not the same as those diagnosed with AOM by clinicians (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: When evaluating children with a billing diagnosis of OME, a third fit a diagnosis of AOM. Clinicians commonly misdiagnosed AOM.

### Effect of antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media on the daily disappearance of middle ear effusion: a placebo-controlled trial [^114XWodg]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). High credibility.

The importance of antimicrobial treatment in reducing the symptoms of acute otitis media (AOM) is well-known. However, the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the duration of middle ear effusion (MEE) and the accompanying hearing impairment remains unclear.

The objective of this study was to determine whether antimicrobial treatment of AOM reduces the duration of MEE.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved a total of 84 children with AOM, aged between 6 months and 15 years. Participants were recruited during various periods: September 14, 1999, to January 4, 2000; October 10, 2005, to December 16, 2005; and September 22, 2009, to June 4, 2012, from children attending an AOM prevention trial and those visiting local outpatient clinics in Oulu, Finland.

Children were randomly allocated to receive either 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin-clavulanate or a placebo mixture per day for 7 days.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome measure was the time to the disappearance of MEE, defined by a normal tympanogram finding (A curve) from both ears on two consecutive measurement days. Parents performed daily tympanometry at home. The study physician performed tympanometry and otoscopy at study entry, after 3 and 7 days, and then weekly until both ears were healthy. The main secondary outcome measures were the time to normal otoscopy findings and the proportion of children without persistent MEE at 14 days and 2 months.

- **Results**: Middle ear effusion disappeared 2.0 weeks (13.7 days) earlier (P = .02) in the antimicrobial group (mean time, 2.7 weeks; 95% CI, 1.7–3.7) than in the placebo group.

### Implications of the AHRQ evidence report on acute otitis media [^115X3cjw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

To familiarize otolaryngologists with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report on acute otitis media (AOM) that reviews the natural history and role of antibiotics in management, the report by the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center (SC-EPC) is the most recent of 15 literature syntheses published by the AHRQ.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (1966 to present), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, BIOSIS, HealthSTAR, and other computerized databases; manual reference search of proceedings, articles, reports, and guidelines.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials and cohort studies relevant to the natural history of AOM and the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. AOM was defined by the 11-member technical expert panel (including 2 authors, RMR and MLC) as middle-ear effusion with the rapid onset of signs or symptoms of middle ear inflammation.

- **Data extraction**: Two physician reviewers at the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center independently rated the articles and extracted data.

- **Data synthesis**: Children receiving placebo or no antimicrobial had a pooled clinical success rate of 81% at 1 to 7 days (95% CI, 72% to 90%), with no increase in suppurative complications when followed closely. Amoxicillin or ampicillin increased the absolute success rate by 12.3% (95% CI, 2.8% to 21.8%) in 5 studies pooled using random effects meta-analysis. The antimicrobial benefit was robust to sensitivity analysis. In contrast, success rates were not influenced by the choice or duration of therapy.

The AHRQ report emphasizes middle-ear effusion and inflammation's rapid onset of signs or symptoms.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^112UW88w]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). High credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasized in the AAP and AAFP guidelines. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high-quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea, the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea, the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children, the NNT would be about ten for normalization of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome.

### Otitis media [^117N8kDP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is diagnosed based on the visualization of a full or bulging tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion. In North America, the distribution of bacteria causing AOM, influenced by pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and antibiotic selection pressure, has led to a predominance of β-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, followed by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although guidelines continue to endorse amoxicillin as the preferred treatment, high dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate would be preferred based on the current otopathogen mix. Antibiotic prophylaxis has fallen into disfavor as a preventative strategy for AOM recurrences.

### Recurrence up to 3.5 years after antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media in very young Dutch children: Survey of trial participants [^116j1y3a]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Some possible limitations deserve further discussion. Firstly, under-reporting or over-reporting of acute otitis media cannot fully be precluded, as the outcomes were based on parental reports. The recurrence rates might therefore be biased, but we would expect a similar effect in both groups, especially as most parents were still blinded when they participated in the survey. Thus, recall bias is unlikely.

Secondly, 70% of the parents who participated in the randomised controlled trial returned the questionnaire. This might potentially have led to the selection of otitis-prone children. The baseline characteristics of the children whose parents responded were, however, similar to those of the original trial population.

Thirdly, we did not conduct a Cox regression analysis, as we measured only the number of re-episodes after three years. Since the mean follow-up times were similar in both groups, we do not expect that Cox regression would have changed our results.

Fourthly, our results can be generalized only to otherwise healthy children in well-resourced settings. Acute otitis media can become a serious illness in children at risk and in those in less-resourced settings, and this may call for a more active approach to treatment.

Fifthly, owing to the delay in reporting the results of this survey, changes in practice since then may have reduced the applicability of our results. As antibiotics are still widely prescribed in young children with acute otitis media, we believe that the results of our study are still applicable to day-to-day practice.

### Chronic otitis media with multiple complications [^116LN84F]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic otitis media (COM) is defined as a persistent infection or inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid air cells. The proximity of the middle ear cleft and mastoid air cells to the intratemporal and intracranial compartments places structures located in these areas at increased risk of infectious complications. The complications of COM are divided into intracranial and extracranial complications. The development and appropriate use of antibiotics have led to a decrease in these potentially devastating complications; however, they continue to occur, and clinical vigilance is required for early detection and treatment. We reported a case with multiple complications, both intracranial and extracranial, secondary to COM.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics, or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops.

### Otitis media and its consequences: beyond the earache [^114CgyV2]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

An international group of multidisciplinary experts on middle-ear and pediatric infections convened to explore consensus on the management of acute otitis media. Initially, informal discussions occurred among several specialists in pediatric infectious disease. The group was then expanded to include a broader spectrum of professionals with complementary expertise in middle-ear disease. Acute otitis media is a very common bacterial infection in children worldwide, leading to excessive antibiotic consumption in most countries and causing substantial burdens of deafness and suppurative complications in developing nations. The group aimed to move beyond existing controversies surrounding guidelines on acute otitis media and proposed actions to reduce the disease burden and microbial antibiotic resistance due to antibiotic use.

- **Diagnosis and treatment considerations**: Defining acute otitis media and ensuring diagnostic accuracy are crucial steps to identify children who will potentially benefit from antibiotic treatment and to eliminate unnecessary prescribing. The group agreed that antibiotics are distributed indiscriminately, even to children without the disease. However, no consensus was reached on whether antibiotics should be given to all appropriately diagnosed children, highlighting the wide range of practices and lack of convincing evidence from observational studies.

The major unanimous concern was an urgent need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116t2xPp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute otitis media, particularly in terms of clinical assessment, AAO-HNSF 2022 guidelines recommend evaluating whether a pediatric patient with otitis media with effusion of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems due to baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors.

### Etiology of acute otitis media in children less than 5 years of age: A pooled analysis of 10 similarly designed observational studies [^116JqXCg]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

This pooled analysis is subject to limitations. First, there was statistically significant heterogeneity among the studies included, despite the use of similar protocols. For example, heterogeneity of PCV7-CRM use across the included studies limits broad interpretation of potential serotype and pathogen replacement. In an attempt to control for this, subgroup analyses were performed, the results were weighted, a random effects model was used, and vaccination status was accounted for whenever possible when formulating the presented conclusions. Nonetheless, some countries had experienced a broad uptake of PCV7-CRM before the conduct of the study, and thus the contribution of herd effects was impossible to factor in. Evaluation after vaccination for a longer duration would be important.

As noted earlier, the pooling methodology relies solely on intrastudy comparisons, meaning that some pooled RR or proportion estimations did not include data from individual studies where such a comparison was not possible. It could, therefore, be argued that this introduces additional bias. However, the strength of the pooling methodology lies precisely in its focus on the consistency (or not) of the comparisons of the values obtained within each study. This should minimize variability that could otherwise arise from inclusion of values from only one group lacking a comparison set of values.

Second, despite efforts to standardize the design across studies, there were important differences in local guidelines for MEF collection. This is a recognized limitation of such prospectively planned pooled analysis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion (update) [^115pv7Js]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for otitis media with effusion, specifically concerning indications for screening, the AAO-HNSF 2016 guidelines recommend not obtaining routine screening for OME in children who are not at risk and do not exhibit symptoms likely attributable to OME. Such symptoms include hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1155AYug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge; however, compared to irrigation or microsuction, it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM.

### Age inconsistency in the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for acute otitis media [^1168yTB4]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics acute otitis media guidelines could reduce antibiotic use. The objective was to compare strategies for diagnosing and treating otitis media: (1) a commonly used, two-criteria strategy, (2) the guidelines' three-criteria algorithm, and (3) initially observing without antibiotics.

- **Methods**: A decision analysis was performed with literature-based parameters. The target population was children presenting to primary care physicians with possible otitis media. Main outcomes were antibiotic use, sick days, mild adverse drug events, and number needed to treat per avoided sick day.

- **Results**: For children aged 2 to 12 years, guideline use, compared with the two-criteria strategy, predicted 67% less antibiotic use, 4% more sick days, and 68% fewer adverse drug events. The number needed to treat for the guideline strategy versus the watch strategy was 6.3 children per avoided sick day.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113KJ5fL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat people with CSOM. This is the first update to the review published in 2021 and is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics compared to placebo, no treatment, or another systemic antibiotic in people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two clinical trial registers up to June 15, 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) to placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period. The participants were people with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms received it.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one and up to two weeks, from two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks.

### Acute otitis media [^114DG2iZ]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2007). High credibility.

Acute otitis media is associated with various factors and symptoms. Exposure to secondhand smoke, conjunctivitis, and bulging tympanic membrane are common associations. Other symptoms include difficulty sleeping, sinusitis, ear pain, and irritability in children. Parental suspicion often aligns with symptoms like ear rubbing, headache, somnolence, and cloudy tympanic membrane. Conditions such as eustachian tube dysfunction, increased white blood cell count, fever, neck pain, poor feeding, and hearing loss can also be related. The presence of enlarged adenoids and a distinctly impaired tympanic membrane's mobility may indicate the condition. Additional factors include otorrhea, cigarette smoking, increased serum CRP, and retracted tympanic membrane, all of which are critical in diagnosing the disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media [^111nc5aK]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis.

Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed.

Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion (update) [^111Wexzb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the AAO-HNSF 2016 guidelines recommend evaluating at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of any of the following at-risk conditions and at 12–18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk before this time):

- **Permanent hearing loss**, independent of OME.
- **Suspected or confirmed speech and language delay or disorder**.
- **Autism spectrum disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders**.
- **Syndromes and craniofacial disorders**, such as Down syndrome or craniofacial disorders, including cognitive, speech, or language delays.
- **Blindness or uncorrectable visual impairment**.
- **Cleft palate** with or without an associated syndrome.
- **Developmental delay**.

These guidelines emphasize the importance of early and accurate assessment of at-risk children to prevent long-term complications associated with otitis media with effusion.

### The clinical course of acute otitis media in high-risk Australian Aboriginal children: A longitudinal study [^111fYrhn]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Our classification of otitis media was based on population-specific, evidence-based guidelines. In this study, where close follow-up was ensured, we used the following criteria:

- **Aerated middle ear**: Normal TM mobility and Type A or C tympanogram.
- **Otitis media with effusion (OME)**: Middle ear effusion behind an intact TM identified by an air-fluid level or bubble seen through a translucent TM, or decreased mobility of the TM, or type B tympanogram (admittance < 0.2 mmho).
- **AOM without perforation**: Clinical diagnosis by health staff or moderate to marked bulging of an intact TM plus decreased TM mobility or Type B tympanogram.
- **AOM with perforation**: Evidence of recent TM perforation provided by clinical history and visualisation of fresh pus in the ear canal. The TM was intact if the perforation had already healed by the time of the assessment, and 'functionally intact' if the TM was bulging and the perforation could only be identified by pneumatic otoscopy.
- **Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)**: TM perforation with otorrhoea present for more than six weeks.
- **Dry perforation**: TM perforation with no discharge seen in the ear canal or within the middle ear space.

AOM was considered cured when there was no bulging and no discharge present on examination. Similarly, we described an episode of AOM as improved if: i) the ear discharge had resolved but bulging of the TM persisted in AOM with perforation, or ii) the bulging of the TM was reduced to mild in AOM without perforation.

### Prognostic factors for treatment failure in acute otitis media [^112nBjM4]. Pediatrics (2017). High credibility.

Antimicrobial treatment is effective in the management of acute otitis media (AOM), but approximately half of the children may recover without antimicrobial agents. By identifying patients who may not require antimicrobial treatment for the management of AOM, the use of antimicrobial agents could be substantially reduced. Our aim was to identify subgroups of children with AOM who would benefit most from antimicrobial treatment and children who could be suitable for initial observation.

- **Methods**: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Children 6 to 35 months of age with AOM (N = 319) were randomly allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (40/5.7 mg/kg per day) or placebo for 7 days. Our primary outcome was time until treatment failure.

- **Results**: Treatment failure occurred in 31.7% of all children. Older age (24–35 months) and peaked tympanogram at entry decreased the hazard for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.96; p = 0.04; and hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.88; p = 0.02, respectively). The rate difference for treatment failure between antimicrobial treatment and placebo groups was highest among children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (11.1% vs. 64.1%; rate difference -53.0%; 95% CI, -73.5% to -32.4%), resulting in a number needed to treat of 1.9.

- **Conclusions**: Children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane seem to benefit most from antimicrobial treatment of AOM. On the other hand, children with peaked tympanogram benefit less from such treatment.

### Otitis media and ear tubes [^117MwwfT]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The placement of myringotomy tubes remains an effective treatment for acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion. Infants and young children are prone to these conditions because of their immature anatomy and immunology. Several host, pathogenic, and environmental factors contribute to their development. The identification and modification of some of these factors can preclude the need for intervention. The procedure continues to be one of the most common outpatient pediatric procedures. Close vigilance and identification of potential complications are of utmost importance in the ongoing management of children with middle ear disease.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112KSmBB]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis media, particularly with systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend ensuring follow-up when observation is used as an initial strategy. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated if the patient worsens or fails to improve within 48–72 hours of the onset of symptoms.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^114Damy2]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). High credibility.

For children at high risk of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), strategies to prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) may reduce progression to CSOM.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind study in northern Australia, 103 Aboriginal infants with first detection of OME were randomized to receive either amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d BD) or placebo for 24 weeks, or until bilateral aerated middle ears were diagnosed at two successive monthly examinations (success). Standardized clinical assessments and international standards for microbiology were used.

- **Results**: Five of 52 infants in the amoxicillin group and none of 51 infants in the placebo group achieved success at the end of therapy (Risk Difference = 9.6% [95% confidence interval 1.6, 17.6]). Amoxicillin significantly reduced the proportion of children with i) perforation at the end of therapy (27% to 12% RD = -16% [-31, -1]), ii) re-perforation during therapy (18% to 4% RD = -14% [-25, -2]), and iii) reduced the proportion of examinations with a diagnosis of perforation during therapy (20% to 8% adjusted risk ratio 0.36 [0.15, 0.83], p = 0.017). During therapy, the proportion of examinations with penicillin non-susceptible (MIC > 0.1 µg/ml) pneumococci was not significantly different between the amoxicillin group (34%) and the placebo group (40%). Beta-lactamase positive non-capsular H. influenzae (NCHi) were uncommon during therapy but more frequent in the amoxicillin group (10%) than placebo (5%).

- **Conclusion**: Aboriginal infants receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears and fewer perforations.

### Molecular microbiological profile of chronic suppurative otitis media [^111qjFQu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) presents with purulent otorrhea (ear discharge), is characterized by chronic inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, and contributes to a significant disease burden worldwide. Antibiotic therapy is guided by swab culture results. In the absence of detailed molecular microbiology studies of CSOM patients, our understanding of the microbiota of CSOM (and indeed of the healthy ear) remains incomplete.

In this prospective study, 24 patients with CSOM were recruited, along with 22 healthy controls. Culture-based techniques and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were used to profile the bacterial community for each patient. Comparisons between patients with and without cholesteatoma in the middle ear and mastoid cavity were also made. A major finding was that the middle ear of many healthy controls was not sterile, which is contradictory to the results of previous studies. However, sequencing data showed that Staphylococcus aureus, along with a range of other Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, were present in all subgroups of CSOM and healthy controls.

Large interpatient variability in the microbiota was observed within each subgroup of CSOM and controls, and there was no bacterial community "signature" which was characteristic of either health or disease. Comparisons of the culture results with the molecular data show that culture-based techniques underestimate the diversity of bacteria found within the ear. This study reports the first detailed examination of bacterial profiles of the ear in healthy controls and CSOM patients.

### Pediatric ear, nose, and throat emergencies [^1144gKTe]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most common infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in children, resulting in more than 20 million antibiotic prescriptions annually. New practice guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians call for the judicious use of antibiotics in view of increasing antibiotic resistance and the unclear necessity of the use of antibiotics in children with uncomplicated acute otitis media. This article reviews these guidelines, several other common ear, nose, and throat conditions, including sinusitis and dental emergencies, and strategies in diagnosis and treatment.
