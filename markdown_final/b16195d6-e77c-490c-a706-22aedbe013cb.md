## Question

Treatment for chronic portal vein. Thrombosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for chronic portal vein thrombosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define chronic portal vein thrombosis and classify its severity and chronicity. Then, I should verify the key risk stratification factors that drive management, especially cirrhosis status and transplant candidacy. Next, I will examine the role and limitations of anticoagulation in chronic PVT, including when it helps and when it does not. After that, I should review endovascular options like portal vein recanalization and TIPS, including technical access routes and outcomes. Finally, I will integrate supportive care, surveillance, and special scenarios such as non-cirrhotic PVT and post-transplant PVT, and close with a practical decision framework and a concise summary algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. Chronic portal vein thrombosis is generally defined as thrombosis persisting beyond 6 months, and standardized nomenclature distinguishes recent (< 6 months) from chronic (> 6 months) disease, with descriptors for degree of occlusion (minimally, partially, or completely occlusive) and the presence of cavernous transformation, which signals mature collaterals and typically low recanalization potential [^113ZEAAa] [^116uMahR]. Hold on, I should verify the implication of cavernous transformation: once cavernoma is established, spontaneous recanalization is unlikely, and routine anticoagulation is generally not advised unless there are special circumstances, which aligns with AASLD and AGA guidance [^113mwTNz] [^116uMahR].

> Next, I should review risk stratification, because management diverges based on cirrhosis status, transplant candidacy, and symptom burden. I need to ensure I separate patients with cirrhosis from those without, since non-cirrhotic patients are generally anticoagulated to prevent progression and complications, whereas cirrhotic patients require individualized decisions balancing thrombosis risk against portal hypertensive bleeding risk [^1126eaXs] [^112pmkHi]. But wait, what if the patient is a transplant candidate? In that case, preserving or restoring portal venous inflow becomes critical, so transplant candidacy meaningfully shifts thresholds toward intervention and anticoagulation [^114aQnFQ] [^113o25vc].

> Now, I will examine anticoagulation in chronic PVT, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. For chronic complete PVT with cavernous transformation, there is no established benefit from anticoagulation, and guidelines recommend focusing on portal hypertension complications rather than attempting anticoagulation, so I should not jump to anticoagulate in this scenario [^116G2hnc] [^113mwTNz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "all chronic PVT should be anticoagulated", but that is incorrect; the correct approach is selective anticoagulation in chronic PVT only when there is progression, thrombophilia, mesenteric extension, or transplant candidacy, and otherwise to avoid anticoagulation in chronic complete occlusion with cavernoma [^111aFN7P] [^116uMahR]. I should double-check the evidence signal: in a prospective cohort without cirrhosis, recanalization after 6 months of anticoagulation was uncommon if it had not occurred early, reinforcing that chronic, organized thrombi are less responsive to anticoagulation [^116uMahR].

> Let me consider endovascular strategies next, because when anticoagulation fails or is not feasible, recanalization may be necessary. Portal vein recanalization followed by TIPS is recommended in transplant candidates with chronic PVT that would hinder a physiologic portal-to-portal anastomosis, and it should be pursued in specialized centers with advanced interventional radiology capabilities [^114aQnFQ] [^1136j2Fn]. I should confirm the access routes: trans-splenic and trans-mesenteric approaches have expanded feasibility for chronic PVT with cavernoma, with series reporting high technical success for TIPS creation even in complex anatomy, though patency may require adjuvant anticoagulation and secondary interventions [^114Kuuu1] [^115P3Ctc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; TIPS is not for everyone, and candidacy should be weighed against liver function reserve, encephalopathy risk, and procedural complexity in chronic occlusion [^111gAKdZ].

> I will now examine supportive and portal hypertension–directed care, because symptom control remains central in chronic PVT. All patients with chronic PVT should undergo endoscopic screening for varices and receive nonselective beta-blockade or endoscopic variceal ligation when indicated, and importantly, anticoagulation does not need to be delayed until variceal eradication; these therapies can proceed in parallel with appropriate precautions [^115sTwB5] [^112p5LjR]. I need to ensure I address portal hypertensive cholangiopathy as well; symptomatic biliary strictures or stones warrant endoscopic therapy, with surgical options reserved for refractory cases, and this should be integrated into longitudinal care plans [^112p5LjR].

> Next, I should review surveillance and monitoring, because treatment response and thrombus dynamics guide ongoing decisions. During active therapy, cross-sectional imaging every 3 months is recommended to assess recanalization or progression, and if there is no response by 6 months, continuing anticoagulation is often futile and can be discontinued, with management shifting to portal hypertension care [^112aSLqK] [^111MKk3q]. Wait, let me verify the rationale: failure to recanalize within 6 months strongly predicts nonresponse, so futile anticoagulation should be avoided to minimize bleeding risk without benefit [^116uMahR].

> But wait, what if the patient does not have cirrhosis? I should confirm that non-cirrhotic chronic PVT is managed differently. In non-cirrhotic patients, anticoagulation is generally indicated to prevent progression and complications, with at least 6 months of therapy and consideration of indefinite anticoagulation if thrombophilia is present or the thrombosis is unprovoked, aligning with ACG and EASL guidance [^1148wRCV] [^117SX3nh] [^1138r6eY]. Hold on, I should verify the agent choice: VKAs, LMWH, or DOACs are acceptable, though data for DOACs in PVT are more limited and decisions should be individualized, especially if portal hypertension coexists [^111u5x58] [^114VDWbL].

> I will now examine special scenarios, starting with post–liver transplant PVT. In pediatric and adult transplant recipients, chronic PVT can threaten graft perfusion; transmesenteric or hybrid endovascular approaches can achieve recanalization and stenting with meaningful patency and symptom relief, though restenosis occurs and may require reintervention and anticoagulation [^notfound] [^notfound]. Let me reconsider the broader transplant context: in candidates awaiting LT, maintaining portal venous patency is prioritized, and anticoagulation is commonly continued until transplantation given rethrombosis risk after cessation [^116gFvV8].

> Next, I should review the role of thrombophilia workup, because it can change duration and intensity of therapy. In cirrhosis, routine hypercoagulable testing is not recommended unless there are additional thrombotic events, unusual sites, or suggestive family history, whereas in non-cirrhotic patients without an obvious cause, evaluation for inherited or acquired thrombophilia, including JAK2, is reasonable to guide long-term anticoagulation decisions [^115JPF5U] [^112p5LjR]. I need to ensure I align testing with the clinical context to avoid low-yield evaluations [^115JPF5U].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it against guidelines. For chronic PVT, I will first confirm chronicity and degree of occlusion and assess for cavernous transformation; if cavernoma is present with complete occlusion, I will avoid anticoagulation and focus on portal hypertension management and transplant-related planning if applicable. If chronic PVT is partial or there are high-risk features such as progression, thrombophilia, mesenteric extension, or transplant candidacy, I will consider anticoagulation with appropriate variceal prophylaxis and close imaging surveillance. If there is refractory portal hypertension or transplant candidacy with compromised inflow, I will refer for PVR-TIPS in an experienced center. Throughout, I will monitor with cross-sectional imaging every 3 months and discontinue futile anticoagulation after 6 months of nonresponse, pivoting to supportive care [^116G2hnc] [^113erkKG] [^114aQnFQ] [^112aSLqK].

Management of chronic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) centers on **portal hypertension complications** [^113mwTNz] and **individualized anticoagulation** [^111ayL1q]. Anticoagulation is indicated for recent thrombosis [^1126eaXs], progression, or transplant candidacy [^111aFN7P], with VKAs, LMWH, or DOACs as options [^111ayL1q]; DOACs are increasingly used in compensated cirrhosis [^111ayL1q] but require caution in advanced disease [^114VDWbL]. Endoscopic variceal screening and prophylaxis are essential [^111MKk3q]; TIPS is reserved for refractory portal hypertension or transplant preparation [^111T5RbA] [^114aQnFQ]. Routine anticoagulation is not recommended for chronic complete occlusion with cavernous transformation [^113mwTNz]; management should be tailored to thrombus extent, liver function, and bleeding risk [^111MKk3q].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation

Anticoagulation is **not universally indicated** in chronic PVT; decisions should be individualized based on thrombus extent, liver function, and bleeding risk [^116G2hnc] [^112pmkHi]. Indications include:

- **Recent thrombosis**: Partial or minimally occlusive thrombosis [^113ZEAAa] (< 50% obstruction) may benefit from anticoagulation to prevent progression [^1122jPSf].

- **Thrombus progression**: Documented extension of thrombus warrants anticoagulation [^111aFN7P].

- **Transplant candidacy**: Patients awaiting liver transplantation should receive anticoagulation to maintain portal vein patency [^113o25vc] [^1173HRgj].

- **Thrombophilia**: Inherited or acquired thrombophilia supports anticoagulation [^115TJZjs].

Conversely, **chronic complete occlusion with cavernous transformation** [^113mwTNz] generally does not benefit from anticoagulation and management should focus on portal hypertension complications [^116G2hnc].

---

## Choice of anticoagulant

The **choice of anticoagulant** depends on liver function, renal function, and patient preference [^111ayL1q] [^111aFN7P]:

| **Anticoagulant** | **Indications** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) | - Long-term therapy <br/> - Especially in non-cirrhotic patients | - INR monitoring required <br/> - Interactions with food and drugs [^111tiZvL] |
| Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) | - Acute phase <br/> - Renal impairment <br/> - Severe liver dysfunction | - Subcutaneous injection <br/> - Monitoring of anti-Xa levels in renal impairment [^notfound] |
| Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) | - Compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A or early B) <br/> - Convenience | - Limited data in advanced cirrhosis <br/> - Caution advised in severe liver dysfunction [^1145TWYH] |

---

## Duration of anticoagulation

The **duration of anticoagulation** varies with clinical context:

- **Non-cirrhotic patients**: Minimum 6 months; indefinite if thrombophilia or persistent risk factors [^1138r6eY] [^117SX3nh].

- **Cirrhotic patients**: Minimum 6 months; continue until transplantation or clot resolution if a transplant candidate [^111YChwD] [^11137rc8].

- **Lifelong anticoagulation**: Indicated in patients with persistent thrombophilia or recurrent thrombosis [^117SX3nh].

---

## Management of portal hypertension complications

Portal hypertension complications require **proactive management**:

- **Variceal screening**: All patients with chronic PVT should undergo endoscopic screening for esophageal and gastric varices [^112p5LjR].

- **Primary prophylaxis**: Nonselective beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) for high-risk varices [^111aFN7P].

- **Secondary prophylaxis**: Combination of EVL and beta-blockers for recurrent variceal bleeding [^113SwdTS].

- **Refractory ascites or variceal bleeding**: Consider transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) [^111T5RbA] [^1136j2Fn].

---

## Role of interventional radiology

Interventional radiology plays a **critical role** in selected patients:

- **Portal vein recanalization**: Consider in transplant candidates with chronic PVT hindering anatomical anastomosis [^114aQnFQ] [^1136j2Fn].

- **TIPS**: Indicated for refractory portal hypertension complications or as a bridge to transplantation [^111T5RbA] [^1136j2Fn].

- **Thrombolysis**: Reserved for acute PVT with persistent intestinal ischemia despite anticoagulation [^115XyURw].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **essential** to assess treatment response and detect complications:

- **Imaging**: Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) every 3–6 months to assess thrombus progression or resolution [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: Regular liver function tests, renal function tests, and complete blood count [^notfound].

- **Clinical assessment**: Monitor for bleeding, thrombosis progression, and portal hypertension complications [^112XpF6q].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Anticoagulation decisions should consider age, thrombus extent, and underlying etiology [^112VH7Zq].

- **Pregnancy**: LMWH is preferred due to its safety profile.

- **Malignancy**: Anticoagulation is generally indicated in non-cirrhotic patients with malignancy-related PVT.

---

Management of chronic PVT requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, balancing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation, portal hypertension complications, and interventional radiology procedures. Anticoagulation is indicated for recent thrombosis, progression, or transplant candidacy, while chronic complete occlusion with cavernous transformation is managed conservatively. TIPS and interventional radiology are reserved for refractory cases or transplant preparation [^1136j2Fn].

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) consists of two different entities: acute PVT and chronic PVT. Acute PVT usually presents as abdominal pain. When the thrombus extends to the mesenteric venous arches, intestinal infarction can occur. Chronic PVT is usually recognized after a fortuitous diagnosis of hypersplenism or portal hypertension, or when there are biliary symptoms related to portal cholangiopathy. Local risk factors for PVT, such as an abdominal inflammatory focus, can be identified in 30% of patients with acute PVT; 70% of patients with acute and chronic PVT have a general risk factor for PVT, most commonly myeloproliferative disease. Early initiation of anticoagulation therapy for acute PVT is associated with complete and partial success in 50% and 40% of patients, respectively. A minimum of 6 months' anticoagulation therapy is recommended for the treatment of acute PVT. For patients with either form of PVT, permanent anticoagulation therapy should be considered if they have a permanent risk factor. In patients with large varices, beta-adrenergic blockade or endoscopic therapy seems to prevent bleeding as a result of portal hypertension, even in patients on anticoagulation therapy. In patients with jaundice or recurrent biliary symptoms caused by cholangiopathy, insertion of a biliary endoprosthesis is the first treatment option. Overall, the long-term outcome for patients with PVT is good, but is jeopardized by cholangiopathy and transformation of underlying myeloproliferative disease into myelofibrosis or acute leukemia.

Guidance statements — management of recent PVT by clinical setting and extent of portal vein (PV) occlusion are as follows: "In all patients with recent PVT and concern for intestinal ischemia, immediate consultation with surgery, critical care, interventional radiology, and hematology is recommended, with the need for surgery in cases of intestinal infarction". "In patients without cirrhosis and with recent PVT, directed antithrombotic therapy should be considered in order to avoid intestinal ischemia and prevent the development of chronic PVT with portal hypertension". For patients with cirrhosis, "Treatment should be considered on a case-by- case basis", and "Decisions for treatment of an individual patient should be based on expected benefit and minimization of clot extension risk". In cirrhosis with minimally occlusive "(< 50% obstruction of the lumen)" thrombosis of the main PV, "observation with serial imaging every 3 months without therapy is reasonable.

### Management of portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis [^114izuJa]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a fairly common complication of liver cirrhosis. Importantly, occlusive PVT might influence the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Evidence from a randomized controlled trial has shown that anticoagulation can prevent the occurrence of PVT in patients with cirrhosis without prior PVT. Evidence from several case series has also demonstrated that anticoagulation can achieve portal vein recanalization in patients with cirrhosis and PVT. Early initiation of anticoagulation therapy and absence of previous portal hypertensive bleeding might be positively associated with a high rate of portal vein recanalization after anticoagulation. However, the possibility of spontaneous resolution of partial PVT questions the necessity of anticoagulation for the treatment of partial PVT. In addition, a relatively low recanalization rate of complete PVT after anticoagulation therapy suggests its limited usefulness in patients with complete PVT. Successful insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) not only recanalizes the thrombosed portal vein, but also relieves the symptomatic portal hypertension. However, the technical difficulty of TIPS potentially limits its widespread application, and the risk and benefits should be fully balanced. Notably, current recommendations regarding the management of PVT in liver cirrhosis are insufficient owing to low-quality evidence.

Introduction

Portal vein (PV) thrombosis (PVT) is characterized by interruption of normal blood flow in the PV because of blood clot formation. Thrombophilic conditions, abdominal inflammation, tumorous invasion, and liver cirrhosis are among the most common causes of PVT (Table 1). Less commonly, PVT has been described after bariatric surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or fine needle aspiration of pancreatic cancer.

Table 1
Causes of portal vein thrombosis

Pathophysiologically, an imbalance of the hemostatic mechanism (both pro- and anti-coagulant factors) is implicated in thrombus formation and, ultimately, PVT. The prevalence of PVT is higher in the advanced stages of cirrhosis and increases in cirrhotic patients with HCC. Improvement in imaging studies, in combination with better awareness amongst clinicians, makes this diagnosis frequent. However, many controversies exist regarding the optimal management.

Yerdel et al, in a seminal paper, have classified PVT according to the size and extension of the thrombus as follows:

Grade 1: partial PVT – the thrombus covers less than 50% of the PV lumen

Grade 2: PV obstruction greater than 50%, or complete occlusion with or without minimal extension into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV)

Grade 3: complete thrombosis of both PVs, thrombus extends to the proximal part of the SMV

Grade 4: complete thrombosis – the PV thrombus affects both the proximal and distal SMV

More recently, the BAVENO VI working group added two more variables for the classification of PVT, apart from the site (trunk, branches or both), the degree (complete or incomplete) and the extent of involvement of the extrahepatic portal venous system. These are the presentation (clinical and radiological features) and the type of underlying liver disease (cirrhosis, non-cirrhotic liver disease, HCC, post-liver transplant). However, even in this classification, there is no comment on the functional consequences of PV occlusion that could have a detrimental effect on liver function. Sarin et al have further proposed a more comprehensive classification system for PVT in cirrhosis, emphasizing PVT functionality (consequences of acute or chronic PV occlusion in diseased or healthy liver).

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^111MKk3q]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

Portal vein thromboses (PVTs) are common in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with advanced portal hypertension and mortality. The treatment of PVTs remains a clinical challenge due to limited evidence and competing risks of PVT-associated complications vs bleeding risk of anticoagulation. Significant heterogeneity in PVT phenotype based on anatomic, host, and disease characteristics, and an emerging spectrum of therapeutic options further complicate PVT management. This Clinical Practice Update (CPU) aims to provide best practice advice for the evaluation and management of PVT in cirrhosis, including the role of direct oral anticoagulants and endovascular interventions.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with PVTs identified on Doppler ultrasound should undergo cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate for malignancy, and document the degree of lumen occlusion, clot extent, and chronicity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboemboli or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT with evidence of intestinal ischemia require urgent anticoagulation to minimize ischemic injury. If available, these patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology and hepatology, interventional radiology, hematology, and surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Consider observation, with repeat imaging every 3 months until clot regression, in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia and recent (< 6 months) thrombosis involving the intrahepatic portal vein branches or when there is < 50% occlusion of the main portal vein, splenic vein, or mesenteric veins. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Anticoagulation should be considered in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia who develop recent (< 6 months) PVT that is > 50% occlusive or involves the main portal vein or mesenteric vessels. Patients who have increased benefit of recanalization include those with involvement of more than 1 vascular bed, those with thrombus progression, potential liver transplantation candidates, and those with inherited thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Anticoagulation is not advised for patients with cirrhosis with chronic (> 6 months) PVT with complete occlusion with collateralization (cavernous transformation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT warrant endoscopic variceal screening if they are not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis. Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants are all reasonable anticoagulant options for patients with cirrhosis and PVT. Decision making should be individualized and informed by patient preference and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class. Direct oral anticoagulants may be considered in patients with compensated Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B cirrhosis and offer convenience as their dosages are independent of international normalized ratio monitoring. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with cirrhosis on anticoagulation for PVT should have cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess response to treatment. If clot regresses, anticoagulation should be continued until transplantation or at least clot resolution in nontransplantation patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may be considered for selected patients with cirrhosis and PVT who have additional indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, such as those with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding. Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may also be considered for transplantation candidates if recanalization can facilitate the technical feasibility of transplantation.

HVT/BCS treatment options — goals and stepwise strategy — include management of portal hypertension, treatment of the underlying thrombotic or malignant disease, and restoration of hepatic venous outflow, with a progressive therapeutic strategy stepping from less invasive (medical) to more invasive (LT) treatment according to clinical response; recognizing the timing to step up therapy is challenging, and these patients should routinely be managed in tertiary referral centers.

### Anticoagulation in cirrhosis: evidence for the treatment of portal vein thrombosis and applications for prophylactic therapy [^112baV2P]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical utility of anticoagulation for patients with cirrhosis and asymptomatic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is widely debated. Complex hemostatic derangements in cirrhosis that increase risk of both bleeding and thrombosis, as well as a lack of randomized controlled data, limit conclusive assessments regarding optimal management of anticoagulation in this setting. In this review, we summarize the relevant literature pertaining to PVT in cirrhosis, including the effect of untreated PVT on the natural progression of liver disease and the overall impact of anticoagulation on clot burden and other relevant clinical outcomes. Apart from patients who are symptomatic or listed for liver transplantation, data supporting anticoagulation for the treatment of PVT is limited and without clear consensus guidelines. In patients with cirrhosis without PVT, emerging evidence for the role of prophylactic anticoagulation to mitigate the progression of fibrosis suggests an optimal risk-benefit tradeoff with decreased rates of liver decompensation and mortality, without a heightened risk of bleeding. In summation, as our understanding of the role of both prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation in cirrhosis continues to evolve, ongoing risk stratification of patients with asymptomatic PVT demands further attention.

Guidance statements — thrombolysis and portal vein recanalization (PVR) with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): Local or systemic thrombolytic therapy should only be considered in very selected cases of recent PVT in whom intestinal ischemia persists despite anticoagulation; PVR followed by TIPS should be considered in liver transplantation (LT) candidates with chronic PVT that hinders a physiological anastomosis between the graft and recipient PV, and PVR followed by TIPS should be considered in patients with chronic PVT and recurrent bleeding and/or refractory ascites not manageable medically or endoscopically.

### Portal vein thrombosis; risk factors, clinical presentation and treatment [^113SwdTS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Frequent complications during follow-up were oesophageal- and gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, bleeding from varices and ascites. A larger part of patients with chronic PVT developed oesophageal varices in comparison with patients with acute PVT. Thus, the development of varices is a time dependent phenomenon, and it is advisable to screen all PVT patients endoscopically. Twenty-nine percent of patients without cancer or cirrhosis experienced variceal bleeding (in patients with cancer or cirrhosis 53%), in only one patient fatal, in accordance with other reports.

Spontaneous resolution of the thrombosis did happen in some cases, but the frequency of partial/complete recanalization seemed to be higher in patients treated with anticoagulation therapy. The effect was seen in patients with both acute and chronic PVT. The aim of anticoagulation therapy is both to prevent further thrombosis, and potentially lead to recanalization, thereby preventing the development of portal hypertension and its complications. It has been suggested that interventional recanalization should be performed whenever the result of anticoagulation is unsatisfactory, and furthermore, that portal stents should be implanted in patients with cirrhosis. One study showed no increased rate of bleeding episodes in patients with established PVT who received anticoagulant therapy. However, to our knowledge, there is yet no consensus on the indication for anticoagulant therapy. For primary prophylaxis, β-blockade is standard for cirrhotic portal hypertension, but the effect is not documented in PVT, and VBL may be preferable. In the acute management of variceal bleeding, vasoactive substances, antibiotics, and VBL remain central. For secondary prophylaxis of re-bleeding we used combined VBL and β-blockade ± long-acting nitrates although evidence to support β-blockers is sparse. In any case, our patients showed regression of their varices when given this combination preventive treatment.

In accordance with others, we found that the outcome of PVT in general is good, and that mortality primarily was associated to underlying cause and less to the consequences of portal hypertension. Mortality in one year was highest in patients with cancer or cirrhosis, 26% compared with only 8% in patients without these diseases.

Portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis in cirrhosis — We suggest anticoagulation in patients with chronic PVT only if there is (i) evidence of inherited thrombophilia, (ii) progression of thrombus, or (iii) history of bowel ischemia due to thrombus extension into the mesenteric veins, and anticoagulation may also be considered in patients awaiting LT. In acute portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis, we suggest 6 months of anticoagulation, with continuation beyond this period in patients with portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis who are on the waiting list for liver transplant. For variceal bleeding prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with high-risk varices and portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulation, we recommend nonselective beta-blockers; endoscopic variceal ligation may be performed if there is a contraindication to or intolerance to beta-blockers, and anticoagulation may need to be interrupted in the periprocedural period. For the initial anticoagulant, we suggest either unfractionated heparin or LMWH, preferring unfractionated heparin in the presence of renal insufficiency and LMWH in the presence of thrombocytopenia.

### Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic challenges [^1153uWTc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent complication in cirrhosis and its prevalence increases with disease severity. Several factors are involved in the development and progression of PVT. The challenge for the management of PVT is the precise evaluation of the bleeding risk as opposed to life-threatening extension of thrombosis. Nevertheless, the impact on the progression and outcome of liver disease is unclear. A critical evaluation of the available data discloses that treating PVT in cirrhotics is safe and effective. However, there are open issues, such as which anticoagulant could represent a safer therapeutic option, and when and for how long this treatment should be administered to cirrhotic patients with PVT.

INTRODUCTION

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare condition in the general population but is common in patients with cirrhosis. The prevalence of PVT in patients with cirrhosis increases with disease severity and varies from 5% to 26% in patients with advanced disease. The exact pathophysiology of PVT is still unknown, but decreased portal flow velocity and severity of liver disease are important risk factors for PVT in patients with cirrhosis. Although it has been suggested that hypercoagulability may also be a risk factor for PVT development, multiple recent studies did not find congenital thrombophilia to be related to PVT risk. Notably, it has been debated whether PVT contributes to liver disease progression or whether it is merely a marker of severity of disease. For example, a systematic review showed an increased risk of mortality and hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis and PVT, while other studies showed no independent association between the presence of PVT and progression of cirrhosis. It is, however, generally accepted that PVT can cause technical challenges during liver transplantation that may result in decreased graft survival rates and increased morbidity.

PVT is often asymptomatic and incidentally found as part of routine imaging. Only a minority of patients present with symptoms such as acute abdominal pain or gastrointestinal bleeding, which is presumably a result of a portal vein thrombus that has recently been formed. For the majority of thrombi, however, the exact timing of thrombus formation is unknown, although it may be estimated by its appearance on radiological imaging or examination of sequential images over time. The age of the thrombus might be of importance for the decision whether or not to treat PVT as more recently formed portal vein thrombi seem to respond better to anticoagulant therapy than older thrombi. Given the lack of precision in determination of thrombus age in the majority of patients, the distinction between acute (or recent) and chronic PVT may be considered arbitrary. In addition, whether anticoagulant therapy is indicated for both recent and chronic PVT remains a matter of debate because (1) some of the thrombi resolve spontaneously, (2) anticoagulant therapy does not always result in recanalization of the portal vein, (3) bleeding may complicate treatment with anticoagulants, and (4) therapy may not benefit the patient, particularly if the patient is not a liver transplant candidate. Therefore, some experts suggest that anticoagulant therapy is not always indicated, and observation with serial imaging every 3 months, for example, to monitor thrombus extension, is a reasonable alternative.

### Portal vein thrombosis; risk factors, clinical presentation and treatment [^1163W5vk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is increasingly frequently being diagnosed, but systematic descriptions of the natural history and clinical handling of the condition are sparse. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe risk factors, clinical presentation, complications and treatment of portal vein thrombosis in a single-centre.

Methods

Sixty-seven patients were identified in the electronic records from 1992 to 2005. All data were obtained from the patient records.

Results

One or more risk factors (e.g. prothrombotic disorder or abdominal inflammation) were present in 87%. Symptoms were abdominalia, splenomegaly, fever, ascites, haematemesis, and weight loss. Abdominalia and fever occurred more frequently in patients with acute PVT. Frequent complications were splenomegaly, oesophageal- and gastric varices with or without bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy and ascites. Varices and bleeding were more frequent in patients with chronic PVT. Patients who received anticoagulant therapy more frequently achieved partial/complete recanalization. Patients with varices who were treated endoscopically in combination with β-blockade had regression of the varices. The overall mortality was 13% in one year, and was dependent on underlying causes.

Conclusion

Most patients had a combination of local and systemic risk factors for PVT. We observed that partial/complete recanalization was more frequent in patients treated with anticoagulation therapy, and that regression of varices was more pronounced in patients who where treated with active endoscopy combined with pharmacological treatment.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) terminology and classification — standardization is emphasized as PVT is a heterogeneous condition with respect to etiology, manifestations, natural history, and therapeutic options, and it is desirable to establish standardized terminology to allow comparison and external validation of future studies; in regard to time course of thrombosis, the term "recent" is preferred to the term "acute", and the term "chronic" should be applied to a PV obstruction persisting longer than 6 months after presumed onset, with justification from a study in 100 patients with recent PVT followed up until 1 year in which recanalization that did not take place within 6 months did not occur between 6 and 12 months; following the onset of a PV obstruction not followed by regression, cavernous transformation may develop within a few weeks, and when portal cavernous transformation is present, this term should be preferred to "chronic portal vein thrombosis"; Table 5 recommends standardized nomenclature including time course (Recent: PVT presumed to be present for < 6 months; Chronic: PVT present or persistent for > 6 months), percent occlusion of main PV (Completely occlusive: No persistent lumen; Partially occlusive: Clot obstructing > 50% of original vessel lumen; Minimally occlusive: Clot obstructing < 50% of original vessel lumen), and response to treatment or interval change (Progressive: Thrombus increases in size or progresses to more complete occlusion; Stable: No appreciable change in size or occlusion; Regressive: Thrombus decreases in size or degree of occlusion).

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in patients with chronic portal vein occlusion and cavernous transformation [^114zCYQL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Goals

To determine the feasibility of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation as a possible salvage intervention in patients with variceal bleeding and chronic portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, refractory to endoscopic therapy.

Background

TIPS is technically feasible in partial portal vein occlusion or complete occlusion due to fresh thrombosis. However, when the portal vein occlusion is complete and chronic, placement of TIPS is technically difficult.

Study

In a tertiary referral center setting 4 patients with portal hypertension associated complications, received TIPS, as salvage therapy. In all patients a covered stent was placed to the cavernous transformation.

Results

Creation of TIPS to the dilated veins of a cavernous transformation was feasible in patients for whom recanalization of the portal vein was not possible. However, the collaterals need to be suitably wide for placement of TIPS and the high-pressure collaterals should communicate with the varices.

Conclusions

TIPS should be considered as salvage therapy when endoscopic treatment is unsuccessful in patients with chronic portal vein thrombosis and cavernous transformation.

### Diagnosis, development, and treatment of portal vein thrombosis in patients with and without cirrhosis [^116B38Zb]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis unrelated to solid malignancy is common in patients with cirrhosis, but less frequently observed in patients without cirrhosis. Prompt diagnosis and management of acute symptomatic portal vein thrombosis are essential. Failure to detect and treat thromboses can result in mesenteric ischemia, chronic cavernous transformation, and complications of portal hypertension. In patients with cirrhosis, development of portal vein thrombosis is often insidious and remains undetected until its incidental detection. Management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis is more controversial. However, there are data to support treatment of specific patients with anticoagulation agents. We review the common and distinct features of portal vein thromboses in patients without liver tumors, with and without cirrhosis.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — algorithmic management begins after "PVT characterized on multiphasic cross-sectional imaging"; if "Acute intestinal ischemia?" is present, "Refer for urgent endovascular intervention or surgery". Otherwise, "Perform prophylaxis for variceal bleeding including band ligation* if high risk varices present and NSBB intolerant". For "Recent (< 6 months) thrombosis of intrahepatic branches or < 50% of main trunk, splenic vein, or mesenteric vein", "Consider observation with serial cross-sectional imaging every 3 months", whereas "Recent (< 6 months) thrombosis with 50%–100% occlusion of main PV or mesenteric veins" and "Symptomatic or transplant candidate" lead to "Consider timely AC" (anticoagulation). For "Complete, chronic (> 6 months) PVT with collateralization", the pathway is "No anticoagulation, unlikely to recanalize". Patients with the largest potential anticoagulation benefits are listed as "Awaiting liver transplant", "Progressive thrombus", and "Additional hypercoagulable state (ie, inherited thrombophilia, MPN)".

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^112aSLqK]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — anticoagulation monitoring and duration: Best Practice Advice 10 states patients with cirrhosis on anticoagulation for PVT should have cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess response, and if clot regresses, anticoagulation should be continued until transplantation or at least clot resolution in transplantation patients. Treated patients should be evaluated every 3 months with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with reimaging every 3 months when complete recanalization or partial regression occurs. Anticoagulation can be discontinued for futility in nonresponders after 6 months, as recanalization is unlikely, and recurrent PVT after revascularization or treatment discontinuation occurs within 2–5 months in up to 38% of patients. A platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L has been associated with a bleeding risk in patients on anticoagulation, so cautious use may be considered on an individualized basis, and thromboelastography may represent a promising tool to assess bleeding risk and may help guide decision making regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation use.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^115Bo1G4]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Anticoagulant therapy in cirrhosis addresses portal vein thrombosis (PVT) by noting that in the acute setting such as new (especially if symptomatic) PVT or extension of prior thrombosis, management notes systemic anticoagulation with IV heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), while asymptomatic incidentally discovered PVT does not invariably warrant therapy and spontaneous resolution may occur, especially if partial. For chronic PVT, especially in patients listed for transplantation or with a history of symptomatic PVT or mesenteric thrombosis, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are reported as safe and effective in Child–Pugh class A and early class B, whereas vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) are problematic due to uncertainty of target INR. For prevention, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is indicated, and in the absence of bleeding, routine DVT prophylaxis measures are recommended.

### Challenging anticoagulation cases: acute extensive portal vein thrombosis in a patient without cirrhosis-evidence-based management of a rare clinical entity [^113sBau3]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute non-cirrhotic and non-malignant portal vein thrombosis (aPVT) is a rare and heterogenous condition. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent extension of thrombosis, and favor recanalization. Although not formally defined, a poor outcome in the acute setting would include thrombosis extension with progression to intestinal infarction. Patients are also at risk of negative long-term outcomes related to complications of portal hypertension, such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and portal cholangiopathy. Identifying patients at risk of these events despite early initiation of anticoagulation remains challenging. Trials comparing treatment strategies in those failing standard therapy with meaningful radiological and clinical endpoints, whether in the short or long term, are desperately needed. The objective of this review will be to discuss a real-life clinical case and propose a treatment approach for aPVT based on the available evidence. We will mainly focus on management strategies including anticoagulation, prognostic factors, and options beyond anticoagulation, such as thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. This review will not cover tumor portal vein thrombosis or thrombosis associated with cirrhosis.

### Portal interventions in the setting of venous thrombosis or occlusion [^1125Y5wA]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis most commonly occurs as a complication of liver cirrhosis and can result in worsening symptoms of portal hypertension, which often can be challenging to treat with conventional decompression therapies. In addition, because complete portal vein thrombosis is associated with higher posttransplant morbidity and mortality, it is regarded as a relative contraindication to liver transplant. Often, the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis is incidental; hence, imaging remains the mainstay for diagnosing this complication and is used to guide subsequent treatment. Although anticoagulation is the initial approach used to treat acute portal vein thrombosis, endovascular and/or surgical interventions may be necessary when there is concern for impending bowel ischemia. Treatment of chronic portal vein thrombosis is primarily aimed at alleviating the symptoms of portal hypertension and improving the chance of candidacy for liver transplant. Awareness of the portal venous anatomy to differentiate it from the periportal collaterals is key during recanalization of a chronically occluded portal vein. The authors provide an overview of the pathophysiology, acute and chronic imaging findings, and management of portal vein thrombosis, with a specific focus on endovascular management, as well as a summary of the current related literature.

### Portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis: incidence, management, and outcome [^115jz4t5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver cirrhosis represents the end stage of chronic diseases of the liver and is associated with life-threatening complications. The natural course of cirrhosis is largely affected by various pathologies, such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and infection. The major predictors of survival of patients with liver cirrhosis are Child-Pugh score; model for end-stage liver disease score; and various biochemical parameters, such as serum bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time or international normalized ratio, creatinine, as well as encephalopathy and ascites. Recent evidence suggests the association between portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and survival of patients with liver cirrhosis, although the data are inconclusive.

Based on the increase in the use of technically-advanced noninvasive liver imaging modalities, PVT has been increasingly identified in patients with cirrhosis, with the estimated current prevalence of PVT in patients with cirrhosis of 0.6 to 26%.

The value of anticoagulation in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis remains controversial. Cirrhosis is associated with bleeding diathesis based on the following factors: prolonged bleeding time, thrombocytopenia associated with hypersplenism, increased prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, reduced synthesis of coagulation factors, and secondary hyperfibrinolysis. More importantly, nearly half of patients with cirrhosis are diagnosed with gastroesophageal varices that can result in life-threatening bleeding events. Taken together, these detrimental conditions greatly limit the use of anticoagulants for patients with cirrhosis. However, recent evidence indicates that both pro- and anticoagulation factors are concomitantly reduced in patients with cirrhosis, thereby maintaining a balance in the coagulation system. Unfortunately, bleeding risk cannot be accurately assessed in patients with chronic liver disease by globally used coagulation tests. In addition, the occurrence of bleeding in patients with cirrhosis is not primarily dependent on hemostatic abnormalities, but on the severity of portal pressure, endothelial dysfunction, and bacterial infection. Accordingly, the use of anticoagulants for patients with cirrhosis and PVT may be theoretically justified. However, convincing clinicians to prescribe anticoagulants to cirrhotic patients, especially those with decompensated cirrhosis, remains difficult.

Further, we discuss the advances in the radiological diagnosis that have improved diagnostic accuracy and are noninvasive. Finally, we discuss the treatment options for patients who have varying extents of thrombosis in the portal vein and specifically focus on PVT that is encountered before and after liver transplantation.

### Long-term outcomes of transmesenteric portal vein recanalization for the treatment of chronic portal vein thrombosis after pediatric liver transplantation [^117CrJ7U]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) may occur at any time following liver transplantation. We describe our experience with portal vein recanalization in cases of thrombosis after liver transplantation. Twenty-eight children (5%) out of 566 liver transplant recipients underwent portal vein recanalization using a transmesenteric approach. All children received left hepatic segments, developed PVT, and had symptoms or signs of portal hypertension. Portal vein recanalization was performed via the transmesenteric route in all cases. Twenty-two (78.6%) patients underwent successful recanalization and stent placement. They received oral anticoagulants after the procedure, and clinical symptoms subsided. Symptoms recurred due to portal vein restenosis/thrombosis in seven patients. On an intention-to-treat basis, the success rate of the proposed treatment was 60.7%. Only 17 out of 28 children with posttransplant chronic PVT retained stent patency (primary + assisted) at the end of the study period. In cases of portal vein obstruction, the transmesenteric approach via minilaparotomy is technically feasible with good clinical and hemodynamic results. It is an alternative procedure to reestablish the portal flow to the liver graft that can be performed in selected cases and a therapeutic addition to other treatment strategies currently used to treat chronic PVT.

### Contemporary management of portal vein thromboses in patients with and without cirrhosis [^1148wRCV]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Portal vein thromboses (PVT) is a common clotting disorder that can be seen in patients with and without cirrhosis. There are no current clinical guidelines on management of portal vein thromboses in these two distinct populations given most studies are retrospective and comprised of heterogenous cohorts.

Recent Findings

When evaluating PVT, patients must first be stratified into those with cirrhosis and those without cirrhosis. In addition, a novel nomenclature can help categorize specific PVT types and determine the need and response to anticoagulation. The management of PVT in patients with cirrhosis varies and is primarily dependent on whether the PVT is recent or chronic. In contrast, patients without cirrhosis are almost always anticoagulated to avoid complications of PVT. Direct oral anticoagulants, low-molecular weight heparin, and vitamin-K antagonists have all been used in patients with and without cirrhosis, without clear guidance on optimal treatment duration and surveillance.

Summary

Direct oral anticoagulants are increasingly used for patients with PVT though there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of these medications. The risk/benefit profiles of various anticoagulants must be considered when choosing a therapeutic anticoagulant. There are ongoing studies evaluating outcome measures of different anticoagulants in patients with PVT. Large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials may help elucidate the efficacy of anticoagulants on various outcome measures in PVT, including recanalization, bleeding, and survival.

### Portal vein thrombosis [^114LsLYH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis is a condition not infrequently encountered by clinicians. It results from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic risk factors. The presentation of acute thrombosis varies widely from an asymptomatic state to presence of life-threatening intestinal ischemia and infarction. In the chronic stage, patients typically present with variceal bleeding or other complications of portal hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound color Doppler imaging has a 98% negative predictive value, and is considered the imaging modality of choice in diagnosing portal vein thrombosis. Controlled clinical trials to assist with clinical decision-making are lacking in both acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis. Oral anticoagulant therapy is initiated if the risks of bleeding are low, but long-term anticoagulation is generally not recommended in patients with concomitant hepatic cirrhosis. The roles of invasive therapeutic approaches such as thrombolysis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt continue to evolve. This review conflates dissenting views into a rational approach of managing patients with portal vein thrombosis for the general internist.

Thirty-nine patients with chronic EHPVO received TIPS. Laboratory parameters and follow-up were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, and every 6 months thereafter. Two hepatologists adjudicated symptom improvement attributable to mesenteric thrombosis and EHPVO before/after TIPS. Kaplan-Meier was used to assess primary and overall TIPS patency, assessing procedural success. Adverse events, radiation exposure, hospital length-of-stay and patency were recorded. Cavernoma was present in 100%, with TIPS being successful in all cases using splenic, mesenteric, and transhepatic approaches. Symptom improvement was noted in 26 of 30 (87%) at 6-month follow-up. Twelve patients (31%) experienced TIPS thrombosis. There were no significant long-term laboratory adverse events or deaths. At 36 months, freedom from primary TIPS thrombosis was 63%; following secondary interventions, overall patency was increased to 81%.

Conclusions

TIPS in chronic, noncirrhotic EHPVO with cavernomas and mesenteric venous thrombosis is technically feasible and does not adversely affect liver function. Most patients demonstrate subjective and objective benefit from TIPS. Improvement in patency rates are needed with proper timing of adjuvant anticoagulation.

### Efficacy and safety study of direct-acting oral anticoagulants for the treatment of chronic portal vein thrombosis in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111EiCy3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of chronic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in liver cirrhosis patients.

Materials and Methods

In a prospective cohort study, patients were divided into DOACs group (oral rivaroxaban tablets or dabigatran etexilate capsules) and control group (no anticoagulant treatment). Based on propensity score matching method, 40 patients with cirrhosis and chronic PVT in each of the groups were recruited for this study. CT portal venography was used to monitor the portal vein area. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to monitor the portal vein flow rate. Biochemical testing and thromboelastography (TEG) were also used for monitoring the status of PVT.

Results

After 3 months of DOACs treatment, the complete/partial recanalization rate of DOACs was 12.8% (5/39). After 6 months of DOACs treatment, the PVT complete/partial recanalization rate of DOACs was 28.2% (11/39). The recanalization rate and portal vein flow velocity improvement were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Patients' total bilirubin level and Child-Pugh scores were improved in the DOACs group. The TEG coagulation index was lower in the DOACs group than in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the DOACs group and control group in the cases of bleeding (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

DOACs are effective and safe for chronic PVT in patients with liver cirrhosis. The TEG can predict the risk of bleeding in patients with chronic PVT in cirrhosis, which is more sensitive than conventional coagulation function test.

### Portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis: incidence, management, and outcome [^115AfE8u]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a serious complication in liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension. We examined the treatment, recurrence and prognosis of PVT in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

The study subjects were all 90 cirrhotic patients with PVT treated with danaparoid sodium (DS) at our department between July 2007 and September 2016. The mean age was 68 years and mean Child-Pugh score was 7. All patients received 2500 U/day of DS for 2 weeks, and repeated in those who developed PVT recurrence after the initial therapy.

Results

Complete response was noted in 49% (n = 44), partial response (shrinkage ≥ 70%) in 33% (n = 30), and no change (shrinkage < 70%) in 18% (n = 16) of the patients after the initial course of treatment. DS treatment neither caused adverse events, particularly bleeding or thrombocytopenia, nor induced significant changes in serum albumin, total bilirubin, prothrombin time, and residual liver function. Re-treatment was required in 44 patients who showed PVT recurrence and 61% of these responded to the treatment. The cumulative recurrence rates at 1 and 2 posttreatment years were 26 and 30%, respectively. The recurrence rates were significantly lower in patients with acute type, compared to the chronic type (p = 0.0141). The cumulative survival rates at 1 and 3 years after treatment (including maintenance therapy with warfarin) were 83 and 60%, respectively, and were significantly higher in patients with acute type than chronic type (p = 0.0053).

Conclusion

We can expect prognostic improvement of liver cirrhosis by warfarin following two-week DS therapy for the treatment of PVT in patients with liver cirrhosis safety and effectiveness. An early diagnosis of PVT along with the evaluation of the volume of PVT on CT and an early intervention would contribute to the higher efficacy of the treatment.

Suspicion is raised by "abdominal pain disproportionate to physical findings", and intestinal ischemia is suspected with fever, ascites, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis, and elevated serum lactate. Doppler ultrasound of hepatic vasculature "should be obtained" for new cirrhosis, onset of portal hypertension (PH), or decompensation; endoscopic evaluation "should be performed" in chronic PVT to assess for varices. "More data are needed" before routine prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent PVT in cirrhosis, and for portal hypertensive cholangiopathy, endoscopic treatment is indicated for symptomatic cholangitis; choledocholithiasis or biliary stricture may also benefit, with surgery considered only when endoscopic therapy is ineffective.

### Treatment response and bleeding events associated with anticoagulant therapy of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111vKCCd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is defined as a clot within the portal vein trunk and/or its intrahepatic branches, the mesenteric vein, the hepatic veins and the splenic veins. PVT can be completely or partially occlusive and can be a life-threatening event if it extends into the superior mesenteric vein. Although the impact of PVT on the natural history of patients with cirrhosis is not well established, some evidence suggests that PVT may contribute to a poor prognosis in patients undergoing liver transplantation.

The natural course of untreated PVT is not known. Several studies have shown spontaneous resolution and/or no change in 30–75% of cases, and worsening in most of the remainder. Evidence suggests that a majority of these patients will benefit from some form of anticoagulation. Robust data on the optimal management of PVT in patients with cirrhosis are lacking and current guidelines do not propose definitive evidence-based treatment strategies. The best choice of anticoagulation is unknown in cirrhotic patients with PVT.

The classes of anticoagulant therapy for PVT in cirrhosis are vitamin K antagonists (VKA), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and, to a lesser extent, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). DOAC in this context have been used in an "off-label" manner and current evidence is limited on its use in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted this meta-analysis to update our knowledge of the use of anticoagulation in PVT patients with cirrhosis, focusing particularly on evidence concerning the use of DOAC.

### Management of portal vein thrombosis in candidates for liver transplant [^116gFvV8]. Liver Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent event among patients with advanced liver disease, with a prevalence reaching up to 26% in those awaiting liver transplantation (LT). Extensive thrombosis affecting the mesenteric vein confluence correlates with increased morbidity and mortality post-LT, particularly when it impedes physiological anastomosis or contraindicates the LT. Current guidelines advocate for routine PVT screening in all potential liver transplant candidates and prompt treatment upon detection. The main objective of candidates for LT is to facilitate physiological portal-to-portal anastomosis. Anticoagulation serves as the first-line therapy, achieving recanalization rates between 33% and 75%. Discontinuation of anticoagulation significantly heightens the risk of rethrombosis in a substantial proportion of patients; therefore, it is recommended to continue anticoagulation until LT for those awaiting LT or potential candidates for LT. Nevertheless, 30%-60% of patients fail to respond to anticoagulation, with PVT progression occurring in up to 14% despite anticoagulation. In such cases, TIPS placement emerges as a viable alternative to maintain portal vein patency. While the feasibility of TIPS placement diminished with the presence of portal cavernoma or chronic PVT, the introduction of novel interventional radiological techniques to recanalize the portal venous axis through transplenic, transmesenteric, and/or transhepatic routes is revolutionizing this landscape. These advancements achieve TIPS placement and recanalization in 90%-100% of patients, warranting consideration in patients with cirrhosis with chronic PVT for whom LT would otherwise be contraindicated or when physiological anastomosis is not feasible.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — diagnostic imaging and thrombophilia workup: The initial diagnosis of PVT in cirrhosis is established on Doppler ultrasound, which has 89%–93% sensitivity and 92%–99% specificity for PVT. Cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI should be performed to assess for concurrent hepatic malignancy, confirm diagnosis of PVT, characterize PVT by extent, degree of occlusion, chronicity, and establish a baseline for longitudinal assessment, and both CT and MRI have excellent sensitivity and specificity for PVT. Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboembolism or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia, and as portal hypertension is the main driver of PVT development in cirrhosis, routine screening for thrombophilic disorders is not warranted in the absence of risk factors such as personal history of additional thrombi, family history of thromboembolic disease, or laboratory evidence of bone marrow disorder.

Discussion

The results of this study showed that anticoagulation with DS is safe and effective treatment, significantly reducing the risk of progression of PVT and liver decompensation. In our study, the response rate (CR + PR) was higher than 75% in all the groups of patients tested in this study. These results are to a large extent similar to those reported by Naeshiro et al. who reported response rate of 77% (CR 15%, PR 62%) after 2-week treatment with DS. Interestingly, the treatment was not associated with severe adverse events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or worsening of liver dysfunction (Fig. 4).

Although no side effects were encountered, PVT relapse occurred in about third of the patients, though a second course of DS treatment was efficacious in 54% of the patients. In this regard, the second course of DS treatment was followed by warfarin for maintenance therapy. It is important to keep the international normalized ratio (INR) at less than 2 during warfarin use. The prognosis of patients with unresolved PVT remains poor, including death from hepatic failure.

The treatment goals in PVT include the reversal or prevention of progression of thrombosis in the portal venous system and prevention/treatment of complications. Management decisions must be tailored to the individual patient and should be based on the experience of the attending specialist, since there are only a few randomized controlled trials and no standardized treatment protocols are currently available. The current guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommend that all patients with acute PVT be anticoagulated for at least 3 months, starting with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), followed by an oral anticoagulant. Long-term anticoagulation is recommended for patients with permanent risk factors or with distal extension of the thrombus into the mesenteric veins. In the setting of chronic PVT, patients should be screened for varices and receive appropriate prophylaxis, with long-term anticoagulation therapy being one consideration for patients with risk factors for thrombosis. At present, no standard recommendations exist for patients with cirrhosis.

### Baveno VII-renewing consensus in portal hypertension [^117LKCkG]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

To expand on the work of previous meetings, a virtual Baveno VII workshop was organised for October 2021. Among patients with compensated cirrhosis or compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD - defined at the Baveno VI conference), the presence or absence of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) is associated with differing outcomes, including risk of death, and different diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Accordingly, the Baveno VII workshop was entitled "Personalized Care for Portal Hypertension". The main fields of discussion were the relevance and indications for measuring the hepatic venous pressure gradient as a gold standard, the use of non-invasive tools for the diagnosis of cACLD and CSPH, the impact of aetiological and non-aetiological therapies on the course of cirrhosis, the prevention of the first episode of decompensation, the management of an acute bleeding episode, the prevention of further decompensation, as well as the diagnosis and management of splanchnic vein thrombosis and other vascular disorders of the liver. For each of these 9 topics, a thorough review of the medical literature was performed, and a series of consensus statements/recommendations were discussed and agreed upon. A summary of the most important conclusions/recommendations derived from the workshop is reported here. The statements are classified as unchanged, changed, and new in relation to Baveno VI.

### Risks and benefits of TIPS in HCC and other liver malignancies: a literature review [^111gAKdZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic liver diseases are often complicated by the development of ascites, variceal bleeding and other symptoms of portal hypertension. Besides systemic treatment, e.g. with non-selective beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is effective for managing clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). Following the Baveno VII Consensus Conference recommendations, TIPS is a valuable treatment option in variceal rebleeding, treatment-refractory ascites, Budd-Chiari syndrome, portal vein thrombosis without cirrhosis and thrombosis of the portal vein trunk in cirrhosis without recanalization on anticoagulation. Contraindications for TIPS in patients include severe heart and liver failure (Child–Pugh score of more than 13 or a Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of more than 19) and chronic or recurrent hepatic encephalopathy (HE). According to a review article from 2022, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most prominent contributor to cancer-related deaths globally. In over 90% of cases, HCC is diagnosed in the setting of chronic liver diseases.

Consequently, patients with HCC often suffer from CSPH and may benefit from TIPS implantation. However, the role of TIPS in HCC is under debate due to the risk of liver failure, HCC spread and potentially less effective subsequent locoregional HCC treatment. Most randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating TIPS and high-volume paracentesis excluded patients with HCC. Thus, the role of TIPS in HCC is not well-studied. Even less evidence exists regarding the role of TIPS in metastatic liver disease.

This review summarizes the current knowledge about the risks and benefits of TIPS placement in patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by liver malignancies.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^113GxwCj]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — The TR identified 12 studies of anticoagulation (low-molecular-weight heparin or VKA), and no studies of DOACs met inclusion; anticoagulation substantially increased complete or partial recanalization versus no treatment (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.73–2.98), overall bleeding did not appear elevated compared with controls, and portal hypertensive bleeding was decreased (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16–0.75). In patients with cirrhosis and acute or subacute nontumoral PVT, the AGA suggests using anticoagulation over no anticoagulation for treatment of PVT. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence), and patients who place higher value on bleeding risk and lower value on uncertain benefits would reasonably choose no anticoagulation.

### The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis… [^111G54P7]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Therapies HCC is highly resistant to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. 6Oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the mainstay systemic agents of choice in the treatment of HCC. There are four drugs approved worldwide. Ten years ago, sorafenib proved superior to placebo in prolonging overall survival of patients with advanced HCC, with preserved liver function in the pivotal SHARP trial. In summary, available systemic agents, including TKIs, immunotherapy agents with checkpoint blockade inhibitors, and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, have all been shown to prolong survival in patients with advanced HCC with strong scientific evidence. In addition, sequencing the available agents offers prolonged survival for many patients. Indeed, response to systemic therapies may open the door for locoregional therapies, including surgery, to further improve prognosis.

29Liver-directed therapies for PVTT include percutaneous thermal ablation and transarterial therapies. Data on percutaneous thermal ablation for PVTT are limited, 30and the procedure is technically challenging for central PVTT because of the proximity to the bile ducts and hepatic vasculature. Transarterial therapies include transarterial embolization with microspheres, TACE, and transarterial administration of 90Y-labeled microspheres, often called transarterial radioembolization or SIRT. Transarterial Chemoembolization for PVTT Two randomized controlled trials, several meta-analyses, and smaller studies have demonstrated increased OS after TACE for patients with intermediate-stage HCC without PVTT.
3. 8% and 0%, respectively; p <. 001), with a median OS of 7. 1 months in the TACE arm and
4. 1 months in the best supportive care arm and a 30-day mortality of 1. 2%.

Of note, although all patients in the TACE arm did better than those in the conservative arm, TACE patients with only branch vessel PVTT did significantly better than those with main PVTT, including greater tumor response and increased OS (median OS, 10. 2 months vs. Although there are no large randomized controlled trials that compare TACE with TARE for patients with PVTT, nonrandomized, prospective, and retrospective data have reported a slightly superior OS and progression-free survival with TARE, with notably fewer side effects.

### Current knowledge and management of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis [^114R52aF]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is an increasingly recognised complication of cirrhosis whose incidence increases in parallel with the severity of cirrhosis. Several risk factors have been associated with the occurrence and progression of PVT. Although the negative effect of complete PVT on the surgical outcome of liver transplant recipients is clear, its impact on cirrhosis progression remains uncertain. Treatment options include anticoagulants and interventional thrombolytic therapies, which are chosen almost on a case-by-case basis depending on the characteristics of the patient and the thrombus. In this manuscript, we review current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis and classification, natural history, clinical consequences and treatment of non-neoplastic PVT in cirrhosis.

### Portal vein thrombosis; risk factors, clinical presentation and treatment [^114DJpbE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last years, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is increasingly frequently being diagnosed by wide use of ultrasound-Doppler equipment. Recently, the lifetime risk of getting PVT in the general population is reported to be 1%. The condition, thus, attracts more focus. The conception of the severity of the problem among treating physicians varies between desolate and unimportant. The recommended therapeutic approach varies between one of expectancy and active intervention aimed at supposed risk factors and complications. Accordingly, there is a need for a basis for clinical decisions.

Risk factors and complications to PVT have become better defined although most of the information derives from patients with cirrhosis. Still, the rational management of PVT is still not adequately understood, and there have been no controlled studies. Based on some case-series, anticoagulation may be associated with recanalization of both acute and chronic thrombosis. Band ligation remains central in treating acute variceal bleeding. Secondary prophylaxis of rebleeding with ligation is effective; however, there are insufficient data on β-blockade alone or in combination with endoscopy.

PVT seems most often to develop in the presence of both systemic and local risk factors, but the relative importance of these factors for the course and treatment strategy of the condition remains unclear.

Thus, there are several unresolved issues regarding PVT that due to the rarity of the condition cannot be clarified by large trials.

Therefore, the aim of this case-series was to describe risk factors, clinical presentation, complications, treatment and outcome in patients with PVT in a tertiary university hospital.

### Intrahepatic portal cavernoma as an indication for liver transplantation [^112FU6R3]. Liver Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Cavernous transformation of the portal vein (portal cavernoma) consists of a periportal or/and intrahepatic venous collateral network, developed as a result of acute or long-standing portal vein thrombosis. Better control of hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications in the patients with portal cavernoma substantially improves their life span and the clinical outcome. However, biliary complications that occur in the late stages of this disease have been recently recognized as challenging management issues because they recur and are difficult to treat. Because of the relatively small number of the patients with cholangiopathy due to portal cavernoma, there is no current standardized treatment approach. We report the case of a predominantly intrahepatic portal cavernoma occurring in a patient with chronic idiopathic portal vein thrombosis, which led to severe cholangiopathy that mimicked primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma, was unresponsive to endoscopic stent placement, and finally required liver transplantation.
