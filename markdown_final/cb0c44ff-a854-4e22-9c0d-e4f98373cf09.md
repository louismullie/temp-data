## Question

What's the first line agent recommended for an uncomplicated UTI in a non-immune compromised patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended first-line agent for treating an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in a non-immunocompromised patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and ensuring this is truly an uncomplicated lower UTI. Then, I should verify the guideline-endorsed first-line agents and their dosing. Next, I will review comparative effectiveness and safety, including adverse event profiles and resistance considerations. After that, I need to check local resistance thresholds and how they influence empiric choices. I will then consider patient-specific factors that modify selection, including allergies, renal function, pregnancy, and prior antibiotic exposure. Finally, I should outline alternatives if first-line agents are unsuitable, clarify what to avoid, and confirm duration and follow-up recommendations, including any role for delayed or non-antibiotic strategies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and ensure we are dealing with an uncomplicated lower UTI in a non-immunocompromised patient, which typically presents with dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic discomfort without fever, flank pain, or systemic signs, and in whom urine culture is not routinely required for initial management unless there are red flags or treatment failure risks [^117VnG78] [^1132xnmk].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline-endorsed first-line agents and their standard regimens so I don't misstate dosing or duration. Contemporary guidance consistently recommends nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line options, with nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, TMP-SMX 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days, and fosfomycin 3 g as a single dose; some recent guidance also includes pivmecillinam where available, typically 400 mg three times daily for 3 days, acknowledging somewhat lower efficacy but favorable stewardship characteristics [^117VnG78] [^1132XuuX] [^116hPLMo].

> Hold on, I should verify comparative effectiveness and safety signals across these agents so I don't overstate equivalence. Multiple contemporary analyses show that guideline-concordant first-line therapies outperform fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams on composite failure outcomes and revisits, with nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX demonstrating strong effectiveness and favorable safety profiles; nitrofurantoin has a particularly low propensity for resistance selection, while TMP-SMX remains effective when local resistance is under about 20% [^114FurQs] [^11166m3B] [^111ptg8h] [^111fdQLH].

> I need to check adverse event profiles carefully because they can meaningfully influence agent selection. Compared with nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX carries higher risks of hypersensitivity, rash, urticaria, acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas nitrofurantoin is generally well tolerated but should be avoided in significant renal impairment and in late pregnancy due to theoretical risks; fosfomycin is typically well tolerated as a single dose, and pivmecillinam has a benign safety profile in trials [^1142QscD] [^113B1ky2].

> Next, I should review local resistance patterns because they directly shape empiric choices. TMP-SMX should be avoided empirically when local E. coli resistance exceeds about 20%, in which case nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin are preferred; nitrofurantoin has shown exceptional durability against resistance emergence, and fosfomycin remains a low-resistance option despite somewhat lower clinical cure rates in some comparisons [^111fdQLH] [^1132XuuX] [^111ptg8h].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that could shift the first-line pick. In sulfa allergy, TMP-SMX is contraindicated and nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin are suitable. In significant renal impairment, nitrofurantoin should be avoided. In pregnancy, nitrofurantoin is generally avoided near term and TMP-SMX is typically avoided in the first trimester, so beta-lactams may be preferred with culture guidance. Recent TMP-SMX exposure increases the risk of resistance and favors choosing a different first-line agent. In men with suspected prostatitis, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are inadequate for tissue penetration and TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones with longer courses are indicated [^114FafnN] [^117H4oaD] [^1132xnmk].

> But wait, what if first-line agents are unsuitable or resistance patterns are unfavorable. In that case, beta-lactams such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefpodoxime can be used, recognizing lower effectiveness than first-line agents and a higher risk of recurrence; fluoroquinolones remain effective but should be reserved due to ecological harm, resistance selection, and serious adverse effects including tendon injury and CNS effects, and are not first-line for uncomplicated cystitis in most guidance [^117VnG78] [^112ZuMBn] [^111fdQLH].

> I should double-check duration recommendations so I don't inadvertently extend therapy unnecessarily. For women with uncomplicated cystitis, 3 days of TMP-SMX, 5 days of nitrofurantoin, and single-dose fosfomycin are all acceptable and effective regimens; for men, durations are longer, typically 7 days, and for febrile UTI or suspected prostatitis, 10–14 days may be warranted; culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained in men and in women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, or atypical presentations to guide therapy and duration [^117VnG78] [^1132XuuX] [^114RqvM3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about non-antibiotic strategies as first-line. NSAIDs alone are inferior to antibiotics for symptom resolution and are associated with higher rates of rescue antibiotic use and possibly more pyelonephritis in some analyses. They may be considered only in select patients with mild symptoms through shared decision-making or as part of a delayed prescribing strategy, but antibiotics remain first-line for most patients [^1152Doak] [^112m772W] [^1123zsv2].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy to ensure internal consistency with the evidence. Given effectiveness, safety, and resistance considerations, nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days is an excellent default first-line choice in nonpregnant women with normal renal function. TMP-SMX 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days is equally appropriate when local resistance is under 20% and there is no sulfa allergy. Fosfomycin 3 g once is a reasonable alternative, particularly when adherence to a multi-day regimen is a concern or when resistance to other agents is high, though clinical cure may be slightly lower. Pivmecillinam is an emerging option where available and can be used for 3 days in appropriate patients [^117VnG78] [^1132XuuX] [^116hPLMo].

> I should confirm follow-up and stewardship elements so we close the loop appropriately. Routine test-of-cure is not needed in asymptomatic patients after treatment, but persistent or recurrent symptoms warrant repeat urinalysis and culture with susceptibilities; clinicians should avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum agents, tailor therapy to local antibiograms, and minimize fluoroquinolone use for uncomplicated cystitis to protect patients and preserve future options [^111XL5y9] [^117VnG78] [^111fdQLH].

---

The first-line agents for uncomplicated UTI in non-immunocompromised patients are **nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days** [^1132xnmk] [^117PqarS], **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days** (if local resistance is ≤ 20%) [^1132XuuX] [^1161NYG2], and **fosfomycin 3 g as a single dose** [^117PqarS]. These regimens are recommended for their **high efficacy, low resistance, and favorable safety profiles** [^114FurQs] [^117PqarS]. Fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are not first-line due to higher resistance, greater ecological harm, and more adverse effects [^111fdQLH] [^1142QscD]. Choice should be guided by **local resistance data, patient allergies, and renal function** [^1164EvA5] [^113zoJEq].

## Rationale for first-line agent selection

- **Efficacy**: Nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin achieve high clinical and microbiological cure rates [^notfound].
- **Resistance**: These agents maintain low resistance rates, supporting empiric use [^notfound].
- **Safety**: Favorable safety profiles with minimal serious adverse effects [^notfound].
- **Stewardship**: Narrow-spectrum options that minimize ecological harm and resistance selection [^117PqarS] [^1132XuuX].

---

## Agents not recommended as first-line therapy

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Reserved for complicated UTIs due to resistance, ecological harm, and serious adverse effects (e.g. tendon rupture, QT prolongation) [^111fdQLH] [^1132XuuX].
- **Beta-lactams**: Less effective and associated with higher recurrence; use only when first-line agents are unsuitable [^117VnG78] [^112ZuMBn].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Allergies**: Avoid TMP-SMX in sulfa allergy; consider nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin [^114FafnN] [^1164EvA5].
- **Renal function**: Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in significant renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Nitrofurantoin is preferred; avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester [^notfound].

## Emerging therapies

Gepotidacin, a novel oral antibiotic, has shown promise in recent trials and may offer an additional first-line option pending regulatory approval [^112sRKie]. Pivmecillinam is a **newly approved oral beta-lactam** for uncomplicated UTI, particularly useful in multidrug-resistant settings [^114NDdVN] [^113B1ky2].

---

## Conclusion

Nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin are the **first-line agents** for uncomplicated UTI in non-immunocompromised patients, selected based on local resistance, patient factors, and stewardship principles [^1132XuuX] [^113zoJEq].

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) microbiome and non-antibiotic approaches — emerging data highlight the role of host microbial communities and the need for alternatives to antibiotics: "Emerging data regarding the bacterial communities of the human bladder, bowel, and vagina suggests that depletion or alteration of the normal host microbiome may disrupt host innate barriers to infection and alter innate immune system function, contributing to the development of rUTI", and "Such disruptions in these communities may be the direct consequence of antibiotic treatments". "A better understanding of the relationship between the urinary microbiome and bladder health may fundamentally transform our earlier belief that urine is "sterile".

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Fluoroquinolone use for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a retrospective cohort study [^116gyawF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The United States Food & Drug Administration released an advisory in 2016 that fluoroquinolones be relegated to second-line agents for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) given reports of rare but serious side effects; similar warnings have followed from Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency. The objective was to determine whether alternative non-fluoroquinolone agents are as effective as fluoroquinolones in the treatment of UTIs.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study using administrative health data from six Canadian provinces. We identified women (n = 1 585 997) receiving antibiotic treatment for episodes of uncomplicated UTIs (n = 2 857 243) between January 1 2005 and December 31 2015. Clinical outcomes within 30 days from the initial antibiotic dispensation were compared among patients treated with a fluoroquinolone versus non-fluoroquinolone agents. High-dimensional propensity score adjustments were used to ensure comparable treatment groups and to minimize residual confounding.

Results

Fluoroquinolone use for UTI declined over the study period in five of six Canadian provinces and accounted for 22.3–48.5% of treatments overall. The pooled effect across the provinces indicated that fluoroquinolones were associated with fewer return outpatient visits (OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.87–0.92), emergency department visits (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.61–0.89), hospitalizations (OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.77–0.88), and repeat antibiotic dispensations (OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.75–0.80) within 30 days.

Conclusions

Fluoroquinolones are associated with improved clinical outcomes among women with uncomplicated UTIs. This benefit must be weighed against the risk of fluoroquinolone resistance and rare but serious fluoroquinolone side effects when selecting first-line treatment for these patients.

IDSA 2023 extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — preferred and alternative antibiotics are specified as follows: Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems are alternative agents for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and although effective, their use is discouraged when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are active. An aminoglycoside (as a single dose) and oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) are also alternative treatments for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and treatment suggestions for ESBL-E infections assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

Discussion

In this cohort study, using a large, contemporary clinical dataset, we demonstrate that IDSA guidelines for treatment of uncomplicated UTI remain robust in terms of both effectiveness and adverse events, despite major changes in the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Unless a patient has a history of drug resistance or intolerance or lives in a region where local rates of resistance are high, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remain the treatments of choice. We replicated our domain expert–derived results with an automated feature building package applied to a common data model, thereby supporting the hypothesis that complex causal inference analyses combined with careful cohort selection can be semiautomatable. This will help promote reproducibility of our findings in other health systems and opens inquiry into other important clinical questions.

We observed a small increase in rates of revisits for patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy compared with those receiving first-line antibiotics. This result is surprising because fluoroquinolones are thought to be equivalent or superior to nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in terms of clinical effectiveness. The differences were limited to outpatients with a diagnosis of lower UTI and were much less pronounced for inpatients, suggesting that the benefit of first-line treatments is restricted to classic presentations of uncomplicated UTI. Follow-up visits soon after treatment may be the result of drug intolerance, toxic effects, or selection of a drug to which an organism is resistant. The latter may be a possible explanation for why people treated with nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had fewer revisits. Recent workhas suggested that rates of resistance to nitrofurantoin remain low, despite its widespread use, and may be due to a high barrier to resistance. Although resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is more common, clinicians are less likely to use this drug on the basis of IDSA guidancethat recommends avoiding it when rates of local resistance exceed 20%, which is a common scenario throughout the US. In contrast, resistance to fluoroquinolones is most often mediated by the accumulation of variants in a single gene, often in response to antibiotic exposure. Given the high rate of fluoroquinolone prescription in the community, this may increase the risk for prescribing an agent to which the organism is resistant. This is further complicated by the fact that uncomplicated UTI is often managed over telephone and without culture data. Finally, given that prescribers are prone to prescribe the same antibiotic, the impact of prior exposure may be more likely to lead to selection of resistance if that antibiotic is a fluoroquinolone and the patients are otherwise healthy outpatients with a low risk for colonization by drug-resistant organisms.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: randomised controlled trial [^1123zsv2]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

We have to reject the hypothesis of non-inferiority of initial symptomatic treatment, and we cannot generally recommend the ibuprofen first approach. This treatment option, however, can be discussed with women with mild to moderate symptoms in a shared decision making approach or within a strategy of delayed prescription. Future research is needed to identify patients for whom symptomatic treatment is sufficient as it has the potential to considerably reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions for women with mild to moderate symptoms of urinary tract infection, in particular those with negative results on culture.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^116j5Mhf]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^11166m3B]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common indication for outpatient antimicrobial therapy. National guidelines for the management of uncomplicated UTI were published in 2011, but the extent to which they align with current practices, patient diversity, and pathogen biology, all of which have evolved greatly in the time since their publication, is not fully known.

Objective

To reevaluate the effectiveness and adverse event profile for first-line antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and oral β-lactams for treating uncomplicated UTI in contemporary clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, population-based cohort study used a claims dataset from Independence Blue Cross, which contains inpatient, outpatient, laboratory, and pharmacy claims that occurred between 2012 and 2021, formatted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Participants were nonpregnant female individuals aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of uncomplicated, nonrecurrent UTI at an outpatient setting. Patients must also have been treated with first-line (nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or ofloxacin), or oral β-lactam (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefadroxil, or cefpodoxime) antibiotics. Data analysis was performed from November 2021 to August 2024.

Exposures

Patients exposed to first-line antibiotics were assigned to the treatment group, and those exposed to fluoroquinolone or β-lactam treatments were assigned to control groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite end point for treatment failure, defined as outpatient or inpatient revisit within 30 days for UTI, pyelonephritis, or sepsis. Secondary outcomes were the risk of 4 common antibiotic-associated adverse events: gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Results

There were 57 585 episodes of UTI among 49 037 female patients (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [20.1]) years), with prescriptions for first-line antibiotics in 35 018 episodes (61%), fluoroquinolones in 21 140 episodes (37%), and β-lactams in 1427 episodes (2%). After adjustment, receipt of first-line therapies was associated with an absolute risk difference of -1.78% (95% CI, -2.37% to -1.06%) for having a revisit for UTI within 30 days of diagnosis vs fluoroquinolones. First-line therapies were associated with an absolute risk difference of -6.40% (95% CI, -10.14% to -3.24%) for 30-day revisit compared with β-lactam antibiotics. Differences in adverse events were similar between all comparators. Results were identical for models built with an automated OMOP feature extraction package.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with uncomplicated UTI derived from a large regional claims dataset, national treatment guidelines published almost 14 years ago continue to recommend optimal treatments. These results also provide proof-of-principle that automated feature extraction methods for OMOP formatted data can emulate manually curated models, thereby promoting reproducibility and generalizability.

### Association of adverse events with antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection [^1142QscD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about the relative harms of different antibiotic regimens prescribed to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). We sought to compare the risk of adverse events associated with commonly used oral antibiotic regimens for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

Methods

Using data from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, we identified 1 169 033 otherwise healthy, nonpregnant women aged 18–44 years with uncomplicated UTI who initiated an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens from 1 July 2006 to 30 September 2015. We used propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the association between antibiotic agent and adverse events.

Results

Of 2 first-line agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (vs nitrofurantoin) was associated with higher risk of several adverse drug events including hypersensitivity reaction (hazard ratio, 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 2.30–2.98), acute renal failure (2.56; 1.55–4.25), skin rash (2.42; 2.13–2.75), urticaria (1.37; 1.19–1.57), abdominal pain (1.14; 1.09–1.19), and nausea/vomiting (1.18; 1.10–1.28), but a similar risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events. Compared with nitrofurantoin, non-first-line agents were associated with higher risk of several adverse drug events and potential microbiome-related adverse events including non-Clostridium difficile diarrhea, C. difficile infection, vaginitis/vulvovaginal candidiasis, and pneumonia. Treatment duration modified the risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events.

Conclusions

The risks of adverse drug events and potential microbiome-related events differ widely by antibiotic agent and duration. These findings underscore the utility of using real-world data to fill evidentiary gaps related to antibiotic safety.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^114FurQs]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) recommended in national guidelines published in 2011 still optimal?

Findings

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### A decision algorithm to promote outpatient antimicrobial stewardship for uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^111RMPhH]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a major cause of treatment failure and leads to increased use of broad-spectrum agents, which begets further resistance. This vicious cycle is epitomized by uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), which affects one in two women during their life and is associated with increasing antibiotic resistance and high rates of prescription for broad-spectrum second-line agents. To address this, we developed machine learning models to predict antibiotic susceptibility using electronic health record data and built a decision algorithm for recommending the narrowest possible antibiotic to which a specimen is susceptible. When applied to a test cohort of 3629 patients presenting between 2014 and 2016, the algorithm achieved a 67% reduction in the use of second-line antibiotics relative to clinicians. At the same time, it reduced inappropriate antibiotic therapy, defined as the choice of a treatment to which a specimen is resistant, by 18% relative to clinicians. For specimens where clinicians chose a second-line drug but the algorithm chose a first-line drug, 92% (1066 of 1157) of decisions ended up being susceptible to the first-line drug. When clinicians chose an inappropriate first-line drug, the algorithm chose an appropriate first-line drug 47% (183 of 392) of the time. Our machine learning decision algorithm provides antibiotic stewardship for a common infectious syndrome by maximizing reductions in broad-spectrum antibiotic use while maintaining optimal treatment outcomes. Further work is necessary to improve generalizability by training models in more diverse populations.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^111DGJZF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112Vuejg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections encountered and treated in outpatients. A set of guidelines published in 1999 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line therapy.

Methods

We undertook a study of cross-sectional data describing the use of ambulatory medical services in the United States by women ≥ 18 years of age who had uncomplicated UTI. Data from 1996 to 2001 were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to (1) examine the prescribing practices for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI and (2) determine whether these practices were influenced by the recommendation in the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The major outcomes measurement was to evaluate whether antibacterial selection was influenced by the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Data were analyzed by year, treatment in private offices vs. hospital clinics, race, geographic location, the specialty of the prescribing health care provider, and the payment method of the patient.

Results

We identified 2339 cases of uncomplicated UTI. Trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin were the most commonly prescribed drugs. Despite the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, the use of trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole did not change significantly (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–1.30; p = 0.53), whereas the use of ciprofloxacin increased significantly (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.75; P ≤ .016). Similar results were obtained after adjusting for age, geographic region, race, physician specialty, payment method, and whether the visit was by a new or returning patient.

Conclusions

Despite the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendation of trimethaprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI, physicians in the United States have not altered their prescribing practices. Adjustment for age, geographic region, race, physician specialty, and payment method confirmed a lack of adherence to this recommendation.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative uropathogens: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^117PCWDx]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represent the highest priority for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Cefiderocol (S-649266), a new siderophore cephalosporin, has broad activity against Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.

Methods

We did a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority trial at 67 hospitals in 15 countries. Adults (≥ 18 years) admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection with or without pyelonephritis or those with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were randomly assigned (2:1) by an interactive web or voice response system to receive 1 h intravenous infusions of cefiderocol (2 g) or imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) three times daily, every 8 h for 7–14 days. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline urine culture with more than two uropathogens, a fungal urinary tract infection, or pathogens known to be carbapenem resistant. The primary endpoint was the composite of clinical and microbiological outcomes at test of cure (ie, 7 days after treatment cessation), which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% and 20% margins) of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug and had a qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug, according to the treatment they received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02321800.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2015, and Aug 16, 2016, 452 patients were randomly assigned to cefiderocol (n = 303) or imipenem-cilastatin (n = 149), of whom 448 patients (n = 300 in the cefiderocol group; n = 148 in the imipenem-cilastatin group) received treatment. 371 patients (n = 252 patients in the cefiderocol group; n = 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group) had qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10⁵ CFU/mL) and were included in the primary efficacy analysis. At test of cure, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved by 183 (73%) of 252 patients in the cefiderocol group and 65 (55%) of 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with an adjusted treatment difference of 18·58% (95% CI 8·23–28·92; p = 0·0004), establishing the non-inferiority of cefiderocol. Cefiderocol was well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 122 (41%) of 300 patients in the cefiderocol group and 76 (51%) of 148 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with gastrointestinal disorders (ie, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) the most common adverse events for both treatment groups (35 [12%] patients in the cefiderocol group and 27 [18%] patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group).

Interpretation

Intravenous infusion of cefiderocol (2 g) three times daily was non-inferior compared with imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in people with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. The results of this study will provide the basis for submission of a New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration. Clinical trials of hospital-acquired pneumonia and carbapenem-resistant infections are ongoing.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^112FQCwS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by DTR P. aeruginosa — preferred and alternative treatments — lists ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, and cefiderocol as the preferred treatment options, while tobramycin or amikacin (as a single dose) and colistin are alternative options. Preferred agents are based on clinical trials showing non-inferiority, and data are insufficient to favor 1 of these agents over others for uncomplicated cystitis because available trials generally do not include patients infected by pathogens with DTR phenotypes. A single dose of tobramycin or amikacin is an alternative option, and a single IV dose of tobramycin or amikacin are likely effective for uncomplicated cystitis as aminoglycosides are nearly exclusively eliminated by the renal route in their active form, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical data are lacking.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — antibiotic choice for acute cystitis should incorporate patient and pathogen factors, with specific options and caveats: Antibiotic choice should take into account specific patient factors (allergies, renal function), complicating factors, and uropathogen sensitivity. For acute cystitis in women with rUTI, nitrofurantoin is a key first-line agent; fosfomycin is effective; clinician may need to request sensitivity testing; TMP-SMX can also be used if resistance is less than 20% in the community; and fluoroquinolones are not first-line treatment of acute cystitis without complicating factors.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^1143JJsA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

On the basis of cost and efficacy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in young women. The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs should be discouraged, except in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or trimethoprim, who have a high frequency of antibiotic resistance because of recent antibiotic treatment or who reside in an area in which significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been noted. Continuous daily prophylaxis with one of these regimens for a period of six months: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one-half tablet per day; nitrofurantoin, 50 to 100 mg per day; norfloxacin, 200 mg per day; cephalexin, 250 mg per day; or trimethoprim, 100 mg per day. Each of these regimens has been shown to decrease the morbidity of recurrent UTIs without a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance.

Long-term studies have shown antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective for up to five years with trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin, without the emergence of drug resistance. 3, 19 Unfortunately, antibiotic prophylaxis does not appear to alter the natural history of recurrences because 40 to 60 percent of these women reestablish their pattern or frequency of infections within six months of stopping prophylaxis.
19. In patients who are unable to tolerate oral medication or who require hospitalization for concomitant medical problems, appropriate initial therapy may be parenteral administration of one of the following: a third-generation cephalosporin with antipseudomonal activity such as ceftazidime or cefoperazone.

Patients who are too ill to take oral antibiotics or who are unable to take them should initially be treated with parenterally administered single agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a third-generation cephalosporin, aztreonam, a broad-spectrum penicillin, a quinolone or an aminoglycoside. The choice of antibiotic is largely empiric, but Gram staining of the urine may be helpful. Once these patients have improved clinically, they can be switched to oral therapy based on the results of culture and sensitivity studies.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression", yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance". For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing". Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes", while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use".

### Managing uncomplicated urinary tract infections… [^114FafnN]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Besides resistance patterns, antibiotic choice should include consideration of the patient's allergy history, the cost and tolerability of the medication, and previous antibiotic use. TMP-SMX has been the standard therapy for UTIs; patients with a sulfa allergy can take trimethoprim alone and achieve a similar cure rate. Side effects include skin rash, nausea, and vomiting. Patients who are concomitantly taking sulfonylureas need glucose monitoring because of the enhanced glucose-lowering effects of TMP-SMX. TMP-SMX therapy should be avoided in patients with liver impairment. Beta-lactam antibiotics are no longer useful as first-line treatment for UTIs because of increased resistance and higher recurrence rates compared with other agents; however, they may be useful if urine culture indicates susceptibility. Third-generation cephalosporins have lower resistance rates and longer half-lives, allowing for less frequent dosing.

The most common side effects of the beta-lactams include rash, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache. Nitrofurantoin can be used in patients with normal renal function. Side effects are rare but may include malaise, cough, and dyspnea. Pulmonary fibrosis may rarely occur with long-term use. Fosfomycin is used as a single-dose treatment that is generally well tolerated but may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or esophageal discomfort. Antibiotics and dosing information for the treatment of UTIs are listed in. Short-course therapy using three days of antibiotics appears to provide similar eradication rates with fewer side effects than a seven- to 10-day course. Patients who may benefit from the longer course of therapy include women who are pregnant, who have diabetes mellitus, or who have a history of urinary tract symptoms.

Patients with recurrent UTIs can be offered continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis, patient-initiated treatment, or postcoital prophylaxis taken within two hours of sexual intercourse, if infection is associated with sexual activity. Urine culture is appropriate before prophylactic therapy is started to establish the susceptibility of the pathogen. Patient-initiated therapy using a short course of antibiotics may be successful in younger women. The authors conclude that TMP-SMX and the fluoroquinolones are useful first-line treatments for uncomplicated cystitis. Other options include a seven-day course of nitrofurantoin or a single dose of fosfomycin.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^114RqvM3]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In adults with febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI), data on optimal treatment duration in patients other than non-pregnant women without comorbidities are lacking.

Methods

A randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial among 35 primary care centers and 7 emergency departments of regional hospitals in the Netherlands. Women and men aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of fUTI were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 or 14 days (the second week being ciprofloxacin 500 mg or placebo orally twice daily). Patients indicated to receive antimicrobial treatment for at least 14 days were excluded from randomization. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit with preset subgroup analysis including sex. Secondary endpoints were bacteriologic cure rate at 10–18 days post-treatment and clinical cure at 70–84 days post-treatment.

Results

Of 357 patients included, 200 were eligible for randomization; 97 patients were randomly assigned to 7 days and 103 patients to 14 days of treatment. Overall, short-term clinical cure occurred in 85 (90%) patients treated for 7 days and in 94 (95%) of those treated for 14 days (difference -4.5%; 90% CI, -10.7 to 1.7; P non-inferiority = 0.072, non-inferiority not confirmed). In women, clinical cure was 94% and 93% in those treated for 7 and 14 days, respectively (difference 0.9; 90% CI, -6.9 to 8.7, P non-inferiority = 0.011, non-inferiority confirmed) and, in men, this was 86% versus 98% (difference -11.2; 90% CI -20.6 to -1.8, P superiority = 0.025, inferiority confirmed). The bacteriologic cure rate was 93% versus 97% (difference -4.3%; 90% CI, -9.7 to 1.2, P non-inferiority = 0.041) and the long-term clinical cure rate was 92% versus 91% (difference 1.6%; 90% CI, -5.3 to 8.4; P non-inferiority = 0.005) for 7 days versus 14 days of treatment, respectively. In the subgroups of men and women, long-term clinical cure rates met the criteria for non-inferiority, indicating there was no difference in the need for antibiotic retreatment for UTI during 70–84 days follow-up post-treatment.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be treated successfully with antibiotics for 7 days. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days during short-term follow-up but it is non-inferior when looking at longer follow-up.

Trial Registration

### Current options for the treatment of infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in different groups of patients [^114Gq4Rw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are a frequent cause of invasive infections worldwide. Carbapenems are nowadays the most used drugs to treat these infections. However, due to the increasing rates of resistance to these antimicrobials, carbapenem-sparing alternatives are being investigated.

Objectives and Sources

The aim of this narrative literature review is to summarize the published information on the currently available antibiotics for the treatment of ESBL-E infections, providing specific information on three subgroups of patients: Group 1, patients with severe infections or infections from high-risk sources or in severely immunocompromised patients; Group 2, patients with non-severe infections from intermediate-risk source; and Group 3, patients with non-severe urinary tract infection.

Content and Implications

For patients in Group 1, the current data would support the use of carbapenems. For milder infections, however, particularly urinary tract infections, other non-carbapenem antibiotics can be considered in selected cases, including beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations, cephamycins, temocillin and aminoglycosides. While specific studies should be performed in these situations, individualized decisions may be taken in order to avoid overuse of carbapenems.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^116ESqrF]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute UTI with complicating factors — Women with rUTI who have complicating factors, such as abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, require additional vigilance in diagnosis and management. Initial empiric therapy until culture results are available to guide therapy (consider only if local resistance < 20%) can include a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), an aminopenicillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3a (parenteral), or an aminoglycoside. For empirical treatment in severe cases or initial failure, options include a fluoroquinolone (if not used for initial therapy), piperacillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3b (parenteral), or a carbapenem. Not recommended for empirical treatment are aminopenicillins (eg, ampicillin, amoxicillin, bacampicillin), TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin trometamol.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, first-line therapy, ESCMID/IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to initiate any of the following regimens as first-line therapy in female patients with uncomplicated cystitis:

- nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID for 5 days, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage and efficacy compared to 3 days of TMP/SMX

- TMP/SMX 160/800 mg BID for 3 days, if local resistance rates of uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis are < 20% or if the infecting strain is known to be susceptible

- fosfomycin trometamol 3 g in a single dose, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it appears to have inferior efficacy compared with standard short-course regimens

- pivmecillinam (in regions where it is available) 400 mg BID for 3–7 days, due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, recognizing that it may have inferior efficacy compared with other available therapies.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1127WTBu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — conditional treatment and acute self-treatment: Conditional treatment uses a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or follow-up without treatment, with antibiotics started only if symptoms progress or do not resolve, and has not been studied in women older than 65 years or with rUTI; in women younger than 65 years, resolution without antibiotics occurred in 20% to 47%, but one study reported pyelonephritis in the placebo group at 2% to 2.6%. In women with rUTI, acute treatment can be initiated by a clinician or patient at symptom onset, and antibiotics are traditional first-line treatment of bacterial cystitis.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114midvA]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — scope and exclusions specify that for the purposes of this Guideline the Panel considers only recurrent episodes in women of localized cystitis restricted to the lower urinary tract; infections with suspected upper urinary tract or systemic involvement should be managed differently, and in this Guideline the term urinary tract infection (UTI) will refer to acute bacterial cystitis. This Guideline does not specifically consider patients in whom complicating factors may put them at higher risk for decreased treatment efficacy or for progression of a localized UTI to systemic infection, including an anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract such as stone disease, diverticulum, or neurogenic bladder, an immunocompromised host, or urinary foreign bodies such as indwelling urethral catheters or ureteral stents.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^1161NYG2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — intermittent self-administered TMP-SMX versus daily prophylactic TMP-SMX: In a medium risk of bias crossover trial (N = 38), intermittent self-administered TMP-SMX for acute symptoms was associated with increased risk of ≥ 1 UTI versus daily prophylactic TMP-SMX (68% versus 6.1%; RR: 11.16; 95% CI: 2.86 to 43.63) and was also associated with increased UTI frequency (2.2 versus 0.2 microbiologically confirmed episodes per patient-year; p < 0.001). Most UTI episodes in women on intermittent dosing resolved with single-dose TMP-SMX treatment, and the rest responded to 10- to 20-day courses of antibiotics, and there was no difference in risk of any adverse event (8.8% versus 15.2%; RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.15 to 2.24).

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: a decision and cost analysis [^112YEba3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, $106 when it was 20%, and $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $107 at current levels of FQ resistance. When > 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to > 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^112m772W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review, we evaluated five randomized controlled trials (of 1309 patients) comparing NSAIDs with antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Although study protocols and reported outcomes were heterogeneous, two smaller studies that were at high and unclear risk of bias found no difference between NSAIDs and antibiotics, while three studies with low risk of bias supported antibiotic therapy over NSAIDs in terms of symptom resolution. Furthermore, two studies at low risk of bias found higher risks of pyelonephritis in patients who received NSAIDs versus antibiotics; the third study with low risk of bias also found a higher risk of pyelonephritis in patients receiving NSAIDs, but the confidence interval for the risk difference included zero. In sum, these findings support the use of antibiotics as first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTI for both symptom resolution and prevention of pyelonephritis.

Despite the superiority of antibiotic therapy, 39–58% of participants in the NSAID groups achieved symptom resolution by day 3 or 4. For comparison, a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials demonstrated clinical success (symptom improvement or resolution by first follow-up visit) in 25–54% of participants in the placebo arms. One possible explanation for why many UTI symptoms resolved without antibiotic therapy is that not all women included in the studies may have had true UTIs. Inclusion in most studies was based on symptoms alone — a commonly accepted approach for uncomplicated UTIsthat is consistent with several clinical practice guidelines from countries where the trials were conducted. – However, clinical symptoms only correctly diagnose UTIs half of the time. Thus, it is possible that a large number of participants may not have had a UTI or been at risk of worsening infection. Indeed, in the four studies that collected urine specimens for culture at the time of inclusion, only 64–86% of patients in either study arm had positive cultures. Women often suffer from urinary symptoms for a host of reasons (e.g. incontinence, medication side effects) that are misdiagnosed as a UTI. Barriers to obtaining timely urine testing often promote alternatives to testing, such as "as needed" antibiotic prescriptions or prescriptions by phone.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Avoid using a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the first-line treatment of… [^116Q9Kvw]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

For women with uncomplicated UTIs, fluoroquinolone antibiotics should not be considered first-line treatment. Although fluoroquinolones are efficacious in three-day regimens, they have a higher risk of ecological adverse events, such as increasing multidrug resistant organisms. Thus, fluoroquinolones should only be used for the treatment of acute UTIs for women who should not be prescribed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treating symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infections in non-pregnant adult women [^1152Doak]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Almost half of all women will have at least one symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime. Although usually self-remitting, 74% of women contacting a health professional are prescribed an antibiotic, and in rare instances, they may progress to more severe infections. Therefore, the standard of care for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs is oral antibiotic therapy, which aims to achieve symptom resolution and prevent the development of complications such as pyelonephritis. Given that a number of UTIs are self-remitting, non-antibiotic treatments that may help reduce the severity or duration of symptoms or reduce the need for antibiotics may be of benefit.

Objectives

This review aims to investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 18 November 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women. The outcomes of interest were: 1) short-term resolution of symptoms (days 1 to 4); 2) medium-term resolution of symptoms (days 5 to 10); and 3) incidence of adverse events (including progression to sepsis or complicated UTI, hospitalisation or need for intravenous antibiotics, gastrointestinal complications, or death) up to 30 days from randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, abstract selection, and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Six studies (1646 randomised women) published between 2010 and 2019 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 28 to 50 years; previous UTIs were reported in 7.2% to 77% of participants. There were five multicentre studies, and studies were carried out in Denmark, Germany, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Overall, the risk of bias was low or unclear. Compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs probably result in less short-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1144 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91; I² = 75%; moderate certainty) and may also result in less medium-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1140 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I² = 78%; low certainty). NSAIDs probably make little or no difference to the number of adverse events by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; I² = 64%; moderate certainty). NSAIDs may result in longer duration of symptoms (2 studies, 553 participants: MD 1.00 day, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39; I² = 0%; low certainty). NSAIDs may result in a lower proportion of women experiencing microbiological resolution by day 10 compared to antibiotics (2 studies, 322 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 0%; low certainty) and probably result in more women using rescue antibiotic treatment by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.42; I² = 49%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may reduce the use of rescue antibiotic treatment (1 study, 183 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to adverse events at day 30. Compared to the herbal product Uva-Ursi, NSAIDs may make little or no difference to adverse events by day 30.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of NSAIDs for symptomatic management of uncomplicated UTIs probably results in less short-term resolution of symptoms and greater use of rescue antibiotics by day 30 compared to primary antibiotic treatment. Future studies should consider the various confounders such as degree of symptoms, microbiology, type and resistance patterns of bacteria involved and number of UTI episodes in the months prior to commencement of treatment.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; p = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112xZtgT]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Addressing antibiotic resistance [^112N6hvV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has traditionally been based on 2 important principles: the spectrum of organisms causing acute UTI is highly predictable (Escherichia coli accounts for 75% to 90% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounts for 5% to 15% of isolates), and the susceptibility patterns of these organisms have also been relatively predictable. As a result, empiric therapy with short-course trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been a standard management approach for uncomplicated cystitis. However, antibiotic resistance is now becoming a major factor not only in nosocomial complicated UTIs, but also in uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs. Resistance to TMP-SMX now approaches 18% to 22% in some regions of the United States, and nearly 1 in 3 bacterial strains causing cystitis or pyelonephritis demonstrate resistance to amoxicillin. Fortunately, resistance to other agents, such as nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones, has remained low, at approximately 2%. Preliminary data suggest that the increase in TMP-SMX resistance is associated with poorer bacteriologic and clinical outcomes when TMP-SMX is used for therapy. As a result, these trends have necessitated a change in the management approach to community-acquired UTI. The use of TMP-SMX as a first-line agent for empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis is only appropriate in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is < 10% to 20%. In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered.

IDSA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to patients with antimicrobial-resistant UTI, IDSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as the preferred treatment option in patients with uncomplicated cystitis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^117LnxXk]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

RESULTS

Search Results and Study Details

A total of 1391 citations were retrieved by our search, including 15 duplicates removed prior to screening. Of these, 65 full-text studies were eligible for inclusion following title and abstract review and 5 randomized clinical trials were included (Fig. 1). Interrater agreement for study inclusion was excellent at 0.97. Four studies were conducted in Europe, and one was conducted in Pakistan.

Flow diagram of study selection.

Characteristics of Included Patients

Four studies, included adult women over the age of 18 while one studyincluded women over the age of 15. Upper age limits ranged from 50 to 70 years, with one studyhaving no upper age limit (Table 1). UTIs were generally defined as a constellation of typical symptoms (i.e. dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic/lower abdominal pain). One studyincluded individuals with self-diagnosed symptomatic cystitis if they had urine dipstick results positive for nitrites, leukocyte esterase, or both. Four studies, excluded patients with upper UTI signs (i.e. fever and back pain), pregnancy, diabetes, prior urological interventions, immunosuppressive states, urinary catheterization, recent UTI, current antibiotic or NSAID use, or contraindications to study drugs. Four studies, included baseline urine culture results at the time of inclusion, though culture results were not used as eligibility criteria (Table 1). The share of patients with positive urine cultures at the time of inclusion ranged from 67 to 86% in the NSAID groups and 64 to 80% in the antibiotic groups (Table 1).

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in the outpatient setting: a review [^117VnG78]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Urinary tract infection is among the most common reasons for an outpatient visit and antibiotic use in adult populations. The increasing prevalence of antibacterial resistance among community uropathogens affects the diagnosis and management of this clinical syndrome.

Objectives

To define the optimal approach for treating acute cystitis in young healthy women and in women with diabetes and men and to define the optimal approach for diagnosing acute cystitis in the outpatient setting.

Evidence Review

Evidence for optimal treatment regimens was obtained by searching PubMed and the Cochrane database for English-language studies published up to July 21, 2014.

Findings

Twenty-seven randomized clinical trials (6463 patients), 6 systematic reviews, and 11 observational studies (252,934 patients) were included in our review. Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women can be diagnosed without an office visit or urine culture. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days), nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals (100 mg twice daily for 5–7 days), and fosfomycin trometamol (3 g in a single dose) are all appropriate first-line therapies for uncomplicated cystitis. Fluoroquinolones are effective for clinical outcomes but should be reserved for more invasive infections. β-Lactam agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefpodoxime-proxetil) are not as effective as empirical first-line therapies. Immediate antimicrobial therapy is recommended rather than delayed treatment or symptom management with ibuprofen alone. Limited observational studies support 7 to 14 days of therapy for acute urinary tract infection in men. Based on 1 observational study and our expert opinion, women with diabetes without voiding abnormalities presenting with acute cystitis should be treated similarly to women without diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Immediate antimicrobial therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin is indicated for acute cystitis in adult women. Increasing resistance rates among uropathogens have complicated treatment of acute cystitis. Individualized assessment of risk factors for resistance and regimen tolerability is needed to choose the optimum empirical regimen.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for adult urinary tract infections within emergency department and urgent care settings [^112fHoxa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are frequently prescribed for treatment of UTI in the outpatient setting; however, data evaluating prescribing patterns after FDA safety warnings is limited, especially in UC. The study goal was to investigate and compare antimicrobial prescribing for UTIs in a single-site ED and an off-site UC in an urban, academic health system. This retrospective study included patients presenting with a UTI to the ED or UC between January and June 2018. Those 18 years or older with uncomplicated, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis were included. Exclusion criteria were catheter-related UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised, or hospitalization. Primary outcome was FQ prescribing rate for all UTI in the ED and UC. Secondary outcomes were rates of non-FQ prescribing, re-presentation, bug-drug mismatch, and treatment durations. 184 patients were included. FQ prescribing rate was similar in ED and UC (21.2% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.4). Non-FQs prescribed in ED and UC were nitrofurantoin (20.2% vs 53.6%), beta-lactams (46.1% vs 22.6%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5% vs. 5%). A longer than recommended duration was identified in 46.3% UC patients compared to 21.2% ED patients. Thirty-day re-presentation with persistent UTI symptoms occurred more frequently in the ED compared to UC (13.5% vs. 7.5%). Predictors of FQ prescribing on logistic regression were male, recurrent UTI, and malignancy. FQ prescribing rate for UTI treatment was low with no difference between ED and UC. Opportunity exists to improve treatment duration and antimicrobial choice.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^115Lxx2S]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

Antibiotic durations should always be individualized to the patient and their clinical status. Many studies have underrepresentation of critically ill patients.

# 7 days is recommended in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

* Consider prolonged courses of 14 days with non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli due to an increased risk of relapse/recurrence with shorter courses.

¶ After definitive source control.

† Trials excluded immunocompromised patients, patients with indwelling prostheses, infectious syndromes that required prolonged durations, or organisms that required prolonged durations of treatment (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis). Most evidence for shorter courses is in bacteremia from gram negative bacteria secondary to urinary tract infections. Control of the primary source and blood culture clearance should also be achieved.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

NEW ANTIBIOTICS AND NEW USES FOR OLD ANTIBIOTICS

Urinary Tract Infections

Due to antibiotic resistance and contraindications that sometimes limit the use of current first-line agents, there is room for new options in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). For the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, the results of 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3, were published in February 2024. These nearly identical trials tested gepotidacin, an oral, first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits DNA replication by binding 2 different topoisomerases at a binding site distinct from fluoroquinolones. Geopotidacin was compared with nitrofurantoin by randomizing female patients over the age of 12 years with uncomplicated UTIs to receive 1 of the 2 drugs for 5 days. The primary outcome was therapeutic success, which was a combination of clinical and microbiologic resolution at day 10–13. Gepotidacin was noninferior to nitrofurantoin in terms of the primary outcome in EAGLE-2, while it was superior to nitrofurantoin in EAGLE-3. Notably, these differences were driven mostly by higher rates of microbiologic failure in the nitrofurantoin groups, as clinical success rates were relatively similar between the 2 arms. Gepotidacin has been submitted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and a decision regarding its approval is expected in 2025.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^116kWawM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most commonly diagnosed infections, and prior studies have reported discordance in antibiotic treatment with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.

Objective

To assess IDSA guideline concordance rates for women with uncomplicated UTIs treated with antibiotics, and compare concordance rates between different specialty field.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cross-sectional study of health care claims data from the US Military Health System Data Repository, which contains comprehensive health care encounter and claims data for all military beneficiaries. Participants were adult women between the ages of 18 to 50 years with uncomplicated UTIs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. Data extraction and analysis were performed in 2022. Patients with diagnosis of UTI in the preceding 6 months, current pregnancy, history of pyelonephritis, history of diabetes, history of organ transplant, history of human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, urinary tract abnormalities, or history of urologic procedures were excluded.

Exposures

Antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated UTIs. Only antibiotics received within 1 day after the diagnosis were analyzed. The IDSA recommends the following antibiotics as first-line therapy: nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The IDSA guideline concordance rates were calculated as the number of patients receiving first-line antibiotic therapy divided by the total number of cases for uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

A total of 46 793 adult women (67.3% [31 475 of 46 793] aged 18–34 years; 38.2% [31 475 of 46 793] of White race) were diagnosed with uncomplicated UTIs with 91.0% receiving guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment. In comparison with obstetrics and gynecology, IDSA guideline-concordant treatment was more likely in internal medicine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.87; 95% CI, 2.73–3.03), family medicine (aOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.76–1.87), surgery (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.36–1.67), and emergency medicine (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.32–1.39) and less likely in urology (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.38–0.43). Compared with direct military care, private sector care had lower concordance rates (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62–0.64).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of antibiotic treatments for uncomplicated UTIs in a universally insured population, the IDSA guideline-concordance rate was high at 91.0% with higher rates in direct military care compared with private sector care. There were higher rates in general medical specialties, surgery, and emergency medicine and lower rates in urology and obstetrics and gynecology. These results further enhance the literature on current antibiotic prescribing practices for uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^111FSSva]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This review has several strengths, including a comprehensive literature search that included multiple databases without language filters as well as a published protocol. It also has several limitations. We could not perform a meta-analysis given substantial heterogeneity in treatment across studies. Second, there was substantial variability in reported outcomes. Third, only five trials met inclusion criteria, limiting the ability to detect rare outcomes. Fourth, the follow-up period for all studies was 1 month or less, preventing the assessment of long-term impact of NSAID versus antibiotic therapy on patient outcomes, though a follow-up study to one trial demonstrated no impact on recurrent UTI or pyelonephritis from 28 days to 6 months post-randomization.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113bqtGg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I² = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I² = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I² = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I² = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection? – results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^112nRg7K]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The main limitation of our study is that due to its pilot character it was not sufficiently powered to give definite answers to all the questions of clinical interest. Furthermore, in the first three days the symptom course was not assessed. Though other authors assessed symptoms on Days 3 and 4 as well, the change of symptoms in the first days should be given more attention.

We cannot exclude that there is a bias at inclusion towards patients with less distinct symptoms. More information about non-participating but eligible patients could be helpful also to evaluate external validity. Although practice staff was demanded to ask even those patients who refused participation to complete the symptom questionnaire, this was often declined.

Concerns on patients' safety or fear of complications may incite GPs to advocate antibiotic treatment in UTI. Anyway, in this sample size, no serious complications were observed, and the incidence of minor adverse events was similar in both groups.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^113955L9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, even patients with "positive" urine cultures may have asymptomatic bacteriuria and thus not require treatment. Misdiagnosis of UTI is particularly common in elderly women who have other long-standing urinary tract symptoms, such as incontinence. – However, the maximum age cutoffs used in four out of five studies (50 to 70 years of age) likely avoided some challenges of diagnosing UTIs in the elderly — while also limiting generalizability to these groups. In summary, although there is a subset of individuals who clearly benefit from antibiotics, there is likely another segment that does not benefit from antibiotics and could be appropriately treated with NSAIDs or no therapy.

Another important finding from the included studies was that only 2.0–4.5% of individuals treated with NSAIDs subsequently developed pyelonephritis (based on 3 studies with 1130 patients). Thus, to avoid one case of pyelonephritis, 22 to 62 people would need to be treated with antibiotics. Notably, these reported rates of pyelonephritis in NSAID groups were higher than placebo arms of prior clinical trials (0.4%and 2.6%). While better follow-up to assess outcomes in the NSAID studies may be partially responsible, NSAIDs have also been associated with worse outcomes in other infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, possibly due to immune suppresion. These and other potential adverse effects of NSAIDs must be better understood before these drugs can be used for uncomplicated UTI.

In summary, this review demonstrates the superiority of antibiotics over NSAIDs for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. However, future research should focus on better diagnosing UTI and stratifying women with uncomplicated UTIs to identify the subset that would benefit from antibiotic treatment while avoiding unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Other potential antibiotic-sparing strategies should be further explored as well, including delayed antibiotic prescriptions for lingering symptoms only, point-of-care testing–driven prescribing algorithms, and provider audit reports and reminders. Given the high incidence of uncomplicated UTIs (and likely misdiagnosed UTIs) as well as the number of antibiotic prescriptions written for these infections, elimination of even a quarter of antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated UTIs would result in tens of thousands fewer antibiotic courses per year. Such a shift in practice patterns could have significant downstream ramifications, including reducing the number of adverse drug reactions, Clostridium difficile infections, and multi-drug resistant organisms.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Latin American consensus on uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection-2018 [^112UM7hm]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

An estimated 20–30% of adult women who experience an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) will have recurrent infection. In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade B recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose; probiotics (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient. Though considered effective and receiving grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.

### Urinary alkalisation for symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^113kmWf7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in women, characterised by dysuria and urinary frequency. Urinary alkalisers are widely used in some countries for the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated UTI, and they are recommended in some national formularies. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support their use for UTI and some healthcare guidelines advise against their use.

Objectives

We aimed to look at the benefits and harms of the use of urinary alkalisers for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 19 January 2016 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs on the use of (any) urinary alkalisers (either exclusively or non-exclusively) for the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated UTI amongst women aged 16 and over, were included. Studies were eligible if they included patients whose diagnosis of UTI was decided by symptoms alone, or positive urine dipstick test or urine culture; and patients with recurrent UTI, provided patients had no symptoms of UTI in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms that lead them to seek medical advice. Studies were ineligible if they studied patients with complicated UTIs; immune-compromising conditions; acute pyelonephritis; or chronic conditions such as interstitial cystitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed and screened papers, and this was repeated by two separate authors (independently). An additional investigator acted as arbitrator, where necessary. There were no papers which fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review, and therefore no data extraction was performed.

Main Results

Our search identified 172 potential studies for inclusion. However, following assessment none fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Until relevant evidence is generated from randomised trials, the safety and efficacy of urinary alkalisers for the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated UTI remains unknown.

### Symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in the ambulatory setting: randomised, double blind trial [^116tR9sn]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The primary outcome was evaluated using a risk difference with a corresponding two sided 95% confidence interval, a one sided normal approximation test for non-inferiority, and a two sided χ² test for superiority. We compared secondary outcomes using conventional two sided P values for superiority and corresponding two sided 95% confidence intervals. We used risk differences with χ² tests for binary data, Poisson regression with robust standard errors for counts, and linear regression with robust standard errors for continuous data. Kaplan-Meier curves accompanied by hazard ratios from Cox models were used to analyse time to definite symptom resolution and time to antibiotic use. Women were considered to have reached definite symptom resolution in the time-to-event analysis if they reached ≤ 2 points (slight, very slight, or no problems) on all five components of the symptom severity score and did not report a subsequent flare-up. All women were included in the analysis in the groups to which they were originally allocated (intention to treat analysis), with missing values accounted for by multiple imputation (see supplementary appendix and supplementary table 1).

We performed prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary outcome accompanied by Mantel-Haenszel tests for interaction by age (< 45 v ≥ 45 years), symptom severity at baseline (≤ 20 v > 20), symptom duration (≤ 3 v > 3 days), and presence of a positive urinary culture result at baseline; post hoc subgroup analyses were performed for urine leucocytes (≤ ++ v > ++) and the presence of norfloxacin resistant Enterbacteriaceae. In per protocol analyses, we excluded women with protocol deviations, defined as women with no documented intake of at least one dose of study drug, crossovers, and women who used rescue antibiotics before day 3. These analyses were prespecified in a statistical analysis plan before the end of recruitment and inspection of the data.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Pivmecillinam for uncomplicated acute cystitis: a contemporary review [^113B1ky2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence and discuss use of pivmecillinam in uncomplicated acute cystitis.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed (from 2000 through August 2024) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, such as mecillinam or pivmecillinam and urinary tract infections, were utilized. Additional references were identified by reviewing literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles were limited to English language publications evaluating the efficacy or safety of pivmecillinam for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult populations.

Data Synthesis

Data from 6 randomized controlled trials support pivmecillinam for acute uncomplicated cystitis at doses of 200 to 400 mg 3 times daily for 3 to 7 days, with more consistent clinical and bacteriologic cure observed with 400 mg doses and longer therapy durations. Clinical evaluation of 400 mg 2 to 3 times daily is available with use more common in non-US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved populations, such as men, pregnancy, and multidrug resistant infections. There are limited data supporting pivmecillinam for pyelonephritis; routine use is cautioned until further clinical data are available. Relevance to patient care and clinical practice in comparison with existing drugs:As resistance to first-line antimicrobials rises, the need for safe and effective treatment options remains high. Pivmecillinam represents a new therapeutic option available in the United States for outpatient management of uncomplicated acute cystitis.

Conclusion

Pivmecillinam could be a key agent for uncomplicated acute cystitis. Utilization will likely be cost driven, but the promise of low resistance encourages the place in therapy when other agents are not susceptible to infecting uropathogens.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114xto5v]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116FkURv]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.
