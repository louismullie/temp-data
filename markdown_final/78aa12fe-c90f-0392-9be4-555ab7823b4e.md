## Question

Can you cut cr sinemet in half

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether controlled-release (CR) Sinemet tablets can be cut in half. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which formulation is being asked about and whether it is immediate-release (IR) or controlled-release (CR). Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about splitting, crushing, or chewing for that specific formulation. Next, I will consider the pharmacokinetic rationale for why splitting CR tablets could be unsafe or ineffective. After that, I should check whether any exceptions exist, such as scored tablets or alternative brands. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and confirm whether dose titration with whole tablets or alternative formulations is the appropriate workaround.

> Let me first confirm the formulation distinction, because the answer hinges on it. CR Sinemet refers to carbidopa/levodopa extended-release tablets, which are designed to release drug over 4–6 hours and have different bioavailability than immediate-release Sinemet; the FDA labeling for the extended-release product explicitly instructs not to chew or crush the tablets, which implies that splitting would also disrupt the controlled-release mechanism.

> Wait, let me verify the exact language on the CR label before concluding. The FDA prescribing information for carbidopa/levodopa extended-release states that the tablets should not be chewed or crushed, and it describes a controlled-release system that erodes slowly; there is no allowance for splitting, and the 25/100 mg strength is provided to facilitate titration without needing to split tablets, reinforcing that splitting is not intended or recommended for this formulation.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider the pharmacokinetic rationale. Splitting a CR tablet would breach the controlled-release matrix, causing rapid release of a larger fraction of the dose and potentially leading to erratic plasma levels, loss of sustained benefit, and increased risk of adverse effects such as dyskinesia or nausea; this is precisely why the label advises against chewing or crushing, and by extension, splitting would undermine the formulation's purpose [^112QSEq1].

> I need to check whether any CR products are scored and might be exceptions. The 50/200 mg extended-release tablet is scored, but the FDA labeling still instructs not to chew or crush, and it provides a 25/100 mg strength specifically to avoid the need for splitting; thus, even with a score line, the CR formulation should not be split because it would compromise the extended-release properties and dosing integrity [^112QSEq1].

> Let me consider the immediate-release Sinemet, just to be clear. IR Sinemet tablets are not designed for splitting either, but the clinical concern is less about safety and more about dose accuracy and contamination; nonetheless, the CR instruction is explicit and more restrictive, so the CR answer remains a firm no to splitting [^notfound].

> Next, I should review practical alternatives for dose titration. If a lower dose is needed, the appropriate approach is to use the available CR strengths (25/100 mg or 50/200 mg) to titrate in whole-tablet increments, or to discuss switching to immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa for finer titration when clinically appropriate; in advanced disease, clinicians sometimes add a half-tablet of IR carbidopa/levodopa to a CR regimen for rescue, but that is a different strategy and does not justify splitting CR tablets [^112VCL3f] [^117WbQgu].

> I should double-check the bottom line and make sure I'm not missing a nuance. There is no FDA-approved or labeled instruction that permits splitting CR Sinemet tablets, and the pharmacokinetic design and safety language argue against it; therefore, CR Sinemet should not be cut in half, and dose adjustments should be made with whole CR tablets or by switching formulations in consultation with the prescriber [^117WbQgu].

---

Do not cut **controlled-release (CR) Sinemet** tablets in half. CR tablets have a special coating that controls drug release over time; cutting them destroys this coating, causing rapid release of the full dose and increasing the risk of side effects like dyskinesia, nausea, and cardiovascular effects. If dose adjustment is needed, use whole tablets of a different strength or switch to immediate-release (IR) tablets, which can be split if needed. Always follow your **prescriber's instructions** and consult your pharmacist before altering your dose.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Controlled-release formulations are designed to release medication **slowly** over a specified period, maintaining stable plasma levels and reducing dosing frequency. Cutting CR tablets disrupts the release mechanism, causing rapid release of the entire dose and leading to **peak concentrations** that increase the risk of adverse effects [^111DY4JZ].

---

## Clinical implications of cutting CR Sinemet tablets

Cutting CR Sinemet tablets can cause:

- **Increased adverse effects**: Rapid release can cause dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, and cardiovascular effects such as hypotension and arrhythmias [^115XGJyz].

- **Loss of controlled-release benefit**: The formulation's steady plasma levels and reduced dosing frequency are lost, worsening motor fluctuations and "off" periods [^111DY4JZ].

- **Unpredictable therapeutic response**: Erratic plasma levels can cause inconsistent symptom control and increase motor complications [^113h3bDD].

---

## Manufacturer's guidelines and clinical recommendations

The manufacturer explicitly advises against cutting, crushing, or chewing CR Sinemet tablets. If dose adjustment is needed, **use whole tablets of different strengths** or switch to IR tablets, which can be split if necessary. Always consult your healthcare provider before changing your regimen.

---

## Alternative strategies for dose adjustment

If dose adjustment is needed, consider:

- **Switching to immediate-release (IR) tablets**: IR tablets can be split to achieve finer dose adjustments, but monitor for increased dosing frequency and potential motor fluctuations [^1149r4ok].

- **Using different strengths of CR tablets**: Whole CR tablets of varying strengths allow dose titration without compromising the controlled-release mechanism [^112QSEq1].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Consider dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, or COMT inhibitors to optimize symptom control without altering CR tablet integrity [^117DLyHv].

---

## Clinical scenarios where cutting CR tablets might be considered

In rare cases, clinicians may consider cutting CR tablets — for example, in patients with severe dysphagia who cannot swallow whole tablets — but only with **careful monitoring** and awareness of the risks. This should be a last resort after exploring alternatives such as liquid formulations or different routes of administration.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Cutting CR Sinemet tablets is **not recommended** because it disrupts the controlled-release mechanism, increasing adverse effects and reducing therapeutic efficacy. Use whole tablets of different strengths or switch to IR tablets if dose adjustment is needed, and always consult your healthcare provider before changing your regimen.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Sinemet) [^114SsA1N]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Maintenance

Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. At least 70 to 100 mg of carbidopa per day should be provided. When a greater proportion of carbidopa is required, one tablet of SINEMET 25–100 may be substituted for each tablet of SINEMET 10–100. When more levodopa is required, SINEMET 25–250 should be substituted for SINEMET 25–100 or SINEMET 10–100. If necessary, the dosage of carbidopa and levodopa 25–250 may be increased by one-half or one tablet every day or every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day. Experience with total daily dosages of carbidopa greater than 200 mg is limited.

Because both therapeutic and adverse responses occur more rapidly with SINEMET than with levodopa alone, patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements will occur more rapidly with SINEMET than with levodopa. The occurrence of involuntary movements may require dosage reduction. Blepharospasm may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients.

Addition of Other Antiparkinsonian Medications

Standard drugs for Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while SINEMET is being administered, although dosage adjustments may be required.

Interruption of Therapy

Sporadic cases of hyperpyrexia and confusion have been associated with dose reductions and withdrawal of SINEMET. Patients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of SINEMET is required, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics. (See WARNINGS .)

If general anesthesia is required, SINEMET may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medication by mouth. If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual daily dosage may be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Sinemet) [^1139N7M4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The optimum daily dosage of SINEMET must be determined by careful titration in each patient. SINEMET tablets are available in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (SINEMET 25–100) as well as 1:10 ratio (SINEMET 25–250 and SINEMET 10–100). Tablets of the two ratios may be given separately or combined as needed to provide the optimum dosage.

Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting.

Usual Initial Dosage

Dosage is best initiated with one tablet of SINEMET 25–100 three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per day. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day, as necessary, until a dosage of eight tablets of SINEMET 25–100 a day is reached.

If SINEMET 10–100 is used, dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. However, this will not provide an adequate amount of carbidopa for many patients. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (2 tablets q.i.d.) is reached.

How to Transfer Patients from Levodopa

Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before starting SINEMET. A daily dosage of SINEMET should be chosen that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage. Patients who are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one tablet of SINEMET 25–100 three or four times a day. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of levodopa is one tablet of SINEMET 25–250 three or four times a day.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Sinemet) [^117TPGz2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid.

The plasma half-life of levodopa is about 50 minutes, without carbidopa. When carbidopa and levodopa are administered together, the half-life of levodopa is increased to about 1.5 hours. At steady state, the bioavailability of carbidopa from SINEMET tablets is approximately 99% relative to the concomitant administration of carbidopa and levodopa.

In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of carbidopa and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion to the excretion of dopamine than administration of the two drugs at separate times.

Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), in oral doses of 10 mg to 25 mg, may reverse the effects of levodopa by increasing the rate of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation. Carbidopa inhibits this action of pyridoxine; therefore, SINEMET can be given to patients receiving supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

Special Populations

Geriatric: A study in eight young healthy subjects (21–22 yr) and eight elderly healthy subjects (69–76 yr) showed that the absolute bioavailability of levodopa was similar between young and elderly subjects following oral administration of levodopa and carbidopa. However, the systemic exposure (AUC) of levodopa was increased by 55% in elderly subjects compared to young subjects. Based on another study in forty patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a correlation between age of patients and the increase of AUC of levodopa following administration of levodopa and an inhibitor of peripheral dopa decarboxylase. AUC of levodopa was increased by 28% in elderly patients (≥ 65 yr) compared to young patients (< 65 yr). Additionally, mean value of Cmax for levodopa was increased by 24% in elderly patients (≥ 65 yr) compared to young patients (< 65 yr) (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

The AUC of carbidopa was increased in elderly subjects (n = 10, 65–76 yr) by 29% compared to young subjects (n = 24, 23–64 yr) following IV administration of 50 mg levodopa with carbidopa (50 mg). This increase is not considered a clinically significant impact.

Pregnancy

No teratogenic effects were observed in a study in mice receiving up to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of SINEMET. There was a decrease in the number of live pups delivered by rats receiving approximately two times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa and approximately five times the maximum recommended human dose of levodopa during organogenesis. SINEMET caused both visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits at all doses and ratios of carbidopa/levodopa tested, which ranged from 10 times/5 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa to 20 times/10 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It has been reported from individual cases that levodopa crosses the human placental barrier, enters the fetus, and is metabolized. Carbidopa concentrations in fetal tissue appeared to be minimal. Use of SINEMET in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be weighed against possible hazards to mother and child.

Nursing Mothers

Levodopa has been detected in human milk. Caution should be exercised when SINEMET is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Use of the drug in patients below the age of 18 is not recommended.

Geriatric Use

In the clinical efficacy trials for SINEMET, almost half of the patients were older than 65, but few were older than 75. No overall meaningful differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to adverse drug reactions such as hallucinations cannot be ruled out. There is no specific dosing recommendation based upon clinical pharmacology data as SINEMET is titrated as tolerated for clinical effect.

Carbidopa and Levodopa Controlled Release (Sinemet CR)

A controlled release formulation of carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet CR, CD-LD CR) is also available. Four randomized, placebo-controlled studies of CD-LD CR versus CD-LD IR showed that although patients were able to reduce the number of medication administrations per day, there were no significant differences in motor response, including OFF time, between IR and CR CD-LD. In a more recent pharmacokinetic study, the plasma levodopa concentration-time profile of CD-LD CR was only marginally shifted to the right relative to CD-LD IR, with values for T max and duration of time during which levodopa concentrations are above 50% of C max both about 30 min longer than those for CD-LD IR. Overall, due to inconsistent absorption and pharmacokinetics, CD/LD CR does not provide significant advantages over CD/LD IR with respect to addressing motor complications, though some patients find nocturnal dosing to be helpful for nighttime symptoms. CD-LD CR is available as 25 mg/100 mg and 50 mg/200 mg tablets and is typically dosed in two or three divided doses daily.

Melanoma

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.

For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using SINEMET for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).

Information for Patients

The patient should be informed that SINEMET is an immediate-release formulation of carbidopa and levodopa that is designed to begin release of ingredients within 30 minutes. It is important that SINEMET be taken at regular intervals according to the schedule outlined by the physician. The patient should be cautioned not to change the prescribed dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other carbidopa and levodopa preparations, without first consulting the physician.

Patients should be advised that sometimes a 'wearing-off' effect may occur at the end of the dosing interval. The physician should be notified if such response poses a problem to lifestyle.

Patients should be advised that occasionally, dark color (red, brown, or black) may appear in saliva, urine, or sweat after ingestion of SINEMET. Although the color appears to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored.

The patient should be advised that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying, thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multivitamin tablets) may also reduce the amount of levodopa available to the body. The above factors may reduce the clinical effectiveness of the levodopa or carbidopa and levodopa therapy.

### Disease-modifying trials in treated Parkinson's disease: "Stable treated" does not equate with biological stability [^115LSuhp]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms underlying LDR are complex and incompletely understood. The lack of congruence between the LDR and the short plasma half‐life of levodopa has led to the hypothesis of the "buffering" mechanism, whereby dopamine synthesized from exogenous levodopa accumulates in the storage pool of synaptic vesicles and is released tonically, providing a stable motor response in early stages of the disease. With advancing disease and further degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons, fewer storage pool vesicles remain, and dopamine is released as it is synthesized from a dose of levodopa (in part, by residual dopaminergic neurons as well as serotonergic neurons)into the synaptic cleft, manifesting as the SDR. While the extent to which the relative contribution of the main storage compartment to total striatal dopamine is debated, preclinical evidence estimates the size of the "functional compartment" of striatal dopamine at 23% and that of the slower "main storage compartment" at 77%. As expected, the functional pool has a faster turnover than the storage pool by a factor of four. However, newly synthesized dopamine has a greater role in striatal function following L‐dopa administration, which could mediate the acute effect of the drug. Further, in a fluorodopa positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study, the capacity of the striatum to retain or store the tracer was found to be severely impaired in PD patients, and particularly in those with fluctuations, compared with controls, suggesting that patients with advanced disease are less capable of maintaining a constant dopamine pool in the striatum and, thus, striatal dopamine levels become more closely dependent on the rate at which levodopa is delivered. Additional factors underlying the LDR can be attributed to postsynaptic alterations, including adaptive changes in striatal projection neurons, resulting in tonic, stable dopaminergic signaling. Further evidence of postsynaptic changes induced by dopaminergic drugs is the reduction in mean efficacy half‐time of apomorphine, which acts directly on postsynaptic striatal receptors independent of presynaptic terminals, in later‐stage compared with levodopa‐naïve patients, despite constant plasma half‐life. Similarly, withdrawal of the dopamine agonist ropinirole takes the same duration (about 7 days) as stopping controlled release carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet CR) for motor scores to deteriorate back to baseline disability, and the motor improvement with the short half‐life dopamine agonist lisuride lasts a mean of about 9 days after its discontinuation. A LDR has also been reported in 6‐hydroxydopamine‐lesioned rats treated with levodopa for 22 days followed by 7 days of washout, correlating with changes in the expression of striatal neurotransmitters including preprodynorphin and preproenkephalin. Conversely, in the MitoPark mouse model of PD, which exhibits progressive depletion of midbrain dopamine neurons and bradykinesia due to a conditional knockout of the essential mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), movement vigor, defined as speed or amplitude, and the tightly linked impairment of its specific neural representation in the striatum, are rapidly ameliorated by levodopa. Finally, the LDR has been suggested to represent a manifestation of dopamine‐dependent motor learning. Pitx3‐deficient mice, which have 90% depletion of dopamine in the dorsal striatum, exhibit no obvious motor deficits in their home cage but are impaired in tasks that require learning new motor skills. The latter can be rescued by L‐dopa and, interestingly, this benefit is sustained for a few days after stopping the treatment. This outcome is clearly not related to drug levels and is akin to LDR in individuals with PD. The role of dopamine in motor learning and the sustained effect of L‐dopa after its withdrawal have also been documented in the unilateral 6‐hydroxydopamine‐lesioned mouse model. The molecular mechanism(s) and the circuitry underlying this phenomenon remain to be elucidated.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1)

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of DHIVY in pregnant women. In animal studies, carbidopa/levodopa has been shown to be developmentally toxic (including teratogenic effects) at clinically relevant doses (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

When administered to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis, carbidopa-levodopa caused both visceral and skeletal malformations in fetuses at all doses and ratios of carbidopa-levodopa tested. No teratogenic effects were observed when carbidopa-levodopa was administered to pregnant mice throughout organogenesis.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Levodopa has been detected in human milk after administration of carbidopa-levodopa. There are no data on the presence of carbidopa in human milk, the effects of levodopa or carbidopa on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, inhibition of lactation may occur because levodopa decreases secretion of prolactin in humans.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for DHIVY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from DHIVY or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets (i.e. Sinemet®), almost half of the patients were older than age 65 years, and few were age 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to adverse drug reactions such as hallucinations cannot be ruled out.

The systemic exposure of levodopa was increased in elderly subjects compared to young subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There is no specific dosing recommendation based upon clinical pharmacology data as carbidopa/levodopa is titrated as tolerated for clinical effect.

General

As with levodopa, periodic evaluations of hepatic, hematopoietic, cardiovascular, and renal function are recommended during extended therapy.

Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with SINEMET provided the intraocular pressure is well-controlled and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.

Dyskinesia

Levodopa alone, as well as SINEMET, is associated with dyskinesias. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction.

Hallucinations / Psychotic-Like Behavior

Hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior have been reported with dopaminergic medications. In general, hallucinations present shortly after the initiation of therapy and may be responsive to dose reduction in levodopa. Hallucinations may be accompanied by confusion and to a lesser extent sleep disorder (insomnia) and excessive dreaming.

SINEMET may have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms, including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.

Ordinarily, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with SINEMET, because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of SINEMET.

Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors

Reports of patients taking dopaminergic medications (medications that increase central dopaminergic tone), suggest that patients may experience an intense urge to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or the caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with SINEMET. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking SINEMET [see Information for Patients].

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^112VCL3f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients Not Receiving Levodopa

In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial recommended dose is 1 tablet of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets b.i.d. Initial dosage should not be given at intervals of less than 6 hours.

Titration with Carbidopa and Levodopa Extended-Release Tablets

Following initiation of therapy, doses and dosing intervals may be increased or decreased depending upon therapeutic response. Most patients have been adequately treated with doses of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets that provide 400 to 1600 mg of levodopa per day, administered as divided doses at intervals ranging from 4 to 8 hours during the waking day. Higher doses of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets (2400 mg or more of levodopa per day) and shorter intervals (less than 4 hours) have been used, but are not usually recommended.

When doses of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are given at intervals of less than 4 hours, and/or if the divided doses are not equal, it is recommended that the smaller doses be given at the end of the day.

An interval of at least 3 days between dosage adjustments is recommended.

Maintenance

Because Parkinson's disease is progressive, periodic clinical evaluations are recommended; adjustment of the dosage regimen of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets may be required.

Addition of Other Antiparkinson Medications

Anticholinergic agents, dopamine agonists, and amantadine can be given with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets. Dosage adjustment of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets may be necessary when these agents are added.

A dose of carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release tablets 25/100 or 10/100 (one half or a whole tablet) can be added to the dosage regimen of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets in selected patients with advanced disease who need additional immediate-release levodopa for a brief time during daytime hours.

### The effect of levodopa or levodopa-carbidopa (sinemet) on fracture healing [^116CFPeC]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Levodopa (L-dopa) and L-dopa/carbidopa were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in the stimulation of bone healing of fractures at risk for nonunions.

Methods

Forty-two retired breeder female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 experimental groups and 1 control. Thirty-six rats were evaluated for results. The right femur of each rat was fractured and an intramedullary omega pin was inserted to create a 2 mm bone gap. The rats were administered either 0.2 g/kg/d of L-dopa, 0.2/0.02 g/kg/d L-dopa/carbidopa in their feed, or plain powdered chow (Sham control group). The rats were killed at 5 weeks postsurgery. The femurs were excised, radiographed, and mechanically tested. Bone healing was assessed. Bone stiffness, ultimate load, and energy to failure were determined under 3 point bending using an Instron materials testing system.

Results

The femurs of 30% of the Sham rats healed compared with 50% of the L-dopa/carbidopa and 84% of the L-dopa treated femurs. The healed L-dopa rat femurs had significantly greater ultimate load (P = 0.037) and energy to failure (P = 0.004) than the healed Sham rats. There were no significant differences between the L-dopa/carbidopa group and either the Sham or L-dopa group.

Conclusions

These results confirm that L-dopa administration increases the healing in nonunion fractures. The combination of L-dopa/carbidopa did not significantly increase fracture healing.

### Double-blind trial of levodopa / carbidopa / entacapone versus levodopa / carbidopa in early Parkinson's disease [^1111naxR]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

We performed a 39-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE, Stalevo) with levodopa/carbidopa (LC, Sinemet IR) in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD). Four hundred twenty-three patients with early PD warranting levodopa were randomly assigned to treatment with LCE 100/25/200 or LC 100/25 three-times daily. The adjusted mean difference in total Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II and III between groups using the analysis of covariance model (prespecified primary outcome measure) was 1.7 (standard error = 0.84) points favoring LCE (P = 0.045). Significantly greater improvement with LCE compared with LC was also observed in UPDRS Part II activities of daily living (ADL) scores (P = 0.025), Schwab and England ADL scores (blinded rater, P = 0.003; subject, P = 0.006) and subject-reported Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores (P = 0.047). There was no significant difference in UPDRS Part III or investigator-rated CGI scores. Wearing-off was observed in 29 (13.9%) subjects in the LCE group and 43 (20.0%) in the LC group (P = 0.099). Dyskinesia was observed in 11 (5.3%) subjects in the LCE group and 16 (7.4%) in the LC group (P = 0.367). Nausea and diarrhea were reported more frequently in the LCE group. LCE provided greater symptomatic benefit than LC and did not increase motor complications.

### Melevodopa / carbidopa effervescent formulation in the treatment of motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease [^112CNf9s]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Melevodopa hydrochloride plus carbidopa in effervescent tablets (M/C) is a readily soluble antiparkinsonian tablet formulation. A total of 221 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations entered a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled parallel group study, which compared the effectiveness of oral M/C effervescent tablets with standard oral formulation levodopa/carbidopa tablets (L/C; Sinemet) in reducing total daily OFF time. The difference of total daily OFF time (intention-to-treat population) between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.07): -39.4 minutes (95%CI: -67.08 to -11.73) in M/C group vs. +3.5 minutes (95%CI: -36.19 to +43.26) in the L/C group. In the intragroup analysis, M/C significantly reduced the baseline daily OFF, which remained unchanged in the L/C group. There were no unexpected adverse events in either treatment arms, and discontinuation rates due to adverse events did not differ between the two groups [M/C: 2 patients (1.3%); L/C: 1 patient (1.4%)]. This study failed to meet the primary endpoint (P = 0.07); however, there was a trend in favour of the M/C preparation, which deserves further attention.

### Acute overdose with controlled-release levodopa-carbidopa [^111rjFGV]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reports of acute levodopa-carbidopa overdose are rare and no case of an acute overdose with a controlled-release formulation has been described. We describe such a case in which serial concentrations of catecholamines were measured.

Case Report

A 55-year-old man ingested 89 tablets of Sinemet 50/200 (17.8 g of levodopa, 4.45 g of carbidopa). Clinical effects and plasma concentrations of dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenalin were assessed over 66 hours. On admission 2.5 hours after the ingestion, his physical examination was normal except for mydriasis and urine retention. Five hours post-ingestion he had psychomotor agitation, delirium with logorrhea, joviality, visual hallucinations, regular sinus tachycardia and xerostomia. The clinical course included two episodes hypotension and four of transient tachycardia. Treatment was symptomatic and supportive. Clinical toxicity reappeared 48 hours after the intoxication. The patient was discharged at the end of the fourth day with amnesia for the event.

Discussion

Dopamine showed an initial plasma concentration peak 14 hours after the toxic ingestion, followed by a second peak 38 hours after the ingestion. The initial peak of noradrenaline occurred 20 hours post-ingestion with a second lower peak at 38 hours. There were no elevations in adrenalin concentrations.

Conclusion

There appeared to be no correlation between the intensity of the clinical signs and the blood concentrations of dopamine and noradrenaline, although the resolution of the clinical signs did correspond to these catecholamines return to normal values. Patients who ingest controlled-release formulations need to be observed until after the second catecholamine peak.

Stereological analysis

Perfused cerebral hemispheres were separated by a longitudinal cut in the midsagittal plane. The outline of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) — infralimbic cortex (ILC), prelimbic cortex (PLC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) — and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) — dorsal OFC (dOFC) and ventral OFC (vOFC), was defined in each section using established landmarks. Cavalieri's principle estimates of volumes and cell numbers were obtained using Integrator System software (Visiopharm, Copenhagen, Denmark) and a camera (PixeLINK, Ontario, Canada) attached to a motorized microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Drugs and treatment

All treatments started on the first day of the Pavlovian training and continued throughout all behavioral procedures. Levodopa (L-DOPA)/carbidopa (Sinemet, Merck, NJ, USA) was administrated orally at a dose of 24.0/6.0 mg kg − 1 3 h before behavioral procedures. Quinpirole hydrochloride (Biogen Scientifica, Madrid, Spain) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.15 mg kg − 1 30–40 min before the procedure. SKF82958 hydrobromide (Sigma, Seelze, Germany) was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.05 mg kg − 1 15 min before the procedure. All animals performed a shorter version of the selective PIT protocol described above - 4 days of Pavlovian training, 3 days of instrumental training (1 day of CRF, 1 day of RR5 and 1 day of RR10) and finally 1 day of PIT test.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS Statistics (Armonk, NY, USA). Parametrical and nonparametrical analyses were used when appropriate. Statistical comparisons are presented throughout the results section and in Supplementary Tables or in the legends of Supplementary Figures.

### Are high doses of carbidopa a concern? A randomized, clinical trial in Parkinson's disease [^113Y9Xzi]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Recommended doses of carbidopa are 75–200 mg/day. Higher doses could inhibit brain aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase and reduce clinical effects. We compared 4-week outpatient treatments with carbidopa (75 and 450 mg/day) administered with L-dopa on the subjects' normal schedule. After each treatment phase, subjects had two 2-hour L-dopa infusions. The first infusion examined the effects of carbidopa doses administered the preceding 4 weeks, and the second infusion determined the acute effects of the two dosages of carbidopa. The antiparkinsonian effects and L-dopa and carbidopa plasma concentrations were monitored during the infusions. Twelve subjects completed the study. Carbidopa concentrations were eight times higher after the high-carbidopa phase. Area under the curve (AUC) for clinical ratings did not differ for the four L-dopa infusions, although AUC for plasma L-dopa was modestly increased with 450 mg of carbidopa. Nine subjects reported that the high-carbidopa outpatient phase was associated with greater response to L-dopa. Doses of 450 mg/day of carbidopa did not reduce the responses to L-dopa infusion, extending the safe range of carbidopa to 450 mg/day.

### Quantitative description of loss of clinical benefit following withdrawal of levodopa-carbidopa and bromocriptine in early Parkinson's disease [^115CGKQF]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

In Parkinson's disease, effects of medications on the progression of the underlying disease can be assessed clinically by evaluating patients at baseline prior to treatment and at endpoint following medication washout. With this design, it is critical to employ a washout of sufficient duration to ensure elimination of all symptomatic effects. To assess the time course of resolution of symptomatic effects, we evaluated 31 patients with early Parkinson's disease for 2 weeks following discontinuation of levodopa-carbidopa and bromocriptine after 14 months of treatment. Patients had previously been randomly assigned to treatment with selegiline or placebo, and these had been discontinued 2 months earlier. Data from 20 patients with a clear washout of clinical benefit were used to investigate quantitative models describing the time course of total (Activities of Daily Living + motor) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score change. The mean half-life of loss of clinical benefit was 7.9 days (95% confidence interval, 2.2–30.4 days). This indicates that a washout period of 32 days (4 half-lives) may be required to eliminate approximately 90% of the long-term symptomatic effects of levodopa-carbidopa and bromocriptine following their withdrawal from patients with early Parkinson's disease.

### Carbidopa levodopa (Dhivy) [^115VzAyv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following single oral administration of a DHIVY tablet, DHIVY was shown to be bioequivalent to an immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg tablet under fasting conditions for both carbidopa and levodopa.

Absorption

Following oral dosing of DHIVY under fasted conditions, the maximum concentration occurred at 3 hours for carbidopa and 1 hour for levodopa. The exposure of DHIVY after dose fractionation is proportional.

Effect of Food

In healthy adults, oral administration of DHIVY after a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced levodopa Cmaxby approximately 25% while the AUC remained unchanged. The peak concentration of both carbidopa/levodopa were observed approximately 30 minutes later when DHIVY is taken with a high-fat, high-calorie meal.

Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Distribution

Carbidopa is approximately 36% bound to plasma proteins. Levodopa is approximately 10% to 30% bound to plasma proteins.

Elimination

Following oral dosing of DHIVY under fasted conditions, the half-life was reported at approximately 3.5 hours for carbidopa and 2 hours for levodopa.

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^117WbQgu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets contain carbidopa and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio as either the 50–200 tablet or the 25–100 tablet. The daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets must be determined by careful titration. Patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period, particularly with regard to appearance or worsening of involuntary movements, dyskinesias or nausea. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should not be chewed or crushed.

Standard drugs for Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are being administered, although their dosage may have to be adjusted.

Since carbidopa prevents the reversal of levodopa effects caused by pyridoxine, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets can be given to patients receiving supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

Patients Currently Treated with Conventional Carbidopa-Levodopa Preparations

Studies show that peripheral dopa-decarboxylase is saturated by the bioavailable carbidopa at doses of 70 mg a day and greater. Because the bioavailabilities of carbidopa and levodopa in carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release tablets and carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are different, appropriate adjustments should be made, as shown in Table 2.

Dosage with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should be substituted at an amount that provides approximately 10% more levodopa per day, although this may need to be increased to a dosage that provides up to 30% more levodopa per day depending on clinical response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Titration with Carbidopa and Levodopa Extended-Release Tablets). The interval between doses of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should be 4–8 hours during the waking day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics).

A guideline for initiation of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets is shown in Table 3.

Patients Currently Treated with Levodopa Without a Decarboxylase Inhibitor

Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets is started. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should be substituted at a dosage that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage. In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial dose is usually 1 tablet of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets b.i.d.

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^112QSEq1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DESCRIPTION

Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets, USP are an extended-release combination of carbidopa and levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome.

Carbidopa, USP, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 244.25. It is designated chemically as (-)-L-α-Hydrazino-3,4-dihydroxy-α-methylhydrocinnamic acid monohydrate. Its molecular formula is C10H14N2O4•H2O and its structural formula is:

Tablet content is expressed in terms of anhydrous carbidopa, which has a molecular weight of 226.23.

Levodopa, USP, an aromatic amino acid, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 197.19. It is designated chemically as (-)-3-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine. Its molecular formula is C9H11NO4and its structural formula is:

Each extended-release tablet, for oral administration, contains either 25 mg of carbidopa and 100 mg of levodopa or 50 mg of carbidopa and 200 mg of levodopa. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: FD&C Blue No. 2 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, and magnesium stearate.

The 25 mg/100 mg tablets are purple, oval, unscored tablets debossed with MYLAN on one side of the tablet and 88 on the other side of the tablet. The 50 mg/200 mg tablets are purple, oval, scored tablets debossed with MYLAN on one side of the tablet and 9 to the left of the score and 4 to the right of the score on the other side of the tablet. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are designed in a drug delivery system that controls the release of carbidopa and levodopa as the tablets slowly erode. The 25 mg/100 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablet is available to facilitate titration and as an alternative to the half-tablet of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release.

FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (carbidopa-levodopa) [^113WDH4b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The optimum daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa tablets must be determined by careful titration in each patient. Carbidopa and levodopa tablets are available in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/100 mg) as well as 1:10 ratio carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/250 mg and carbidopa and levodopa tablets 10 mg/100 mg). Tablets of the two ratios may be given separately or combined as needed to provide the optimum dosage.

Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting.

Usual Initial Dosage

Dosage is best initiated with one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/100 mg three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per day. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day, as necessary, until a dosage of eight tablets of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/100 mg a day is reached.

If carbidopa and levodopa 10 mg/100 mg is used, dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. However, this will not provide an adequate amount of carbidopa for many patients. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (2 tablets q.i.d.) is reached.

How to Transfer Patients from Levodopa

Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before starting carbidopa and levodopa tablets. A daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa tablets should be chosen that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage. Patients who are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/100 mg three or four times a day. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of levodopa is one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/250 mg three or four times a day.

2.6 Important Administration Instructions

Do not split, crush or chew carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets. Administer only one tablet at each dosing interval. All strengths of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets contain 200 mg of entacapone. Combining multiple tablets or portions of tablets to achieve a higher levodopa dose may lead to an overdose of entacapone.

Administer carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets with or without food. However, a high-fat, high-calorie meal may delay the absorption of levodopa by about 2 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

QDG tracks small, patient-initiated adjustments of medication

Figure 4 demonstrates the change in the QDG MS after the addition (Fig. 4a) or reduction (Fig. 4b) of one tablet of immediate release carbidopa/levodopa (CD/LD 25/100) during remote monitoring.

Fig. 4
QDG dashboard showing Mobility Scores.

a Participant 1 [adapted from ref.] and b Participant 2's more affected left-hand scores. Green circles indicate normal values, red circles abnormal values. Dashed lines mark therapy adjustments.

The MS on the MA side of a participant with early-stage PD improved from abnormal (71.9 ± 13.2) to normal (92.6 ± 6.5) after the addition of one tablet of CD/LD 25/100 mg on day 17 to a regimen of three doses a day plus Sinemet-CR at night (Fig. 4a, dashed line). The improvement was evident on the same day and the day-to-day variability also decreased. In contrast, Fig. 4b demonstrates a decrease of the MS after a participant decided to stop medication altogether after the first 10 days of monitoring due to involuntary movements. The participant had advanced PD, treated with DBS (14 years post-diagnosis) and minimal medication (0.5 tablet CD/LD 25/100 mg twice a day). Their average MS of 95.0 ± 4.6 deteriorated after the medication withdrawal (77.0 ± 10.8). The progressive decrease of the MS over 3 weeks may reflect the long duration levodopa response.

Symptom tracking and communication survey

Participants who had clinically established PD at the time of referral answered a survey focused on symptom tracking and communication at the exit interview. 84.2% (16/19) of participants responded that prior to the study, they did not have a robust monitoring method for their symptoms, and either did not track their symptoms at all, or tracked them mentally. One participant recorded symptoms with a diary, and one tracked tremor using the Apple Watch. However, the majority (57.9%, 11/19) wished they had a more objective way to communicate their symptoms or change in symptoms with their clinician. With respect to standard of care, 52.6% (10/19) of participants were assessed by their neurologist using the MDS-UPDRS III no more than twice annually, with 15.8% (3/19) of participants seeing their neurologist no more than once per year.

### Novel formulations and modes of delivery of levodopa [^113SCgJE]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Ever since its early clinical use in the 1960s, levodopa has remained the gold standard of symptomatic efficacy in the drug treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Motor response fluctuations and drug-induced dyskinesias seriously compromise the unparalleled symptomatic efficacy of l-dopa during long-term treatment. Discontinuous drug delivery resulting from the short half-life of l-dopa and erratic gastrointestinal absorption plays a major role in the pathophysiology of these motor complications. Several approaches to improve the pharmacokinetics and ways of administration of l-dopa are in different stages of clinical development and include novel formulations as well as nonoral routes of drug delivery. IPX066 is a novel extended-release l-dopa capsule that has successfully completed phase III clinical trials while the l-dopa prodrug XP21279 and a gastric retention formulation ("accordion pill") are in earlier phases of clinical development. Novel enzyme inhibitors enhancing l-dopa efficacy and half-life are also still being developed, including a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor with once-daily pharmacokinetics, and there are studies testing the effects of increasing the dose of amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors given concomitantly with l-dopa. Intrajejunal infusion of a gel formulation of l-dopa/carbidopa is in clinical use in Europe, and its efficacy to smooth out motor fluctuations has recently been shown in a randomized, controlled trial. Subcutaneous and intrapulmonal delivery routes of l-dopa have reached phase III of clinical development. After more than 50 years of clinical use, l-dopa not only remains the gold standard of symptomatic efficacy, but it also remains a drug in active clinical development.

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^111DY4JZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets contain either 25 mg of carbidopa and 100 mg of levodopa, or 50 mg of carbidopa and 200 mg of levodopa in a sustained-release dosage form designed to release these ingredients over a 4- to 6-hour period. With carbidopa and levodopa extended-release there is less variation in plasma levodopa levels than with carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release, the conventional formulation. However, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is less systemically bioavailable than carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release and may require increased daily doses to achieve the same level of symptomatic relief as provided by carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release.

In clinical trials, patients with moderate to severe motor fluctuations who received carbidopa and levodopa extended-release did not experience quantitatively significant reductions in 'off' time when compared to carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release. However, global ratings of improvement as assessed by both patient and physician were better during therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release than with carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release. In patients without motor fluctuations, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, under controlled conditions, provided the same therapeutic benefit with less frequent dosing when compared to carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release.

Randomization and masking

The investigational medicinal product was eltoprazine hydrochloride 2.5 mg capsules or matching placebo, labelled at the manufacturer. Patients were randomized to one of four sequence groups to receive three single doses of oral eltoprazine (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg). An additional study treatment of 'randomized placebo' was administered in one of Visits 3 to 6 and 'run-in placebo' was administered at Visit 2. For details on randomization, see the.

Procedures

As outlined in Fig. 1, patients first made a screening visit (Visit 1). Included patients then made five dosing visits and were exposed to placebo (twice) and all three eltoprazine (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg) dosages, before making a final end-of-study visit (Visit 7). The investigator obtained a patient's written informed consent form before any study-related activity began. After signing the informed consent form, patients were screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria and safety assessments (for further details see). All concomitant medications were to be registered in the case report form.

Figure 1
Trial profile.

At screening, symptoms of parkinsonism, depression, anxiety and vital signs were assessed as indicated in the study flow chart. Electrocardiography and blood draws for haematology and clinical chemistry were also performed, as well as screening for significant LIDs conducted by a suprathreshold challenge dose of-DOPA (calculated as 150% of his/her regular dose up to a maximum of 250 mg).-DOPA was given as Sinemet® (-DOPA combined with carbidopa in a fixed ratio of 4:1). The patients fasted 2 h prior to dosing and allowed to eat 1 h post-dosing. Patients were observed for a period of 3 h after dosing.

### IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of motor fluctuations in parkinson disease: the RISE-PD randomized clinical trial [^114pDF6S]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can extended-release carbidopa-levodopa (IPX203) improve symptomatic control in patients with Parkinson disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations while taking immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa?

Findings

In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial involving 506 participants, IPX203 showed statistically significant improvement in daily good on-time compared to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa when dosed a mean of 3 times per day compared to 5 times per day for immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa.

Meaning

The results of this study suggest that IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa may be useful in patients with Parkinson disease and motor fluctuations by providing more sustained benefit throughout the day, even with fewer daily doses.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Whether given with carbidopa-levodopa or with levodopa, the optimal daily dosage of carbidopa must be determined by careful titration. Most patients respond to a 1:10 proportion of carbidopa and levodopa, provided the daily dosage of carbidopa is 70 mg or more a day. The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa should not exceed 200 mg, since clinical experience with larger dosages is limited. If the patient is taking carbidopa-levodopa, the amount of carbidopa in carbidopa-levodopa should be considered when calculating the total amount of carbidopa to be administered each day.

Patients Receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa Who Require Additional Carbidopa

Some patients taking carbidopa-levodopa may not have adequate reduction in nausea and vomiting when the dosage of carbidopa is less than 70 mg a day, and the dosage of levodopa is less than 700 mg a day. When these patients are taking carbidopa-levodopa, 25 mg of carbidopa may be given with the first dose of carbidopa-levodopa each day. Additional doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg may be given during the day with each dose of carbidopa-levodopa. Carbidopa may be given with any dose of carbidopa-levodopa as required for optimum therapeutic response. The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa, given as carbidopa and as carbidopa-levodopa, should not exceed 200 mg.

Patients Requiring Individual Titration of Carbidopa and Levodopa Dosage

Although carbidopa-levodopa is the most frequently used of carbidopa and levodopa administration, there may be an occasional patient who requires individually titrated doses of these two drugs. In these patients, carbidopa should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg three or four times a day. The two drugs should be given at the same time, starting with no more than one-fifth (20%) to one-fourth (25%) of the previous or recommended daily dosage of levodopa when given without carbidopa. In patients already receiving levodopa therapy, at least twelve hours should elapse between the last dose of levodopa and initiation of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa. A convenient way to initiate therapy in these patients is in the morning following a night when the patient has not takenlevodopa for at least twelve hours. Health care providers who prescribe separate doses of carbidopa and levodopa should be thoroughly familiar with the directions for use of each drug.

### Initiating levodopa / carbidopa therapy with and without entacapone in early parkinson disease: the STRIDE-PD study [^113M8wdS]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

L-dopa is the most widely used and most effective therapy for Parkinson disease (PD), but chronic treatment is associated with motor complications in the majority of patients. It has been hypothesized that providing more continuous delivery of L-dopa to the brain would reduce the risk of motor complications, and that this might be accomplished by combining L-dopa with entacapone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, to extend its elimination half-life.

Methods

We performed a prospective 134-week double-blind trial comparing the risk of developing dyskinesia in 747 PD patients randomized to initiate L-dopa therapy with L-dopa/carbidopa (LC) or L-dopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE), administered 4x daily at 3.5-hour intervals. The primary endpoint was time to onset of dyskinesia.

Results

In comparison to LC, patients receiving LCE had a shorter time to onset of dyskinesia (hazard ratio, 1.29; p = 0.04) and increased frequency at week 134 (42% vs 32%; p = 0.02). These effects were more pronounced in patients receiving dopamine agonists at baseline. Time to wearing off and motor scores were not significantly different, but trended in favor of LCE treatment. Patients in the LCE group received greater L-dopa dose equivalents than LC-treated patients (p < 0.001).

Interpretation

Initiating L-dopa therapy with LCE failed to delay the time of onset or reduce the frequency of dyskinesia compared to LC. In fact, LCE was associated with a shorter time to onset and increased frequency of dyskinesia compared to LC. These results may reflect that the treatment protocol employed did not provide continuous L-dopa availability and the higher L-dopa dose equivalents in the LCE group.

Pharmacokinetics

Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid.

In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of separate tablets of carbidopa and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion to the excretion of dopamine when compared to the two drugs administered at separate times.

Supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B6) can be given to patients when they are receiving carbidopa and levodopa concomitantly or the fixed combination carbidopa-levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa extended release. Previous reports in the medical literature cautioned that high doses of vitamin B6should not be taken by patients on levodopa therapy alone because exogenously administered pyridoxine would enhance the metabolism of levodopa to dopamine. The introduction of carbidopa to levodopa therapy, which inhibits the peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine, counteracts the metabolic-enhancing effect of pyridoxine.

Carbidopa is combined with levodopa in carbidopa-levodopa and carbidopa-levodopa extended release tablets.

Recommendations

Part I — which drugs are available for motor symptoms of PD?

This part of the article covers the recommendations for the drugs that are available for the treatment of motor symptoms of PD. The recommendations for the use of these drugs in different treatment situations are covered in the second part of this article.

Which properties influence the prioritization of specific levodopa preparations for individual patients?

Background: There are different pharmacokinetic formulations of levodopa available, i.e. oral standard-release, rapidly dissolving or extended-release formulations and an inhalable formulation. The oral formulations, but not the inhalable formulation, are always combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, either carbidopa or benserazide.

Results: There is no published evidence that extended-release formulations of levodopa with dopa decarboxylase inhibitors are superior to the standard-release formulation in the treatment of PD. There are no studies that compared 4:1 ratio combinations of levodopa/carbidopa with 4:1 ratio levodopa/benserazide. In a study from 1999, standard (immediate release) was compared with extended-release levodopa/carbidopa, and no difference in symptom control, development of fluctuations, or dyskinesias was found within the 5-year observation period. Due to the lack of comparative studies, no recommendation can be made regarding a preference for the decarboxylase inhibitor. Extended-release preparations do not offer any advantage over standard-release preparations in terms of symptom control, motor fluctuations, or dyskinesias.

In addition to the primary outcome measure, the amount of time spent in the "Off" state was evaluated, and patients were also evaluated by subparts of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a frequently used multi-item rating scale intended to assess mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor function (Part III), complications of therapy (Part IV), and disease staging (Part V and VI); an investigator's and patient's global assessment of clinical condition, a 7-point subjective scale designed to assess global functioning in Parkinson's disease; and the change in daily carbidopa/levodopa dose.

In Study 1, 171 patients were randomized in 16 centers in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (Study 1), all of whom received concomitant levodopa plus dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (either carbidopa/levodopa or benserazide/levodopa). In Study 2, 205 patients were randomized in 17 centers in North America (US and Canada); all patients received concomitant carbidopa/levodopa.

The following tables (Table 4 and Table 5) display the results of these two studies:

Effects on "On" time did not differ by age, sex, weight, disease severity at baseline, levodopa dose and concurrent treatment with dopamine agonists or selegiline.

Withdrawal of entacapone:

In Study 2, abrupt withdrawal of entacapone, without alteration of the dose of carbidopa/levodopa, resulted in a significant worsening of fluctuations, compared to placebo. In some cases, symptoms were slightly worse than at baseline, but returned to approximately baseline severity within 2 weeks following levodopa dose increase on average by 80 mg. In Study 1, similarly, a significant worsening of parkinsonian symptoms was observed after entacapone withdrawal, as assessed 2 weeks after drug withdrawal. At this phase, the symptoms were approximately at baseline severity following levodopa dose increase by about 50 mg.

In the third placebo-controlled trial (Study 3), a total of 301 patients were randomized in 32 centers in Germany and Austria. In this trial, as in the other 2 studies, entacapone 200 mg was administered with each dose of levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (up to 10 times daily) and UPDRS Parts II and III and total daily "On" time were the primary measures of effectiveness. Results for the primary measures, as well as for some secondary measures are presented in Table 6.

2.3 Converting Patients from Carbidopa and Levodopa Products to Carbidopa, Levodopa and Entacapone Tablets

There is no experience in transferring patients currently treated with extended release formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, or carbidopa/levodopa products that are not combined in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa.

Patients with a history of moderate or severe dyskinesias or taking more than 600 mg of the levodopa component per day are likely to require a reduction in their daily levodopa dose when entacapone is added. Because dose adjustment of the individual carbidopa or levodopa component is not possible with fixed-dose products, initially titrate patients to a dose that is tolerated and that meets their individual therapeutic need using a separate carbidopa/levodopa tablet (1:4 ratio) plus an entacapone tablet. Once the patient's individual dose of carbidopa/levodopa plus entacapone dose has been established using two separate tablets; switch the patient to a corresponding single tablet of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone.

When less levodopa is required, reduce the total daily dosage of carbidopa/levodopa either by decreasing the strength of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets at each administration or by decreasing the frequency of administration by extending the time between doses.

2.4 Concomitant Use with Other Anti-Parkinson's Disease Drugs

Anticholinergic agents, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase (MAO) - B inhibitors, amantadine, and other standard drugs for Parkinson's disease may be used concomitantly while carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets is being administered; however, dosage adjustments of the concomitant medication or carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may be required.

2.5 Decrease or Interruption of Dosing

Avoid interruption of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets dosing because hyperpyrexia has been reported in patients who suddenly discontinue or reduce their use of levodopa [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^112UPD5h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In these studies, using similar total daily doses of levodopa, plasma levodopa concentrations with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release fluctuated in a narrower range than with carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release. Because the bioavailability of levodopa from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release relative to carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release is approximately 70–75%, the daily dosage of levodopa necessary to produce a given clinical response with the extended-release formulation will usually be higher.

The extent of availability and peak concentrations of levodopa after a single dose of 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release increased by about 50% and 25%, respectively, when administered with food.

At steady state, the bioavailability of carbidopa from carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release tablets is approximately 99% relative to the concomitant administration of carbidopa and levodopa. At steady state, carbidopa bioavailability from 50 mg/200 mg carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is approximately 58% relative to that from carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release.

Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), in oral doses of 10 mg to 25 mg, may reverse the effects of levodopa by increasing the rate of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation. Carbidopa inhibits this action of pyridoxine.

Special Populations

Geriatric

A study in eight young healthy subjects (21–22 yr) and eight elderly healthy subjects (69–76 yr) showed that the absolute bioavailability of levodopa was similar between young and elderly subjects following oral administration of levodopa and carbidopa. However, the systemic exposure (AUC) of levodopa was increased by 55% in elderly subjects compared to young subjects. Based on another study in forty patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a correlation between age of patients and the increase of AUC of levodopa following administration of levodopa and an inhibitor of peripheral dopa decarboxylase. AUC of levodopa was increased by 28% in elderly patients (≥ 65 yr) compared to young patients (< 65 yr). Additionally, mean value of Cmaxfor levodopa was increased by 24% in elderly patients (≥ 65 yr) compared to young patients (< 65 yr) (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

The AUC of carbidopa was increased in elderly subjects (n = 10, 65–76 yr) by 29% compared to young subjects (n = 24, 23–64 yr) following IV administration of 50 mg levodopa with carbidopa (50 mg). This increase is not considered a clinically significant impact.

### Concomitant medication usage with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel: results from the COSMOS study [^116rcPY4]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite proven efficacy and widespread use of levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), the chemical properties of orally administered levodopa include a short plasma half‐life that leads to intermittent receptor stimulation and subsequent fluctuations in symptom control. As PD progresses, the therapeutic window of levodopa treatment narrows and patients experience intermittent motor and nonmotor symptoms that require addition of drugs such as dopamine agonists, catechol‐ O ‐methyl‐transferase (COMT) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase‐B (MAO‐B) inhibitors, or amantadine. Poor treatment adherence is common among patients with PD, possibly because of side effects and/or drug–drug interactions from comedications to help manage PD, other comorbidities, or aspects of PD disease progression such as cognitive decline and dysphagia. Therefore, the complex oral drug regimens that are often used and frequently result in inadequate symptom control can be particularly burdensome to patients with advancing PD, creating a paradoxical need to simplify drug regimen while the disease progresses.

### Soluble and controlled-release preparations of levodopa: do we really need them? [^114WJWAV]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The controlled-release preparations of levodopa or newer soluble preparations of levodopa may improve levodopa bioavailability and tolerability and help managing (or even preventing) motor complications. Whether the controlled-release preparations or soluble preparations can really take the place of standard levodopa remains highly controversial, especially in patients receiving chronic levodopa therapy. Controlled-release formulations have a longer half-life and provide more stable plasma levels than standard levodopa. In de novo parkinsonian patients, controlled-release levodopa and standard levodopa are equally efficacious, and carry similar motor complication rates. In patients with advanced disease, whether motor fluctuations respond better to controlled release than to standard oral levodopa remains unclear. In selected parkinsonian patients, single bedtime doses of controlled-release levodopa may improve sleep and nocturnal disability. The poor solubility of levodopa may be overcome by soluble formulations that achieve maximal absorption. A levodopa formulation that guarantees faster and more reliable absorption would be especially useful in the clinical treatment of Parkinson's disease patients experiencing "no-on" or "delayed-on" phenomena. However, further studies with these new formulations are needed to understand if they offer better benefit to parkinsonian patients. New dual formulations incorporating both a faster absorption and an increased half-life than standard levodopa are currently under study.

### Persistent dyskinesias in patients with fetal tissue transplantation for parkinson disease [^111ZbsUi]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Since October 2001, he has taken a single carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 in the morning. He has occasional troublesome dyskinesias of the left side when under stress. The patient considered himself much improved from his pre-transplant condition by the transplant-stimulator combination.

Patient 133 (video segments 17–19) developed parkinsonism at age 42 in 1986. His major problems were wearing-off episodes as well as levodopa-induced dyskinesias, particularly of the left arm. He had a sham operation during the double-blind phase of the study and an open-label fetal tissue implant in January 1999 at age 55. During the first year after the transplant, his "off" periods were milder (see Table 1).

After the transplant, dyskinesias increased, so levodopa was reduced. Controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg was reduced to one per day and was discontinued by February 2000, 13 months after transplant. He continued to take trihexyphenidyl, selegiline, and amantadine. He was employed as an electrician. On September 11, 2001, he was working on the 34th floor of the first World Trade Center Tower attacked by a hijacked airplane. He walked down the 33 flights of stairs in the same 15 min as all others evacuating the building, ran five blocks to escape the dust cloud, and was not injured.

By October 2001, he indicated that left arm dyskinesias began at 9 to 10 a.m. and were bothersome about 1 h out of every four. Late in the afternoon, his right arm rather than his left might show intermittent dyskinesias.

Later in 2001, he experienced increasing "off" time, and restarted Sinemet which caused an increase in "on" dyskinesias. His levodopa-induced dyskinesias continued to fluctuate and were severe at times. Reduction of Sinemet and addition of ropinirole improved his fluctuations but did not eliminate them. In July 2002, 42 months after transplant, his UPDRS motor "off" score was 10 and "on" score was 5 with levodopa-induced dyskinesias present. Repeat FDOPA PET scan showed persistent putaminal fluorodopa uptake as we have found for at least four years in all subjects even without immunosuppression. He continued to work full time as an electrician.

### Novel detection and restorative levodopa treatment for preclinical diabetic retinopathy [^1153CGtR]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is diagnosed clinically by directly viewing retinal vascular changes during ophthalmoscopy or through fundus photographs. However, electroretinography (ERG) studies in humans and rodents have revealed that retinal dysfunction is demonstrable prior to the development of visible vascular defects. Specifically, delays in dark-adapted ERG oscillatory potential (OP) implicit times in response to dim-flash stimuli (< −1.8 log cd·s/m²) occur prior to clinically recognized DR. Animal studies suggest that retinal dopamine deficiency underlies these early functional deficits. In this study, we randomized individuals with diabetes, without clinically detectable retinopathy, to treatment with either low- or high-dose Sinemet (levodopa plus carbidopa) for 2 weeks and compared their ERG findings with those of control subjects (no diabetes). We assessed dim-flash-stimulated OP delays using a novel handheld ERG system (RETeval) at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks. RETeval recordings identified significant OP implicit time delays in individuals with diabetes without retinopathy compared with age-matched control subjects (P < 0.001). After 2 weeks of Sinemet treatment, OP implicit times were restored to control values, and these improvements persisted even after a 2-week washout. We conclude that detection of dim-flash OP delays could provide early detection of DR and that Sinemet treatment may reverse retinal dysfunction.

### Effect of opicapone on levodopa pharmacokinetics in patients with fluctuating Parkinson's disease [^117Xc3c5]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibiting catechol-O-methyltransferase extends the plasma half-life of levodopa, potentially allowing physicians to optimize the levodopa regimen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing motor fluctuations.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of once-daily opicapone on levodopa plasma pharmacokinetics and motor response when added to two different levodopa dosing regimens.

Methods

A total of 24 patients with PD and motor fluctuations were enrolled in an exploratory, open-label, modified cross-over trial. Participants first received levodopa/carbidopa 500/125mg (five intakes) for 2weeks and were then randomly assigned (1:1) to levodopa/carbidopa 400/100mg given over either four or five daily intakes plus opicapone 50mg for an additional 2weeks. Levodopa 12-hour pharmacokinetics was the primary outcome (ie, excluding the effect of last/evening levodopa/carbidopa intake), with motor complications evaluated as secondary outcomes.

Results

Over 12-hour pharmacokinetics and compared with five-intake levodopa/carbidopa 500/125mg without opicapone, maximal levodopa concentrations were similar or nonsignificantly higher on both levodopa/carbidopa 400/100mg regimens plus opicapone. Despite a 100mg lower total levodopa/carbidopa daily dose, adding opicapone 50mg at least doubled the levodopa plasma half-life and minimal concentrations, with a significant ≈30% increase in total exposure. The levodopa fluctuation index was only significantly lower for the five intakes plus opicapone regimen (difference of -71.8%; P < 0.0001). Modifications to levodopa pharmacokinetics were associated with decreased off time and increased on time.

Conclusions

Combining opicapone 50mg with a 100mg lower daily dose of levodopa provides higher levodopa bioavailability with avoidance of trough levels. Despite the lower levodopa dose, modifying the levodopa pharmacokinetic profile with opicapone was associated with decreased off time and increased on time. © 2022 The Authors.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to levodopa, AAN 2021 guidelines recommend to prescribe immediate-release levodopa, rather than controlled-release levodopa or levodopa-carbidopa-entacapone, initially in patients with early PD.

### Extended-release carbidopa-levodopa (IPX066) compared with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations: a phase 3 randomised, double-blind trial [^113kqcf6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

IPX066 is an oral, extended-release, capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa. We aimed to assess this extended-release formulation versus immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study at 68 academic and clinical centres in North America and Europe. Patients with Parkinson's disease who had at least 2.5 h per day of off-time underwent 3 weeks of open-label immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa dose adjustment followed by 6 weeks of open-label extended-release carbidopa-levodopa dose conversion. These patients were then randomly allocated (1:1), by use of an interactive web-response system, to 13 weeks of double-blind treatment with extended-release or immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa plus matched placebos. The primary efficacy measure was off-time as a percentage of waking hours in all patients randomly allocated to treatment groups, adjusted for baseline value. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00974974.

Findings

Between Sept 29, 2009, and Aug 16, 2010, we enrolled 471 participants, of whom 393 (83%) were randomly allocated in the double-blind maintenance period and were included in the main efficacy analyses. As a percentage of waking hours, 201 patients treated double-blind with extended-release carbidopa-levodopa (mean 3.6 doses per day [SD 0.7]) had greater reductions in off-time than did 192 patients treated double-blind with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (mean 5.0 doses per day [1.2]). Covariate-adjusted end-of-study means were 23.82% (SD 14.91) for extended-release carbidopa-levodopa and 29.79% (15.81) for immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (mean difference -5.97, 95% CI -9.05 to -2.89; p < 0.0001). Extended-release carbidopa-levodopa reduced daily off-time by, on average, an extra -1.17 h (95% CI -1.69 to -0.66; p < 0.0001) compared with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. During dose conversion with extended-release carbidopa-levodopa, 23 (5%) of 450 patients withdrew because of adverse events and 13 (3%) withdrew because of a lack of efficacy. In the maintenance period, the most common adverse events were insomnia (seven [3%] of 201 patients allocated extended-release carbidopa-levodopa vs two [1%] of 192 patients allocated immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa), nausea (six [3%] vs three [2%]), and falls (six [3%] vs four [2%]).

Interpretation

Extended-release carbidopa-levodopa might be a useful treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease who have motor fluctuations, with potential benefits including decreased off-time and reduced levodopa dosing frequency.

### Levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [^113h3bDD]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

For all its imperfections at treating Parkinson's disease (PD), orally-administered levodopa (l-dopa) can be regarded as the "platinum" standard of PD therapeutics for its impact on disability and discomfort and its cost-effectiveness. The past half-century has confirmed that the typical l-dopa-treated patient gains improvement for most Parkinsonian features, presumably by conversion of this amino acid into dopamine in the striatum. However, fundamental questions remain as to its full mechanism of action and how adverse reactions evolve. Various aspects of clinical phenomenology associated with chronic l-dopa use (such as dyskinesias and the long-duration anti-Parkinsonian response) present a continuing challenge for better understanding of its pharmacology. The pharmacokinetics of l-dopa tend to predict some of problems that can emerge during chronic therapy, which can be linked with its irregular uptake and marked dose-by-dose variability in plasma concentrations. Several new pharmaceutical approaches are targeted at the unique physiology of l-dopa uptake and are likely to improve the consistency of its anti-Parkinsonian effect.

### Advances in levodopa therapy for parkinson disease: review of RYTARY (carbidopa and levodopa) clinical efficacy and safety [^116kKfqA]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Parkinson disease (PD) is a slowly progressive, incurable, neurodegenerative disorder with progressive motor symptoms that can be managed with treatments. Levodopa is generally recognized as the most effective and widely used treatment for PD. It improves function and quality of life, morbidity, and mortality, and therefore reduces individual and societal costs. Levodopa has a relatively short half-life, however, and is quickly metabolized in the plasma, leading to fluctuations, including wearing-off of effect and inconsistent symptomatic relief as well as development of dyskinesias, with both wearing off and dyskinesias worsening with advancing disease. Immediate-release and controlled-release formulations have been used with success, but motor fluctuations remain a problem. RYTARY (levodopa and carbidopa, IPX066) is an oral extended-release therapy composed of carbidopa-levodopa microbeads designed to dissolve at various rates that allows for quick absorption and sustained levodopa release over an extended period. In development studies, RYTARY improved symptoms in patients with both early and advanced PD and offered significantly improved Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores and "on" times, without worsening troublesome dyskinesias when compared to other levodopa formulations. Tolerability and safety were comparable to other formulations. This section reviews the data that support the use of RYTARY in the treatment of PD.

Effect of carbidopa increase on "off" and "on" times

(A) Mean changes (−SEM) from baseline in daily "off" time. (B) Mean changes (+SEM) from baseline in daily "on" time without dyskinesia. 65 mg = ODM-101/65; 105 mg = ODM-101/105; LCE = levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone.

Predefined, explorative subgroup analyses were also done for "off" time (crossover analyses). The number of patients in different subgroups varied significantly depending on the analysis. Estimated treatment effects between the 2 ODM-101 combinations vs LCE were numerically higher (−0.76 for ODM-101/65 and −0.85 hours for ODM-101/105) in patients who had a higher daily levodopa dose at baseline (mean 812 [SD 144] mg (n = 43) compared to patients with a lower levodopa dose (482 [79] mg [n = 65, −0.49, and 0.08 hours]). In addition, patients taking 5 (n = 38) or more frequent (n = 21) doses of levodopa at baseline had numerically higher treatment differences (−0.97 and −0.86 or −0.70 and −0.86 hours) favoring ODM-101 combinations compared to LCE than patients taking less than 5 doses a day (n = 51, −0.31 and 0.04 hours). Patients who did not have entacapone at baseline (n = 22) had numerically higher treatment differences favoring ODM-101 combinations compared to LCE (−1.43 and −1.37 hours) when compared to those on entacapone at baseline (n = 85, −0.34 and −0.11 hours). Treatment effects were similar (−0.57 and −0.48, −0.66 and −0.58, or −0.51 and −0.10 hours) between ODM-101 combinations and LCE in patients with different durations of "off" time at baseline (< 3, 3–5, or > 5 hours; n = 8, 47, or 52).

2.1 Levodopa Carbidopa Controlled Release

2.1.1 Efficacy Conclusion

Three trials met the eligibility criteria for this question. There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of levodopa carbidopa controlled release to treat motor fluctuations in PD patients on (attempted) optimal oral levodopa therapy.

2.1.2 Summary

Three trials evaluated the use of levodopa carbidopa controlled release for reducing OFF‐time compared with levodopa carbidopa immediate release. One trial found no difference between the active treatment and placebo, while the other two showed a mild effect on reducing OFF‐time. However, all studies had significant design limitations and raised serious concerns regarding risk of bias. Additionally, these trials showed no differences between levodopa carbidopa controlled release and placebo in terms of increasing ON‐time or improving disability scores.

### IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of motor fluctuations in parkinson disease: the RISE-PD randomized clinical trial [^113vjxyY]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Levodopa has a short half-life and a limited window of opportunity for absorption in the proximal small intestine. IPX203 is an oral, extended-release formulation of carbidopa-levodopa developed to address these limitations.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in patients with Parkinson disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

RISE-PD was a 20-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial. The study was conducted between November 6, 2018, and June 15, 2021, at 105 academic and clinical centers in the US and Europe. Patients with Parkinson disease taking a total daily dose of 400 mg or more of levodopa and experiencing an average of 2.5 hours or more daily off-time were included in the study. A total of 770 patients were screened, 140 were excluded (those taking controlled-release carbidopa-levodopa apart from a single daily bedtime dose, Rytary (Amneal Pharmaceuticals), additional carbidopa or benserazide, or catechol O-methyl transferase inhibitors or who had a history of psychosis within the past 10 years), and 630 were enrolled in the trial.

Interventions

Following open-label immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa dose adjustment (3 weeks) and conversion to IPX203 (4 weeks), patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to double-blind, double-dummy treatment with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa or IPX203 for 13 weeks.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary end point was mean change in daily good on-time (ie, on-time without troublesome dyskinesia) from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment period.

Results

A total of 630 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [8.95] years; 396 [62.9%] men) were enrolled, and 506 patients were randomly assigned to receive IPX203 (n = 256) or immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (n = 250). The study met its primary end point, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in daily good on-time for IPX203 compared to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (least squares mean, 0.53 hours; 95% CI, 0.09–0.97; P = 0.02), with IPX203 dosed a mean 3 times per day vs 5 times per day for immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. Good on-time per dose increased by 1.55 hours with IPX203 compared to immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (95% CI, 1.37–1.73; P < .001). IPX203 was well tolerated. The most common adverse events in the double-blind phase (IPX203 vs immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa) were nausea (4.3% vs 0.8%) and anxiety (2.7% vs 0.0%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, IPX203 provided more hours of good on-time per day than immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa, even as IPX203 was dosed less frequently.

### Carbidopa, levodopa, and entacapone (Stalevo) [^112gHHdF]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Converting Patients from Carbidopa and Levodopa Products to Stalevo

There is no experience in transferring patients currently treated with extended release formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, or carbidopa/levodopa products that are not combined in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa.

Patients with a history of moderate or severe dyskinesias or taking more than 600 mg of the levodopa component per day are likely to require a reduction in their daily levodopa dose when entacapone is added. Because dose adjustment of the individual carbidopa or levodopa component is not possible with fixed-dose products, initially titrate patients to a dose that is tolerated and that meets their individual therapeutic need using a separate carbidopa/levodopa tablet (1:4 ratio) plus an entacapone tablet. Once the patient's individual dose of carbidopa/levodopa plus entacapone dose has been established using two separate tablets; switch the patient to a corresponding single tablet of Stalevo.

When less levodopa is required, reduce the total daily dosage of carbidopa/levodopa either by decreasing the strength of Stalevo at each administration or by decreasing the frequency of administration by extending the time between doses.

2.4 Concomitant Use with Other Anti-Parkinson's Disease Drugs

Anticholinergic agents, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase (MAO) - B inhibitors, amantadine, and other standard drugs for Parkinson's disease may be used concomitantly while Stalevo is being administered; however, dosage adjustments of the concomitant medication or Stalevo may be required.

2.5 Decrease or Interruption of Dosing

Avoid interruption of Stalevo dosing because hyperpyrexia has been reported in patients who suddenly discontinue or reduce their use of levodopa [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.6 Important Administration Instructions

Do not split, crush or chew Stalevo tablets. Administer only one tablet at each dosing interval. All strengths of Stalevo contain 200 mg of entacapone. Combining multiple tablets or portions of tablets to achieve a higher levodopa dose may lead to an overdose of entacapone.

Administer Stalevo with or without food. However, a high-fat, high-calorie meal may delay the absorption of levodopa by about 2 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prescribing levodopa — formulation evidence and dosing note that there are no studies comparing immediate-release (IR) levodopa to extended-release (ER) carbidopa/levodopa in early PD; controlled-release (CR) levodopa has lower bioavailability and less predictable symptom relief compared to IR; IR is less costly; clinical trials demonstrate symptomatic benefit with levodopa/carbidopa 150–300 mg/day and a lower dyskinesia risk with dosages < 400 mg/day; levodopa may cause ICDs, hallucinations, EDS, and may exacerbate postural hypotension; nausea is common early and dose-dependent, and taking levodopa with meals may decrease nausea and improve compliance in early PD but may decrease therapeutic efficacy in later stages.

### Increased dose of carbidopa with levodopa and entacapone improves "off" time in a randomized trial [^115Gy9p5]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Efficacy variables

The primary efficacy criterion was the change in diary-recorded "off" time during 3 consecutive days from baseline compared to the end of each crossover period. Patients (or caregivers if needed) filled in the diary. A concordance training session of at least 2 hours before the baseline visit was performed by all patients. Secondary efficacy variables were diary recorded as "on" time without dyskinesia, "on" time with nontroublesome dyskinesia, and "on" time with troublesome dyskinesia. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Parts I–IV (UPDRS I–IV), as well as Schwab and England scores were evaluated by investigators at baseline and at the end of each study period. UPDRS Part III was assessed 30 to 90 minutes after study-drug intake during the presumed "on" stage at each visit. UPDRS Part III was completed after the same study-drug dose of the day. For example, if originally done after the second dose before the randomization visit, then the following assessments were done after the second dose at the end of the treatment periods as well. The study also evaluated the use of electronic home diaries (eDiary) to collect "on/off" times.

Tolerability and safety assessments

Safety was determined by adverse-event documentation, vital signs, ECG, safety laboratory parameters, and physical examination. The occurrence of sleep attacks was separately assessed by asking: "In the past 4 weeks, have you experienced any events in which you fell asleep suddenly or unexpectedly?"

### Increased dose of carbidopa with levodopa and entacapone improves "off" time in a randomized trial [^114JZgVg]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether increased fixed carbidopa doses of 65 or 105 mg (ODM-101/65 and ODM-101/105) in combination with 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone might improve "off" time in fluctuating Parkinson disease (PD) compared to the standard combination of 4:1 levodopa/carbidopa with the usual 200 mg of entacapone (LCE) during a 4-week treatment period.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, crossover, multicenter, phase II, proof-of-concept study in patients with fluctuating PD.

Results

One hundred seventeen patients were randomized into the study (mean age 67.0 years; daily "off" time 5.3 hours; mean daily levodopa dose 610 mg). Carryover-adjusted mean changes from baseline "off" times were during ODM-101/65, −1.53 hours (p = 0.02 vs LCE), during ODM-101/105, −1.57 hours (p = 0.01 vs LCE), and during LCE −0.91 hours. Changes in daily "on" time without dyskinesia were 1.54 hours (p = 0.005 vs LCE), 1.38 hours (p = 0.0214 vs LCE), and 0.69 hours, respectively. Changes in "on" time with troublesome dyskinesia were < 0.1 hours and not significantly different between treatments. In patients with high-activity COMT genotypes Val/Met or Val/Val, "off" time was reduced more with ODM-101/65 and ODM-101/105 than with LCE (p = 0.015 and p = 0.006). No difference between the treatments was seen in safety and tolerability. The most common treatment-related adverse effects were nausea, dizziness, drug-effect decrease, and dyskinesia, which were in most cases mild or moderate in severity. Treatment-related serious adverse events were diarrhea (ODM-101/105 and LCE), and myocardial ischemia and blood creatine kinase increase (LCE).

Conclusion

Increasing the dose of carbidopa in combination with levodopa and entacapone should be considered in the treatment of fluctuating PD to improve daily "off" times. Genotyping patients with PD according to COMT activity may improve individual treatment strategies.

2.2 IPX066 (Levodopa Carbidopa Extended Release)

2.2.1 Efficacy Conclusion

One trial met the eligibility criteria for this question. IPX066 is efficacious to treat motor fluctuations in PD patients on (attempted) optimal oral levodopa therapy.

2.2.2 Summary

One trial evaluated the use of IPX066 for reducing OFF‐time compared with levodopa carbidopa immediate release, showing a difference between groups of 1.2 h (P < 0.0001) in favor of IPX066. The same study showed an increase in ON‐time without troublesome dyskinesia (0.9 h, P < 0.001) and ON‐time without any dyskinesia (0.7 h, P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Mean dosing frequency was 3.6 doses per day (SD 0.7 doses) for IPX066 versus 5.0 doses per day (SD 1.2 doses) for levodopa carbidopa immediate release (P < 0.0001). IPX066 was not effective in improving disability, with differences in UPDRS‐II of −0.9 points (P < 0.003) during ON‐medication state and −0.8 points P < 0.005) during off‐medication state, both of which were not considered clinically relevant. Additionally, IPX066 was unlikely to improve quality of life as the difference in PDQ‐39 scores between IPX066 and levodopa carbidopa immediate release was −2.5 points (P < 0.05), which did not reach clinical relevance. Comparisons using SF‐36 and EQ‐5D (EuroQol 5 Dimension) showed no significant differences between the groups.

### Increased dose of carbidopa with levodopa and entacapone improves "off" time in a randomized trial [^114NqszF]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Classification of evidence

This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of 2 increased and fixed carbidopa doses (65 and 105 mg) in combination with the COMT inhibitor entacapone compared with levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE) in patients with PD who have end-of-dose wearing off. This study provides Class II evidence that an increased dose of carbidopa improves motor fluctuations in patients with PD when administered with levodopa and entacapone (daily carryover-adjusted "off" time −1.53 for 65 mg [p = 0.02 vs LCE] and −1.57 for 105 mg [p = 0.01 vs LCE] compared to −0.91 hours for LCE).

Study design and treatments

This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, crossover, multicenter, phase II, proof-of-concept study using the intention-to-treat approach in its analysis. The study was conducted in 24 centers in Germany, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania.

Study population

Enrolled patients had idiopathic PD according to the UK brain bank criteria and were at least 30 years of age. The following were inclusion criteria: patients were required to have an average of ≥ 3.0 hours of "off" time, with a minimum of 0.5 hours of "off" time each day on 3 consecutive days (as assessed with home diaries) with Hoehn and Yahrstage 2–4 during "on" time. The main exclusion criteria were severe dyskinesia, severe orthostatic hypotension, currently active hallucinations, a Mini-Mental State Examination score < 24, and problematic impulse control disorders.

At study entry, patients were allowed to be on 3 to 8 regular daily doses of levodopa/DDCI with or without entacapone. One evening dose of controlled-release levodopa/DDCI was allowed. Use of soluble levodopa/benserazide preparations up to 4 doses per week (not on diary days) was also allowed as a rescue therapy. All standard levodopa preparations were to be switched to study medications at randomization.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In controlled clinical trials, patients predominantly with moderate to severe motor fluctuations while on carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release were randomized to therapy with either carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release or carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. The adverse experience frequency profile of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release did not differ substantially from that of carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release, as shown in Table 1.

Abnormal laboratory findings occurring at a frequency of 1% or greater in approximately 443 patients who received carbidopa and levodopa extended-release and 475 who received carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release during controlled clinical trials included: decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit; elevated serum glucose; white blood cells, bacteria and blood in the urine.

The adverse experiences observed in patients in uncontrolled studies were similar to those seen in controlled clinical studies.

Other adverse experiences reported overall in clinical trials in 748 patients treated with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, listed by body system in order of decreasing frequency, include:

Body as a Whole: Asthenia, fatigue, abdominal pain, orthostatic effects.

Cardiovascular: Palpitation, hypertension, hypotension, myocardial infarction.

Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal pain, dysphagia, heartburn.

Metabolic: Weight loss.

Musculoskeletal: Leg pain.

Nervous System/Psychiatric: Chorea, somnolence, falling, anxiety, disorientation, decreased mental acuity, gait abnormalities, extrapyramidal disorder, agitation, nervousness, sleep disorders, memory impairment.

To investigate whether increased fixed carbidopa doses of 65 or 105 mg (ODM-101/65 and ODM-101/105) in combination with 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone might improve "off" time in fluctuating Parkinson disease (PD) compared to the standard combination of 4:1 levodopa/carbidopa with the usual 200 mg of entacapone (LCE) during a 4-week treatment period.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, crossover, multicenter, phase II, proof-of-concept study in patients with fluctuating PD.

Results

One hundred seventeen patients were randomized into the study (mean age 67.0 years; daily "off" time 5.3 hours; mean daily levodopa dose 610 mg). Carryover-adjusted mean changes from baseline "off" times were during ODM-101/65, -1.53 hours (p = 0.02 vs LCE), during ODM-101/105, -1.57 hours (p = 0.01 vs LCE), and during LCE -0.91 hours. Changes in daily "on" time without dyskinesia were 1.54 hours (p = 0.005 vs LCE), 1.38 hours (p = 0.0214 vs LCE), and 0.69 hours, respectively. Changes in "on" time with troublesome dyskinesia were < 0.1 hours and not significantly different between treatments. In patients with high-activity COMT genotypes Val/Met or Val/Val, "off" time was reduced more with ODM-101/65 and ODM-101/105 than with LCE (p = 0.015 and p = 0.006). No difference between the treatments was seen in safety and tolerability. The most common treatment-related adverse effects were nausea, dizziness, drug-effect decrease, and dyskinesia, which were in most cases mild or moderate in severity. Treatment-related serious adverse events were diarrhea (ODM-101/105 and LCE), and myocardial ischemia and blood creatine kinase increase (LCE).

Conclusion

Increasing the dose of carbidopa in combination with levodopa and entacapone should be considered in the treatment of fluctuating PD to improve daily "off" times. Genotyping patients with PD according to COMT activity may improve individual treatment strategies.

### Comparison of orally dissolving carbidopa / levodopa (parcopa) to conventional oral carbidopa / levodopa: a single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^114kjUBS]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Levodopa use in fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) is complicated by an inconsistent and prolonged onset to clinical improvement. An orally dissolved carbidopa/levodopa (OD C/L) preparation (Parcopa UCB Pharma) is available in the United States. This offers potential advantages to shorten the duration from ingestion to clinical improvement. Surprisingly, this has never been clinically assessed. We tested 20 patients with fluctuating PD and a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) "off" motor score of ≥ 25 in a 2-day, single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study. Patients arrived in the morning in the practically defined "off" state and were randomly assigned to receive identical doses of either oral C/L and OD placebo or OD C/L and oral C/L placebo on 1st day and the reverse combination on a 2nd day. After training, patients underwent bilateral hand tapping at baseline and every 5 minutes for 60 minutes after dose ingestion. Stride length (SL) was recorded at 5-minute intervals with an ambulatory gait monitor. Patients identified their subjective latency to "on" and noted drug preferences and adverse events. They also underwent a UPDRS motor examination at baseline and 60 minutes after dose. Twenty subjects [15 male, age 68.7 (9.7), PD duration 13.4 (6.8)] completed. There were no significant group differences in tapping speed, subjective time to "on", latency of increased SL, or overall preference. However, all trends did favor OD C/L. Adverse events were similar. This small pilot study did not show significant group differences favoring OD C/L; however, larger studies may be justified, and individual patients may benefit.

Study-2 Design: Dose Ranging of Carbidopa-Levodopa

This open-label proof-of-concept study conducted in a private ophthalmology practice (identifier) started participant recruitment in May 2017. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to study initiation and all patients provided written informed consent. In this trial, patients who had completed Study-1 (Cohort 1, n = 17), or who had been receiving anti-VEGF injections for at least 3 months (Cohort 2, n = 14), were enrolled for 3 months and evaluated monthly. Patients received escalating doses of levodopa; 1 tablet QHS the first month, followed by 1 tablet TID the second month and then 2 tablets TID from the next month on (Supplementary Figure, B). The open-label extension (identifier) continued to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the highest dose of levodopa (2 tablets TID). After baseline measurements were obtained (Supplementary Table 2), the patients were evaluated monthly and continued to be under the care of their referring retina specialist. After each follow-up visit, the retina specialist was notified of the patient's BCVA and anatomic changes. The patient's retina specialist determined whether the patient required anti-VEGF therapy. Although Study-2 is still ongoing, here we report the results of levodopa at the 1- and 6-month time points.

Study Drug: Carbidopa-Levodopa

Levodopa was given as a combination therapy with carbidopa, as is standard for treatment of movement disorders. Inclusion of carbidopa reduces the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, thus, nausea and other peripheral effects are decreased by approximately 80% and the bio-availability of levodopa in the central nervous system is increased. An Investigational New Drug Application 132078 was submitted for this indication.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

To be included in the studies, patients had to be at least 50 years old and have a clinical diagnosis of AMD with choroidal neovascularization in one eye, among other criteria (for a complete list of eligibility criteria, see Supplementary Table 3).

### Increased dose of carbidopa with levodopa and entacapone improves "off" time in a randomized trial [^111YuWV6]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study conduct

The study consisted of a screening period, 3 treatment periods of 4 weeks each, and a posttreatment period. There were no washout periods between the treatment periods.

The patients' individually optimized daily levodopa regimens were kept stable for at least 2 weeks before randomization. The patients were randomized to receive ODM-101 with 200 mg of entacapone and 65 mg of carbidopa and 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg of levodopa (ODM-101/65), ODM-101 with 200 mg of entacapone and 105 mg of carbidopa and 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg of levodopa (ODM-101/105), and LCE. At each levodopa intake, the patients received either ODM-101/65 or ODM-101/105 and the corresponding placebo for LCE, or LCE and the corresponding placebo for ODM-101.

The levodopa dosage in the study drug (75, 100, 125, or 150 mg) was determined by the patient's individually optimized levodopa regimen (3–8 daily doses including soluble and controlled-release evening formulations if taken regularly). Baseline 75 mg levodopa dosage without entacapone was switched to 75 mg study-drug dosage, 100 mg was switched to 75 mg, 125 mg was switched to 100 mg, 150 mg was switched to 125 mg, and 200 mg was switched to 150 mg. Baseline levodopa dosage with entacapone was switched to the same dosage of the study drug. During the first 2 weeks of each treatment period, the patient's levodopa dosage (but not frequency) was adjusted as needed by the investigator. For the remaining 2 weeks of each treatment period, levodopa dosages were kept stable. The use of tolcapone was prohibited, but stable doses of dopamine agonists (except apomorphine), monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, amantadine, and anticholinergics were allowed.

The patients who had signed informed consent for pharmacogenetic studies (n = 76) were included in a substudy. Blood samples for DNA extraction were taken at the screening visit from these patients and checked for COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism.

### Sensor-based algorithmic dosing suggestions for oral administration of levodopa / carbidopa microtablets for Parkinson's disease: a first experience [^117TN1r1]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, sensor readings for all 25 patients were obtained, but appropriate individual models could only be fitted for 19 patients. One patient could not perform the hand rotation task, one patient had limited response to levodopa during the test day, and for four patients the algorithm predictions misrepresented the dose–effect behavior at the day of the trial. For those four patients, the series of sensor index scores did not represent a "normal" dose–response curve, i.e. the values did not go from baseline to a peak effect and then back to baseline. Results from the remaining 19 patients are presented here, for nine of which one test occasion was removed as outlier in the model fitting process and for one patient two test occasions were removed as outliers. Outliers were identified as scores that had either a sudden drop in value after the onset of effect, or displayed a sudden spike in effect after wearing off started to demonstrate. Sudden motor fluctuations do happen, but cannot be accommodated by the current PKPD models. That is why these values were selected as outliers, even though they might not be in clinical practice. The outliers were removed based on a visual inspection of the TRS scores.

### Inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase contributes to more stable levodopa plasma levels [^114vKRzi]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

The short plasma half-life limits the antiparkinsonian efficacy of levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD). Administration of LD/CD with the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor entacapone in one tablet (LCE) may extend plasma half-life of LD and thus its effect on motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objectives of this study were to monitor the motor response to a switch from LD/CD to LCE by a simultaneous performance of an instrumental motor test and rating of motor symptoms and to compare the LD plasma behavior between both conditions in terms of stability. Twenty-one treated PD patients received LD/CD and then the identical oral LD dosage of LCE within a standardized setting on 2 consecutive days. Rating better reflected the motor improvement after LD application than the instrumental test. Motor symptoms of PD patients decreased significantly more during the LCE than the LD/CD condition, probably due to significantly higher LD plasma levels and a significantly less pronounced fall of the LD concentrations following the second LD intake. Our study shows a more stable LD plasma behavior during LCE intake and accordingly a better effect on motor symptoms according to rating outcomes and motor test results to a lesser extent.

### Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel reduces dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease in a randomized trial [^116w7j1L]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

The combination of levodopa‐carbidopa is a mainstay in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. Generally, catechol‐ O ‐methyl transferase (COM‐T) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase‐B (MAO‐B) inhibitors, and dopamine agonists are used simultaneously with levodopa to reduce motor fluctuations. Despite use of optimal oral medications, patients progressively develop persistent motor fluctuations such as wearing‐off and delayed "On" time characterized by predictable or unpredictable swings from mobility to immobility. Even with optimal oral treatments, dyskinesias are often challenging to manage.

Dyskinesias are among the most troublesome symptoms in advanced PD. Approximately 50% of patients present with dyskinesia 4 to 5 years after treatment initiation and approximately 90% after 9 years. Moderate‐to‐severe dyskinesia can be painful and impair voluntary movements, thus impacting quality of life (QoL). Dyskinesias are thought to result from pulsatile stimulation of postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors caused by multiple oral levodopa dosing. In the context of severe neurodegeneration, erratic absorption, unpredictable variability in gastric emptying, and the short levodopa half‐life, multiple oral levodopa dosing can result in unstable levodopa levels in plasma and, therefore, unstable dopamine levels in the basal ganglia. Thus, dyskinesias in PD may result from drug therapy, specifically levodopa treatment. Dyskinesia treatment options include oral amantadine, continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, and deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, DBS may not be available or suitable for all patients. More treatment options are needed for patients with advanced PD. One option may be continuous levodopa delivery.

Levodopa‐carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is continuously delivered to the upper intestine by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with J tube extension (PEG‐J) using an external pump. LCIG provides more stable levodopa plasma levels than standard oral levodopa therapy thus decreasing the potential for motor complications and dyskinesia. Clinical trials and observational studies with LCIG have demonstrated marked reductions in "Off" time, decreased "On" time with dyskinesia, and increased "On" time without troublesome dyskinesia. However, these studies assessed dyskinesia using patient PD diaries and/or the motor section (Part IV) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), both of which are limited in their sensitivity to change and ability to quantify dyskinesia symptoms.

### Pharmacology and evidence-based strategies for current and emerging treatments for OFF periods in parkinson disease [^117DLyHv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

​​​​​​​​ Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms such as rigidity, resting tremor, and slowed movement in addition to nonmotor symptoms. As the disease advances and a patient's response duration to a levodopa dose is shortened, OFF episodes become more prevalent, negatively impacting their quality of life. Clinicians may employ a variety of therapeutic strategies to reduce OFF time, such as altering the levodopa dose or initiating adjuvant therapy. Medications to treat daily OFF time include dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, amantadine ER, and adenosine A2A antagonists; as-needed rescue therapies include subcutaneous apomorphine, apomorphine sublingual film, and orally inhaled levodopa; and, when necessary, advanced therapies such as carbidopa/levodopa enteral suspension or DBS may be indicated.

### Very early levodopa may prevent self-injury in lesch-nyhan disease [^112rr299]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient C showed restlessness at age two weeks and irritability with episodes of hyperextension at 2 months. At six months, orange diaper stains suggested urine uric acid crystals due to hyperuricemia. LND was confirmed by a previously unreported HPRT1 c.202C > T; p.L68F variant. Levodopa/carbidopa (ratio 4:1) was started at 11 months, gradually increasing to ~5 mg/kg/day levodopa in three doses (Fig A). Dystonia, chorea, and restlessness subsequently worsened during a roseola infantum infection. After reducing levodopa by half, these exacerbated motor symptoms subsided. While continuing on ~2.5 mg/kg/day levodopa, self-injury started at age 1.5 years with biting fingers and inner cheeks. To prevent self-injury, the patient wears gloves.

### Levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease [^116hQpby]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The predominant motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurones and can be reversed in part or whole by dopamine replacement or augmentation strategies. Physicians have most experience with the use of levodopa, which remains the most potent oral dopaminergic treatment for PD. There are reservations about the long-term use of levodopa, most particularly in the context of its propensity to induce motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Strategies exist to delay or diminish these complications, but the physician must lay the basis for these in the selection of drugs for early treatment and the sequence of drugs introduced subsequently. Levodopa efficacy and duration of effect may be enhanced by combination with a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor. Maintaining good motor function and quality of life remain the primary goals of therapy and the principle that treatment must be tailored to the individual patient's needs is paramount.

"Off" time by COMT enzyme rs4680 genotype

Val 158 Met genotyping data were available for 76 of 117 patients of whom 18 (24%) presented a low-COMT-activity Met/Met genotype, 31 (41%) were of heterozygous Val/Met, and 27 (36%) of homozygous Val/Val genotype. "Off" time from baseline was reduced significantly more during ODM-101/65 and ODM-101/105 treatments than during LCE treatment (p = 0.015 and p = 0.006) in patients with high-COMT-activity Val/Met or Val/Val genotypes. In patients with the low-COMT-activity genotype Met/Met, no such differences were seen (p = 0.679 and p = 0.890; table 3). "Off" time reduction in patients with the Val/Val genotype was seen with the ODM-101/65 and ODM-101/105 treatments but not with the LCE treatment (table 4).

### Foslevodopa / foscarbidopa: a new subcutaneous treatment for Parkinson's disease [^117SMEQ6]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Globally, Parkinson's disease (PD) affects > 6,000,000 people and has the fastest rate of growth among neurological disorders, the leading source of worldwide disability. 1 Our understanding of the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors involved in the development of PD 2 has advanced substantially 3 over the 2 centuries since James Parkinson's Essay on the Shaking Palsy 4; however, the primary pathological hallmark of the disease is still dopamine (DA) deficiency within the basal ganglia, leading to death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 5 Despite significant efforts to fulfill the substantial clinical need to identify disease‐modifying agents, 6 chronic DA replacement therapy remains the most effective method to treat the tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity motor symptoms of PD. 7

Levodopa (LD) remains the gold standard in DA replacement therapy. 7, 8, 9 The mechanism of action for LD as DA replacement therapy in the central nervous system involves the enzymatic decarboxylation of LD (a DA prodrug) by central dopa decarboxylase (Fig 1A). Without a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, minimal LD crosses the blood–brain barrier owing to premature decarboxylation; thus, high LD doses are required for PD therapy, leading to side effects. The development of the dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa (CD), 10 was a key breakthrough in LD treatment and led to the approval of oral LD/CD combination therapy in 1975. In early stage PD, oral LD/CD is effective at managing symptoms (see Fig 1B) when there is tolerance of fluctuating brain DA concentrations. 7 Later in disease progression, higher and more frequent doses are required, eventually leading to dyskinesias (involuntary exaggerated movements) at high DA concentrations and increased "off" time at low DA concentrations. Efforts to remove the peaks and troughs from oral LD/CD therapy and deliver a consistent and optimal DA level led to the development of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa). Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel decreases the "off" time of advanced PD patients by an average of 1.9 hours per day 11 but requires surgery for administration. Nevertheless, clinical experience with levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel demonstrated that sustained LD concentrations of ≤ 5μg/ml should be effective in treating the vast majority of patients with advanced PD, 12, 13 an important observation guiding our efforts to develop improved LD therapeutic approaches.

### The relationship between the distinct ratios of benserazide and carbidopa to levodopa and motor complications in Parkinson's disease: a retrospective cohort study [^113qKgHm]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In Japan, only two medications of immediate-release levodopa with distinct ratios of decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI), namely levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg and levodopa/carbidopa 100/10 mg, are available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationship between the difference in the DCI to levodopa ratio and the development of motor complications in long-term administration of levodopa is unknown.

Purpose

We assessed the duration from initiation of levodopa/DCI to the emergence of motor fluctuations in patients with PD treated with levodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa.

Methods

We retrospectively assessed the disease course, especially the period from the onset of motor symptoms or initiation of levodopa/DCI to the emergence of motor fluctuations, in patients with PD who were initially treated with either levodopa/benserazide (300/75 mg/day) or levodopa/carbidopa (300/30 mg/day).

Results

Of the 186 candidates, 52 patients were enrolled. The mean duration to the emergence of motor fluctuations in the levodopa/carbidopa group was significantly longer than that in the levodopa/benserazide group (5.0 ± 1.4 vs 3.1 ± 1.2 years, p < 0.01). The mean duration from onset of motor symptoms to the emergence of motor fluctuations in the levodopa/carbidopa group was also significantly longer than that in the levodopa/benserazide group (6.6 ± 1.6 vs 4.7 ± 1.3 years, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Our study suggests that levodopa/carbidopa therapy with a DCI to levodopa ratio of 1:10 may delay the occurrence of motor fluctuations when compared to levodopa/benserazide therapy with that of 1:4. The difference in the blending ratio of levodopa/DCI may influence the disease progression in PD.

### Role of COMT inhibitors and dopamine agonists in the treatment of motor fluctuations [^114WAFc2]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Although levodopa remains the most effective drug for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), there are significant limitations to its chronic use. Growing preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the severity of motor fluctuations is influenced both by PD severity and pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors. Current management of motor fluctuations is based primarily on strategies to prolong the effects of dopaminergic stimulation. This prolongation is accomplished either through the use of long-acting dopaminergic drugs or prolonging of the effects of levodopa. During the past decade, the armamentarium of dopamine agonists increased and agents that prolong the plasma half-life of levodopa became available. Furthermore, recent clinical trials provide evidence-based approaches to improve the management of motor fluctuations in patients with advanced and early PD.
