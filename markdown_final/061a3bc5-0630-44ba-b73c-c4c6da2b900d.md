## Question

NSAIDs anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how NSAIDs cause anemia, how strong the evidence is, who is highest risk, how to monitor and manage it, and what to do when anemia is already present. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanisms linking NSAIDs to anemia. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of the evidence across trials, observational studies, and labels. Next, I will stratify risk by patient and drug factors. After that, I need to outline practical monitoring and prevention strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a management algorithm for NSAID-associated anemia and highlight special populations and controversies, making sure I double-check conflicting data as I go.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic framework. NSAID-associated anemia arises through three principal pathways: occult gastrointestinal blood loss (upper and especially lower GI), hemodilution from fluid retention, and a putative direct suppression of erythropoiesis that remains incompletely characterized; importantly, NSAIDs also impair platelet aggregation, which can amplify bleeding even when mucosal lesions are modest, so I need to keep both mucosal injury and hemostatic effects in mind when interpreting falling hemoglobin on therapy [^111sFJG3] [^113VPZPm] [^112XKzhi] [^114RFrza] [^111SKeYC].

> Wait, let me verify the bleeding contribution across the GI tract. NSAIDs cause mucosal injury beyond the stomach and duodenum; small-bowel enteropathy and colopathy are well described and can present with iron-deficiency anemia, often without upper GI symptoms, which means a normal upper endoscopy does not exclude NSAID-related blood loss; capsule endoscopy studies show frequent small-bowel lesions in chronic NSAID users, and consensus statements emphasize clinically meaningful events throughout the entire GI tract, not just the upper tract [^111NgZ4Y] [^111kVMhR] [^113aRfF7] [^117Q34JV].

> I should double-check the quantitative signal for hemoglobin decline. In GI-REASONS, a 6‑month randomized trial in older osteoarthritis patients, clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin drop ≥ 2 g/dL without non-GI explanation) occurred more often with nonselective NSAIDs than celecoxib (2.9% vs 1.8%; RR 1.6), and the mean hemoglobin decrease was greater with nsNSAIDs, supporting a true GI blood loss signal; postmarketing ibuprofen data also show that 17–23% of patients on higher daily doses had hemoglobin decreases ≥ 1 g/dL, reinforcing dose-related hematologic toxicity even in the absence of overt bleeding [^111mQieS] [^113VPZPm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all NSAIDs behaving the same. Celecoxib trials generally show lower rates of GI events and anemia than nonselective NSAIDs, but the absolute anemia rates are low and not zero; in controlled trials, anemia occurred in 0.6% with celecoxib vs 0.4% with placebo, so COX‑2 selectivity reduces but does not eliminate risk, and the clinical relevance depends on baseline risk and duration of exposure [^113A28GZ] [^111mQieS].

> Next, I should review aspirin separately because its irreversible platelet inhibition and mucosal effects differ. Narrative reviews suggest that low-dose aspirin may be associated with small hemoglobin declines in older adults, but the evidence is heterogeneous and often confounded; some observational data even show a paradoxical association with higher hemoglobin, so I need to be cautious in attributing causality outside trials and consider patient selection and comorbidity as major drivers [^115SdPok] [^1169dxLp] [^114RBZW1].

> I will now examine who is highest risk so I can target monitoring. Older age, comorbid CKD or heart failure, concomitant anticoagulants or antiplatelets, prior GI ulcer/bleeding, and polypharmacy all elevate risk; perioperative and interventional pain populations also carry heightened bleeding risk when NSAIDs are used, and guideline panels advise individualized risk stratification before prescribing NSAIDs in these settings [^111X1Brb] [^116U1dBM] [^114NGUtP].

> Let me think about dose and duration, because I initially thought "duration > 3 months" was the key threshold; wait, I should verify that. The clearest quantitative signal in GI-REASONS emerged over 6 months, and observational data linking medications to iron-deficiency anemia typically evaluate long-term exposure, often defined as ≥ 12 months; short courses can still cause occult bleeding, but the cumulative risk and anemia signal rise with sustained use, so I should frame risk as cumulative and dose dependent rather than tied to a single short-term threshold [^111mQieS] [^111YFhq4] [^111wUYPh].

> Next, I should review monitoring recommendations and make sure they align with labels and guidelines. For patients on long-term NSAIDs, periodic CBCs are advised to detect occult blood loss, with some labels recommending hemoglobin/hematocrit checks if anemia symptoms occur; in higher-risk patients, a baseline CBC and iron studies before initiation, followed by periodic reassessment, are reasonable, and a hemoglobin drop ≥ 2 g/dL can serve as a pragmatic trigger to evaluate for GI sources of bleeding [^112XKzhi] [^113VPZPm] [^114RFrza] [^115S546m].

> I need to ensure prevention strategies are evidence-aligned. Use the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest duration, consider COX‑2–selective agents for patients at higher GI risk, and add PPI therapy for those with moderate-to-high upper GI risk; however, I should confirm that PPIs do not protect the small bowel, so unexplained anemia despite PPI prophylaxis warrants evaluation for lower GI sources, and H. pylori should be eradicated when present to reduce ulcer risk [^111X1Brb] [^111NgZ4Y] [^117SeGfL].

> Now, let me synthesize a management approach when anemia is present. First, confirm iron-deficiency anemia with ferritin, transferrin saturation, and reticulocyte count; if IDA is confirmed, stop or switch the NSAID when feasible, initiate iron replacement, and pursue GI evaluation to localize bleeding, starting with upper and lower endoscopy and proceeding to capsule endoscopy if the source remains obscure, because NSAID enteropathy/colopathy may be the culprit even without upper GI symptoms [^115nNc4m] [^114j9KAe] [^111MxU9e].

> But wait, what if the patient absolutely requires ongoing NSAID therapy. In that case, I should confirm the indication and consider switching to a COX‑2 inhibitor, ensure gastroprotection with a PPI when appropriate, correct iron deficiency, and monitor hemoglobin closely; if anemia recurs or remains refractory, I should double-check for ongoing occult bleeding and revisit the risk–benefit discussion, as continued NSAID exposure may not be tenable in some cases [^111X1Brb] [^111mQieS].

> I should also consider special populations. In sickle cell disease, guidelines allow short NSAID courses for acute pain with careful renal, GI, and bleeding risk assessment, and emphasize patient education and monitoring; in perioperative or procedural settings, NSAID use adds bleeding risk and should be individualized, with attention to antithrombotic regimens and patient-specific risk factors; in older adults, under-recognition of occult bleeding is common, so a lower threshold for evaluation is prudent [^115AKntP] [^116kWVB5] [^116U1dBM] [^114NGUtP].

> Hold on, I should verify the controversies and conflicting data so I don't overstate certainty. Some case–control data from primary care do not show an association between prescribed NSAIDs and incident IDA, possibly due to underascertainment of over-the-counter NSAID use and confounding by indication; conversely, randomized and label data consistently show hemoglobin declines and anemia signals with NSAIDs, particularly at higher doses and with nonselective agents, so the balance of evidence supports a causal contribution via GI blood loss, with magnitude modulated by dose, duration, and patient risk [^112E4S5d] [^111wUYPh] [^111mQieS] [^113VPZPm].

> In summary, NSAIDs can cause anemia through occult GI bleeding (including small-bowel and colonic sources), hemodilution, and possible direct erythropoietic effects; the risk is dose and duration dependent, higher with nonselective NSAIDs than COX‑2 inhibitors, and amplified by age, comorbidities, and concomitant antithrombotics; practical steps include risk stratification, minimizing dose and duration, adding gastroprotection when indicated, and monitoring hemoglobin, with a low threshold to investigate unexplained iron-deficiency anemia using endoscopic evaluation of the entire GI tract when initial studies are unrevealing [^111NgZ4Y] [^111mQieS] [^111X1Brb] [^115nNc4m].

---

NSAIDs can cause anemia through **occult gastrointestinal bleeding** [^114pf772] and impaired platelet function [^113VPZPm], with risk rising with prolonged use, higher doses, older age, and comorbidities [^117Q34JV] [^111XtF2K]. Clinically significant anemia is common, especially in older adults and those with GI risk factors [^111XtF2K]. Management includes stopping the NSAID, correcting iron deficiency, and using gastroprotection (PPIs, H. pylori eradication, or COX-2 inhibitors) [^111LD3cx] [^117SeGfL] [^111XtF2K] [^111NgZ4Y]; **monitor hemoglobin** during long-term therapy and avoid NSAIDs in high-risk patients when possible [^112XKzhi] [^111X1Brb].

## Mechanisms of NSAID-induced anemia

NSAID-associated anemia arises from **three main mechanisms**:

- **Gastrointestinal blood loss**: NSAIDs cause mucosal injury throughout the GI tract [^111NgZ4Y], leading to occult bleeding and iron deficiency anemia [^114pf772].

- **Impaired platelet function**: NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation, increasing bleeding risk and worsening anemia [^113VPZPm].

- **Direct effects on erythropoiesis**: NSAIDs may suppress red cell production, though this is less well defined [^113VPZPm].

---

## Clinical evidence of NSAID-induced anemia

Multiple studies and reviews document **clinically significant anemia** with NSAIDs:

- **GI-REASONS trial**: Nonselective NSAIDs caused more clinically significant anemia (≥ 2 g/dL Hb drop) than celecoxib (2.9% vs 1.8%; RR 1.6) [^111mQieS].

- **Ibuprofen studies**: 17–23% of patients on high-dose ibuprofen had Hb drops ≥ 1 g/dL, with occult GI bleeding [^113VPZPm].

- **Low-dose aspirin**: Even 75–100 mg/day can cause occult bleeding and anemia, especially in older adults [^115SdPok].

---

## Risk factors for NSAID-induced anemia

Several factors increase the **risk of anemia** with NSAIDs:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults have higher risk due to GI vulnerability and comorbidities [^112BxH3V] |
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and prolonged use increase risk [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | GI ulcers, bleeding disorders, CKD, cardiovascular disease [^111X1Brb] |
| Concomitant medications | Anticoagulants, antiplatelets, SSRIs, corticosteroids [^notfound] |
| NSAID type | Nonselective NSAIDs carry higher risk than COX-2 inhibitors [^111mQieS] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

NSAID-induced anemia often presents insidiously with **fatigue, weakness, pallor, and dyspnea** [^notfound]. Diagnosis relies on CBC, iron studies, and stool occult blood testing [^notfound]; endoscopy may be needed to identify GI lesions [^115nNc4m].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management includes:

- **Discontinuation or substitution**: Stop or switch to safer alternatives (acetaminophen, COX-2 inhibitors) [^111X1Brb].

- **Iron supplementation**: Treat iron deficiency with oral or IV iron [^notfound].

- **Gastroprotection**: Use PPIs, eradicate H. pylori, and consider misoprostol [^111NgZ4Y].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly check Hb/Hct in long-term NSAID users [^112XKzhi].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **risk stratification**, using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest duration, and gastroprotection (PPIs, H. pylori eradication, COX-2 inhibitors) in high-risk patients [^111X1Brb] [^111NgZ4Y].

---

NSAIDs can cause anemia through GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, and possible suppression of erythropoiesis, with risk influenced by age, dose, duration, comorbidities, and co-medications. Management centers on stopping the NSAID, correcting iron deficiency, and using gastroprotection; **prevention requires risk assessment, dose minimization, and protective strategies** [^111XtF2K] [^111mQieS].

### Is there an association between low dose aspirin and anemia (without overt bleeding)? Narrative review [^115vwW7F]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

It is not clear whether there is a clinically significant effect of LDA on Hb in adults in the absence of overt bleeding, but the limited evidence available at present cannot rule this out and suggests that it may be a problem in older people, or a subset of them. This is an important issue because of the expanding use of LDA by older people and the associations between anemia and impaired function and quality of life, morbidity and mortality.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^113UJ5gz]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The similar prevalence found in studies published before and after 2000 suggests that significant advances in identifying and/or treating anaemia in older people have not been made in recent years. It is estimated that for between 14% and 50% of cases of anaemia in the elderly, the underlying cause is unexplained. We know little about whether it is preventable, or how much is associated with medications for other medical conditions of older age, except for NSAIDs and perhaps low dose aspirin. There does not appear to be an extensive literature on therapy, and whether therapy improves quality of life and outcomes in older people.

We, as others before, find the limitations of the literature, especially the small number of larger studies in defined communities with defined criteria, limit any methodological considerations without the danger of over analysis. To some extent the unanswered questions are more interesting than those that can be answered – for example about the causes, health and economic consequences, and treatment of anaemia in older people, and the desirability or otherwise of using different action levels than the WHO definitions of anaemia. While the usual call for more research is often rather lame, in this case the extraordinary expected growth in the numbers of older people, coupled with the high prevalence and potentially serious consequences of anaemia, suggest that in this case more research is a sensible conclusion.

### Is there an association between low dose aspirin and anemia (without overt bleeding)? Narrative review [^115SdPok]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Overt bleeding associated with low dose aspirin (LDA) is well-recognized, little attention is given to the possibility of association between LDA and occult bleeding, although this is known to occur in healthy volunteers. LDA is used increasingly in primary and secondary prevention of a number of medical conditions, many of which are common in older people, as is anemia. Anemia in older people is associated with adverse outcomes including disability, morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to review the evidence that LDA might cause anemia without overt bleeding.

Methods

An extensive narrative review was carried out. Electronic searching (including database links) and reference lists of reports were used to identify studies reporting on use of aspirin ≤ 325 mg/day and anemia or change in hemoglobin (Hb) without overt bleeding. Data were extracted from reports of trials, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and prevalence studies of adults aged ≥ 18 years, published since 1980.

Results

There are few relevant data, with considerable heterogeneity among trial designs, duration, and patient characteristics in studies of LDA. In five randomised trials (n = 5879) in (mostly secondary) prevention, the majority of patients were men without peptic ulcer disease aged 50–70 years and no consistent association between LDA and change in Hb was found. In two smaller studies (n = 609) of primary prevention in healthy patients aged ≥ 70 years, there was a small but statistically significant fall in Hb with LDA. Observational studies, and data from trials in which use of LDA was not a primary focus of the study, were inconclusive.

Conclusions

It is not clear whether there is an association between LDA and anemia in the absence of overt bleeding, but there may be an association between LDA and fall in Hb in (a subset of) older patients. The available evidence has significant limitations, which are discussed; studies including more older patients, and publication of individual patient data, would help clarify this important matter.

### Is there an association between low dose aspirin and anemia (without overt bleeding)? Narrative review [^1169dxLp]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The most striking observation is that there is so little relevant information on possible covert effects on Hb with such a commonly prescribed drug as aspirin, despite its well-known propensity to cause significant overt gastrointestinal bleeds in some patients. We are aware of the difficulties in identifying all relevant data, (particularly from studies other than trials of LDA in which change in Hb was a primary outcome) but, given the small amount of such trial data available, feel that it is appropriate to present the additional data that we have found, despite their potential limitations. The relevant available data (from a wide range of types of study and outcomes) show no consistent association between LDA and anemia. While some studies indicated that Hb levels were reduced with LDA, others showed no change, or even suggested a higher Hb level. Anemia, however defined, was not consistently associated with aspirin use. We believe that there are a number of factors relevant both to the lack of data, and to the interpretation of what data are available.

The limited trial evidence shows that there is either no effect of LDA on mean Hb, or a very small effect but with considerable variability compared to the effect size. However the trial data should be interpreted with caution; there is considerable clinical heterogeneity among the studies (indication for LDA, dose of LDA, age of participants, duration of trial, data collected, exclusions, and co-morbidities), making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the effect of LDA on Hb in the absence of overt bleeding. The majority of trial data comes from men aged 50–70 years with cardio- and/or cerebrovascular disease, including a high proportion of smokers. There are very small amounts of trial data on LDA and Hb in primary prevention in healthy older patients, and it is not reassuring to find that the trial evidence available suggests that in these patients LDA is associated with a fall in Hb, at least when taken for one year. We lack information on other groups, in particular on secondary prevention in older people, whether fit or frail. Conditions where LDA prescription may be appropriate are common in older people and many clinicians will recognize the common scenario of having to decide on prescribing LDA for secondary prevention in a mildly anemic elderly patient.

Any study that might have contributed was obtained in full and read. For inclusion, the only criterion was that of full publication; abstracts or posters were not accepted. Formal quality scoring of included studies was not considered feasible because of the likely mix of systematic reviews, randomised trials, and observational studies. Because of the problems in searching for data on events that were often not considered as primary, secondary or even adverse event outcomes, and the enormous number of reports that could potentially contain relevant data, we did not feel able to call this review systematic. We consider it to be an extensive narrative review. There was no pooling of data; no statistical methods were planned, and none used.

Prevalence studies- data from secondary care

Several studies of patients referred to secondary care for assessment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) have reported aspirin use as a patient characteristic; unfortunately none of these studies had assessment of a relationship between aspirin consumption and Hb/iron status as a primary outcome. Aspirin was taken by 25–29% of patients who had no symptoms that suggested a cause for IDA. In an audit of patients referred with IDA, 24% were taking aspirin, but in a subgroup (53%) in which no cause of IDA was found, 41% were taking aspirin, while the prevalence of regular aspirin prescription among patients of similar age in the same catchment area as those referred for investigation of IDA was 11%. Although these are very small studies with limited information reported on indications for aspirin prescription, aspirin dosage, duration of consumption, co-morbidities and other possibly relevant medication (such as NSAIDs), it is likely that the patients in all these studies took aspirin for prophylaxis rather than as analgesics.

In a more recent prospective study of investigation of IDA in patients admitted as inpatients to general medical services (apart from admissions for acute GI bleeds), mean Hb and prevalence of LDA prescription were reported with other related data. There was no information on prevalence of LDA prescribing in the catchment area from which the hospital received its acute admissions.

Much used for over a century, in the last twenty years aspirin has been prescribed for many new indications, and at progressively smaller doses. Because of this history, its current use has not been assessed with the rigor of contemporary criteria necessary for licensing a new drug. Perhaps familiarity has bred complacency over associated ADRs. ADRs are difficult to study, are often incompletely reported, and reports of ADRs may not be readily found in databases. It is particularly hard to identify ADRs where the event rate is low and the background rate is not known, and even harder where the ADRs are not clinically obvious. Acute gastrointestinal bleeds severe enough to require hospital admission are, of course, obvious (and relatively easy to count). A gradual fall in Hb or recurrent small bleeds over a long period might not be obvious to the patient or to health professionals, as the effects can be subtle and non-specific (such as increased tiredness) or indirect (for instance worse prognosis in CHF). Development of anemia may well be, by nature, insidious and difficult to identify without serial blood sampling. And LDA might affect Hb other than by causing bleeding from the GI tract (for instance, it has been suggested that LDA might act as an anti-inflammatory drug, tending to increase Hb). Individuals might well differ in their susceptibility to such effects. A clinically significant effect in a small subgroup of patients may not be readily apparent from inspection of mean values for the group as a whole. If, say, LDA caused occult bleeding in a subgroup of 5% of patients such that their Hb fell by 20 g/L and the remaining 95% had no change in Hb, the mean change for the group as a whole would only be 1 g/L.

Exclusions, withdrawals from trials, and compliance issues may have had an important impact on the results. The trial data largely precede the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy; patients with a history of peptic ulcer were excluded from trials of LDA, and the results of these trials may not be readily applicable to patients who take PPI drugs with LDA. There is little formal reporting of reasons for withdrawal from these trials (except where withdrawal occurred because a pre-determined end-point was reached, such as a cardio- or cerebrovascular event in trials where LDA was used for secondary prevention), but aspirin intolerance associated with upper gastro-intestinal symptoms is common. If such symptoms are associated in some patients with occult bleeding sufficient to cause a fall in Hb, there is potential for bias in trial results if affected participants withdraw from a trial. There might be similar bias with (lack of) compliance with LDA. A large Scottish study of patients (mostly aged 60 or more) showed that compliance at a year was less than 50%.

Many patients taking LDA have co-morbidities which themselves may be relevant to the development of anemia (chronic heart failure would be one example). Such co-morbidities, and drugs used to treat them, make it more difficult to identify effects on Hb specific to LDA. In particular, not all studies indicated whether patients taking NSAIDs were excluded, and possible effects of even short term or intermittent NSAID use in a longer-term study are difficult to evaluate.

In studies where Hb is recorded during acute illness, the timing of blood sampling can be critical because Hb can vary during acute illness. This phenomenon is relevant to trials on LDA in secondary prevention where baseline Hb data were used, and similarly in trials on other drugs or interventions where data on Hb and prevalence of LDA use were reported as baseline characteristics. Moreover, there are also potentially significant diurnal and day-to-day changes in Hb and Hct.

Note added in proof

Since the revised, peer reviewed version of this paper was submitted, another observational study has been published (Al-Azzam SI, AlMahasneh F, Mhaidat N, Alzoubi KH, Khader YS: Prophylactic use of aspirin does not induce anaemia among adults. J Clin Pharm Ther 2010, 35:415–419.) The results of this study are consistent with those of some other observational studies which are included in the review, and do not affect our conclusions.

Good practice statement — NSAID safety in SCD advises that it is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, because long-term safety data for SCD are lacking, but vascular, bleeding, and renal risks may be elevated.

### Is there an association between low dose aspirin and anemia (without overt bleeding)? Narrative review [^1149w6CS]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

In two smaller studies, enteric coated (ec) aspirin 100 mg was prescribed for primary prevention of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease in 609 patients aged 70 or older, with similar numbers of men and women. Patients included in these two studies had similar mean baseline Hb (142 and 140 g/L respectively), were in good general health, and 24% and 44% were current or ex-smokers. In both of these studies there was a statistically significant fall in Hb at one year compared with baseline in the LDA arms of the trials, but not in the placebo groups; there were also statistically significant differences in Hb between LDA and placebo groups at one year in both studies. One study reported the percentage of patients in whom Hb fell by 10 g/L or more, and here too there was a statistically significant difference between the LDA and placebo groups, although there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the percentage of patients with any fall in Hb over one year.

2. Anemia or change in Hb reported as an ADR

Relevant adverse event data (fall in Hb or Hct, or anemia) were available from several studies in which LDA at doses of 75–325 mg daily was used. There was considerable heterogeneity among the study designs. The timing of adverse events was not reported and where anemia was reported, the criteria for diagnosis were not stated explicitly. Study details and results are shown in Additional file 3 (Additional file 3: ADR data: LDA as either primary treatment or as comparator drug).

The prevalence of relevant adverse events ranged between 0% and 4.4%. In one study anemia (defined using a probable criterion of only Hb < 90 g/L) occurred less frequently in patients taking LDA at a dose of less than 162 mg daily than in those taking LDA 162–325 mg daily, 70 patients (3.0%) versus 97 patients (4.4%) (p = 0.011).

3. Prevalence studies

We found data on prevalence of LDA prescribing and anemia (or Hb levels) in three studies in community settings, noted as patient characteristics in three studies of treatment of cardiovascular disease in older patients, and in four studies in secondary care in patients considered for investigation of anemia. The majority of the data were from older patients. Study details and results are shown in Additional file 4 (Additional file 4: Prevalence data: LDA use in various settings).

### Aspirin prophylaxis and the prevalence of anaemia [^114RBZW1]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia and vascular disease are both common amongst the elderly and frequently co-exist. Whilst a consensus exists concerning the benefits of low-dose aspirin in reducing risk from atheromatous disease, nonetheless concerns arise in view of its harmful effect on gastric mucosa and its influence upon haemostasis, with the possibility of subsequent gastrointestinal bleeding. This study examined the relationship between chronic low-dose aspirin therapy and the presence of anaemia.

Setting

A cross-sectional study of a representative cohort of 464 community-dwelling subjects aged 77 years.

Methods

Subjects underwent comprehensive assessment of psychosocial, functional, medical and laboratory variables. In accordance with the World Health Organization criteria, anaemia was defined as less than 13 g/dl for men and 12 g/dl for women.

Results

Chronic low-dose aspirin use was found amongst 29% of the 227 women and 38% of the 237 males (P = 0.026). Aspirin use was significantly associated with hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Anaemia was 42% less common among aspirin users, a statistically robust finding (OR 2.44, 95%CI 1.28–4.66) according to logistic regression analysis which included the confounding variables of gender, education, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, peptic diseases, antipeptic therapy and smoking. Similarly, no association was observed between aspirin use and reduced serum iron or iron saturation, reduced mean corpuscular haemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume.

Conclusions

Chronic low-dose aspirin use amongst an elderly cohort was associated with increased likelihood of normal haemoglobin.

### Role of prescribed medication in the development of iron deficiency anaemia in adults-a case-control study [^115FN6w5]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The literature in this area is however limited, with a Medline search yielding rather conflicting evidence regarding the relevance of therapy with anticoagulants, antiplatelet agentsand PPIsto the pathogenesis of IDA. There is little published evidence either way for non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and antidepressants. As a result, there is no clear guidance — and further research evidence is required to allow a comprehensive systematic review of this important topic.

The primary aim of the current study was to assess for an association between long-term exposure to specific prescribed medications and presentation with IDA in a large study of unmatched case–control design, looking specifically at the five drug groups discussed above. While demonstration of an association does not of course prove causation, the absence of one makes causation much less likely. The secondary aim of the study was to determine whether any associations identified were mediated by subgroups with or without an underlying haemorrhagic lesion (HL) of the GI tract.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^115vfRkF]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapy for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — For adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^111NgZ4Y]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Scarpignato et al. used a modified Delphi approach to gauge levels of agreement and opinions on the level of evidence for nine statements about various aspects of NSAID use. These ranged from efficacy for pain relief, a comparison of GI risks with different NSAIDs, to a comparison of the CV risks with different NSAIDS. The panel was an international multidisciplinary group. It is perhaps a pity that their meeting was now more than three years ago, but the authors updated their literature search in the interval for this publication. The result is a helpful distillation of expert opinion on the areas covered. This commentary will focus on two aspects. Firstly, the consensus statement looks more comprehensively than others at the GI risks of NSAIDS from top to bottom of the GI tract. While the life threatening complications of NSAIDS (including low-dose aspirin) arise mainly from ulcers in the stomach and duodenum, it is increasingly recognized that small intestinal ulceration is also common as one cause of iron-deficiency anemia in NSAID users and, occasionally, of frank GI hemorrhage. Looking at GI risk in its totality, statement 4 from the consensus conference reads in part: ' NSAID use is associated with increased risk of adverse events throughout the entire GI tract'. The levels of agreement and of supporting evidence were both high. There is good evidence, summarized in the consensus paper, that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) substantially reduce the risk of upper GI ulceration and complications of both nsNSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. However, it is not surprising that current evidence (rated level B by the conference) indicates that PPIs do not protect against ulceration in the near neutral pH milieu of the small intestine and colon.

Regarding medical management for sickle cell disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute complications, vaso-occlusive crisis, NHLBI 2014 guidelines recommend to continue managing with NSAIDs in adults and children with a vasoocclusive crisis associated with mild-to-moderate pain in those who report relief with NSAIDs in the absence of contraindications.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^116kWVB5]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Recommendation 2a — nonopioid pharmacological therapies for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain states that for adults and children with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of NSAIDs in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks specify that NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective COX inhibitors; that patient-specific assessment of harms, including renal, vascular, and gastrointestinal toxicity, anticoagulation requirements, and cardiovascular disease, will help identify patients who are appropriate for NSAID therapy and tailor the selection of the drug/class of NSAID; and that patients specifically at increased risk of renal toxicity need to be identified and, if comorbidities such as peptic ulcer disease, renal dysfunction, or full-dose anticoagulation are significant risk factors, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^111SKeYC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Hematologic Effect

Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including
ketorolac tromethamine. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI
blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on
long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, should have
their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of
anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong
bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet
function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients
receiving ketorolac tromethamine who may be adversely affected by alterations in
platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients
receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ketorolac tromethamine
should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and
should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

Ketorolac tromethamine is a potent NSAID and may cause serious
side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney failure, which may
result in hospitalization and even fatal outcome.

### Naproxen (Ec-naproxen) [^112XKzhi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Hematologic Toxicity

Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.

NSAIDs, including NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever

The pharmacological activity of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.

5.14 Long-Term Use and Laboratory Monitoring

Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodica ly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)].

Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically.

Because of adverse eye findings in animal studies with drugs of this class, it is recommended that ophthalmic studies be carried out if any change or disturbance in vision occurs.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### The hidden burden of anemia in elderly surgical patients: a prospective study on incidence and contributing factors [^116AgNDF]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia was nearly ten times more likely to develop in patients who experienced intraoperative blood loss exceeding 500 mL (AOR: 9.8, 95% CI: 3.2–29.6, p < 0.001). Excessive perioperative bleeding significantly increased the risk of anemia, particularly in elderly patients with diminished physiological reserves. Common factors contributing to this include lower baseline hemoglobin levels, decreased bone marrow responsiveness, and poor erythropoietic recovery following severe blood loss. Furthermore, excessive intraoperative bleeding may exacerbate anemia by triggering inflammatory reactions. The implementation of blood conservation techniques, such as blood salvage during surgery, is crucial for mitigating this risk.

The use of multiple medications, or polypharmacy, was associated with a 4.8-fold higher risk of anemia (AOR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.3–11.9, p < 0.001). This finding aligns with studies from various countries that indicate polypharmacy is a significant factor in anemia among older surgical patients. The increased risk is primarily linked to medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), anticoagulants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can suppress bone marrow function, cause gastrointestinal bleeding, or impede iron absorption. Prolonged use of anticoagulants and NSAIDs raises the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially leading to iron deficiency anemia. Additionally, PPIs reduce stomach acid production, hindering the absorption of iron and vitamin B12, and are frequently prescribed to older individuals with GERD or peptic ulcers. Other medications, including antibiotics, chemotherapy agents, and certain antihypertensives, can also negatively affect bone marrow function, reducing red blood cell production. Given the strong association between polypharmacy and anemia, effective perioperative drug management is essential. Monitoring high-risk patients, assessing preoperative medications, and deprescribing unnecessary drugs can help reduce the risk of anemia.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis – a rheumatologist's perspective [^117PkrQF]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
Strategies to decrease cardiovascular and GI adverse events with NSAIDs or Cox-2 selective inhibitors. a American Heart Association Guidelines define patients at risk of CV events as 10-year risk of CV event ≥ 10%. b High risk indicates patients with previous ulcer bleed at estimated rate of UGI complications of > 28.8 cases per 100 patient years. Adapted from Lanas et al.

While the use of a proton pump inhibitor may reduce the risks of NSAID-related upper GI adverse events, this strategy is unlikely to have any impact on the risk of lower GI events. In view of the increased recognition of the latter events, and the evidence that the risk of such events is lower with Cox-2 selective inhibitors than with non-selective NSAIDs, there is a case for the use of Cox-2 selective inhibitors in preference to non-selective NSAIDs in patients at risk of lower GI events. However, this raises the question of how such patients can be identified; as noted above, the presence of anaemia may be a key factor in identifying lower GI bleeding in NSAID-treated patients. The introduction of a novel end-point named Clinically Significant Upper and/or Lower GI Events (CSULGIEs) captures adverse events throughout the entire length of the GI tract, and may provide important information on the NSAID-related risk of lower GI events.

### A novel composite endpoint to evaluate the gastrointestinal (GI) effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs through the entire GI tract [^113EqFdE]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) not only cause damage to the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract but also affect the lower GI tract. To date, there is no endpoint that evaluates serious GI events in the entire GI tract. The objective of this report is to introduce a novel composite endpoint that measures damage to the entire GI tract - clinically significant upper and lower GI events (CSULGIE) - in patients with NSAID-induced GI damage.

Methods

We reviewed the data from largescale, multicenter, randomized, clinical trials on lower GI toxicity associated with NSAID use. The rationale for using CSULGIE as a primary endpoint in 2 ongoing trials - the Celecoxib vs Omeprazole and Diclofenac for At-risk Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Patients (CONDOR) trial and the Gastrointestinal Randomized Events and Safety Open-Label NSAID Study (GI-REASONS) - is also discussed.

Results

Previous randomized trials focused primarily on damage to the upper GI tract and often neglected the lower GI tract. The CSULGIE endpoint extends the traditional "perforation, obstruction, and bleeding" assessment of upper GI complications by including events in the lower GI tract (small/large bowel) such as perforation, bleeding, and clinically significant anemia.

Conclusion

By providing clinicians with a new, descriptive language for adverse events through the entire GI tract, the CSULGIE endpoint has the potential to become a standard tool for evaluating the GI effects of a range of therapies.

5.15 Photosensitivity

Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using diclofenac sodium topical gel. If patients need to be outdoors while using diclofenac sodium topical gel, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. Advise patients to discontinue treatment with diclofenac sodium topical gel at the first evidence of sunburn.

5.16 Exposure to Eyes and Mucosal Membranes

Avoid contact of diclofenac sodium topical gel with eyes and mucosa. Advise patients that if contact in the eye, or mucosal membranes occurs, immediately wash out the eye or mucosal membranes with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour.

5.17 Oral Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

Concomitant use of oral and topical NSAIDs may result in a higher rate of hemorrhage, more frequent abnormal creatinine, urea and hemoglobin. Do not use diclofenac sodium topical gel in combination with an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and periodic laboratory evaluations are conducted.

### Burden of anemia in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in French secondary care [^117ALFTi]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions are a significant public health issue, and are estimated to affect more than 21% of adults. Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a major cause of disability and presents a significant burden to health care providers. In approximately 10% of the world's population aged 60 years or more, OA-related joint pathology causes significant clinical problems. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is less prevalent but is associated with high medical expenses because of the requirement for continuous treatment to slow disease progression, and a high incidence of joint replacements. Hospitalization represents a significant component of the costs associated with arthritis.

Anemia, defined by the World Health Organization as a hemoglobin concentration below 12 g/dl in women and 13 g/dl in men, is common in people with arthritis. Anemia is associated with increased morbidity, length of hospitalization, and cost of care delivery. In RA, it is estimated that 30–60% of patients are anemic. One of the most frequent causes of anemia in RA patients is "iron deficiency anemia", which can result from gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. "Anemia of chronic disease", which does not usually respond to iron supplementation, is another major cause of anemia in patients with RA. In a study of 225 patients with RA, anemia of chronic disease accounted for 77% and iron deficiency anemia for 23% of observed anemia. There are few data on the prevalence of anemia in patients with OA, although the prevalence of both conditions is known to increase with age. Sex also appears to influence disease prevalence; OA appears to affect more women than men, while current estimates suggest that women are up to three times more likely to develop RA than men. Women are also at a greater risk of becoming anemic than men, particularly during menstruation or pregnancy, when iron requirements are increased.

### Identifying and assessing benefit-risk in primary care – a family physician's perspective [^114pf772]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

GI haemorrhage related to NSAID use is often occult. Thus, treating physicians and patients cannot be reassured by lack of abdominal symptoms. Although bleeding may be acute and catastrophic, it is more likely to be indolent and subtle, often resulting in a picture of iron deficiency anaemia. Furthermore, the onset of bleeding from NSAID-related GI damage can occur with even short duration therapy. Both of these factors are clinically relevant — patients are still at risk despite short course NSAID therapy, with no overt GI symptoms. GI risk assessment should be independent of duration of therapy or assumed tolerance.

The introduction of the selective Cox-2 inhibitors marked an important breakthrough in patient safety. This class of medications was found to be associated with less GI toxicity but similar efficacy to tNSAIDs. The use of this new class of medications became widespread with early guidelines urging their use as first line for patients who were at high risk of GI complications from tNSAIDs.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Sprix) [^117VK7pd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.12 Hematologic Toxicity

Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with SPRIX has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. Do not use SPRIX in patients for whom hemostasis is critical [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)].

NSAIDs, including SPRIX, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

The concurrent use of ketorolac and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans, has not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only with extreme caution. Monitor patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis closely.

In clinical trials, serious adverse events related to bleeding were more common in patients treated with SPRIX than placebo. In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience with ketorolac IV and IM dosing, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with peri-operative use. Therefore, use SPRIX with caution in the postoperative setting when hemostasis is critical.

5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever

The pharmacological activity of SPRIX in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.

### Ibuprofen [^113VPZPm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hematological effects

Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.

In two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreased hemoglobin level was greater than previously reported. Decrease in hemoglobin of 1 gram or more was observed in 17.1% of 193 patients on 1600 mg ibuprofen daily (osteoarthritis), and in 22.8% of 189 patients taking 2400 mg of ibuprofen daily (rheumatoid arthritis). Positive stool occult blood tests and elevated serum creatinine levels were also observed in these studies.

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.

Patients receiving ibuprofen tablets who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants should be carefully monitored.

Preexisting asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ibuprofen tablets should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

Ophthalmological effects

Blurred and/or diminished vision, scotomata, and/or changes in color vision have been reported. If a patient develops such complaints while receiving ibuprofen tablets, the drug should be discontinued, and the patient should have an ophthalmologic examination which includes central visual fields and color vision testing.

Aseptic Meningitis

Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed on rare occasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on ibuprofen tablets, the possibility of its being related to ibuprofen tablets should be considered.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^111ZjBs5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

GI safety was investigated in the PRECISION trial, which had clinically significant GI events as a secondary outcome and iron-deficiency anemia of GI origin as a tertiary outcome.GI outcomes for the on-treatment population showed that among the three agents studied (celecoxib, naproxen, and ibuprofen), significantly fewer clinically significant GI events occurred in the celecoxib group. Similarly, there was a lower incidence of anemia in celecoxib recipients compared with those receiving ns-NSAIDs.

In the CONCERN study on arthritis patients with both high GI and high CV risk, the cumulative incidence of recurrent upper-GI-tract bleeding (the primary end point) was 5.6% in the celecoxib group compared with 12.3% in the naproxen group (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23–0.82; P = 0.01), and no treatment-related deaths occurred. On the basis of their findings, the authors suggested that naproxen be avoided in high-GI/high-CV-risk patients, "despite its perceived cardiovascular safety".

### Ibuprofen oral (ibuprofen) [^1112Nmk9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Ibuprofen cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of ibuprofen in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Hepatic Effects

Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ibuprofen. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), ibuprofen should be discontinued.

Hematological Effects

Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ibuprofen. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.

### To bleed or not to bleed: observing risk of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and oral anticoagulant use after venous thromboembolism [^1119yzfS]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The evidence to date on NSAIDs with oral anticoagulants is conflicting with some studies showing increased bleeding risk, whereas others show no significant difference. Until recently, much of this information revolved around vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) with little data to guide practice decisions for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). A 2023 systematic review of 27 studies representing > 1.1 million patients concluded that NSAIDs increased all bleed risk with odds ratio of 1.5 for DOACs and 2.2 for VKAs, respectively. However, there was marked heterogeneity of the included studies and the vast majority of these were designed to investigate other primary objectives.

Thus, to better elucidate the effects of NSAIDs in VTE patients on anticoagulation, Petersen et alcompleted an elegant cohort study using the Danish National Health Service registry. The registry included 51,794 patients initiated on oral anticoagulants (37,991 on DOACs, 13,789 on VKAs) for VTE between 2012 and 2022 with information on NSAID use and bleeding. Adjusted hazard ratio for combined NSAID use was 2.09. Among the NSAIDs investigated, ibuprofen had the lowest adjusted hazard ratio of 1.79 compared with 3.30 for diclofenac and 4.10 for naproxen. DOACs combined with NSAIDs showed a higher adjusted hazard ratio of 2.27 compared with that of 1.79 for VKAs. Adjusted hazard ratios for rivaroxaban and apixaban were nearly identical, while data were inconclusive for dabigatran and edoxaban due to their limited use. Notably, the adjusted hazard ratios with NSAID use was elevated not just for gastrointestinal bleeding at 2.24, but also for all bleeding, including intracranial (3.22), thoracic and respiratory tract (1.36), urinary tract (1.57), and anemia (2.99). Overall, the results showed that concurrent NSAID use slightly increased bleed risk for both DOACs and VKAs.

These results are consistent with previous findings showing that adding NSAIDs to oral anticoagulants can increase bleed risk. This finding aligns with our pathophysiological understanding of the effects of NSAIDs, and this study reminds us to use NSAIDs with caution and that ibuprofen may be the preferred choice when needed at the minimal effective dose as risk is dose-dependent. Although concomitant proton pump inhibitor use may be protective, it is important to recognize that bleed risk is not limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Additional research on specific DOAC and NSAID combinations regarding safety may be beneficial for guiding therapy choices.

### Aging, the gastrointestinal tract, and risk of acid-related disease [^112BxH3V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

It is estimated that by 2020, > 16% of people in the United States will be ≥ 65 years of age and that nearly 20 million will be > 85 years of age. Aging imparts a variety of physiologic changes in the oropharynx, esophagus, and stomach that increase the risk for esophageal and gastrointestinal disorders. Older individuals also tend to have a higher prevalence of comorbid factors, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, presence of other diseases, or use of medications (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) that increase their risk for acid-related disorders. Given these physiologic and comorbidity factors, the elderly are at higher risk for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pill-induced esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and complications related to the use of NSAIDs. Unfortunately, in the elderly patient with these disorders — even those with severe disease or complications — symptom presentation may be subtle or atypical, resulting in a delayed diagnosis. Endoscopy remains the "gold standard" for the identification of mucosal disease and should be performed in all patients with "new-onset" or persistent symptoms who are > 45 years of age, as well as in individuals of any age who present with alarm symptoms, such as weight loss, vomiting, anemia, dysphagia, or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. In general, the treatment of older individuals with peptic ulcer or GERD and its complications is similar to that of younger individuals. Proton pump inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy for symptom relief, healing of erosive esophagitis, resolution of peptic ulceration, reduction of the risk for NSAID-induced mucosal damage, and prevention of disease recurrence.

### Diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium extended-release) [^112YaHnN]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

General

Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium extended-release in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Hematological Effects

Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving diclofenac sodium extended-release who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.

Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium extended-release should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. In patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release, the CBC and a chemistry profile (including transaminase levels) should be checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, diclofenac sodium extended-release should be discontinued.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^117SeGfL]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In the context of all NSAID therapy, H. pylori infection increases the risk of ulceration and bleeding, and its eradication prior to commencing long-term antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce GI risk. The risk of GI toxicity increases at high NSAID doses, but even at standard doses the risks are not negligible: the CLASS study showed that the risk of upper GI ulceration was higher for standard doses of ibuprofen or diclofenac compared with celecoxib administered at doses greater than those indicated clinically. In addition to antiplatelet therapy, GI risk is increased with concomitant use of corticosteroids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

Appropriate assessment of patient GI risk includes age, prior GI ulceration or bleeding, use of gastroprotective agents, and use of corticosteroids and other medications. In addition to assessment, the risk of GI toxicity with NSAID use can be mitigated through regular monitoring to facilitate the early detection of injury and appropriate treatment. Hemoglobin levels can be used as an indicator of GI injury, with low hemoglobin and hematocrit attributable to blood loss in the absence of other potential causes. A drop in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL is a well-recognized surrogate endpoint for investigating NSAID-associated GI toxicity in clinical trials.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111XtF2K]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with a history of renal impairment, congestive heart failure, elevated BP and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, or the presence of unexplained anemia, consider a complete blood count and assessment of renal function prior to initiating an NSAID.

Patients at high risk of NSAID-associated adverse events may be stratified according to GI, CV and renal risk. Patients considered to be at high GI risk are those with age greater than 65 years, use of high-dose NSAIDs, history of peptic ulcer and related complications, and concurrent use of aspirin, anti-platelet therapy or anti-coagulant therapy (and especially patients receiving double anti-platelet therapy). Patients at high CV risk are those with a history of acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous/surgical coronary revascularization, stable angina and angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery stenosis, a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, documented significant carotid artery stenosis, or congestive heart failure. Patients at high renal risk are those with age greater than 75 years, impaired renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min, and concomitant administration of an antihypertensive from any of the diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) classes. Analgesics such as paracetamol, tramadol or codeine may be used in place of NSAIDs if the risks of NSAID treatment outweigh the potential benefits. However, the efficacy, availability and potential adverse effects of these alternatives also need to be considered in any decision-making regarding appropriate analgesia.

Choice of NSAIDs

All oral nonselective NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors have analgesic effects of a similar magnitude, but differences may exist among individual drugs in terms of potential GI, CV, renal or liver toxicities.

This statement was a point of contention among the group and represents a compromise from the original statement, which was formulated as: GI protective therapies are generally inadequate or inappropriate in NSAID users. Consensus was not formed for this statement, necessitating rephrasing of the statement to the above wording (Level of agreement: strongly agree, 21%; agree, 43%; consensus, 64% [not reached]). In line with the revision, the group agreed that GI protective therapies (eg, PPIs) benefit patients who require an NSAID and who have a moderate to high risk for upper GI complications. There is little or no evidence to support any protection against lower GI side effects.

Regular monitoring

In a European survey investigating primary-care physician behavior and understanding, it was found that only half of the doctors measured their osteoarthritis patients' hemoglobin routinely as part of a complete blood count. Although GI-injury prophylaxis is important, regular monitoring is still essential to allow early detection of injury so that treatment can be administered, and also to prevent development of complications. Hemoglobin levels can be used as an indicator of GI injury; low hemoglobin and hematocrit are attributable to blood loss in the absence of other evident causes. The CONDOR trial, which looked at both upper- and lower-GI events, also investigated the frequency of clinically significant blood loss measured by decreases ≥ 2 g/dL in hemoglobin throughout the GI tract. A drop in hemoglobin ≥ 2g/dL has been well recognized as a surrogate end point in clinical trials investigating the GI toxicity of NSAIDs conducted over the last 20 years.–

### Efficacy, tolerability, and safety of an oral enzyme combination vs diclofenac in osteoarthritis of the knee: results of an individual patient-level pooled reanalysis of data from six randomized controlled trials [^112S9yMo]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

The DIC-associated observation of a decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte count may be explained as laboratory correlates of treatment-related mucosal lesions of the intestine and subsequent blood loss via the GI system. Prevalence and excess of changes were comparable to those reported by Roth and Fuller in their studies on DIC safety in OA. Subclinical GI blood loss is a common consequence of NSAID treatment, and predominantly is not caused by NSAID effects on the upper GI tract, but rather by topical side effects in the small intestine, where the enterohepatic circulation of NSAIDs increases their exposure toward the mucosal epithelium.–Proven consequences are silent mucosal inflammation, reduced blood flow, epithelial damage, mucosal injury, increased mucosal permeability, malabsorption, protein loss, and occult blood loss (with an associated decrease in hemoglobin), reported for more than 50% of patients on NSAIDs or low-dose aspirin.–The clinical significance of these NSAID-related TEAEs on the lower GI tract are poorly characterized compared to those of the upper tract; however, they must not be underestimated, as studies have reported a similar or even higher mortality for complications arising from the lower when compared with those of the upper GI tract. At present, effective means to prevent NSAID-related intestinal lesions are not available. Therefore, based on the currently available data, treatment with an equally effective but significantly better-tolerated agent, such as OEC, seems to be a reasonable alternative for OA patients who need anti-inflammatory therapy.

Bleeding risk modifiers for interventional techniques (Table 10) — factors associated with increased bleeding risk include advanced age (older than 75 years), frailty, anemia with hemoglobin (< 11.0 g/L), chronic renal failure, low body weight, hospitalization for bleeding within the past year, previous stroke/intracranial bleed, and regular need for NSAIDs or prednisone; thus, these risk scores change on an individual basis, and a clinician may update the risk based on medical and physiological factors.

### Celecoxib [^113A28GZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11 Fetal Toxicity

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including celecoxib, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.

If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit celecoxib use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if celecoxib treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue celecoxib if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.12 Hematological Toxicity

Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with celecoxib has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.

In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss.

NSAIDs, including celecoxib, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever

The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including VYSCOXA, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including VYSCOXA, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

Use of NSAIDs, including VYSCOXA, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

### Role of prescribed medication in the development of iron deficiency anaemia in adults-a case-control study [^112E4S5d]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Objective

To estimate the strength of association between exposure to selected classes of prescribed medications and the risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), specifically considering oral anticoagulants (OACs), antidepressants, antiplatelet agents, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

Design

A case–control study involving the analysis of community repeat prescriptions among subjects referred with IDA, and unmatched controls referred as gastroenterology fast-tracks for other indications. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to calculate ORs for the association between IDA presentation and each medication class, adjusted for age, sex and coprescribing. For those classes showing significance, it was also used to calculate risk differences between those in the IDA group with or without haemorrhagic lesions on investigation.

Results

A total of 1210 cases were analysed — 409 in the IDA group, and 801 in the control group. Significant associations were identified between presentation with IDA and long-term exposure to PPIs (OR 3.29, 95% CI: 2.47 to 4.41, p < 0.001) and to OACs (OR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.29 to 3.24, p = 0.002). IDA was not associated with long-term exposure to any of the other three drug classes. In contrast to the relationship with PPIs, the association with OACs was primarily in the IDA sub-group with haemorrhagic lesions.

Conclusion

Long-term exposure to PPIs and OACs are independently associated with the risk of developing IDA. There are grounds for considering that these associations may be causal, though the underlying mechanisms probably differ.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115nNc4m]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

1. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

2. IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia affects about a third of the global population and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Iron deficiency is one of the dominant causes, and the resulting anaemia (iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)) has a point prevalence of 2%–5% among adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world.

IDA is the most common form of anaemia seen in primary care in the UK. It is estimated to account for more than 57 000 emergency admissions to UK hospitals each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) more than £55 million per annum.

While menstrual loss is commonly the cause of IDA in premenopausal women, IDA in adult men and postmenopausal women is often due to chronic blood loss from the GI tract. IDA may be the first presenting manifestation of colonic or oesophago-gastric carcinoma, highlighting the importance of swift and complete investigation. There are however many other recognised causes of IDA (table 1) including malabsorption (most commonly from coeliac disease (CD) in the UK), poor dietary intake, blood donation, gastrectomy and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). IDA is often multifactorial, and dual pathology (ie, significant disease in both upper and lower GI tract) is found in 1%–10% of cases — this should be particularly considered in the older patient.

Table 1
Pathological disorders associated with iron deficiency anaemia

IDA may present in primary care, or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and historically the management of IDA was often suboptimal — with investigation being slow, inadequate or incomplete. Over recent years, however, the recognition that IDA may reflect serious underlying GI pathology has resulted in increasing involvement of gastroenterology services. IDA may now account for 10% or more of all gastroenterology referrals, and a typical district hospital unit in the UK with a catchment of 250 000 may have in excess of 400 IDA referrals per annum.

### Prasterone and ibuprofen (prastera) [^112yeZvc]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Hematological effects

Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.

In two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreased hemoglobin level was greater than previously reported. Decrease in hemoglobin of 1 gram or more was observed in 17.1%of 193 patients on 1600 mg ibuprofen daily (osteoarthritis), and in 22.8%of 189 patients taking 2400 mg of ibuprofen daily (rheumatoid arthritis). Positive stool occult blood tests and elevated serum creatinine levels were also observed in these studies.

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.

Patients receiving ibuprofen tablets who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants should be carefully monitored.

Preexisting asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ibuprofen tablets should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

Ophthalmological effects

Blurred and/or diminished vision, scotomata, and/or changes in color vision have been reported. If a patient develops such complaints while receiving ibuprofen tablets, the drug should be discontinued, and the patient should have an ophthalmologic examination which includes central visual fields and color vision testing.

Aseptic meningitis

Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed on rare occasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on ibuprofen tablets, the possibility of its being related to ibuprofen tablets should be considered.

### Factors involved in gastrointestinal bleeding in advanced cancer patients followed at home [^114nUPwx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

There is a lack of information on the frequency of symptomatic gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with advanced cancer. This group of patients presents several risk factors for developing gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this multicenter longitudinal survey was to assess the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding and possible factors implicated in advanced cancer patients followed at home. A consecutive sample of 439 patients who referred to home palliative care program entered the study. Age, gender, primary cancer and known metastases, possible associated pathologies, history of peptic disease, use of previous or actual nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids, drugs used to prevent gastric complications, the occurrence of hematemesis or melena, significant anemia requiring blood transfusion, and mortality associated with the hemorrhagic event were recorded. Of 377 patients who completed the study, 18 reported gastrointestinal bleeding, and five had significant anemia requiring blood transfusion in three cases. Death was found to be related to bleeding in three patients. NSAIDs, steroids, and gastroprotectors were frequently used, either before or during home care. However, no clear relationship between age, gender, and the use of offender drugs with gastrointestinal bleeding was found. Liver involvement was frequently associated with the risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Voltaren [^114Z5GQR]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Voltaren® Gel should not be applied to open skin wounds, infections, inflammations, or exfoliative dermatitis, as it may affect absorption and tolerability of the drug. Voltaren® Gel should not be allowed to come into contact with the eyes or with mucous membranes.

The effect of Voltaren® Gel under occlusive dressings has not been evaluated, and should be avoided.

5.9 Pregnancy

As with other NSAIDs, Voltaren® Gel should be avoided in late pregnancy, because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

5.10 Corticosteroid treatment

Voltaren® Gel cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced acute ulcers in the colon [^117UQKQe]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) colitis is a clinically significant disease, which may present with diarrhea, anemia, and nonspecific abdominal complaints. The definition of NSAID colitis is: endoscopy changes (not necessarily with formed diaphragm, capsule endoscopy not obligatory) plus history of taking NSAID on a regular basis or on demand basis plus clinical symptoms (sideropenic anemia, or diarrhea, or abdominal pain, or combination) plus histology that excludes malignancy, Crohn's disease or acute infection or histology that directly proves enhanced submucosal fibrosis (the latter is hard to document since the biopsies are usually obtained from the mucosa). NSAIDs may also cause acute damage and ulcers not only to the upper gastrointestinal tract but also to the small and large intestine. Careful history taking, together with awareness of endoscopic and histological findings, allows a timely diagnosis of this disease. The patient whose figure is presented herein (Fig. 1) was admitted because of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding after intake of only one capsule of niflumic acid. Bleeding subsided spontaneously and two days afterwards colonoscopy revealed acute small ulcers in the otherwise normal sigmoid colon. Further clinical work up resulted in established final diagnosis of NSAID-induced acute ulcers.

### Diclofenac sodium and capsaicin (capsinac) [^116wfrKQ]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.15 Inflammation

The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium topical solution in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

5.16 Hematological Effects

The effects of diclofenac sodium topical solution on platelet function were studied in 10 healthy subjects administered 80 drops four times a day for 7 days. There was no significant change in platelet aggregation following one week of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Check hemoglobin or hematocrit of patients on diclofenac sodium topical solution if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss.

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration and reversible. Carefully monitor patients receiving diclofenac sodium topical solution who may be adversely affected by alteration in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants.

5.17 Monitoring

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms in patients taking NSAIDs, monitor patients for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Check CBC and a chemistry profile periodically in patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs. Discontinue diclofenac sodium topical solution if abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular, renal or gastrointestinal comorbidities: joint APAGE / APLAR / APSDE / APSH / APSN / PoA recommendations [^111X1Brb]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications, but they are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney injury and GI complications.

Objective

To develop a set of multidisciplinary recommendations for the safe prescription of NSAIDs.

Methods

Randomised control trials and observational studies published before January 2018 were reviewed, with 329 papers included for the synthesis of evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Whenever possible, a NSAID should be avoided in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, high risk of cardiovascular disease and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Before treatment with a NSAID is started, blood pressure should be measured, unrecognised CKD should be screened in high risk cases, and unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be investigated. For patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen or celecoxib are preferred. For patients with a moderate risk of peptic ulcer disease, monotherapy with a non-selective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor should be used; for those with a high risk of peptic ulcer disease, a selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI are needed. For patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system blockers, empirical addition (or increase in the dose) of an antihypertensive agent of a different class should be considered. Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored in most cases.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are a valuable armamentarium in clinical medicine, but appropriate recognition of high-risk cases, selection of a specific agent, choice of ulcer prophylaxis and monitoring after therapy are necessary to minimise the risk of adverse events.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy as a major risk factor for small bowel bleeding: a retrospective study [^111MxU9e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is defined as persistent or recurrent bleeding of unknown origin despite repetitive diagnostic testing, including upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy. Small bowel (SB) bleeding accounts for 80% of obscure GI bleeding cases and 5% of all GI bleeding cases. Unexplained iron deficiency anemia (IDA) manifests in 30–40% of obscure GI bleeding cases. Capsule endoscopy is the first-line examination in cases of obscure GI bleeding and the third diagnostic test after negative upper and lower endoscopy results in cases of ongoing overt bleeding. Whereas angioectasia is the most common etiology of SB bleeding in Western countries, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced SB lesions are the major cause reported in Japanese studies.

NSAIDs are widely prescribed in most clinical conditions; however, it is well known that these drugs can cause GI complications. Although various studies have reported an association between NSAID intake and GI adverse effects, the role of NSAIDs in SB bleeding remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the frequency of NSAID-induced SB lesions in Korean patients with obscure GI bleeding, who underwent capsule endoscopy.

### Clinical implications of prostaglandin inhibition in the small bowel [^111LD3cx]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

NSAID-induced intestinal toxicity is more common than previously recognized and may have clinically significant sequelae, especially in elderly arthritic patients. Increased awareness of the potential intestinal complications associated with prostaglandin inhibition is required for early recognition and appropriate management. An increase in the level of suspicion by physicians may lead to earlier diagnosis and subsequent discontinuation of the offending NSAID; this is important in that discontinuation of the offending agent may be preferable to multiple endoscopic radiologic and surgical procedures in the patient with obscure blood loss and anemia. Appropriate diagnosis in selected patients may prevent the increased morbidity and mortality associated with small intestinal surgery. The emergence of selective COX-2 inhibitors likely will bring this issue to the forefront because it will become increasingly important to determine the effects of these agents on the small intestine and colon, in addition to their effects on the gastroduodenal mucosa. The new generation of selective COX-2 inhibitors may offer a potential therapeutic advantage over the nonselective NSAIDs with respect to their intestinal toxicity. Well-designed safety trials that have intestinal injury as a predefined end point will provide important information as to the overall gastrointestinal safety of these compounds. These agents must be evaluated with respect to their overall safety profile and not just by their gastrointestinal safety. Nevertheless, these agents are continuing to provide new directions for exciting basic and clinical scientific investigation.

### Role of prescribed medication in the development of iron deficiency anaemia in adults-a case-control study [^116fd4JB]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the consequence of impaired bone marrow production of erythrocytes due to depletion of body iron stores. It is a major global healthcare issue, with multiple causes primarily relating to reduced assimilation and/or enhanced loss of iron.

In the UK, about 30% of cases of IDA in adult males and non-menstruating females prove on investigation to have an underlying cause in the upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A variety of pathologies may contribute, with malabsorption (most commonly due to coeliac disease) in around 4% of cases. However, the majority are accounted for by mucosal lesions due to inflammatory, vascular or neoplastic pathology, with the common final pathway of enhanced chronic GI blood loss. Because of the cancer link, unexplained IDA in these groups is a recognised indication in the UK for fast-track investigation.

Further investigation may reveal pathology in the small bowel or renal tract in a small percentage of additional cases. However, the majority of episodes of IDA in the adult UK population remain unexplained. The IDA cohort referred for further investigation is relatively elderly, a group who frequently take prescribed medications. The question frequently arises as to whether such medication may be contributing to the development of IDA, and therefore whether it should be discontinued. In the individual case, this can be difficult to answer, particularly if the indication for continuing therapy is strong.

Many drugs have a plausible mechanism for influencing iron balance in the GI tract, and therefore potentially the risk of development of IDA. Examples would include enhanced chronic blood loss through impairment of haemostasis (anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), mucosal damage (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) or both (aspirin), and impairment of iron absorption (proton pump inhibitors, PPIs).

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced colopathy [^113aRfF7]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced enteropathy, comprising inflammation, ulceration, occult bleeding and subsequent healing with stricture formation in the small bowel, has become an established clinical entity. Recently, reports of similar pathological changes in the colon have led to increasing awareness of, what is termed, NSAID-induced colopathy. The authors here present a case of NSAID-induced colopathy with diaphragm formation in the colon. Diaphragms are thickened mucosal folds which can completely obliterate the bowel lumen. NSAID-induced colopathy can present with iron-deficiency anaemia, abdominal pain, weight loss, blood-positive stools or altered bowel habits, thus mimicking colon cancer. Acute presentation with bowel obstruction and/or perforation can also occur. Management involves withdrawal of the offending NSAID, excluding differential diagnoses such as inflammatory bowel disease and malignancy, and sometimes surgery with resection. With the increased use of coated and slow-release formulations of NSAIDs, increased awareness with regard to this clinical entity is relevant.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy as a major risk factor for small bowel bleeding: a retrospective study [^112xzjm6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study showed an improved diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy for obscure GI bleeding and reaffirmed that NSAID-induced enteropathy is the most common etiology of SB bleeding in Korean patients. Therefore, aggressive clinical management, including SB capsule endoscopy, should be considered for patients with unexplained GI bleeding or drug-refractory iron deficiency anemia, particularly during aspirin or NSAID medications.

### Association of anaemia in primary care patients with chronic kidney disease: cross sectional study of quality improvement in chronic kidney disease (QICKD) trial data [^113hVcVp]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and treating anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) may improve outcomes. However, little is known about the scope to improve primary care management of anaemia in CKD.

Methods

An observational study (N = 1,099,292) with a nationally representative sample using anonymised routine primary care data from 127 Quality Improvement in CKD trial practices (ISRCTN5631023731). We explored variables associated with anaemia in CKD: eGFR, haemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), iron status, cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of therapy which associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, oral iron and deprivation score. We developed a linear regression model to identify variables amenable to improved primary care management.

Results

The prevalence of Stage 3–5 CKD was 6.76%. Hb was lower in CKD (13.2 g/dl) than without (13.7 g/dl). 22.2% of people with CKD had World Health Organization defined anaemia; 8.6% had Hb ≤ 11 g/dl; 3% Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 1% Hb ≤ 9 g/dl. Normocytic anaemia was present in 80.5% with Hb ≤ 11; 72.7% with Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 67.6% with Hb ≤ 9 g/dl; microcytic anaemia in 13.4% with Hb ≤ 11 g/dl; 20.8% with Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 24.9% where Hb ≤ 9 g/dl. 82.7% of people with microcytic and 58.8% with normocytic anaemia (Hb ≤ 11 g/dl) had a low ferritin (< 100 ug/mL). Hypertension (67.2% vs. 54%) and diabetes (30.7% vs. 15.4%) were more prevalent in CKD and anaemia; 61% had been prescribed aspirin; 73% non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); 14.1% warfarin 12.4% clopidogrel; and 53.1% aspirin and NSAID. 56.3% of people with CKD and anaemia had been prescribed oral iron. The main limitations of the study are that routine data are inevitably incomplete and definitions of anaemia have not been standardised.

Conclusions

Medication review is needed in people with CKD and anaemia prior to considering erythropoietin or parenteral iron. Iron stores may be depleted in over > 60% of people with normocytic anaemia. Prescribing oral iron has not corrected anaemia.

### Mucoprotective drugs can prevent and treat nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced small bowel enteropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1161haL2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide. As capsule endoscopy (CE) became more available in the past two decades, small bowel enteropathy (SBE) started to get much more attention among NSAID users. While the incidence of upper gastrointestinal (GI) events decrease, an increasing trend in lower GI events was observed among these patients. Manifestations of SBE are nonspecific, with various signs and symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and constipation, and consequences like iron-deficiency anaemia or protein loss. Moreover, life-threatening ulcer complications, bleeding and perforation can also appear in this population.

The pathogenetic mechanisms of NSAID-induced small bowel injuries are still not fully elucidated. It is known that NSAIDs going through enterohepatic recirculation are more potent to induce mucosal lesions. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, direct damage to the intestinal epithelial cells, increased intestinal permeability and altered gut microbiota are associated with these medications. A recent study demonstrated that NSAID-triggered inflammatory signals can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. This protein plays a crucial role in SBE, as it affects gut homeostasis by modulating the interactions between the innate immune system, intestinal epithelium and microbiota.

### The cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib prevent colorectal neoplasia occurrence and recurrence [^113PnAZ6]. Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. Most colorectal cancers are believed to develop from colorectal adenomas. We examined the effect of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib, nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, and acetaminophen on colorectal neoplasia (colorectal cancer, colorectal adenoma, or both).

Methods

This was a nested case-control study, which used data from a government insurance database on patients 65 years and older who underwent a diagnostic test or procedure for colorectal neoplasia between January and June 2001. Logistic regression models were used to determine the effect of exposure to the drugs of interest for at least 3 months on the occurrence or recurrence of colorectal neoplasia.

Results

The control group included 2568 patients found to be free of colorectal neoplasia; 730 patients were diagnosed with colorectal adenoma, and 179 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Patients more likely to have colorectal adenoma (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval) were those diagnosed with colorectal adenoma (4.12, 3.27–5.18) or colorectal cancer (3.74, 2.32–6.03) in the previous 1–3 years and those with hemorrhage of the rectum or unspecified anemia in the prior month (3.19, 2.46–4.12). Exposures to rofecoxib (0.67, 0.46–0.98) and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (0.41, 0.21–0.83) reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma. Rofecoxib, celecoxib, and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were all protective against both neoplasias (0.64, 0.45–0.91; 0.73, 0.54–0.99; and 0.47, 0.26–0.86, respectively).

Conclusions

Rofecoxib, celecoxib, and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs seem to protect against the development of colorectal neoplasia.

### Anemia in chronic heart failure: pathogenetic mechanisms [^115zFEUA]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia can be the cause of heart failure, but also its consequence. The pathogenesis of anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) has yet to be fully elucidated, but is likely to be complex. Epidemiologic studies suggest that kidney dysfunction (by reducing the erythropoietic response to anemia), inflammation (by inducing erythropoietin resistance), decreased body mass index, old age, female gender, and poor clinical status may be important factors in the development of anemia in CHF. Intestinal malabsorption, chronic aspirin use, and proteinuria predisposes to iron deficiency. Proinflammatory cytokines are likely to play a significant role in anemia in CHF by generating the "anemia of chronic illness" that is a hallmark of inflammatory conditions. Few studies have investigated the mechanisms of anemia in CHF. There is a need for such studies.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and lower gastrointestinal complications [^117Q34JV]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

In addition to the upper GI tract, NSAIDs can damage the small bowel and the colon. NSAID enteropathy is frequent and may be present in more than 60% of patients taking these drugs long term. In most cases, damage is subclinical, including increased mucosal permeability, inflammation, erosions, ulceration, but other more serious clinical outcomes such as anemia, and overall bleeding, perforation, obstruction, diverticulitis and deaths have also been described. The magnitude of these serious outcomes from the lower GI tract is not well defined, but recent data suggest that they may be as frequent and severe as upper GI complications. Contrary to what happens in the upper GI tract, treatment and prevention of NSAID enteropathy is difficult, since the pathogenic mechanisms are different and not well understood. Among other options, misoprostol, antibiotics, and sulphasalazine have been proved to be effective in animal models, but they have not been properly tested in humans. Selective COX-2 inhibition is emerging as a potential alternative to tNSAIDs in the prevention of damage in the lower GI tract in rheumatologic patients. Preliminary studies in healthy volunteers have shown that these drugs are associated with no or less small bowel damage than tNSAIDs plus PPI, although their long-term effects in patients need to be properly tested. Post hoc analysis of previous outcome studies focused on complications of upper GI tract or cardiovascular events have shown contradictory results. Data from one ongoing trial comparing celecoxib versus diclofenac plus PPI and examining serious outcomes from the whole GI tract will probably provide new insights in this area.

### Predictors of gastrointestinal lesions on endoscopy in iron deficiency anemia without gastrointestinal symptoms [^117PFt9g]. BMC Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

There is scanty data regarding predictors of endoscopic lesions in IDA patients without GI symptoms, however, hemoglobin, ferritin, female gender and history of NSAIDs have been shown to be associated with endoscopic lesions in patients with IDA having gastrointestinal symptoms. In the current study there was no correlation with the factors described in patients with GI symptoms. However, our results of advancing age, low mean corpuscular volume and positive fecal occult blood test are in concordance with the available literature of IDA patients.

The main limitation of our study is that we did not investigate patients with negative endoscopies with capsule endoscopy and/or enteroscopy.

In conclusion, patients with iron deficiency anemia without gastrointestinal symptoms obligates comprehensive gastrointestinal tract examination especially with advance age, low mean corpuscular volume and positive fecal occult blood test, as large proportion of patients may have potentially treatable etiology. High proportion of upper gastrointestinal lesions warrants upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as initial endoscopic procedure in patients with iron deficiency anemia with out gastrointestinal symptoms. However these conclusions need validation in further studies.

For children with avascular necrosis of bone, the panel "chooses not to offer a recommendation for or against the use of SNRIs and/or NSAIDs". For adults and children with leg ulcers, the panel "chooses not to offer a recommendation for or against any specific nonopioid pharmacological management strategy". NSAIDs are broadly defined to include selective and nonselective COX inhibitors, the evidence base for avascular necrosis pain management is indirect and restricted to adults, and surgical/nonsurgical treatments of the underlying cause were not the focus of this recommendation.

### GI-REASONS: a novel 6-month, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial [^111cnFcG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Study eligibility

Patients aged ≥ 55 years with a clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis, who required daily NSAID therapy for the management of osteoarthritis symptoms, were eligible. Key exclusions were active GI ulcer hemorrhage or gastroduodenal ulceration within 90 days of screening, known established cardiovascular disease, any patient who, in the opinion of the investigator, was at sufficiently high cardiovascular risk to require low-dose aspirin, or positive fecal occult blood test at screening. Acetaminophen for occasional treatment of nonarthritis pain (up to 4 g per day for no more than 2 consecutive days), narcotic analgesics, and gastroprotective agents were allowed.

Study endpoints

The primary endpoint was the incidence of clinically significant upper and/or lower GI events over 6 months, individual components of which are shown in the Results section (Table 1). Potential GI endpoint events were adjudicated by an independent, blinded, expert GI events adjudication committee that evaluated whether the suspected GI event met predefined criteria for a component of the composite GI endpoint. The primary endpoint component, clinically significant anemia of presumed occult GI origin, was defined as a hemoglobin decrease of more than 2 mg/dl from baseline, which had no apparent non-GI cause to explain the decrease. Patients could have only one primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included moderate to severe abdominal symptoms, withdrawal owing to GI adverse events, changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit from baseline, study and nonstudy drug utilization, gastroprotective drug use, and fecal occult blood test results. Patient satisfaction was measured with a validated instrument as a secondary endpoint to assess potential treatment benefit. Cardiovascular events were also assessed and adjudicated by an independent, blinded, expert cardiovascular adjudication committee.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced strictures of the colon: report of a case and review of the literature [^115ERjbX]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

The phenomenon of strictures of the colon induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is a newly recognized pathologic entity that has gained little exposure in the surgical literature to date. A further case is reported and the clinical features of this entity are discussed. Most patients present with symptoms suggestive of malignancy, namely anemia, obstructive symptoms, or weight loss. Pathologic changes are characterized by diaphragm-like strictures with submucosal fibrosis. Surgical resection to exclude malignancy and treat symptoms along with cessation of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is the treatment of choice.

### GI-REASONS: a novel 6-month, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial [^117CidDG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The relative merits of the various methods used to assess NSAID-induced GI damage (e.g. endoscopy of the upper GI tract, a composite endpoint evaluation of the entire GI tract, or assessment of ulcer complications) have been the focus of the recent US regulatory discussions. NSAID toxicity in GI-REASONS was assessed by a composite primary endpoint of clinically significant upper and/or lower GI events. Historically, the most commonly employed investigational method in the study of NSAID-related GI damage is endoscopy. Although upper endoscopy is useful to assess the upper GI tract, it is not appropriate for the entire small intestine. In the small intestine, capsule endoscopy studies have shown differences in mucosal damage between COX-2-selective and nonselective NSAIDs; however, the clinical relevance of these endoscopic findings is still unclear. In addition, a common gastroprotective strategy, PPI use, is not anticipated to have pharmacological effects extending beyond the duodenum. We believe a primary endpoint that assesses damage through the entire GI tract provides valuable safety data to guide management of arthritis patients, as well as methodological and regulatory discussions.

Prior data indicate that the GI advantage of COX-2-selective NSAIDs may be compromised in patients taking concomitant aspirin. Aspirin use was an exclusion criterion in this study. Although we avoided the potential confounding of the GI endpoint, this exclusion criterion means that our observations may not be generalizable to patients on prophylactic aspirin therapy.

The largest proportion of the composite GI endpoint can be attributed to decreases in hemoglobin ≥ 2 g/dl and/or ≥ 10% hematocrit, and the clinical relevance of a 2-g/dl drop in hemoglobin is currently the subject of active debate. We believe that the difference reflects those taking nsNSAIDs, even with concomitant PPI use, are at increased risk of mucosal damage throughout the entire GI tract compared with the relative GI mucosa protection offered by COX-2 inhibition via celecoxib. On a large scale, such as that examined in this study, it is possible that this difference of protection between nsNSAIDs and celecoxib is likely enough to expose the smaller, nonscoped bleeding changes that can occur throughout the entire GI tract with nsNSAID use. These smaller bleeding changes would then be reflected in the hemoglobin differences seen in the two arms.

### Occult blood in feces is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction: a nationwide population study [^115x94y8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

A major limitation of this study is that it evaluated the association between the FIT results and the main outcomes, not the causal relationships. In addition, the long lag time from the FIT‐positive results to the occurrence of stroke and MI may have hindered interpreting the relationship. However, we confirmed the consistency of our results by performing subgroup, interaction, and internal validation analyses. This trend was maintained by adjusting for other factors as well, providing more concrete evidence for our results. Second, no medication information, such as aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, and antiplatelet agents, was collected and adjusted for in the analysis. Antithrombotic agents are essential in cardiovascular disease and are also one of the main reasons for false‐positive FIT results. Although not all of the medications were adjusted at baseline, we minimized bias by excluding all subjects with any history of cardiovascular disease and identified only those with first‐time stroke and MI. Moreover, the subgroup analysis by anemia revealed no significant interaction between anemia and FIT, indicating consistency in the main outcome. Third, we could not distinguish between the first time ever MI/stroke and recurrent events because of the innate limitation in using ICD‐10 codes of the claims data. Further study is needed for future application in real‐world practice. Last, some of the clinical information, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical exercise, was collected via self‐answered questionnaire, indicating a careful approach in interpretation.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that FIT positivity predicted an increased association with cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Subjects with a positive FIT result are not only at risk of colorectal neoplasia but may also be at risk of developing stroke and MI. Further study is needed to confirm the causal relationship, but this study postulated the novel concept of the clinical significance of FIT in fields other than CRC screening, which may pave the way for possible expansion of its use in the future.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^1143HWfG]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiological data from Spain showed that although the number of NSAID-related GI events decreased over the period 1996–2005 (probably due to the addition of PPI therapy), there was a corresponding increase in the number of lower-GI-tract events associated with NSAID use.NSAID-induced enteropathy and bleeding may occur more often than NSAID-induced gastropathy. One study estimated that approximately 70% of chronic NSAID users have significant small-intestine damage and bleeding. In addition, lower-GI-tract events are more severe than upper-GI-tract events in terms of higher mortality rate, prolonged length of hospital stay, and more diagnostic tests required.

The most likely mechanism for lower-GI-tract damage with ns-NSAIDs is increased lower-GI-tract mucosal permeability and inflammation.ns-NSAIDs cause direct damage to the surface epithelium, increasing intestinal permeability, which results in a tissue reaction known as inflammatory enteropathy. Anemia, occult blood loss, malabsorption, and protein loss are common. Clinically significant GI bleeding, perforation, diarrhea, mucosal ulceration, diverticular disease, and strictures may also occur. Capsule-endoscopy studies have increased understanding of the adverse lower-GI-tract effects of NSAIDs, with one showing biochemical and direct evidence of macroscopic injury to the small intestine in 68%–75% of volunteers after 2 weeks' treatment with slow-release diclofenac. Such changes appear to develop even after the addition of a PPI.

### Role of prescribed medication in the development of iron deficiency anaemia in adults-a case-control study [^111wUYPh]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this case–control study demonstrate that among adults in the UK, presentation with IDA has a strong association with long-term PPI therapy, a moderate link with long-term anticoagulation, but no association with treatment with antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or long-term antidepressants.

The apparent negative association between short-term antidepressant therapy and IDA was not anticipated. Our speculation is that this finding might reflect confounding due to an excess of antidepressant prescribing in the control group in the months leading up to presentation, given that a proportion of subjects in this group had functional symptoms such as dyspepsia or bowel disturbance driven by psychosocial factors and/or psychological stress.

Various forms of bias need to be addressed in a study of this type, and for this reason potential confounders such as age, sex and coprescribed medications were incorporated into the analysis. In addition, the primary analysis focused on long-term medication exposure, since this is not only more likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of IDA (a chronic process) but also minimises the risk of protopathic bias — a situation where medication (such as a PPI) is falsely incriminated because it is prescribed for an indication (such as a peptic ulcer) which is the actual cause of the outcome in question (in this case, IDA).

More difficult to control for is the potential bias introduced by 'medicalised' subjects, who are arguably more likely to have been prescribed medications, and also more likely to have had a blood count checked — and so found to have IDA. It is therefore reassuring that long-term exposure to three of the drug classes assessed showed no difference between the two groups.

The study has several other potential weaknesses. First, iron studies were not routinely undertaken in the control group, so some cases may have had latent IDA — however, this might be expected to lessen any observed prescribing differences between the groups. Second, compliance with medication is rarely 100%, so prescription does not equate to ingestion — but this is likely to apply to both study groups. Finally, the findings for non-steroidal anti-inflammatories carry the major caveat that over-the-counter usage will not register in this study.

### Role of prescribed medication in the development of iron deficiency anaemia in adults-a case-control study [^116qmWRF]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Results

Following exclusions for incomplete data sets or duplication, there were 409 subjects in the IDA group and 801 in the control group available for analysis. The descriptive statistics for the two groups are shown in table 1, revealing as anticipated that the IDA group were marginally older, with a greater proportion of females and a lower haemoglobin. Across the study groups (n = 1210), drug exposure of any duration was identified in 157 (13.0%) for OACs, 202 (16.7%) for antidepressants, 205 (16.9%) for antiplatelet agents, 574 (47.4%) for PPIs and 52 (4.3%) for non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

Table 1
Descriptive statistics of the study groups

Analysis confirmed the presence of multiple relationships between the study variables. The association was particularly strong between the prescription of PPIs and that of OACs, antiplatelet therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (p < 0.001 for each) — as anticipated, given the widespread use of PPI therapy to minimise the risk of GI side-effects of other drug classes. There were also statistically significant associations between the prescription of (a) PPI and antidepressants, and (b) non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and antidepressants. Finally, the prescription prevalence of all drug groups was associated with both sex (commoner in females) and increasing age.

Statistical assessment of validity and goodness of fit of the logistic regression model based on the criteria outlined in the Method section was satisfactory. As shown in table 2, the model revealed a strong association between long-term PPI exposure and IDA (OR 3.29, p < 0.001). A statistically significant association was also demonstrated between long-term OAC exposure and IDA (OR 2.04, p = 0.002). Figure 1 shows the relationship between exposure to long-term prescription of these two drug classes within the two study groups according to age, showing a consistent relationship across all age-groups.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced diaphragms and ulceration in the colon [^114Rjkqq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The toxic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the small bowel have been reported extensively. A growing number of reports of toxic effects of NSAIDs on the colon have appeared recently. The clinical presentation, endoscopic appearances and histological findings of so-called NSAID colopathy are quite varied, as illustrated by a series of four patients described in this report. Presenting symptoms and signs in this series include iron-deficiency anaemia and crampy abdominal pain, but alteration of bowel habit, weight loss, and even nausea and vomiting have also been described. One patient in this series has large-bowel diaphragms, considered by some to be pathognomonic of NSAID effects. Each of the four patients had right-sided colonic lesions only, possibly supporting a direct toxic effect of NSAIDs. Management usually involves simply stopping the offending NSAID. A review of the literature on this under-recognized entity is presented.

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^114j9KAe]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend to perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding if a bleeding source is not identified in the colon, especially in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or NSAID use.

Aspirin — an antiplatelet agent and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) included in multiple over-the-counter and scheduled products, it inhibits synthesis of prostaglandin by cyclooxygenase, inhibits platelet aggregation, and has antipyretic and analgesic activity. It is indicated as an antiplatelet agent for patients suspected of suffering from an acute coronary syndrome. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to aspirin or NSAIDs (including aspirin-induced urticaria or aspirin-intolerant asthma), bleeding GI ulcers, hemolytic anemia from PK and G6PD deficiency, hemophilia, hemorrhagic diathesis, hemorrhoids, lactating mother, nasal polyps associated with asthma, sarcoidosis, thrombocytopenia, and ulcerative colitis.

### Visible small-intestinal mucosal injury in chronic NSAID users [^111kVMhR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients who regularly take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an increased risk for small-intestinal mucosal ulceration and bleeding, which may present as anemia of undetermined gastrointestinal origin or protein loss. The prevalence and severity of small-intestinal lesions remains unclear. Our aim was to assess the frequency of NSAID-induced small-bowel injury among chronic NSAID users.

Methods

Ambulatory patients with various types of arthritides who took NSAIDs daily (> 3 mo duration) or took either acetaminophen alone or nothing were enrolled in the study. All patients fasted overnight and underwent wireless video capsule endoscopy. Two investigators, blind to therapy, reviewed each video beginning after the pylorus. Lesions were scored as normal, red spots, small erosions, large erosions, or ulcers. An ulcer was defined as a larger lesion with apparent depth and a definite rim.

Results

Forty-one patients, 36 men and 5 women, ages ranging from 22 to 66 years (mean age, 49.8 y) were analyzed including 21 chronic NSAID users and 20 control patients. Small-bowel injury was seen in 71% of NSAID users compared with 10% of controls (P < .001). Injury was mild (few or no erosions, absence of large erosions/ulcers) in 10 NSAID users compared with 2 controls. Five NSAID users had major (> 4 erosions or large ulcers/ulcers) damage compared with none in the control group. There were no complications or problems with the capsule endoscopy procedure.

Conclusions

Endoscopically evident small-intestinal mucosal injury is very common among chronic NSAID users. The role of endoscopically evident injury in unexplained iron-deficiency anemia and hypoalbuminemia among chronic NSAID users remains undetermined.

### Role of prescribed medication in the development of iron deficiency anaemia in adults-a case-control study [^111KY4D7]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The major conclusions of this study are that antiplatelet therapy does not contribute to the development of IDA, long-term anticoagulation has a modest influence and the largest effect appears to be exerted by long-term PPI therapy. This raises the possibility that the surge in IDA referrals seen in secondary care over recent yearsis being driven at least in part by prescribing practice — and strengthens the case for minimising PPI exposure to the population as a whole, and to those with problematic IDA in particular. Clearly further research is needed to confirm our findings and to strengthen the conclusions of a definitive systematic review with meta-analysis, and should include both case–control and cohort studies from primary and secondary care.

### GI-REASONS: a novel 6-month, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial [^111mQieS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Secondary endpoints

A smaller proportion of patients receiving celecoxib (94 (2.3%)) experienced moderate to severe abdominal symptoms than those receiving nsNSAIDs (138 (3.4%); P = 0.0035). However, withdrawals owing to GI adverse events were similar between groups (112 (2.8%) and 120 (3.0%), respectively; P = not significant).

At baseline, mean hemoglobin levels were similar between treatment groups (13.6 g/dl in each group). At study completion, the hemoglobin decrease from baseline was significantly greater in those taking nsNSAIDs (treatment difference, 0.132; 95% CI, 0.10–0.16; P < 0.0001). Over the course of the 6-month study, 1.8% of celecoxib patients compared with 2.9% of nsNSAID patients had a ≥ 2-g decrease in hemoglobin or 10% or greater decrease in hematocrit (relative risk, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.2; P = 0.0023).

The proportion of patients taking gastroprotective agents (PPI or H₂-RA) for ≥ 75% of the time under study was 22.4% in the celecoxib group and 23.8% in the nsNSAID group. The proportion of patients with clinically significant upper and/or lower GI events among those who took a PPI was approximately 1.4% in the celecoxib group and 3.0% in the nsNSAID group, and among those who did not take a PPI, the proportion was 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Furthermore, among patients who took a PPI, the proportion of patients with clinically significant anemia (defined as either clinically significant anemia of defined GI origin or clinically significant anemia of presumed occult GI origin, including possible small-bowel blood loss) was approximately 1.3% in the celecoxib group and 2.4% in the nsNSAID group. This rate changed to 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively, for those who did not use a PPI.

### Role of prescribed medication in the development of iron deficiency anaemia in adults-a case-control study [^111YFhq4]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The five classes of medication assessed were (1) oral anticoagulants (OACs — vitamin K antagonists and DOACs), (2) antidepressants (all subclasses), (3) oral antiplatelet agents (aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors), (4) PPIs and (5) non-steroidal antiinflammatories (all subclasses). For each censored drug, the duration of prescribed exposure was estimated. For the purposes of the analysis, cumulative repeat prescription duration was defined as short-term if less than 12 months, or long-term if 12 months or more. The data for each subject were anonymised prior to analysis by the clinical team overseeing their management such that no identifiable personal data (including name, hospital number, postcode, date of birth or age to anything closer than year) was in the data set at the point of analysis.

Power calculations were based on an arbitrary expected drug exposure rate of 20% in the control group and a 1:2 case to control ratio. For an OR of 1.5 at the 5% significance level (two-sided test) and a power of 80%, the total sample size requirement for the study was estimated to be 1200 participants — 400 cases and 800 controls.

Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for the association between the IDA presentation and each drug class, adjusted for age, sex and concurrent drug exposure. The model was constructed according to the formula: Logit (probability of IDA) = β₀ + β₁age + β₂sex + β₃OAC + β₄AD + β₅AP + β₆NS + β₇PPI (where OAC, anticoagulant; AP, antiplatelet therapy; NS, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory; PPI, proton pump inhibitor and AD, antidepressant). Linearity, independence, multicollinearity, influential values, pseudo R² and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were examined to check the validity of the fitted logistic regression model and the goodness of fit.

Recommendation 6b — chronic pain due to avascular necrosis or leg ulcers in sickle cell disease: For adults with SCD who have chronic pain from avascular necrosis of bone, the ASH guideline panel suggests the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as an option for management in the context of a comprehensive disease and pain management plan, with a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects; for children with SCD who have chronic pain from avascular necrosis of bone, the panel chooses not to offer a recommendation for or against the use of SNRIs and/or NSAIDs; and for adults and children with SCD who have chronic pain from leg ulcers, the panel chooses not to offer a recommendation for or against any specific nonopioid pharmacological management strategy.

Osteoarthritis-directed pharmacotherapy benefits for SCD-related joint pain are limited: Estimates of minimum clinically important differences for WOMAC scales have varied, but based on these estimates, overall clinical effects are likely to be quite modest, and the potential benefits of both duloxetine (and likely other SNRI medications) and celecoxib (and likely other NSAIDs) for avascular necrosis of bone are estimated to be small, including improved pain control and improved physical function related to the affected joints.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy as a major risk factor for small bowel bleeding: a retrospective study [^114YMosr]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Capsule endoscopy for unexplained GI bleeding has shown diagnostic yields of 57–62%, with the most common diagnosis being angioectasia (50%), followed by ulcers (26.8%) and tumors (8.8%), as suggested in a recent systematic literature review. The present study revealed a detection rate of SB bleeding and lesions using capsule endoscopy of 72.3% (60 of 83 patients), of which NSAID-induced enteropathy accounted for 25 of all 60 SB bleeding cases. The diagnostic yield of small bowel lesions in our study was higher than in a previous nationwide Korean study of capsule endoscopy, but the prevalence of ulcerative/erosive lesions was comparable (40/60 vs 106/157). Similar to our results, a Korean study using balloon-assisted enteroscopy found that the most common type of SB lesions associated with obscure GI bleeding were mucosal injury (56%), followed by vascular lesions (18.7%). Because of limited availability of data regarding the use of NSAIDs/low-dose aspirin, we could not compare the prevalence of NSAID-induced enteropathy with the results from these studies. However, considering the meaningful association between NSAID use and SB injury presented in previous studies, NSAID-induced enteropathy could be the major cause of obscure GI bleeding in Eastern countries. Contrary to previous reports from Western countries, we observed a higher occurrence rate of ulcerative/erosive lesions than angioectasia in patients with obscure GI bleeding, supporting the implication of low-dose aspirin or NSAID medications in the disease etiology. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the optical timing of capsule endoscopy would be within 2 days, to improve the diagnostic yield. For patients with clear bloody stool in our study, the capsule endoscope was able to start testing within a median of 51 h (inter-quartile range, 24 to 96 h). In the case of persistent melena or hematochezia enough to show symptoms, the patients usually visited the emergency room and in these patients, the capsule endoscopy could be performed within at least 48 h, but if patients showed intermittent blood stool or if symptoms related to bleeding or anemia were not clear, capsule endoscopy would not be conducted within 2 days. In real practice, further improvement is needed in this respect.

### Predictors of gastrointestinal lesions on endoscopy in iron deficiency anemia without gastrointestinal symptoms [^111MvJa8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Following lesions were considered as source of IDA on colonoscopy: colonic mass, one or more polyps (> 0.5 cm in diameter), 5 or more vascular ectasias, a vascular ectasia greater than 0.7 cm in size, colonic ulcer(s), and histopathologically proven inflammatory bowel disease. Diffuse diverticular disease was considered as a possible cause of IDA only in those patients with no other causes of blood loss on upper and lower GI endoscopies.

Dependent and Independent variables

Endoscopic lesions including bleeding and non bleeding causes for IDA were classified according to following outcome variables i) Absence or presence of bleeding related lesion ii) Absence/presence of cause of IDA (including bleeding and non bleeding causes).

Following independent variables were investigated for each outcome variable age (years), gender (male/female), hemoglobin level (gm/dl), MCV (fl), serum iron, feacal occult blood (positive/negative), family history of cancer (yes/no), weight loss (yes/no), prior therapy for IDA (yes/no), drug history (NSAIDs [yes/no].

Data Analysis Procedure

Data entered and then analyzed on software Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, IL) version 15.

Mean ± standard deviation were computed for continuous variables of age, hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, MCV, serum ferritin level, serum iron, serum TIBC, transferrin saturation. Frequency and percentages were calculated for categorical data like male and female ratio, drug history, weight loss, family history of GI cancers, prior therapy for IDA, fecal occult blood, gastrointestinal lesions.

Univariate analysis was performed by using simple logistic regression for association between independent and outcome variables. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the variables with p-value ≤ 0.25 were included in multiple logistic regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict gastrointestinal lesions with clinical and biochemical variables.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy as a major risk factor for small bowel bleeding: a retrospective study [^1121g5f6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel (SB) bleeding accounts for 5% of all gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding cases and 80% of obscure GI bleeding cases. Although angioectasia is the common etiology of SB bleeding, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced SB lesions are also reported as a major cause in studies from Eastern countries. Herein, we assessed the frequency of occurrence of NSAID-induced SB lesions in Korean patients with obscure GI bleeding.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed medical records of all consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent capsule endoscopy from March 2018 to February 2019 at Ulsan University Hospital and Kosin University Gospel Hospital.

Results

Of the 83 subjects (all Korean; mean age ± standard deviation: 59 ± 18 years; age range: 18–84 years; men: n = 52; women: n = 31), 55 (66.2%) had stool with clear blood and 28 (33.8%) had normal stool with iron deficiency anemia. The detection rate of SB bleeding and lesions using capsule endoscopy was 72.3% (60 of 83 patients). A significantly higher frequency (40 of 51) of ulcerative/erosive lesions than other causes was observed in patients with inactive bleeding but visible SB lesions. As a result, NSAID-induced enteropathy accounted for 30.1% of 83 patients with obscure GI bleeding (25 of the all 60 SB bleeding cases).

Conclusions

Contrary to what is reported for patients in Western countries, this study in Korean patients showed an improved diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy for obscure GI bleeding and that NSAID-induced enteropathy was the most common etiology of SB bleeding. Aggressive small intestine examination is required for patients with unexplained GI bleeding.

Surrogate outcome trials — appraisal criteria emphasize validity, effect size and durability, and clinical applicability. Validity asks for "a strong, independent, consistent association between the surrogate end point and the clinical end point" and whether randomized trials "in other drug classes" or "in the same drug class" show that improving the surrogate consistently improves the target outcome. Results should address, "How large, precise, and lasting was the treatment effect? Effect should be large, precise, and lasting to consider a surrogate trial reasonable basis for offering patients the intervention". Applicability weighs benefits, harms, and costs: "Offer intervention on basis of surrogate data only if patient's risk of the target outcome is high, patient places a high value on avoiding the target outcome, and there are no satisfactory alternative therapies". The table notes that "Answers to one or both of these questions should be "yes" for a surrogate trial to be an adequate guide for clinical action".
