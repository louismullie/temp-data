## Question

Lung granuloma significance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of lung granulomas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what granulomas are pathologically and why they form. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies and their relative frequencies. Next, I will examine the clinical significance, including symptoms, complications, and prognosis. After that, I need to review diagnostic challenges and how to distinguish granulomas from malignancy. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight special scenarios and knowledge gaps, making sure I verify each claim against the best available evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Lung granulomas are focal aggregates of activated macrophages, Langerhans cells, and lymphocytes that wall off substances the immune system cannot clear, forming a barrier around antigens such as mycobacteria, fungi, or unknown triggers in diseases like sarcoidosis; this is a nonspecific tissue response rather than a disease itself, which is crucial for interpreting their significance in context [^6f48baf1] [^5a35490d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I should categorize the major causes and their frequencies. Infectious etiologies are common globally, with mycobacterial and fungal infections accounting for roughly half of pulmonary granulomas in pathologic series, though proportions vary by geography; in the U.S., fungi predominate, whereas mycobacteria are more frequent outside the U.S., and a substantial minority remain idiopathic even after thorough evaluation [^5a35490d]. Noninfectious causes include sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic beryllium disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease in common variable immunodeficiency; together these represent a large share of noninfectious granulomatous lung disease and often require multidisciplinary correlation to diagnose confidently [^5a35490d] [^f71430c4] [^031e8007].

> I need to check the clinical significance next. Many granulomas are incidental and asymptomatic, but their importance lies in three domains: identifying an underlying treatable disease, assessing risk of complications such as fibrosis or organ dysfunction, and distinguishing benign granulomas from malignancy; symptoms, when present, are typically driven by the underlying process rather than the granuloma per se, and granulomas themselves can impair function if they distort airways or vasculature [^6f48baf1] [^5a35490d]. In sarcoidosis, for example, up to 20% develop pulmonary fibrosis, and granulomatous inflammation can persist and drive organ damage, underscoring the need to evaluate disease activity and extent rather than assuming benignity based on granulomas alone [^01d3f4e9] [^ff14ee4f].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic challenge of differentiating granulomas from lung cancer, because this is where missteps occur. Granulomas can mimic peripheral lung cancers on CT, sharing features like spiculation, lobulation, and lymphadenopathy; FDG-PET avidity is common in granulomatous inflammation and lowers specificity for malignancy, especially in regions with endemic granulomatous disease, so a positive PET cannot reliably distinguish cancer from granuloma [^6f48baf1] [^3bb4bae7] [^ccec6bd4]. I should double-check CT discriminators: lower nonenhanced attenuation (≤ 21 HU), rim enhancement, and irregular shape favor granuloma, whereas moderate heterogeneous enhancement favors malignancy, but these are supportive rather than definitive and must be integrated with clinical risk and, when necessary, tissue diagnosis [^cb9337c2] [^7f7b6861].

> Let me consider the role of biopsy and pathology, and I should confirm what constitutes a specific benign diagnosis. Core needle biopsy that demonstrates granulomatous inflammation is generally considered a specific benign diagnosis in lung nodule algorithms, though I must ensure infection is excluded with stains and cultures because necrotizing granulomas can reflect mycobacteria or fungi; fine-needle aspiration is often insufficient for granulomatous disease, so core biopsy is preferred when feasible [^4ebc3044] [^12b6cb3e]. But wait, what if the granuloma is nonnecrotizing and well formed? That pattern supports sarcoidosis, yet histology alone cannot distinguish sarcoidosis from other granulomatous diseases, so I need to correlate with clinical and radiologic features and exclude infections before labeling sarcoidosis [^f97d7ef3] [^346be906].

> Next, I should review management principles by etiology, and I need to ensure I align with guidelines. For sarcoidosis, first-line therapy remains corticosteroids for significant pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease, with immunomodulators for refractory cases; importantly, I should monitor for fibrotic transformation and complications like pulmonary hypertension and airway disease, and consider antifibrotic strategies in selected patients with fibrotic sarcoidosis [^ff14ee4f] [^01d3f4e9]. For hypersensitivity pneumonitis, removal of the antigen and immunosuppression are key, and diagnosis relies on integrating bronchiolocentric cellular interstitial pneumonia with poorly formed granulomas alongside exposure history and imaging, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework [^b12f067e] [^d915eb78]. For chronic beryllium disease, confirmation of beryllium sensitization plus granulomatous inflammation on biopsy establishes the diagnosis and guides avoidance and immunotherapy decisions [^f71430c4]. For CVID-associated GLILD, rituximab-based regimens are often used given the lymphoproliferative component, though evidence is limited and multidisciplinary care is essential [^031e8007] [^dc347bb4].

> I should confirm special scenarios that change pretest probabilities and testing choices. In tuberculosis-endemic regions, granulomas are common and malignancy rates are lower, so longer surveillance and greater reliance on nonsurgical biopsy are reasonable; conversely, in older smokers with spiculated nodules, malignancy risk is higher and tissue diagnosis is prioritized despite granulomatous features on imaging [^1ef24189] [^604789cb]. But wait, what if PET is positive in a patient with suspected granulomatous disease? Given false positives from inflammation, PET is best used to identify active sites for biopsy or to assess extrathoracic disease activity rather than to diagnose malignancy outright in this context [^ccec6bd4] [^1f9e4bd7].

> Let me reconsider prognosis and follow-up, and I should verify outcomes data. Many unexplained necrotizing granulomas after resection have an indolent course without progression even without therapy, though a rigorous search for infection and systemic granulomatous diseases is warranted before concluding idiopathy; this supports individualized surveillance rather than reflex immunosuppression when no treatable cause is found [^c99434c7]. In sarcoidosis, spontaneous remission occurs in a majority, but chronic disease with fibrosis develops in a substantial minority, so longitudinal monitoring of symptoms, pulmonary function, and imaging is prudent to detect complications early [^ff14ee4f] [^5bfb3dff].

> I will now examine knowledge gaps and future directions, and I should be cautious not to overstate. There is a need for better biomarkers to predict who will develop fibrosis or have persistent granulomatous activity, for standardized PET protocols and interpretation criteria to improve clinical utility, and for prospective trials to define when and how to treat granulomatous inflammation across diseases; multidisciplinary diagnosis remains the cornerstone while these gaps are addressed [^ff14ee4f] [^fdb78f12] [^5a35490d].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise: lung granulomas signify a nonspecific immune response that signals an underlying disease process rather than a single diagnosis; their significance hinges on identifying the cause, gauging activity and complications, and excluding malignancy using clinical context, imaging features, and, when needed, tissue diagnosis; management is etiology-specific, ranging from observation to antimicrobials to immunosuppression, and misclassification as cancer is a key pitfall that can be mitigated by integrated, multidisciplinary evaluation [^6f48baf1] [^5a35490d] [^40fb012a].

---

Lung granulomas are **nonspecific immune responses** to persistent antigens, most often due to infection (TB, NTM, fungi) or sarcoidosis [^5a35490d] [^f1456f81]. They are **usually benign** but can cause symptoms or fibrosis depending on size, number, and location [^ff14ee4f]. Diagnosis requires **histology plus exclusion of infection** and malignancy; management targets the underlying cause, with steroids for sarcoidosis and antimicrobials for infections [^f97d7ef3] [^0d4dee28]. Granulomas can mimic cancer on imaging, so tissue diagnosis is often needed to avoid unnecessary surgery [^6f48baf1] [^12b6cb3e].

---

## Pathological significance

Granulomas are **organized aggregates of macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells** that wall off antigens the immune system cannot eradicate [^6f48baf1]. They are **nonspecific** and occur in diverse infectious and noninfectious conditions [^5a35490d].

---

## Common causes of lung granulomas

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Tuberculosis (TB) [^5a35490d] <br/> - Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) [^116d6b93] <br/> - Histoplasmosis [^c99434c7] <br/> - Cryptococcosis [^6eb00e3b] <br/> - Coccidioidomycosis [^notfound] |
| Non-infectious | - Sarcoidosis [^ff14ee4f] <br/> - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis [^b12f067e] <br/> - Chronic beryllium disease [^f71430c4] <br/> - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^53fe3e16] <br/> - Common variable immunodeficiency (GLILD) [^031e8007] |

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Granulomas may be **asymptomatic and incidentally detected**, but symptoms depend on size, number, and location:

- **Asymptomatic**: Small, solitary granulomas, especially calcified, are often incidental and benign [^40fb012a].
- **Symptomatic**: Larger or multiple granulomas can cause cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, or obstructive symptoms [^023631d5].
- **Fibrosis**: Chronic granulomatous inflammation can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and irreversible lung damage, particularly in sarcoidosis [^01d3f4e9] [^ff14ee4f].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on **clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic correlation**:

- **Imaging**: Chest radiography and CT identify nodules, calcification, lymphadenopathy, and fibrosis; patterns help distinguish sarcoidosis (perilymphatic micronodules, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy) from other causes [^dbb68b59] [^631cd454].
- **Histopathology**: Noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells support sarcoidosis; necrotizing granulomas suggest infection and require special stains and cultures [^346be906] [^b7aeb669].
- **Exclusion of infection**: Acid-fast bacilli stains, fungal stains, and cultures are essential to exclude TB, NTM, and fungi [^f1456f81] [^116d6b93].
- **Exclusion of malignancy**: Granulomas can mimic malignancy on imaging; tissue diagnosis is often required to differentiate [^6f48baf1] [^12b6cb3e].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Sarcoidosis**: Corticosteroids are first-line for symptomatic or progressive disease; immunomodulators (methotrexate, azathioprine, biologics) for refractory cases [^0d4dee28].
- **Infectious granulomas**: Antimicrobial therapy tailored to the identified organism (e.g. anti-TB therapy, antifungals) [^notfound].
- **Observation**: Stable, asymptomatic granulomas may be monitored with periodic imaging [^40fb012a].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology and disease activity**. Sarcoidosis has a favorable outlook, with spontaneous remission in ~60–70%, but fibrosis occurs in ~20–25% and can be progressive [^ff14ee4f] [^677cca3b]. Infectious granulomas generally resolve with appropriate therapy, though chronic infection or fibrosis can persist [^c99434c7]. Idiopathic granulomas often remain stable without progression [^c99434c7].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **pulmonary fibrosis** with progressive dyspnea and respiratory failure, particularly in sarcoidosis [^01d3f4e9] [^ff14ee4f]. Obstructive symptoms may occur with endobronchial granulomas causing airway obstruction [^023631d5]. Hemoptysis can result from erosion of granulomas into vessels. Secondary infections, including aspergillomas, may develop within cavitary granulomas [^efeca24d].

---

## Differentiation from malignancy

Granulomas can **mimic malignancy** on imaging, necessitating careful evaluation:

- **Imaging features**: Calcification, satellite lesions, and rim enhancement favor granulomas; spiculation, irregular margins, and rapid growth favor malignancy [^ee48dd80] [^cb9337c2].
- **PET-CT**: Granulomas are often FDG-avid, limiting specificity; false positives are common in endemic granulomatous disease [^3bb4bae7] [^ccec6bd4].
- **Tissue diagnosis**: Core needle biopsy or surgical resection may be required to exclude malignancy [^12b6cb3e] [^b141bb81].

---

Lung granulomas are **nonspecific immune responses** with diverse causes; they are usually benign but can cause symptoms or fibrosis. Accurate diagnosis and management require **multidisciplinary evaluation**, with therapy directed at the underlying cause and vigilance for complications.

Purpose Of Review

Up to twenty percent of patients with sarcoidosis develop pulmonary fibrosis, transforming an often benign disease into a highly morbid and potentially fatal one. We highlight the fibrotic pulmonary sarcoidosis phenotype as an area of intense clinical and translational investigation, review recent developments in treatment, and provide a roadmap for future research in sarcoidosis associated pulmonary fibrosis.

Recent Findings

Granulomatous inflammation in a lymphatic distribution is the hallmark finding of pulmonary sarcoidosis and the nidus for fibrosis. Recent research demonstrates that fibrotic sarcoidosis begins in the setting of persistent, uncontrolled inflammation, and is aided by pro-fibrotic genetic features and immune responses. Comparison to other fibrotic lung diseases also reveals key features that inform our understanding of common pathways in fibrosis.

Summary

Understanding the mechanisms of fibrotic transformation in sarcoidosis enhances clinical care and facilitates development of novel therapeutic options. The impact of these findings in fibrotic sarcoidosis may be amplified through application to other interstitial lung diseases marked by inflammatory to fibrotic transformation. Important aspects of clinical management of fibrotic sarcoidosis include surveillance for co-morbidities, such as pulmonary hypertension, airway disease, and infection, and assessment for pulmonary disease activity that may benefit from immunosuppression.

### Noninfectious granulomatous diseases of the chest [^6f48baf1]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Granulomas are pathologically defined as focal aggregations of activated macrophages, Langerhans cells, and lymphocytes. Granulomas form in the lungs when the immune system barricades the substances it perceives as foreign but is unable to remove. Granulomas manifest with numerous imaging appearances in thoracic radiology, and their presence is a nonspecific finding. Granulomatous lung diseases comprise multiple entities with variable clinical manifestations and outcomes. Their imaging findings are rarely specific and can mimic malignancies, often triggering an extensive diagnostic workup. Radiologists must be familiar with the clinical manifestations and imaging findings of these entities to generate appropriate differential diagnoses. This review describes the imaging manifestations of various noninfectious, necrotizing, and nonnecrotizing granulomatous diseases that primarily affect the thorax. © RSNA, 2020.

### Sarcoidosis [^ff14ee4f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by granuloma formation in affected organs, most often in the lungs. Patients frequently suffer from cough, shortness of breath, chest pain and pronounced fatigue and are at risk of developing lung fibrosis or irreversible damage to other organs. The disease develops in genetically predisposed individuals with exposure to an as-yet unknown antigen. Genetic factors affect not only the risk of developing sarcoidosis but also the disease course, which is highly variable and difficult to predict. The typical T cell accumulation, local T cell immune response and granuloma formation in the lungs indicate that the inflammatory response in sarcoidosis is induced by specific antigens, possibly including self-antigens, which is consistent with an autoimmune involvement. Diagnosis can be challenging for clinicians because of the potential for almost any organ to be affected. As the aetiology of sarcoidosis is unknown, no specific treatment and no pathognomic markers exist. Thus, improved biomarkers to determine disease activity and to identify patients at risk of developing fibrosis are needed. Corticosteroids still constitute the first-line treatment, but new treatment strategies, including those targeting quality-of-life issues, are being evaluated and should yield appropriate, personalized and more effective treatments.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^f97d7ef3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized but is based on three major criteria: a compatible clinical presentation, finding nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in one or more tissue samples, and the exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous disease. There are no universally accepted measures to determine if each diagnostic criterion has been satisfied; therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure. Methods: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize the best available evidence. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Recommendations for or against various diagnostic tests were formulated and graded after the expert panel weighed desirable and undesirable consequences, certainty of estimates, feasibility, and acceptability. Results: The clinical presentation, histopathology, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses were summarized. On the basis of the available evidence, the expert committee made 1 strong recommendation for baseline serum calcium testing, 13 conditional recommendations, and 1 best practice statement. All evidence was very low quality. Conclusions: The panel used systematic reviews of the evidence to inform clinical recommendations in favor of or against various diagnostic tests in patients with suspected or known sarcoidosis. The evidence and recommendations should be revisited as new evidence becomes available.

### Diagnosis and management of sarcoidosis [^0d4dee28]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in any organ, most commonly the lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis should be suspected in any young or middle-aged adult presenting with unexplained cough, shortness of breath, or constitutional symptoms, especially among blacks or Scandinavians. Diagnosis relies on three criteria: (1) a compatible clinical and radiologic presentation, (2) pathologic evidence of noncaseating granulomas, and (3) exclusion of other diseases with similar findings, such as infections or malignancy. An early and accurate diagnosis of sarcoidosis remains challenging, because initial presentations may vary, many patients are asymptomatic, and there is no single reliable diagnostic test. Prognosis is variable and depends on epidemiologic factors, mode of onset, initial clinical course, and specific organ involvement. The optimal treatment for sarcoidosis remains unclear, but corticosteroid therapy has been the mainstay of therapy for those with significantly symptomatic or progressive pulmonary disease or serious extrapulmonary disease. Refractory or complex cases may require immunosuppressive therapy. Despite aggressive treatment, some patients may develop life-threatening pulmonary, cardiac, or neurologic complications from severe, progressive disease. End-stage disease may ultimately require lung or heart transplantation for eligible patients.

Outstanding questions

There is a need for better quality evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of GLILD, define the clinical course of the disease, and monitor pulmonary nodules. Unmet needs that require further research include the following:

- Developing preclinical models for studies of GLILD pathogenesis and treatment.
- Facilitating funding and promoting the development and conduct of clinical trials in GLILD to determine the efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory therapy.
- Building large, multisite, rigorously-phenotyped GLILD patient cohorts with long-term clinical and biological data.
- Additionally, there is a need for integrated studies in GLILD using omics data to enhance risk stratification and personalized therapeutic strategies.

### Sarcoidosis [^ca0fe4bd]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown cause characterized by granulomatous inflammation. Although the lung is almost universally involved, any organ can be affected. Complex pathogenesis and protean clinical manifestations are additional features of the disease. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, although the presence of noncaseating granulomas at disease sites is a prerequisite in most cases. The management of sarcoidosis requires a multidisciplinary approach, particularly when the heart, the brain, or the eyes are involved. The paucity of effective therapies and the lack of reliable predictors of disease behavior greatly contribute to making sarcoidosis a challenging disease to manage.

### Pathology of granulomatous pulmonary diseases [^5a35490d]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

Because granulomas are represented in almost every disease category, the number of clinically and pathologically important granulomatous pulmonary diseases is large. Their diagnosis by pathologists is particularly challenging because of their nonspecificity. A specific diagnosis can be achieved only when a granuloma-inciting agent(s) (eg, acid-fast bacilli, fungi, foreign bodies, etc) are identified microscopically or by culture; this does not occur in most cases. Furthermore, a specific diagnosis cannot be reached in a high percentage of cases. Although sarcoidosis and infectious diseases account for approximately half of pulmonary granulomatous diseases worldwide, there is significant geographic variation in their prevalence.

Objectives —

To present updated information to serve as a guide to pathologic diagnosis of pulmonary granulomatous diseases, to address some commonly held misconceptions and to stress the importance of multidisciplinary coordination. Presentation of basic aspects of granulomas is followed by discussion of specific disease entities, such as tuberculous and nontuberculous Mycobacterial infections, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic infections, sarcoidosis, necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis, berylliosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hot tub lung, rheumatoid nodule, bronchocentric granulomatosis, aspirated, inhaled, and embolized foreign bodies, drug-induced granulomas, chronic granulomatous disease, common variable immunodeficiency, and granulomatous lesions associated with various types of cancer.

Data Sources —

Review of pertinent medical literature using the PubMed search engine and the author's practical experience.

Conclusions —

Although the diagnosis of granulomatous lung diseases continues to present significant challenges to pathologists, the information presented in this review can be helpful in overcoming them. The importance of multidisciplinary coordination in cases where morphologic diagnosis is not possible cannot be overstated.

Regarding specific circumstances for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (diagnostic imaging), SHARE initiative 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain CXR in all patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, followed by chest CT in case of abnormal findings or if the clinical concern of lung involvement remains despite a normal CXR.

### The role of PET in the management of sarcoidosis [^26ba1c86]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The hallmark of sarcoidosis is granulomatous inflammation because of a dysregulated response of the immune system. Once initiated, the resultant organ damage is dependent upon the intensity and duration of the persistent granulomatous inflammation. Given that the lungs are affected in about 90% of individuals, the pulmonary system garners much attention but sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease. With the potential to damage any organ system, identifying and localizing active inflammation in different systems can direct management. PET has emerged as a tool to detect inflammation in patients with sarcoidosis that may not be easily recognized by physical examination or methods of assessment currently used in clinical practice. In this current opinion, we hope to present the role of PET in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis, the advantages and drawbacks of PET, and outline areas of further research.

### Pulmonary necrotizing granulomas of unknown cause: clinical and pathologic analysis of 131 patients with completely resected nodules [^c99434c7]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The cause of pulmonary necrotizing granulomas is often unclear, even after histologic examination. Our aim was to determine the clinical significance of histologically unexplained necrotizing granulomas.

Methods

Pulmonary necrotizing granulomas surgically resected at the Mayo Clinic (1994–2004) were retrieved and reviewed retrospectively. Cases in which a cause was evident at the time of initial histologic examination were excluded. The analysis cohort comprised 131 completely resected histologically unexplained pulmonary necrotizing granulomas. Clinical and laboratory information was abstracted from medical records, chest CT scans were reviewed, histologic slides were reexamined, and additional ancillary studies were performed in selected cases.

Results

A cause was determined on review in more than one-half of the histologically unexplained necrotizing granulomas (79 of 131, 60%) by reexamining histologic slides (47), incorporating the results of cultures (26), fungal serologies (14), and other laboratory studies (eight), and correlating histologic findings with clinical and radiologic information (13). Infections accounted for the majority (64 of 79), the most common being histoplasmosis (37) and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections (18). Noninfectious diagnoses (15 of 79) were rheumatoid nodule (five), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener) (five), sarcoidosis (four), and chronic granulomatous disease (one). Many cases remained unexplained even after extensive review (52 of 131, 40%). Most of these patients received no medical therapy and did not progress clinically or develop new nodules (median follow-up, 84 months).

Conclusions

A cause, the most common being infection, can be established in many surgically resected pulmonary necrotizing granulomas that appear unexplained at the time of initial histologic diagnosis. Patients whose granulomas remain unexplained after a rigorous review have a favorable outcome. Most do not develop new nodules or progress clinically, even without medical therapy.

### Granulomatous lung disease: an approach to the differential diagnosis [^b7aeb669]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Granulomas are among the most commonly encountered abnormalities in pulmonary pathology and often pose a diagnostic challenge. Although most pathologists are aware of the need to exclude an infection in this setting, there is less familiarity with the specific histologic features that aid in the differential diagnosis.

Objective

To review the differential diagnosis, suggest a practical diagnostic approach, and emphasize major diagnostically useful histologic features. This review is aimed at surgical pathologists who encounter granulomas in lung specimens.

Data Sources

Pertinent recent and classic peer-reviewed literature retrieved from PubMed (US National Library of Medicine) and primary material from the institutions of both authors.

Conclusions

Most granulomas in the lung are caused by mycobacterial or fungal infection. The diagnosis requires familiarity with the tissue reaction as well as with the morphologic features of the organisms, including appropriate interpretation of special stains. The major noninfectious causes of granulomatous lung disease are sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hot tub lung, aspiration pneumonia, and talc granulomatosis.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^11a50d50]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Atypical granulomas closely mimic PLCs in morphological features, posing a great challenge in differentiation. CECT scans could provide important information about the lesions, which is crucial for their differential diagnosis. In younger (≤ 63 years) patients with diabetes, an irregular SN exhibiting lower density (≤ 21 HU) in non-enhanced CT and a non-moderate enhancement pattern should first be considered as granulomas. Understanding the clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas and PLCs is beneficial for accurately identifying them and reducing unnecessary surgical resections.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^083fb242]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

On non-enhanced CT images, it was found that granulomas more frequently exhibited lower density (≤ 21 HU), which may be closely associated with their tendency for necrosis. Thus, the non-enhanced CT value of lesions could be considered as a potentially valuable predictive indicator in distinguishing between granulomas and PLCs. This finding has not been highlighted in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant nodules in previous studies. It suggests that for clinically indeterminate SNs, measuring the CT value on non-enhanced CT images is essential. A lower non-enhanced CT value indicates a greater likelihood that the nodule is a granuloma.

Various enhancement patterns observed on CECT images are useful in differentiating pulmonary SNs. This study found that granulomas displayed five distinct patterns of enhancement, which may be closely related to their pathological changes at different stages, offering crucial clues for better differentiation. Granulomas in the active phase typically exhibit a rich blood supply, which diminishes as they mature due to vascular regression and necrosis. Thus, they may show severe enhancement, mild enhancement, and no significant enhancement, consistent with previous findings. Additionally, due to frequent necrosis, they may initially present significant enhancement accompanied by a well-defined area without enhancement due to focal necrosis, and subsequently exhibit rim enhancement due to a larger area of necrosis surrounded by fibrotic tissue.

### Sarcoidosis from head to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^dbb68b59]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder characterized by development of noncaseating granulomas in various organs. Although the etiology of this condition is unclear, environmental and genetic factors may be substantial in its pathogenesis. Clinical features are often nonspecific, and imaging is essential to diagnosis. Abnormalities may be seen on chest radiographs in more than 90% of patients with thoracic sarcoidosis. Symmetric hilar and mediastinal adenopathy and pulmonary micronodules in a perilymphatic distribution are characteristic features of sarcoidosis. Irreversible pulmonary fibrosis may be seen in 25% of patients with the disease. Although sarcoidosis commonly involves the lungs, it can affect virtually any organ in the body. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/CT are useful in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis, but imaging features may overlap with those of other conditions. Familiarity with the spectrum of multimodality imaging findings of sarcoidosis can help to suggest the diagnosis and guide appropriate management. © RSNA, 2018.

### Should CT play a greater role in preventing the resection of granulomas in the era of PET? [^fa02e273]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

PET cannot distinguish between bronchogenic carcinoma and granuloma, but positive scans may prompt surgery. We systematically evaluated the CT appearance of resected carcinomas and granulomas to identify features that could be used to reduce granuloma resections.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively identified 93 consecutive patients between January 2005 and November 2008 who had resection of a pulmonary nodule pathologically diagnosed as bronchogenic carcinoma or granuloma and preoperative imaging with CT and PET. Each nodule was evaluated on CT for size, doubling time, location, borders, shape, internal characteristics, calcification, clustering, air bronchograms, and cavitation. A diagnostic impression was rendered. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed. Pre-PET data regarding the proportion of resected granulomas and carcinomas between January 1995 and December 1996 were reviewed.

Results

Sixty-eight percent (65/96) of nodules were carcinomas and 32% (31/96) were granulomas. The CT impression was benign in 65% (20/31) of granulomas and 5% (3/65) of carcinomas (p < 0.0001; negative predictive value [NPV], 87% [20/23]). Specific CT features significantly associated with granuloma were clustering, cavitation, irregular shape, lack of pleural tags, and solid attenuation. The combination of nonspiculated borders, irregular shape, and solid attenuation had an NPV of 86% (12/14). Granulomas represented 18% (9/50) of resected nodules in 1995 and 1996 (p = 0.066).

Conclusion

CT findings reduce but cannot eliminate the possibility that a nodule is malignant. Outcomes-based clinical trials are needed to determine whether CT features of benignity can guide less-invasive initial management and reverse a concerning trend in granuloma resection.

### Sarcoidosis [^5bfb3dff]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sarcoidosis:

- **Definition**: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by the formation of immune granulomas in various organs, primarily the lungs and lymphatic system.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of sarcoidosis involves an exaggerated immune response leading to the formation of granulomas. This response is triggered by specific antigens, possibly including self-antigens, suggesting an autoimmune involvement. Genetic factors also play a significant role in the risk of developing sarcoidosis and the course of the disease.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of sarcoidosis in the US is estimated at 10.75 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for sarcoidosis include genetic predisposition and exposure to certain environmental agents. Specific genetic risk factors have been identified, such as the association of chromosome 11q13.1 with sarcoidosis susceptibility in Europeans. Environmental and occupational exposures, such as insecticides, agricultural employment, and microbial bioaerosols, have also been associated with sarcoidosis risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of sarcoidosis is highly variable and unpredictable. It can range from asymptomatic cases, where abnormalities are incidentally discovered on chest radiographs, to severe cases with multi-organ involvement. Respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and chest tightness, are common. Non-respiratory signs and symptoms related to the disease or of uncertain origin, such as fatigue, may also occur.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of sarcoidosis is diverse. While spontaneous remission occurs in approximately two-thirds of patients, up to 30% may have a chronic course of the disease, resulting in progressive (sometimes life-threatening) loss of lung function.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^ee48dd80]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The wide application of computerized tomography (CT) in clinical practice has resulted in a significant increase in the detection of pulmonary nodules. Detected nodules are mainly classified as solid nodules (SNs) and sub-solid nodules (SSNs) based on their density difference. Currently, there have been extensive studies on the radiological identification of SSNs, while the differentiation of SNs remains a significant challenge due to their diverse etiology and complex CT characteristics. Most SNs are benign, and do not require immediate surgical intervention. In contrast, malignant ones are often associated with higher malignant potential and poorer prognosis than SSNs. Thus, accurate diagnosis of SNs is helpful for selecting appropriate treatment options for patients.

Peripheral lung cancers (PLCs) represent the most common malignant SNs, whereas granulomas are a relatively common type of benign SN. A previous study indicated that the CT features between necrotizing granulomas and lung cancers are indistinguishable, and tissue diagnosis is necessary. Furthermore, both granulomas and PLCs were frequently associated with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Thus, granulomas are often misdiagnosed as PLCs due to their similarities. Although calcification and satellite lesions are typical indicators in tuberculous granulomas, and halo signs are relatively specific in fungal granulomas, there are still a considerable number of granulomas lacking these typical CT features.

Given that atypical granulomas may be more difficult to distinguish from PLCs, it is essential to further differentiate them to guide clinical treatment effectively. However, specific studies focusing on this aspect have not yet been conducted. This study aimed to explore the clinical and CT indicators that can help differentiate between these two entities.

### Does PET-CT have a role in the evaluation of tuberculosis treatment in phase 2 clinical trials? [^d61d4ea3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

[18F]-FDG PET-CT MEASURES THE METABOLIC ACTIVITY OF PATHOGEN AND HOST

Multimodal animal models combining PET-CT, immunology, microbiology, and histology have shown that M tuberculosis infection triggers a dynamic process where bacterial activity is pitted against immunologic control, resulting in a spectrum of disease phenotypes. When tuberculous granulomas form, they can recede in size and avidity to the point of resolving completely, or they can stagnate or progress, depending on the immune characteristics at the time of granuloma formation in the host. Since [18F]-FDG is taken up by all metabolically active cells, avid lesions on PET-CT may represent metabolic activity of multiplying M tuberculosis and/or immune control of the infection. Regardless, data from several animal models show that metabolic activity in lungs or the thoracic cavity correlates with mycobacterial burden in lung tissue.

### Differential transcriptomics in sarcoidosis lung and lymph node granulomas with comparisons to pathogen-specific granulomas [^820e0194]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by the formation of granulomatous lesions, especially in lung tissues and thoracic lymph nodes. The clinical heterogeneity and unpredictable disease course in sarcoidosis represents a challenge in early diagnosis and prediction of progression. Despite significant progress in the understanding of genetic predisposition and role of immunity in sarcoidosis pathogenesis, predicting the clinical course of sarcoidosis in a given patient remains challenging. The majority of sarcoidosis patients experience spontaneous recovery, however, fully a third of subjects develop complicated sarcoidosis defined as multiorgan involvement, progressive fibrotic lung involvement and pulmonary function deterioration. Validated sarcoidosis biomarkers are desperately needed to distinguish patients who will spontaneously recover from patients who will worsen and develop severe manifestations of the disease. Thus, personalized medicine approaches are tasked with the capacity to predict the patient phenotype likely to develop progressive disease or that may eventually require lung transplantation. While there has been progress in identifying genetic variants that contribute to complicated sarcoidosis, and we have previously utilized genomic expression profiling of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to subphenotype patients with a variety of inflammatory disorders including sarcoidosis, there remains an important and unmet need for molecular and specific genome-based biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of disease severity in sarcoidosis.

### Necrotizing granuloma of the lung: imaging characteristics and imaging-guided diagnosis [^12b6cb3e]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess CT findings and the sensitivities of imaging-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and core needle biopsy in the diagnosis of necrotizing granuloma of the lung.

Conclusions

The CT characteristics of necrotizing granuloma are indistinguishable from those of malignant tumors; tissue diagnosis therefore is necessary. Core needle biopsy is a sensitive method for diagnosing necrotizing granuloma of the lung, but FNA biopsy is insufficient for diagnosis.

### Causes of pulmonary granulomas: a retrospective study of 500 cases from seven countries [^f1456f81]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The frequencies of various causes of pulmonary granulomas in pathological material are unknown, as is the influence of geographical location on aetiology. The aim of this study was to identify the causes of pulmonary granulomas in pathological specimens, to define their frequencies, and to determine whether these causes vary by geographical location.

Methods

500 lung biopsies and resections containing granulomas were reviewed retrospectively by expert pulmonary pathologists from 10 institutions in seven countries. Fifty consecutive cases from each location were assigned a diagnosis based on histological features and available clinical/microbiological data.

Results

A specific cause was identified in 58% of cases (290/500), most commonly sarcoidosis (136, 27%) and mycobacterial or fungal infections (125, 25%). Mycobacteria were identified in 19% of cases outside the USA versus 8% within the USA. In contrast, fungi accounted for 19% cases in the USA versus 4% in other locations. Fungi were mostly detected by histology, whereas most mycobacteria were identified in cultures. In 42% of cases (210/500) an aetiology could not be determined.

Conclusions

Across several geographical settings, sarcoidosis and infections are the most common causes of pulmonary granulomas diagnosed in pathological specimens. Fungi are more commonly identified than mycobacteria in the USA, whereas the reverse is true in other countries. A definite aetiology cannot be demonstrated in more than a third of all cases of pulmonary granulomas, even after histological examination. These findings highlight the need to submit material for histology as well as cultures in all cases in which granulomatous disease enters the differential diagnosis.

### Evaluating the patient with a pulmonary nodule: a review [^40fb012a]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million patients per year in the US and are detected on approximately 30% of computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest. Optimal treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule can lead to early detection of cancer while minimizing testing for a benign nodule.

Observations

At least 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified are benign, most often granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Smaller nodules are more likely to be benign. Pulmonary nodules are categorized as small solid (< 8 mm), larger solid (≥ 8 mm), and subsolid. Subsolid nodules are divided into ground-glass nodules (no solid component) and part-solid (both ground-glass and solid components). The probability of malignancy is less than 1% for all nodules smaller than 6 mm and 1% to 2% for nodules 6 mm to 8 mm. Nodules that are 6 mm to 8 mm can be followed with a repeat chest CT in 6 to 12 months, depending on the presence of patient risk factors and imaging characteristics associated with lung malignancy, clinical judgment about the probability of malignancy, and patient preferences. The treatment of an individual with a solid pulmonary nodule 8 mm or larger is based on the estimated probability of malignancy; the presence of patient comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease; and patient preferences. Management options include surveillance imaging, defined as monitoring for nodule growth with chest CT imaging, positron emission tomography-CT imaging, nonsurgical biopsy with bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy, and surgical resection. Part-solid pulmonary nodules are managed according to the size of the solid component. Larger solid components are associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Ground-glass pulmonary nodules have a probability of malignancy of 10% to 50% when they persist beyond 3 months and are larger than 10 mm in diameter. A malignant nodule that is entirely ground glass in appearance is typically slow growing. Current bronchoscopy and transthoracic needle biopsy methods yield a sensitivity of 70% to 90% for a diagnosis of lung cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million people per year in the US and approximately 30% of chest CT images. The treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule should be guided by the probability that the nodule is malignant, safety of testing, the likelihood that additional testing will be informative, and patient preferences.

### Methods for staging non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^ccec6bd4]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Non-small cell lung cancer staging — PET scanning fundamentals and limitations: Standardized quantitative criteria for an abnormal PET scan in the mediastinum are lacking; although a standard uptake value of ≥ 2.5 is sometimes used (based on peripheral masses ≥ 2 cm), its applicability to mediastinal nodes is questioned, and the lower limit of spatial resolution is approximately 7 to 10 mm. Nonneoplastic granulomatous/inflammatory diseases and infections may yield positive PET findings, and certain well-differentiated low-grade malignancies (adenocarcinoma in situ, well-differentiated invasive adenocarcinomas, typical carcinoid tumors) are known to have a higher risk of FN results.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^43206436]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

At our institution, incidentally detected indeterminate SNs (≥ 8 mm) are managed according to a standardized diagnostic protocol. Initial management involves a 3-month CT follow-up. Nodules showing growth during follow-up undergo further evaluation with CT-guided core needle biopsy or surgical resection, while stable nodules are assessed by contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) or biopsy. Histologically confirmed malignancies typically proceed to surgical intervention, with PET-CT employed for preoperative staging to assess the extent of disease and guide treatment planning. Biopsy-negative cases with benign CT findings enter extended imaging surveillance. Lesions with discordant results (malignant CT features despite negative biopsy) are managed through multidisciplinary discussion, incorporating patient preferences and clinical risk profiles. Based on this protocol, we retrospectively identified patients who underwent surgical resection of pulmonary lesions from October 2019 to July 2024 through the Pathology Information System (PIS). The enrolled patients required the following conditions to be satisfied: (1) the lesions were confirmed as granulomas or lung cancers by pathological examination, (2) patients had chest CECT scans within two weeks prior to resection, and (3) the lesions were peripheral SNs (diameter ≤ 30 mm) on CT images. The excluded patients required the following conditions to be satisfied: (1) patients with both granulomas and lung cancers, (2) absence of thin-section CT images (≤ 1.5 mm), (3) presence of significant noise on CT images, (4) the nodules had calcification, satellite lesions, or halo sign, and (5) the diameter of the nodules was < 8 mm. The study initially included a final cohort of 183 patients with 204 atypical granulomas manifested as SNs. Considering the potential correlation between the diameter of SNs and their CT features, a control group of PLCs was randomly selected to match the granulomas by size. This was achieved by individually pairing nodules of similar dimensions and applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria at a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a total of 195 patients with 204 PLCs (Fig. 1).

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^346be906]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Histopathology

Given that the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis are often nonspecific, histological evaluation of tissue granulomas is often required to establish the diagnosis. Histological features that are typical of a sarcoidosis granuloma include the presence of well-formed, concentrically arranged layers of immune cells, most prominent being the central core of macrophage aggregates and multinucleated giant cells. An outer layer of loosely organized lymphocytes, mostly T cells, is often observed with a few interposed dendritic cells. In some cases, the granulomas are surrounded by isolated collections of B lymphocytes. Sarcoidosis granulomas are most often nonnecrotic; however, variants of sarcoidosis, particularly the nodular pulmonary sarcoidosis phenotype, can present with a mixture of necrotic and nonnecrotic granulomas.

The differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases is broad, as noted in the next section. Table 2 and Figure 1 provide histopathological features that are useful for discriminating sarcoidosis from other causes, although histopathologic features alone cannot distinguish sarcoidosis from other granulomatous diseases. Certain granulomatous diseases may have similar histological features, such as berylliosis (chronic beryllium disease).

Table 2.
Key Pathological Features of Sarcoidosis

(A) Typical sarcoidosis histology with well-formed granulomas comprised of macrophage aggregates (G) and featuring multinucleated giant cells (white arrows, inset), with minimal surrounding lymphocytic inflammation (L). (B) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis featuring smaller granulomas (G) with more extensive surrounding lymphocytic alveolitis (L). (C) A large acellular necrotizing granuloma (NG) caused by pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum infection.

Exclusion of alternative causes

To ensure diagnostic accuracy of sarcoidosis, the differential diagnosis must be considered and alternative diagnoses reliably excluded during the initial diagnostic evaluation or in presumed established sarcoidosis cases with atypical clinical features, such as those refractory to immune suppression treatment. Although tissue histopathology may reveal an alternative diagnosis (Figure 1), granulomas found in patients with sarcoidosis have no unique histologic features to differentiate them from all other granulomatous diseases. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis, therefore, requires a complete history and physical examination and, when indicated, additional testing to exclude other disorders, especially those that also produce granulomas. The differential diagnosis of sarcoidosis is typically categorized into granulomatous disorders of infectious and noninfectious causes (Table 3 provides representative examples of each). An alternative schema classifies these diagnoses according to the affected organ system(s) (Table 4).

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^dd852eea]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To standardize organ involvement in sarcoidosis, consensus criteria were originally established in 1999 and updated in 2014. These instruments assumed that the patient had known sarcoidosis, and assessed the probability of specific organ involvement. The 2014 document was sponsored by the World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders. In that document, the criteria for sarcoidosis involvement of each organ were established on the basis of consensus among sarcoidosis experts using a structured Delphi methodology, and the confidence of organ involvement was further qualified on a scale of highly probable, probable, or possible. Consensus for a specific criterion was considered achieved if more than 70% of the experts agreed. Some clinical features failed to reach a consensus. Two recent reports using similar methodology from groups of sarcoidosis experts have developed clinical criteria for the diagnosis of cardiac and neurologic sarcoidosis.

Table 1 provides a summary of clinical features and related relative probabilities supporting a diagnosis of sarcoidosis based on history, physical examination, imaging, and laboratory testing. This table is not an exhaustive list of the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis, but encompasses clinical features of sarcoidosis that are relatively common and specific enough to inform the clinical suspicion of the disease. In recognition of the central role of imaging during the initial assessment of interstitial lung diseases, as briefly summarized in Table 1, we refer the interested reader to a more comprehensive review of this topic. This table has also simplified certain criteria from the more detailed World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders document, such as by combining various forms of uveitis under one heading.

Table 1.
Clinical Features Supportive of a Diagnosis of Sarcoidosis

Table 1 does not account for the presence of multiple clinical features for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis that may reinforce the diagnosis of sarcoidosis beyond that when only one feature is present. Nevertheless, we endorse the proposed list of clinical features to aid clinicians during the initial diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected sarcoidosis.

### The spectrum of pulmonary sarcoidosis: variations of high-resolution CT findings and clues for specific diagnosis [^631cd454]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown cause, characterized by widespread non-caseating granulomas. There is a wide spectrum of radiologic manifestations in pulmonary sarcoidosis, providing challenges to radiologists. However, recognition of the key features of sarcoidosis with knowledge of its pathologic background can often allow for specific diagnosis. In this review, we describe the variety of high-resolution CT findings in pulmonary sarcoidosis along with its pathologic features as the basis for radiographic manifestations, and discuss the key features on high-resolution CT for the specific diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis.

### Cavitary lung diseases: a clinical-radiologic algorithmic approach [^4d5e8b3c]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Cavities occasionally are encountered on thoracic images. Their differential diagnosis is large and includes, among others, various infections, autoimmune conditions, and primary and metastatic malignancies. We offer an algorithmic approach to their evaluation by initially excluding mimics of cavities and then broadly classifying them according to the duration of clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities. An acute or subacute process (< 12 weeks) suggests common bacterial and uncommon nocardial and fungal causes of pulmonary abscesses, necrotizing pneumonias, and septic emboli. A chronic process (≥ 12 weeks) suggests mycobacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections; malignancy (primary lung cancer or metastases); or autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Although a number of radiographic features can suggest a diagnosis, their lack of specificity requires that imaging findings be combined with the clinical context to make a confident diagnosis.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease characterized by a nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammatory process that can progress through various stages of activity. The distinctive histology of sarcoidosis is often associated with various morphologic findings in the lung and other organs. The rare variants, necrotizing sarcoidal granulomas and nodular sarcoidosis, share some of the histologic features of typical sarcoidosis, but may have different clinical and pathologic manifestations. The clinician and pathologist should be aware of the diverse pathologic appearances of sarcoidosis.

### Revisiting the role of the granuloma in tuberculosis [^74b7d22f]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

The granuloma, which is a compact aggregate of immune cells, is the hallmark structure of tuberculosis. It is historically regarded as a host-protective structure that 'walls off' the infecting mycobacteria. This Review discusses surprising new discoveries — from imaging studies coupled with genetic manipulations — that implicate the innate immune mechanisms of the tuberculous granuloma in the expansion and dissemination of infection. It also covers why the granuloma can fail to eradicate infection even after adaptive immunity develops. An understanding of the mechanisms and impact of tuberculous granuloma formation can guide the development of therapies to modulate granuloma formation. Such therapies might be effective for tuberculosis as well as for other granulomatous diseases.

### Noninfectious manifestations and complications of chronic granulomatous disease [^d3c8086a]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Despite advances in medical management of CGD, these important gaps in our understanding of CGD immunopathogenesis remain obstacles to maximizing outcomes for patients. For example, pulmonary involvement remains an important cause of death in this patient population. As patients survive longer, the short- and long-term cumulative effects of repetitive infectious and noninfectious respiratory disorders gain importance. Baseline respiratory burst function correlates with risk of infection, but whether the development of autoimmune or inflammatory complications are similarly correlated remains unclear. In addition, because most noninfectious pulmonary complications occur in adulthood, it would be highly beneficial to identify biomarkers and/or predictors that help us to risk-stratify patients before the development of overt pulmonary signs and symptoms. The development of large clinical registries of patients with a primary immunodeficiency might prove useful in this regard.

In comparison to other vasculitides, the lung is the most common organ involved in wegener granulomatosis presenting with a very aggressive airways pathology and chronic relapsing course. Chest radiographs fail to describe the pattern and distribution of thoracic pathology sufficiently, and CT has shown to be more sensitive for detecting lung involvement. We present the CT findings of 57 patients with wegener granulomatosis and a review of the literature.

For nonfibrotic, or cellular, HP, a confident histopathological diagnosis requires typical features including: 1) a cellular interstitial pneumonia accentuated around small airways ("bronchiolocentric") with 2) a cellular chronic bronchiolitis, 3) a distinctive pattern of granulomatous inflammation, and 4) no histopathological features to suggest a more likely alternative.

### Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis [^25fd494f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis (NSG) is rare. Its various clinical and histological presentations are ambiguous and confusing. Although sometimes limited only to the lungs, other organ systems can be involved. The disease affects primarily women in their late forties but has been documented in children.

Recent Findings

There are two schools of thought regarding the taxonomical position of NSG. Some believe that it is an independent entity, whereas others argue that it is just another manifestation of sarcoidosis. This article will review the available, current and evidence-based information about clinical and basic science aspects of NSG.

Summary

Diagnosis of NSG is perplexing; its pathogenesis is a dilemma. The disease is frequently confused with other processes including malignancy, Wegener's granulomatosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis and lymphoid granulomatosis. Its symptoms are nonspecific and a histology finding of necrotizing granuloma has many causes. Although no specific management tool or strategies are advocated, steroids, surgical resection of localized disease or sometimes watchful waiting are recommended.

### Assessment of advanced diagnostic bronchoscopy outcomes for peripheral lung lesions: a Delphi consensus definition of diagnostic yield and recommendations for patient-centered study designs. An official American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians research statement [^4ebc3044]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Bronchoscopic pathology classification — criteria for specific benign diagnoses versus nondiagnostic results: Panel members agreed that specific benign pathological diagnoses such as benign lung tumors (e.g., hamartoma, lipoma), vasculitis, or amyloidosis, and cytopathological findings suggesting mycotic infection or tuberculosis constitute specific benign diagnoses. Cytopathological findings suggesting bacterial infection may be considered specific benign only with concurrent culture results in an appropriate clinical context; a positive bacterial culture on BAL fluid alone does not typically constitute a specific benign diagnosis. Granulomatous inflammation, whether necrotizing or nonnecrotizing, is believed to be a specific benign diagnosis, though a prior review classified it as nonspecific; in contrast, Kim and colleagues reviewed 226 TTNB samples and found granulomatous inflammation to be a robust indicator of a true negative biopsy with no cancer diagnoses among 81 patients. Table 2 is described as summarizing what constitutes specific malignant or benign diagnoses versus nondiagnostic procedure results; nondiagnostic results include specimens showing only blood, necrosis, normal lung parenchyma, or insufficient tissue, and the findings of atypia and nonspecific pathological findings (including nonspecific inflammation) also constitute nondiagnostic results.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^7e719f1c]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to granulomas, the PLCs mainly displayed moderate (30–59 HU) and heterogeneous enhancement. Similar results were acquired by Swensen et al and Ye et al, who found that the mean ▵CT values of lung cancers were 38.1 HU and 38.7 HU, respectively. Another study by Li et al also revealed that lung cancers frequently exhibit heterogeneous CT perfusion. Pathologically, the newly formed networks of blood vessels in lung cancers increase the tumor blood supply, which is generally lower than that caused by the vasodilatation in active granulomas. Furthermore, ischemic necrosis and fibrosis mixed within the tumor usually lead to uneven blood supply. These characteristics resulted in the relatively uniform enhancement patterns of PLCs.

This study has several limitations that should be considered. Firstly, as a retrospective single-center study, our findings are constrained by the limited sample size. Future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are required to validate these results, and systematic comparison of different machine learning models is also warranted to enhance the robustness of diagnostic predictions. Secondly, the current results on granulomas were primarily based on TB nodules. Therefore, the applicability of our conclusions may be geographically limited, as TB may not be the common cause of granulomas in some regions. Thirdly, the specific etiology of some granulomas remains unclear, primarily due to the retrospective nature of the study. Finally, the analysis and comparison were limited to atypical granulomas and PLCs, so the findings are specifically focused on distinguishing between these two types of lesions. Fourthly, our diagnostic model in this study was developed based on dynamic three-phase images. However, since this approach is not routinely performed in some institutions, the application of the present findings may be limited. After comparison, the diagnostic model based on the VP performed comparably to the dynamic three phases, and the enhancement characteristics of lesions could also be well observed on VP images. Therefore, the VP can be solely used instead of both the arterial and VPs. Finally, the variations in tube voltage settings (110–130 kV) across CT scanners may influence measurements of CT values, while there was no significant difference in the use of kV values between granulomas and PLCs.

### PET scanning and the solitary pulmonary nodule [^e40dbd8f]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The finding of a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph is a common problem in pulmonary medicine and is seen in about 1 in 500 chest radiographs. Of the benign lesions, 80% are infectious granulomas, 10% are hamartomas, and the remaining 10% are caused by a variety of rarer disorders including noninfectious granulomas and other benign tumors. The prevalence of malignancy ranges from 10% to 68% in the literature. Because of the high prevalence of malignancy and the poor survival for lung cancer, early detection, characterization, and directed treatment are important. Positron emission tomography with 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) can play an important role in the evaluation and management of solitary pulmonary nodules. This includes improved characterization of solitary pulmonary nodules with very high negative predictive value and improved staging information when performed in association with CT, especially for nodal staging and identification of unsuspected stage IV disease. PET also provides additional information for management of solitary pulmonary nodules by estimating the probability of malignancy.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^eec88614]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to make recommendations that address uncertainties that are commonly confronted by clinicians relating to the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. The target audience is pulmonary, rheumatology, or other clinicians who manage patients with suspected or confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis. This guideline was developed by an ad hoc committee of experts from the American Thoracic Society with guidance from experienced methodologists to objectively identify and summarize the best available evidence. The quality of the evidence was poor in most cases, reflecting the need for additional high-quality research to guide clinical practice. As such, clinicians, patients, payers, and other stakeholders should not consider these recommendations as mandates. Moreover, no guideline or recommendation can consider all potential clinical circumstances. Thus, clinicians are encouraged to apply the recommendations within the clinical context of each individual patient, including the patient's values and preferences, and on the basis of regional factors, such as the prevalence of alternative diagnoses or consideration of alternative diagnostic approaches when the preferred diagnostic modality is unavailable.

### Noninfectious manifestations and complications of chronic granulomatous disease [^1acaf4e1]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

No specific evidence-based guidelines regarding the monitoring and management of noninfectious complications of patients with CGD currently exist, which underscores an important knowledge gap that requires future research. With respect to pulmonary complications, 1 group proposed computed tomography of the chest every 2 years with specific pulmonary evaluation once per year and chest radiography and pulmonary function tests performed more frequently as part of routine monitoring; the risk/benefit ratio of this monitoring scheme is uncertain. One important question that remains unanswered is whether aggressive antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment affect the development of noninfectious respiratory manifestations, especially because infections can serve as triggers or occur concomitantly.

The growing body of evidence suggests that carriers of X-linked CGD indeed have an increased risk of clinically significant disease, and further investigation is warranted to better characterize and address such findings. It is notable that the risk of inflammatory disease in carriers does not seem to correlate with oxidative burst function. It also remains unclear if carriers of CGD might be protected from the development of atherosclerotic disease as patients with CGD seem to be. An additional challenge is how to identify asymptomatic carriers, especially if no affected males are in the family. A prospective study screened 120 pediatric patients with IBD using a dihydrorhodamine flow cytometry assay but failed to identify any patients or carriers. This relatively small study highlights the inherent challenges of detecting a relative rare disease even when a test with good sensitivity and specificity is available and the target population is selected appropriately. Last, no evidence-based guidelines are currently available for the short- and long-term management of carriers. Some authors have proposed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis be initiated in carriers when respiratory burst function falls to ≤ 20%, regardless of the presence of symptoms. The optimal management of carriers with autoimmune or inflammatory manifestations remains to be elucidated, and a better understanding of outcomes in these patients in research studies and clinical trials of those with IBD, SLE, and other relevant diseases is needed.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^e2625c1d]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study comprehensively compared the clinical and CT features of atypical granulomas and PLCs, revealing significant differences between these two entities. It was found that some traditional clinical and morphological features of PLCs were not effective for differentiation. In contrast, indicators such as patient age, history of diabetes, history of COPD, lesion shape, lobulation, non-enhanced CT value, and enhancement patterns served as important clues for accurate diagnosis. Specifically, SNs that exhibited lower non-enhanced CT value (≤ 21 HU), irregular shape, and non-moderate enhancement in younger patients (≤ 63 years) with diabetes should first be suspected as granulomas. Given that enhancement features could provide critical information, CECT should be preferred for differentiating them.

Recent studies on diagnostic models for differentiating granulomas from lung cancer have primarily focused on machine learning approaches. Lin et al developed a deep learning model based on radiomic features, achieving an AUC of 0.871, which improved to 0.907 after integrating clinical and imaging features. Beig et al reported lower AUCs of 0.80 and 0.76 based on radiomic and deep learning models, respectively, for distinguishing non-calcified granulomas from lung adenocarcinomas. In contrast, this study established a diagnostic model integrating clinical and CT features to differentiate atypical granulomas from PLCs, with the highest AUC of 0.941, outperforming prior machine learning models. This improvement may be attributed to the fact that previous studies predominantly analyzed single-phase CT images (either non-contrast or contrast-enhanced), thereby lacking critical enhancement characteristics. In contrast, the present study integrates non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT features, enabling more precise characterization of granulomas that exhibit significant pathological heterogeneity across different disease stages.

### Exploring the key clinical and CT characteristics of granulomas mimicking peripheral lung cancers: a case-control study [^0ea36205]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies indicated that clinical risk factors for lung cancer include older age, histories of smoking and COPD, and elevated tumor markers. In this study, patients with PLCs were older and more frequently exhibited COPD, along with higher levels of cytokeratin 19 and CEA, consistent with previous results. However, a history of smoking was not a predictor of PLCs, possibly because it was also a risk factor for granulomas. Additionally, this study identified diabetes as a risk factor for granulomas, which may be related to the fact that granulomas, often caused by TB and fungal infections, are more likely to develop in patients with immunocompromised conditions due to diabetes. Therefore, when differentiating granulomas and PLCs, it is essential to consider the patients' clinical data, particularly the presence of potential immunosuppressive conditions.

Regular SNs with lobulation were highly indicative of lung cancer, especially those with coarse margin, air bronchogram, spiculation, and pleural indentation. In this study, irregular SNs without lobulation were found to be relatively common in granulomas, which is similar to the previous study focused on comparing benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. However, other CT morphological features were not reliable predictors for either granulomas or PLCs. Furthermore, this study found that it was not effective for mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in distinguishing PLCs from granulomas, inconsistent with previous studies on benign and malignant nodules. This may be because both inflammation caused by granuloma and lung cancer metastasis can lead to lymphadenopathy. Consequently, it is challenging to differentiate them based solely on the CT morphological features. Thiessen et al obtained similar results, they found that CT morphological features were insufficient to differentiate granulomas with necrosis from malignant tumors, requiring core needle biopsy for definitive diagnosis. However, the risk of false-negative results associated with needle biopsy necessitates caution. Therefore, integrating additional valuable CT features with biopsy validation is essential, particularly for those stable SNs during follow-up.

Results

Patients' clinical characteristics and pathological natures of lesions

Among 183 patients with granulomas, 17 (9.3%) had multiple lesions (13 with 2 nodules and 4 with 3 nodules), of whom 9 (52.9%) had lesions within the same lobe and 5 (29.4%) had lesions with similar features. In contrast, among 196 patients with PLCs, 8 (4.1%) had 2 nodules, of whom 6 (75.0%) had lesions distributed in the same lobe and 1 (12.5%) had lesions demonstrating similar features. Of the 204 granulomas, 135 (66.2%) were tuberculosis (TB), and 32 (15.7%) were fungal infections, while the remaining 37 (18.1%) cases were determined as inflammatory granulomas but without a determined etiology due to lack of further examination. In comparison, the 204 PLC cases included 163 (79.9%) adenocarcinomas, 30 (14.7%) squamous cell carcinomas, 6 (2.9%) large cell lung cancers, 3 (1.5%) small cell lung cancers, and 2 (1.0%) typical carcinoids.

Table 1 summarizes the patients' clinical characteristics. Patients with granulomas were significantly younger than those with PLCs (p < 0.001). History of diabetes (23.0% vs 9.2%) was significantly more prevalent in patients with granulomas (p < 0.001), while history of COPD (32.7% vs 15.3%) was more common in those with PLCs (p < 0.001). Compared to patients with granulomas, cases with increased cytokeratin 19 (31.1% vs 21.0%) and CEA (17.5% vs 4.5%) were all more common in patients with PLCs (each p < 0.05). ROC analysis revealed the optimal cutoff value of patient age for distinguishing granulomas from PLCs was ≤ 63 years.

### Sarcoidosis [^0be25eaa]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by noncaseating granulomatous infiltration of 1 or more organs. In North America, after the lungs and thoracic lymph nodes, the skin is the next most commonly involved organ. Data from multiple studies indicate a coaction between genetic and environmental factors in immunologically susceptible hosts. The disease's many clinical manifestations and course vary greatly and are influenced by race, ethnicity, and gender. In the skin, the lesions of sarcoidosis are classified as specific when noncaseating granulomas are present, and nonspecific when there is an inflammatory reaction pattern devoid of granulomas.

CHEST HP diagnostic recommendation — For patients with suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), we suggest integrating biopsy findings with clinical and radiological findings to support the diagnosis of HP in the context of the MDD (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Pathologic findings characteristic of HP typically include a combination of cellular and/or fibrosing interstitial pneumonia with bronchiolocentric accentuation, poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas with or without giant cells, with or without peribronchiolar metaplasia, and/or small foci of organizing pneumonia; isolated histopathological findings such as non-necrotizing granulomas or inconspicuous foci of organizing pneumonia can occasionally be seen in other ILDs and are not specific enough for a diagnosis of HP; potential limitations of lung biopsy include interobserver variation in the pathologic interpretation, biopsy size and number of specimens affecting the diagnostic yield of the biopsy procedure, sampling error, and atypical findings such as NSIP or UIP-like patterns; biopsy findings of HP or occasional isolated atypical patterns produced by HP require MDD to confirm the diagnosis.

Interobserver agreement of CT features

Table S1 summarizes the interobserver agreement for the CT features of the lesions. For the continuous variables, agreement for the non-enhanced CT value and the ▵CT value was good (0.750–0.890), and that for nodule size was excellent (≥ 0.900). For the categorical indicators, agreement for shape and air bronchogram was substantial (0.610–0.800), and those for other features were almost perfect (0.810–1.000).

The non-enhanced CT features of lesions

Table 2 summarizes the non-enhanced CT features of lesions. Granulomas were more frequently demonstrated irregular shape (27.0% vs 13.2%) and smooth margin (55.4% vs 38.2%) (each p < 0.05), whereas PLCs more frequently showed lobulation (58.8% vs 34.3%), air bronchogram (53.9% vs 35.8%), and pleural indentation (57.4% vs 39.7%) (each p < 0.05). Additionally, granulomas exhibited lower density in non-enhanced CT than PLCs (median [IQR], 14.50 [7.00–24.00] HU vs 28.00 [20.00–35.00] HU, p < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed the optimal cutoff value of the non-enhanced CT value for distinguishing granulomas from PLCs was ≤ 21 HU.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^d915eb78]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Lung biopsy pattern in suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) — the panel states "we suggest integrating biopsy findings with clinical and radiological findings to support the diagnosis of HP in the context of the MDD (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence)". Pathologic findings characteristic of HP "typically include a combination of cellular and/or fibrosing interstitial pneumonia with bronchiolocentric accentuation, poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas with or without giant cells, with or without peribronchiolar metaplasia, and/or small foci of organizing pneumonia", while "isolated histopathological findings such as non-necrotizing granulomas or inconspicuous foci of organizing pneumonia can occasionally be seen in other ILDs and are not specific enough for a diagnosis of HP". The guideline cautions that "Potential limitations of lung biopsy include interobserver variation in the pathologic interpretation, biopsy size and number of specimens affecting the diagnostic yield of the biopsy procedure, sampling error, and the occasional presence of atypical findings such as NSIP or UIP-like patterns", and that "Biopsy findings of HP or occasional isolated atypical patterns produced by HP require MDD to confirm the diagnosis".

### Noninfectious manifestations and complications of chronic granulomatous disease [^023631d5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

A common presentation for noninfectious events in patients with CGD is granuloma formation, with or without concurrent lymphocytic infiltrate. Lung granulomas can present with obstructive symptoms, depending on their location in the pulmonary tree. These masses have been termed "autoimmune granulomas", because they typically resolve with immunomodulatory therapy. Granulomas are often sterile, although it can be difficult to exclude the presence of an infectious agent despite negative laboratory evaluation results.

Radiologic pulmonary findings are often nonspecific and can reveal consolidation, ground-glass or tree-in-bud opacities, scattered nodules, and bronchiectasis. The radiographic appearance of CGD-associated pulmonary lesions can mimic neoplasm of the lung. CGD, therefore, should be included in the differential diagnosis when abnormal radiologic findings, such as granulomas or masses, are found on chest imaging to minimize diagnostic delay and/or inappropriate therapy. Pathologic findings of CGD-associated inflammatory lung disease are also variable. In the French adult cohort described previously, circumscribed nodules or parenchymal consolidation occurred after a respiratory infection in 7 of 11 patients (6 of 7 after Aspergillus infection), which might indicate a dysregulated response to infection. Biopsy results often reveal granulomas, with or without neutrophilic or eosinophilic microabscesses. Other biopsy findings can include increased reticular or ground-glass opacities without previous evidence of infection.

### Cutaneous involvement in sarcoidosis… [^f5a95a56]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Sarcoidosis is an antigen-mediated disease defined by granuloma formation in different organs. It involves mainly the mediastinal and peripheral lymph nodes, lungs, eyes, skin, liver, and spleen. Cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis may be specific, showing histologically noncaseating granulomas, or nonspecific, most typically erythema nodosum. Frequently, both types of skin lesions are the means of presentation of the disease and may contribute to the diagnosis. A workup for systemic sarcoidosis should be undertaken in every patient with sarcoid cutaneous granulomas. Some types of cutaneous lesions have prognostic significance. Lupus pernio and plaques are associated with more severe systemic involvement and more chronic course, while erythema nodosum is the hallmark of acute and benign disease.

Chronic granulomatous disease

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited PID caused by a genetic defect of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. The mode of inheritance can be X-linked or of autosomal recessive form (Table 3). This defect renders phagocytic cells unable to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are crucial to killing ingested microorganisms. CGD is estimated to occur in ~ 1/200,000–250,000 live births in the USA. The disease is characterized by recurrent life-threatening infections and inflammatory manifestations. The lung is the main affected organ. Pulmonary infections are often severe and invasive aspergillosis represents the major cause of mortality. Chronic non-infectious events may occur in various organs including the lung. Anti-microbial prophylaxis with itraconazole and sulphamethoxazole and improved management of infectious and inflammatory complications have, however, dramatically improved CGD outcomes over the last decades. Patients now easily reach adulthood.

### Evaluation of pulmonary nodules: clinical practice consensus guidelines for Asia [^604789cb]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Asian pulmonary nodule management — adapted considerations: In broad terms, the diagnosis and management of pulmonary nodules in most Asian countries are not substantially different from those performed in Western countries, but evaluation may be affected by differences between regions and by access to diagnostic equipment and sociocultural factors. One key difference from CHEST is the consideration to increase the duration of CT surveillance to 3 years and beyond; the panel acknowledged there is insufficient published evidence supporting this practice and that risks of repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation may not be trivial. The panel also states that populations used to validate models for assessing pretest probability of malignancy (eg, the Mayo Clinic model suggested by CHEST) may be inaccurate in Asia for reasons that include high rates of granulomatous and other infectious diseases, severe air pollution, and lung cancer among nonsmokers.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^10736d32]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — histological lung biopsy: In patients with suspected HP, we suggest considering histological lung biopsy for additional diagnostic evaluation when all available data such as clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings along with bronchoscopic results do not yield a confident diagnosis and results may help guide management (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). When possible, a consensus MDD should be considered before an SLB or TBC; SLB, TBC, and transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) have different diagnostic yields and benefit-risk profiles, and the harm from the procedure must be weighed against the potentially useful information that can be gained, particularly in suspected nonfibrotic or advanced fibrotic HP cases. Some patients with fibrotic HP may show histopathologic findings of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, and samples should be carefully examined for findings consistent with HP (eg, poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas and/or multinucleated giant cells and fibrotic bronchiolocentric accentuation).

### Nuclear imaging in sarcoidosis [^73240f5f]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatosis which may result in a wide variety of clinical and biological presentations. Symptoms are often nonspecific, and incidental abnormal findings on chest radiography is rather common. Although sarcoidosis resolves favorably in most cases, some localizations can provoke functional impairment or even impact on patients' prognosis. The diagnosis is based on a pathological hallmark which is the non-necrotizing epithelioid-cell rich granuloma. Owing to the ability to detect inflammation throughout the body with a high sensibility, FDG-PET/CT gained a central role in sarcoidosis because it can suggest the diagnosis in certain clinical context, guide biopsy, evaluate the extent of the disease, help assess the prognosis, and monitor immunosuppressive therapy. This review will briefly describe clinical and typical findings of conventional imaging according to organ involvement, in order to highlight the additional information provided by nuclear imaging. In the future, we can expect to further improve diagnostic performance of imaging in some indications through the availability of more specific radiopharmaceuticals and the wider use of combined PET/MRI.

The CECT features of lesions

Table 3 summarizes the patterns of enhancement on CECT images. Granulomas more frequently showed no significant enhancement (30.4% vs 0%), rim enhancement (15.2% vs 1.0%), and enhancement with well-defined necrosis (18.6% vs 1.0%) (each p < 0.001), while PLCs exhibited a higher rate of heterogeneous enhancement (85.8% vs 18.1%, p < 0.001). A total of 73 granulomas and 200 PLCs with homogeneous and heterogeneous enhancement were analyzed to evaluate the degree of enhancement. No significant differences in CT values were observed between the 73 granulomas and 200 PLCs exhibiting homogeneous or heterogeneous enhancement, either in AP images (54.00 [41.00–73.00] HU vs 55.00 [39.25–72.00] HU) or VP images (61.00 [40.00–83.00] HU vs 66.50 [53.00–76.75] HU) (each p > 0.05). Among the lesions with homogeneous and heterogeneous enhancement, based on ▵CT P, granulomas had significantly higher incidences of mild enhancement (30.1% vs 11.5%) and severe (47.9% vs 10.0%) enhancement (each p < 0.001), whereas PLCs more frequently showed moderate enhancement (78.5% vs 21.9%, p < 0.001); based on ▵CT A, granulomas demonstrated a higher incidence of severe enhancement (24.7% vs 4.0%, p < 0.001) and PLCs more frequently exhibited moderate enhancement (46.5% vs 24.7%, p = 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in mild enhancement between them (50.7% for granulomas vs 49.5% for PLCs, p = 0.862); based on ▵CT V, granulomas demonstrated a greater incidence of mild enhancement (37.0% vs 20.5%; p = 0.001) and severe enhancement (34.2% vs 8.0%, p < 0.001), while PLCs more frequently exhibited moderate enhancement (71.5% vs 28.8%, p < 0.001).

### Chronic granulomatous disease [^5439b198]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare congenital immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections as well as granuloma formation. The manifestations of this disease can involve single or multiple organ systems. The lungs are the most commonly affected organ; however, lymphatic, hepatic, skeletal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, and central nervous system involvement have also been described. Most patients present with symptoms in their first few years of life. Due to the nonspecific manner in which patients present, the pediatric radiologist may be among the first to recognize the pattern of infection, inflammation, and granuloma formation leading to a diagnosis of CGD. The purpose of this paper is to review the imaging findings of CGD that can manifest throughout the body.

### Determinants of cough-related quality of life in interstitial lung diseases [^6de8c329]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study we showed for the first time, that histological presence of granulomas was associated with the impairment of C-QoL. The difference between patients with and without granulomas was over 4 points measured by the LCQ total score median, which made it a clinically significant result (Fig. 2). There was also bivariate association between the SGRQ and granulomas, probably because the SGRQ included cough questions, although statistical correlation was not seen in the median multivariate regression analysis. Granulomas are unspecific lesions whose appearance do not reveal the etiology or disease unless the inciting agent can be identified within the granuloma, and MDD approach plays the key role when diagnosing granulomatous diseases especially in the field of ILD. In a study including 103 patients with HP, 97% reported cough. 52 patients underwent transbronchial lung biopsy or endobronchial lung biopsy and of them, 30 patients had ill-defined granulomas in histological specimen. In sarcoidosis, it has been shown that neurotrophins and their receptors are stained in granulomas and alveolar macrophages. Still, association between cough and neurotrophins remains unproven. In our study histological findings causing architectural distortion (honeycombing or fibrosis) did not correlate with C-QoL. Granulomas in the lung tissue are usually seen in several processes such as sarcoidosis, pulmonary lymphoid lesions as lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG), granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD), aspiration, exposure associated diseases as HP, vasculitis and in collagen vascular disorders. In our study population, granulomas were found in sarcoidosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, NSIP, and unclassified ILD patients.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^2060b586]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of experts in sarcoidosis was composed to construct clinically important questions related to diagnostic testing for sarcoidosis. Systematic reviews were then performed to inform recommendations that answered each question. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to formulate and grade the strength of the recommendations. The guideline included three patients who participated on the guideline panel and provided perspective on patient values and preferences. A detailed description of the methods, including the implications of the strengths of the recommendation (i.e. strong vs. conditional) and the meaning of best practice statements, are described in the online supplement. The guideline underwent anonymous peer review by four content experts and one methodologist. After multiple cycles of review and revision, the guideline was reviewed and approved by a multidisciplinary board of directors. The guideline will be reviewed by the American Thoracic Society 3 years after publication, and it will be determined if updating is necessary.

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: histopathology [^03f9c617]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Context

The classic histopathology of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP) is well known but variations do occur and at times the diagnosis can be difficult. This is particularly true in the chronic stage of the disease.

Objective

To review the wide variety of histopathologic changes that can be seen in HSP and to offer a practical approach to diagnosis, including the diagnosis of recently described variants of HSP such as the so-called hot tub lung.

Data Sources

This review draws from the author's own experience and a concurrent search of national and international literature.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of HSP can be made with confidence only in light of clinical, serologic, and radiographic data. A particular challenge for pathologists is the recognition of the disease in its chronic stage. In this stage, the identification of poorly formed granulomas in association with (1) a pattern of homogeneous linear fibrosis and (2) irregular fibrosis in a partially peribronchiolar distribution would facilitate the diagnosis.

### Meta-analysis of [F] FDG-PET / CT in pulmonary sarcoidosis [^677cca3b]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease characterised by the growth of non-necrotising granulomas that can accumulate in virtually any organ in the body. The aetiology of the disease remains poorly understood, with a highly variable clinical course. It is estimated to occur in roughly 2 to 160 people per 100,000, with a varied geographic prevalence likely due to a combination of environmental factors and genetic susceptibility. Thoracic involvement affecting the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung parenchyma is the most common disease manifestation. Indeed, symptoms related to this are often the cause of the first presentation. Approximately 60 to 70% with pulmonary disease will see spontaneous resolution of symptoms before any intervention is implemented. However, for patients where the disease persists, severity can range from asymptomatic nodal involvement to a progressive fibrotic process leading to eventual respiratory failure that is difficult to treat. For this reason, the accurate and timely diagnosis of subclinical but active pulmonary sarcoidosis is important.

At present, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized but is generally accepted based on three major criteria: (i) a clinically compatible picture with pathognomonic features, (ii) radiological evidence and (iii) a histological specimen demonstrating non-necrotising granulomatous disease. The diverse spectrum of clinical presentations can make the diagnosis of sarcoidosis challenging for clinicians, particularly when disease activity can vary, and conventional markers are often inconclusive. CT is the standard diagnostic imaging test, with appearances ranging from an almost pathognomonic pattern of mediastinal and hilar nodal enlargement to more nonspecific nodal and pulmonary changes requiring further investigation. Therefore, histological evidence is typically needed establish the final diagnosis.

Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as a sensitive method of detecting sites of inflammation, sometimes before morphological changes are visible on anatomical imaging. FDG PET/CT has an established role in cardiac sarcoidosis diagnosis and assessment of disease activity. It is unclear at present, how FDG PET/CT correlates with pulmonary involvement, lung function and treatment response. To date, no meta-analysis or systematic literature review has been published on this topic. The aim of this meta-analysis of the current literature was to (i) assess the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT for patients with suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis and (ii) determine the correlation between FDG-PET/CT and other clinically relevant biomarkers.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: diagnosis and management of beryllium sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease [^f71430c4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) — diagnostic criteria emphasize that a diagnosis of CBD is based on confirmation of an immune response to beryllium and granulomatous lung inflammation on lung biopsy. Depending on clinical context, probable CBD can be diagnosed using combinations of clinical presentation, exposure history, evidence of BeS, radiographic findings, lung histology, BAL findings, and PFT abnormalities; when BeS is confirmed but biopsy is not done or not possible, imaging consistent with sarcoidosis or a BAL lymphocytosis can support a probable diagnosis. Certain findings such as an abnormal BeLPT or lung granulomas confer greater diagnostic certainty than nonspecific interstitial changes or pulmonary function deficits. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has specific diagnostic criteria for current or former DOE workers applying for compensation due to CBD.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review clinical and radiologic manifestations of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.

Conclusion

Common and well-recognized patterns of infection include cavitary and bronchiectatic disease and infection in AIDS patients. Less common or well-recognized manifestations include nodules or masses mimicking malignancy, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and others. Definitive diagnosis can be difficult and patterns may overlap. Timely diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and knowledge of the spectrum of clinical and radiologic features.

### Inflammatory lesions mimicking chest malignancy: CT, bronchoscopy, EBUS, and PET evaluation from an oncology referral center [^72fd6ca8]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Infective and inflammatory diseases can mimic malignancy of the lung. Granulomatous inflammations are common causes of pulmonary nodule, mass, or nodal disease. Systemic infection or inflammation also commonly involves the lung that may raise suspicion of a malignant process. Even in patients with a known malignancy, inflammatory diseases can simulate new metastasis or disease progression. Knowledge of the imaging features of these diseases is essential to prevent missed or overdiagnosis of malignancy. Radiologists also need to be familiar with the scope and limitations of bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, PET-CT, and biopsy to guide clinical management. In this review, we discuss the imaging features and diagnostic approach of common mimickers of chest malignancy that involve the chest wall, pleura, lung parenchyma, and mediastinal nodes.

Microbiologic criteria can be satisfied by positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples; or positive culture results from at least one bronchial wash or lavage; or transbronchial or other lung biopsy with mycobacterial histologic features (granulomatous inflammation or acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) and positive culture for NTM, or histologic features plus one or more sputum or bronchial washings that are culture positive for NTM. Because isolation may reflect contamination or nonprogressive disease, > 1 positive sputum culture is recommended for diagnostic purposes, and the same NTM species (or subspecies in the case of M. abscessus) should be isolated in ≥ 2 sputum cultures; clinically significant MAC pulmonary disease is unlikely with a single positive sputum culture during the initial evaluation but can be as high as 98% in those with ≥ 2 positive cultures.

### Granulomas in common variable immunodeficiency display different histopathological features compared to other granulomatous diseases [^031e8007]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is an Inborn Error of Immunity characterized by an antibody deficiency. Patients typically suffer from recurrent infections that are relatively well controlled with immunoglobulin replacement therapy and antibiotic treatment. However, a significant number of CVID patients develop additional non-infectious complications, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Granulomatous disease is a serious non-infectious complication that is reported in 8–20% of CVID patients.

Granulomas are aggregates of highly activated immune cells that encapsulate pathogens or substances that are hard to clear. Granulomas can affect every organ, potentially leading to irreversible organ damage if not eradicated. Granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD), and liver granulomas are associated with reduced survival in CVID patients. This is most likely attributed to the ensuing tissue destruction and complications specific to the affected organs. Granulomatous disease in CVID often affects multiple organs per patient, with the lungs, liver and lymph nodes most frequently included.

In CVID, the antigenic trigger that induces granulomas is unknown. Moreover, only little information is available on granuloma structure, and cells contributing to granuloma formation. Serum studies in CVID patients with granulomatous diseases revealed elevated levels of proteins suggestive for involvement of T cells, monocyte or macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. Also B cell aberrations are observed in CVID patients with granulomatous diseases, such as increased CD21low B cells. Interestingly, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab that targets B cells, is reported effective in pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia and for granuloma remission in CVID patients. CVID granulomas rarely resolve without immune modulatory therapies, while the most effective treatment strategies remain uncertain. The lack of a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology underlying granulomas in CVID hinders the development of more effective therapies and specific monitoring tools. This warrants more insight into the immune pathobiology in order to optimize effective clinical care.

### Evaluation of pulmonary nodules: clinical practice consensus guidelines for Asia [^1ef24189]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of pulmonary nodules — Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines for Asia — adapts those of CHEST to provide consensus-based recommendations relevant to practitioners in Asia and notes that evaluation in Asia broadly follows CHEST "with important caveats". Practitioners "should be aware of the risk of lung cancer caused by high levels of indoor and outdoor air pollution", the "high incidence of adenocarcinoma in female nonsmokers", and that "the high prevalence of granulomatous disease and other infectious causes of pulmonary nodules need to be considered"; therefore, "diagnostic risk calculators developed in non-Asian patients may not be applicable" and "longer surveillance of nodules than those recommended by CHEST should be considered". TB in Asia "favors lesser reliance on PET scanning and greater use of nonsurgical biopsy over surgical diagnosis or surveillance", and practitioners in Asia are "encouraged to use these adapted consensus guidelines to facilitate consistent evaluation of pulmonary nodules".

### Pulmonary hyalinising granuloma: a rare and elusive cause of multiple lung nodules [^2444ca26]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 72-year-old woman was referred with incidentally detected multiple lung nodules, one of which was identified as 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid on positron emission tomography. Extensive workup followed, including numerous radiographs, surveillance scans and a CT-guided biopsy which demonstrated chronic inflammation only. Following a wedge-resection, a diagnosis of pulmonary hyalinising granuloma (PHG) was made. PHG is a cause of FDG-avid single or multiple pulmonary nodules and can mimic lung cancer or metastatic disease radiologically. The diagnosis is often difficult to make with minimally invasive techniques such as needle-guided biopsies which do not tend to yield the diagnosis and requires surgical resection for definitive diagnosis and exclusion of malignancy.

### Silicosarcoidosis: histologic and clinical features of an occupational granulomatous disease [^2879c83d]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. Growing evidence indicates that occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) is associated with an increased incidence of sarcoidosis. Yet a diagnosis of sarcoidosis rarely prompts investigation to identify preventable exposures. We sought to elucidate features that identify this important clinical syndrome of silicosarcoidosis. We assembled a multinational case series of workers with sarcoidosis who also reported occupational RCS exposure. We characterized clinical and histopathologic findings using a standardized instrument. We also assessed lung specimens using a novel quantitative microscopy technique to measure birefringent dust density in silicosarcoidosis cases and compared them to control groups. We identified 35 silicosarcoidosis cases (97% male, mean age 48 years) from the United States, Israel, and Taiwan who reported 21 ± 9 years of RCS exposure. On histology scoring, 25/29 (86%) had granulomas and 17/18 (94%) with evaluable lung tissue had lymphocytic inflammation and/or lymphoid aggregates. Common lung interstitial findings included silicotic nodules (39%), mixed‐dust macules/nodules (44%), and birefringent dust (50%). Quantitative birefringent dust density was significantly greater (p < 0.001) in silicosarcoidosis cases compared with healthy controls (147 ± 179 vs. 12 ± 9 particles/mm 2) but lower than in coal miners with silica‐related progressive massive fibrosis (623 ± 777). We found significant differences in the frequency of histologic abnormalities in large versus small biopsy specimens, with fewer findings of RCS exposure in smaller tissue samples. The use of the term silicosarcoidosis should enhance recognition of this significant exposure‐related granulomatous lung disease and will help guide clinical management that addresses exposure prevention in combination with appropriate pharmacologic treatment.

### Rare but relevant: the injection of tablet preparations and pulmonary hypertension [^9839c29e]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The primary clinical problem associated with intravenous injection of insoluble material is that these excipients can be expected to lodge primarily in pulmonary capillaries. Once lodged, these foreign bodies are largely unable to be broken down by inflammation and repair processes within the body and become incorporated in localised areas of chronic inflammation and scar tissue formation or granulomas, with the characteristic finding of refractile material containing giant cells within the granulomas, which are best appreciated on using polarised light. Despite one of the standard body responses to foreign particulate material in the vascular tree being activation of the clotting cascade and accumulation of thrombotic material around that lodged material, this seems to be an uncommon response seen on microscopy of lung tissue in pulmonary foreign body granulomatosis. Possibly, this could be the result of healing processes within the affected vessels having cleared the initial lesions of substance such as fibrin with replacement by inflammation and fibrosis. Rarely, the foreign body granulomas and associated scarring, or fibrosis, of lung tissue can be palpable during autopsy, however, in the majority of cases, the diagnosis is based on microscopy of lung tissue (see Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
(a) Occlusive foreign body giant cell granulomas in small blood arteries in the lung (arrows), haematoxylin and eosin stain, 10× objective. (b) Numerous fragments of refractile foreign material, visible as bright white material some in multinucleated foreign body giant cells, within the area depicted in (a), haematoxylin and eosin stain, 20× objective, partially polarised.

These granulomas within innumerable small blood vessels in the lung obstruct blood flow and thereby cause pulmonary hypertension. Unlike systemic hypertension, even relatively minor increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and relatively modest increases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure can have significant acute and long‐term clinical effects with shortness of breath, fatigue, syncope and chest pain being common presenting symptoms, although signs of pathology are generally subtle on clinical examination of the patient. Additional pathophysiological effects of multiple granulomas within lung tissue vasculature include inevitable fibrous tissue deposition and scarring associated with the foreign body granulomas, with resultant disruption of normal lung architecture and development of interstitial fibrosing lung disease. Such lung disease is compounded by the high rate of tobacco smoking in PWID who have high rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which in its later stages can also cause pulmonary hypertension.

### Stepwise diagnostic algorithm for high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities on CT [^68dc1b59]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

High-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities are commonly seen on CT. These findings are increasingly encountered with the growing number of CT examinations and the wide availability of thin-slice images. The abnormalities include benign lesions, such as infectious granulomatous diseases and metabolic diseases, and malignant tumors, such as lung cancers and metastatic tumors. Due to the wide spectrum of diseases, the proper diagnosis of high-attenuation abnormalities can be challenging. The assessment of these abnormal findings requires scrutiny, and the treatment is imperative. Our proposed stepwise diagnostic algorithm consists of five steps. Step 1: Establish the presence or absence of metallic artifacts. Step 2: Identify associated nodular or mass-like soft tissue components. Step 3: Establish the presence of solitary or multiple lesions if identified in Step 2. Step 4: Ascertain the predominant distribution in the upper or lower lungs if not identified in Step 2. Step 5: Identify the morphological pattern, such as linear, consolidation, nodular, or micronodular if not identified in Step 4. These five steps to diagnosing high-attenuation abnormalities subdivide the lesions into nine categories. This stepwise radiologic diagnostic approach could help to narrow the differential diagnosis for various pulmonary high-attenuation abnormalities and to achieve a precise diagnosis.

Critical relevance statement Our proposed stepwise diagnostic algorithm for high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities may help to recognize a variety of those high-attenuation findings, to determine whether the associated diseases require further investigation, and to guide appropriate patient management.

Key points

- To provide a stepwise diagnostic approach to high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities.

- To familiarize radiologists with the varying cause of high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities.

- To recognize which high-attenuation abnormalities require scrutiny and prompt treatment.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis: typical and atypical manifestations at high-resolution CT with pathologic correlation [^efeca24d]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder that is characterized by noncaseous epithelioid cell granulomas, which may affect almost any organ. Thoracic involvement is common and accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Thoracic radiologic abnormalities are seen at some stage in approximately 90% of patients with sarcoidosis, and an estimated 20% develop chronic lung disease leading to pulmonary fibrosis. Although chest radiography is often the first diagnostic imaging study in patients with pulmonary involvement, computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive for the detection of adenopathy and subtle parenchymal disease. Pulmonary sarcoidosis may manifest with various radiologic patterns: Bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement is the most common finding, followed by interstitial lung disease. At high-resolution CT, the most typical findings of pulmonary involvement are micronodules with a perilymphatic distribution, fibrotic changes, and bilateral perihilar opacities. Atypical manifestations, such as masslike or alveolar opacities, honeycomb-like cysts, miliary opacities, mosaic attenuation, tracheobronchial involvement, and pleural disease, and complications such as aspergillomas, also may be seen. To achieve a timely diagnosis and help reduce associated morbidity and mortality, it is essential to recognize both the typical and the atypical radiologic manifestations of the disease, take note of features that may be suggestive of diseases other than sarcoidosis, and correlate imaging features with pathologic findings to help narrow the differential diagnosis.

### Accuracy of FDG-PET to diagnose lung cancer in a region of endemic granulomatous disease [^3bb4bae7]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is used to evaluate suspicious pulmonary lesions due to its diagnostic accuracy. The southeastern United States has a high prevalence of infectious granulomatous lung disease, and the accuracy of FDG-PET may be reduced in this population. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET in patients with known or suspected non-small cell lung cancer treated at our institution.

Methods

A total of 279 patients, identified through our prospective database, underwent an operation for known or suspected lung cancer. Preoperative FDG-PET in 211 eligible patients was defined by standardized uptake value greater than 2.5 or by description ("moderate" or "intense") as avid. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and decision diagrams were calculated for FDG-PET in all patients and in patients with indeterminate nodules.

Results

In all eligible patients (n = 211), sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET were 92% and 40%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 86% and 55%. Overall FDG-PET accuracy to diagnose lung cancer was 81%. Preoperative positive likelihood ratio for FDG-PET diagnosis of lung cancer in this population was 1.5 compared with previously published values of 7.1. In 113 indeterminate lesions, 65% had lung cancer and the sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 40%, respectively. Twenty-four benign nodules (60%) had false positive FDG-PET scans. Twenty-two of 43 benign nodules (51%) were granulomas.

Conclusions

In a region with endemic granulomatous diseases, the specificity of FDG-PET for diagnosis of lung cancer was 40%. Clinical decisions and future clinical predictive models for lung cancer must accommodate regional variation of FDG-PET scan results.

### The role of the PET scan in the management of sarcoidosis [^1f9e4bd7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It is important to gain knowledge and understanding about the appropriate use of PET scan in the management of sarcoidosis patients. This means that, in view of the radiation dose and costs, defining appropriate indications for PET scanning in sarcoidosis patients is vital.

Recent Findings

PET has been shown to be a very sensitive technique for the assessment of inflammatory activity in sarcoidosis by detecting and quantifying the degree of inflammatory and granulomatous reactions that occur in the lungs and elsewhere in the body.

Summary

PET is not indicated in the standard workup, but can be of great value to complement more routinely used techniques. On the basis of the current findings, PET offers added value in sarcoidosis patients with unexplained persistent disabling symptoms. PET appears especially helpful in those persistently symptomatic patients without serological signs of inflammatory activity, in patients with radiologic signs of fibrosis and in the detection of active cardiac sarcoidosis. The use of PET to assess the extent of disease can uncover a suitable location for biopsy to obtain histological evidence for the diagnosis or to explain the (mainly extrathoracic) symptoms. Furthermore, the detection of unexpected organ involvement may offer prognostic value.

Histopathological Features

Lung biopsy often plays a pivotal role in ascertaining a diagnosis of HP. The criteria proposed for diagnosis are valid to any biopsy type but are based on historical descriptions of the histopathological findings in surgical lung biopsy (SLB) specimens (,–). The findings that make a diagnosis of HP likely apply to both nonfibrotic (i.e. cellular) and fibrotic variants, the difference being the presence or absence of a fibrotic pattern that may show histological overlap with fibrotic IIP (Table 7).

Table 7.
Histopathological Criteria for the Diagnosis of HP (Other than "Hot-Tub Lung" *)

Histopathological Features of Nonfibrotic, or Cellular, HP

A confident histopathological diagnosis of nonfibrotic HP requires the presence of typical histopathological features. These include 1) a cellular interstitial pneumonia accentuated around small airways ("bronchiolocentric") accompanied by 2) a cellular chronic bronchiolitis, 3) a distinctive pattern of granulomatous inflammation, and 4) no histopathological features to suggest a more likely alternative (Figure 3 and Table 7) (,–). This combination of findings is often present in a single biopsy specimen. In other patients, each of several biopsy sites may demonstrate only a subset of findings, requiring review of all specimens to appreciate the complete set of features required for a confident histological diagnosis of HP.

### Silicosarcoidosis: histologic and clinical features of an occupational granulomatous disease [^4022311f]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We describe a multinational case series of 35 workers from a range of industries with occupational RCS exposure who presented with clinical features of silicosis and sarcoidosis. We utilized a standardized histologic scoring instrument to assess lung and lymph node findings from the majority of cases and found pathologic features of granulomatous inflammation, dust nodules, birefringent particulate matter, and increased birefringent dust density compared to healthy lung tissue. Most of these cases had been diagnosed on initial clinical evaluation with sarcoidosis, and opportunities to address both the medical and public health management of silicosis were missed until the role of silica exposure was recognized. As workplace exposures are estimated to contribute substantially to 30% of all sarcoidosis cases, we propose that the term "silicosarcoidosis" be used to describe granulomatous lung disease in the presence of a significant occupational history of exposure to RCS.

4.1 Histopathology of Silicosarcoidosis

Histopathologic findings in silicosarcoidosis are heterogeneous. Besides the common findings of granulomas and dust nodules with birefringent particles on larger sample sizes, other findings of silicosis and sarcoidosis may aid in diagnosis. Dust lesions may have qualities of mature and immature silicotic nodules, though MDAP was uncommon in this case series. Notably, granulomatous and particulate involvement of the pleura was common and should be assessed routinely in lung tissue samples with available pleura. Interstitial fibrosis and hyperinflation with emphysematous changes are features of both diseases and are therefore less useful in distinguishing this overlap condition, as are the classic features of sarcoidosis, including asteroid bodies, Schaumann bodies, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytic inflammation or lymphoid aggregates.

### PET / CT in the diagnosis and workup of sarcoidosis: focus on atypical manifestations [^26326506]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas. Lung and intrathoracic lymph nodes are classic sites of involvement; however, sarcoidosis can affect any site in the body. The clinical course is extremely variable, and the imaging features are diverse and dependent on the affected site, degree of inflammation, and treatment the patient receives. Atypical manifestations and imaging findings can make diagnosis and/or management challenging. In addition, assessment of treatment response can be difficult in the setting of chronic disease. Fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is sensitive for assessment of the inflammatory activity of sarcoidosis in any organ. Although FDG PET/CT is not included in the standard workup for sarcoidosis, there has been growing evidence that supports the value of this examination in guiding diagnosis and management. FDG PET/CT may be especially useful for assessing reversible granuloma, treatment response, disease extent, occult disease, and cardiac or osseous sarcoidosis, and determining the most suitable biopsy site. Capability to image the entire body during a single examination is advantageous in cases of systemic disease such as sarcoidosis. The authors review the use of FDG PET/CT, providing up-to-date evidence and describing various cases of sarcoidosis in which FDG PET/CT has an important role in diagnosis and/or management. They also discuss the usefulness of FDG PET/CT in cases of selective manifestations of sarcoidosis. © RSNA, 2018.

### Common and uncommon CT findings in CVID-related GL-ILD: correlations with clinical parameters, therapeutic decisions and potential implications in the differential diagnosis [^dc347bb4]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by decreased IgG, IgA and/or IgM serum levels and impaired antibody response to immunization or infections. CVID results in a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, including infectious and non-infectious complications, as chronic airways abnormalities and immune-mediated interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Possible manifestations of ILD are follicular bronchiolitis, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, granulomatous lung disease, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, non-specific interstitial pneumonia and organizing pneumonia.

Since all these patterns may be present in the same patient, the term "Granulomatous and Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease (GL-ILD)" was coined for CVID, referring to "a distinct clinico-radio-pathological ILD, associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate and/or granuloma in the lung". GL-ILD is a rare manifestation of a rare disease, identified in around 8–20% of CVID subjects, resulting from a systemic immune dysregulation. This is underlined by the association with other immune-mediated complications and by the alteration in T and B lymphocytes compartment, such as lower percentage of switched-memory and marginal zone (MZ) B cells, increased percentage of circulating CD21 low B cells and a preferential memory CD4+ T cell differentiation toward a CXCR3+CCR6- TH1 phenotype. Previous studies suggested that GL-ILD patients are at higher risk of B-cell lymphoma, too. According to the UK-PID Network Consensus, in the suspicion of GL-ILD, it is useful in performing chest computed tomography (CT) examination, lung function tests, bronchoscopy and surgical lung biopsy, that is mandatory for a definite diagnosis, but not free from risks. The main CT GL-ILD features are nodules, ground glass opacities, reticulations, consolidations, and interstitial fibrosis. Moreover, CT may evaluate chronic bronchial abnormalities, such as bronchiectasis. Since GL-ILD patients may be asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms, CT may identify suspicious features in advance, anticipating clinical and pulmonary function tests (PFT) abnormalities and providing prognostic elements. Hence, some GL-ILD CT scores have been proposed to evaluate lung involvement, although there is not a general consensus, yet. Furthermore, the radiological differential diagnosis with other ILD and between acute and chronic lung manifestations may be challenging. In particular, sarcoidosis is considered in differential diagnosis, while, on a background of GL-ILD abnormalities, the superimposition of acute infections may be hard to identify, as well as lung lymphoma. Lastly, there is no evidence of any specific radiological element that may be associated with the need of GL-ILD therapy.

### Silicosarcoidosis: histologic and clinical features of an occupational granulomatous disease [^4416552d]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. Growing evidence indicates that occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) is associated with an increased incidence of sarcoidosis. Yet a diagnosis of sarcoidosis rarely prompts investigation to identify preventable exposures. We sought to elucidate features that identify this important clinical syndrome of silicosarcoidosis. We assembled a multinational case series of workers with sarcoidosis who also reported occupational RCS exposure. We characterized clinical and histopathologic findings using a standardized instrument. We also assessed lung specimens using a novel quantitative microscopy technique to measure birefringent dust density in silicosarcoidosis cases and compared them to control groups. We identified 35 silicosarcoidosis cases (97% male, mean age 48years) from the United States, Israel, and Taiwan who reported 21 ± 9years of RCS exposure. On histology scoring, 25/29 (86%) had granulomas and 17/18 (94%) with evaluable lung tissue had lymphocytic inflammation and/or lymphoid aggregates. Common lung interstitial findings included silicotic nodules (39%), mixed-dust macules/nodules (44%), and birefringent dust (50%). Quantitative birefringent dust density was significantly greater (p < 0.001) in silicosarcoidosis cases compared with healthy controls (147 ± 179 vs. 12 ± 9 particles/mm 2) but lower than in coal miners with silica-related progressive massive fibrosis (623 ± 777). We found significant differences in the frequency of histologic abnormalities in large versus small biopsy specimens, with fewer findings of RCS exposure in smaller tissue samples. The use of the term silicosarcoidosis should enhance recognition of this significant exposure-related granulomatous lung disease and will help guide clinical management that addresses exposure prevention in combination with appropriate pharmacologic treatment.

### The role of PET in the management of sarcoidosis [^fdb78f12]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Although PET has a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for identifying inflammation because of sarcoidosis, the current state of the literature is composed mostly of retrospective investigations. Prospective trials are needed to strengthen the role of PET in management of sarcoidosis. These trials should investigate a connection between PET findings and practical clinical outcomes. These studies have the potential to set a standard for preparation and interpretation of PET as well which is currently lacking. The importance of abnormal PET results in context of an asymptomatic patient needs more evidence base to support or withhold treatment. These results would make further studies, collaboration, and patient management more efficient.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^b089a2fe]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — lung biopsy in suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) states: In patients with suspected HP, we suggest considering histological lung biopsy for additional diagnostic evaluation when all available data such as clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings along with bronchoscopic results do not yield a confident diagnosis and results may help guide management (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Voting results were: definitely agree, 10; probably agree, 5; neutral, 0; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 0; abstained, 0. Remarks add that a consensus multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) should be considered before surgical lung biopsy (SLB) or transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC), that SLB, TBC, and transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) have different diagnostic yields and benefit-risk profiles, and that potential harm must be weighed against potential information, particularly in suspected nonfibrotic or advanced fibrotic HP cases. Additional remarks note that some patients with fibrotic HP may show nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) patterns; samples should be carefully examined for HP-consistent findings such as poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas, multinucleated giant cells, and fibrotic bronchiolocentric accentuation, and histopathology requires multidisciplinary reconciliation with clinical and radiological information.

### Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis: the many faces of presentation at initial CT scan [^2f76175f]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

PLCH is a rare disease whose elementary lesion is a bronchiolocentric-evolving granuloma. A history of cigarette smoking, coupled with suggestive findings at radiographic imaging, is key to suspect the disease. At diagnosis, symptoms and functional tests are non-specific, while CT may be distinctive, showing lesions corresponding to the various evolutionary aspects of the disease. Typical cases are characterised by the association of nodules, cavitary nodules and cystic lesions. However, differential diagnosis can be challenging when CT shows unique lesions that can mimic other diseases.

Knowledge of the different CT features at presentation helps to determine the diagnosis of PLCH correctly or to consider PLCH among other diseases and thus guide the diagnostic approach.

### Pulmonary granulomas in a patient with positive ANCA and history of tuberculosis: case report [^2c606462]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, pulmonary TB and GPA have many overlapping features clinically and radiologically which can pose a diagnostic dilemma. It is evident that treatment decisions need to be focused on the clinical presentation of patients and not ANCA testing alone. In patients with high-risk TB exposure history, TB should be actively excluded as an alternate diagnosis in patients with a positive ANCA before initiating high-dose immunosuppression. It appears that P-ANCA/MPO ANCA is most associated with pulmonary TB whilst, a combination of C-ANCA/PR-3 ANCA may be helpful in differentiating GPA from pulmonary TB. It is recommended that biopsies of lung lesions, sputum microscopy and multidisciplinary team input are sought as part of the workup when these two differentials are being considered.

Clinical Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Lung Cancer Screening on Detection of Incidental Pulmonary Nodules. Imaging analysis shows promise in predicting the risk of developing lung cancer on initial detection of an incidental lung nodule and in distinguishing indolent from aggressive lung neoplasms. PFS indicates progression‐free survival; ROC, receiver operating characteristic.

The majority of indeterminate pulmonary nodules are incidentally detected (ie, they are not encountered during screening but in routine cross‐sectional imaging for other diagnostic indications, such as CT angiography), 48 and pose a dilemma to patients and their providers. Annually, more than 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed with an incidentally detected nodule 49; whereas most of these nodules are benign granulomas, up to 12% may be malignant. 50 The Fleischner Society 51 and the American College of Radiology Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung‐RADS) 52 provide recommendations for the follow‐up and management of these incidentally detected nodules, which usually require follow‐up imaging between 3 and 13 months to confirm growth before intervening with more invasive diagnostics (eg, biopsy). These systems are "semantic", in that they describe features that are commonly used in the radiology lexicon to describe regions of interest by human experts. Because they are scored manually, there is high potential for large inter‐reader variability. 53 In a recent study, a model incorporating 4 quantitatively scored semantic features (short‐axis diameter, contour, concavity, and texture) conferred an accuracy of 74.3% to distinguish malignant from benign nodules in the lung cancer screening setting. 34 A separate study was conducted to identify semantic features from small pulmonary nodules (less than 6 mm) to predict lung cancer incidence in the lung cancer screening setting and the revealed final model yielded an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.930 based on total emphysema score, attachment to vessel, nodule location, border definition, and concavity. 54 Although there was an imbalance between malignant and benign nodules in the aforementioned analyses, these studies provide compelling evidence for the utility of semantic features in lung cancer screening. As with nodules detected in the lung cancer screening setting, the standard of care for incidental pulmonary nodules lacks accurate decision tools for predicting malignancy versus benign disease and indolent versus aggressive behavior. Thus, the appropriate management of incidental pulmonary nodules is dictated by the probability of cancer and the potential aggressiveness of its behavior. Prediction of the nature of a nodule may justify diametrically opposing strategies, such as biopsy versus observation. Erroneous prediction carries significant consequences, including a risk of premature mortality from delayed intervention on the one hand and morbidity and mortality resulting from invasive testing on the other. Lung cancer screening also detects cancers that exhibit a wide spectrum of behaviors: some are clinically indolent, and others are aggressive, mandating prompt treatment. One study estimated that greater than 18% of all lung cancers detected by LDCT in the NLST seem to be indolent. 43

### Prevalence and clinical characteristics of malignant lung nodules in tuberculosis endemic area in a single tertiary centre [^647f89b3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung nodule management remains a challenge to clinicians, especially in endemic tuberculosis areas. Different guidelines are available with various recommendations; however, the suitability of these guidelines for the Asian population is still unclear. Our study described the prevalence of malignant lung nodules among nodules measuring 2–30 mm, the demographic and characteristics of lung nodules between benign and malignant groups, and the clinician's clinical practice in managing lung nodules.

Method

Retrospective review of lung nodules from the computed tomography archiving and communication system (PACS) database and clinical data from January 2019 to January 2022. The data was analysed by using chi square, mann whitney test and simple logistic regression.

Results

There were 288 nodules measuring 2–30 mm identified; 49 nodules underwent biopsy. Twenty-seven (55%) biopsied nodules were malignant, (prevalence of 9.4%). Among the malignant lung nodules, 74% were adenocarcinoma (n = 20). The commonest benign nodules were granuloma n = 12 (55%). In nodules > 8 mm, the median age of malignant and benign was 72 ± 12 years and 66 ± 16 years, respectively (p = 0.024). There was a significant association of benign nodules (> 8 mm) in subjects with previous or concurrent tuberculosis (p = 0.008). Benign nodules are also associated with nodule size ≤ 8 mm, without spiculation (p < 0.001) and absence of emphysema (p = 0.007). The nodule size and the presence of spiculation are factors to make the clinicians proceed with tissue biopsy. Spiculated nodules and increased nodule size had 11 and 13 times higher chances of undergoing biopsy respectively (p < 0.001).) Previous history of tuberculosis had a 0.874 reduced risk of progression to malignant lung nodules (p = 0.013). These findings implied that these three factors are important risk factors for malignant lung nodules. There was no mortality association between benign and malignant. Using Brock's probability of malignancy, nodules ≤ 8 mm had a low probability of malignancy.

Conclusion

The prevalence of malignant lung nodules in our centre was comparatively lower than non-Asian countries. Older age, the presence of emphysema, and spiculation are associated with malignancy. Clinical judgment is of utmost importance in managing these patients. Fleishner guideline is still being used as a reference by our clinician.
