## Question

would full body MRI or pet be better for identifying oral pharyngeal cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether whole-body MRI or PET is better for identifying oropharyngeal cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "identifying" entails clinically: detecting the primary site, staging regional nodes, and surveying for distant metastases and second primaries. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines actually recommend for initial workup and for response assessment. Next, I will compare diagnostic performance of whole-body MRI versus PET-based approaches, including PET/CT and PET/MRI. After that, I need to check post-treatment scenarios and practical issues like radiation, lung lesion detection, and availability. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom line and specify what to choose if forced to pick one modality versus how to combine them in practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical tasks bundled into "identifying oropharyngeal cancer". Identification is not just seeing a mass; it means accurate T-staging of the primary in the oropharynx, detecting cervical nodal metastases, and excluding distant metastases or synchronous primaries that change management, along with having a plan for response assessment and surveillance after therapy. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines explicitly separate the local head-and-neck evaluation from the whole-body component, because that will influence which modality is "better" for which task [^116D3Xm8] [^113c5PA8].

> For the primary site, let me think about anatomic detail and soft-tissue contrast. MRI of the head and neck is preferred for delineating oropharyngeal tumors, perineural spread, marrow infiltration, and deep soft-tissue planes, and this is consistently recommended in major guidelines for initial evaluation, often alongside contrast-enhanced CT depending on local practice. Wait, I should double-check that ACR and ESMO-era guidance indeed lists contrast-enhanced neck CT or MRI for initial cross-sectional imaging, with MRI particularly helpful in the oropharynx, which they do [^115i5ppi] [^113c5PA8] [^116su4E7].

> Now, nodal and distant disease: I need to ensure which modality best detects metabolically active metastases. FDG-PET/CT generally offers sensitivity and specificity above 90% for nodal and distant metastases and is highlighted for unknown primary evaluation and for differentiating recurrence from post-treatment change. Hold on, let me verify with a meta-analysis that conventional anatomic imaging underperforms for distant disease; yes, PET/PET-CT roughly doubles sensitivity for distant metastases over CT/MRI while maintaining high specificity, which materially affects staging decisions [^111CNGZq].

> What about whole-body MRI alone? I should review its strengths and limits. Whole-body MRI provides radiation-free systemic coverage with excellent soft-tissue contrast and can be quite good for liver, brain, and marrow assessment, but it relies on morphologic nodal criteria and can miss metabolically active but morphologically subtle disease. Wait, let me verify comparative data: a 2013 meta-analysis across cancers shows similar patient-based sensitivity and specificity for WB-MRI and PET/CT for distant disease overall, but that analysis did not isolate head-and-neck nodal staging, where the lack of PET signal is a disadvantage for MRI alone [^115XxZa2] [^116GoJfi].

> I will now examine hybrid approaches: PET/MRI versus PET/CT. Multiple head-to-head studies in head and neck cancer report broadly similar overall diagnostic performance between PET/MRI and PET/CT, with PET/MRI offering superior soft-tissue detail and less dental artifact, and PET/CT sometimes better for small lung nodules. Let me reconsider whether this changes the choice between whole-body MRI alone and PET-based imaging; it does not, because these comparisons still rely on the PET component to overcome MRI's nodal sensitivity limitations [^116KsaXy] [^116Jo93q] [^111GqSCQ] [^116yRCRm] [^114s7i2b].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to avoid overgeneralizing from single studies. UK national oropharyngeal guidelines recommend MRI of the primary site plus CT of the neck and chest for initial staging, reserving PET-CT particularly for response assessment after chemoradiotherapy and for suspected recurrence; European oncology guidance recommends contrast-enhanced head-and-neck CT and/or MRI plus chest imaging with CT and/or FDG-PET, emphasizing a multimodality strategy. Hold on, I should verify the broader hybrid-imaging stance: the European hybrid/molecular imaging recommendations explicitly endorse FDG-PET/CT for staging, nodal and distant metastases, unknown primary, and recurrence, citing its high accuracy and superiority over CT/MRI alone for differentiating recurrence from treatment effects [^116D3Xm8] [^113Z1a5u] [^113c5PA8] [^111CNGZq].

> Post-treatment assessment matters because "identification" often includes ruling out residual disease. I need to check timing and modality: guidance favors a PET-CT around 12 weeks after definitive therapy to assess residual disease, cautioning that earlier studies risk false positives from inflammation; this advantage over anatomic imaging in distinguishing recurrence from post-therapeutic change is a key reason PET-CT is standard in this window. Wait, let me verify pitfalls so we do not overcall uptake; FDG is not tumor-specific, and correlating with the CT or MR component and clinical context remains essential [^111CNGZq] [^114qdqqH] [^116cfY49].

> Practical considerations can sway the balance. PET/CT exposes patients to ionizing radiation but detects substantially more distant metastases and synchronous cancers than chest radiography or CT combined with regional MRI in prospective paired designs; whole-body MRI avoids radiation and excels in certain organs but may underperform in detecting small pulmonary metastases that change staging. Hold on, I should confirm lung performance and synchronous detection differences; PET/CT outperforms alternative strategies for distant metastasis and second primaries, while MRI's radiation-free profile can be valuable when repeated surveillance is needed and PET is not indicated [^116e78z4] [^114EhuVp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I nearly concluded that whole-body MRI could replace PET/CT for systemic staging because a meta-analysis showed comparable sensitivity overall; but that synthesis pooled heterogeneous primaries and did not address head-and-neck nodal evaluation, where PET's metabolic signal is pivotal. I should correct that: in oropharyngeal cancer, MRI remains ideal for primary-site delineation, but PET-based imaging is superior for nodal and distant staging and for post-treatment response, which is why guidelines do not recommend whole-body MRI alone as the staging workhorse [^115XxZa2] [^111CNGZq].

> Bottom line, I need to be precise. For identifying and staging oropharyngeal cancer, the evidence-based approach is dedicated head-and-neck MRI for the primary site combined with PET/CT for nodal and distant disease and for post-treatment assessment; whole-body MRI alone is not recommended as a stand-alone staging modality in current guidelines. If forced to choose one whole-body technique for "identification" across the full staging spectrum, PET/CT is generally better than whole-body MRI because it more reliably detects nodal and distant disease and distinguishes recurrence from post-treatment changes, though PET/MRI can be an acceptable alternative where available and may offer advantages in soft-tissue characterization with comparable overall performance to PET/CT [^113c5PA8] [^111CNGZq] [^116D3Xm8] [^116KsaXy].

PET/CT is **superior to whole-body MRI for identifying oropharyngeal cancer** [^111CNGZq] as it offers higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting primary tumors, nodal metastases, and distant disease, and it is recommended by major guidelines for staging and surveillance. Whole-body MRI offers **excellent soft-tissue contrast** and **no radiation** [^116GoJfi], but it is less sensitive for small primaries and nodal metastases and is not guideline-recommended as a standalone staging tool [^113c5PA8]. PET/CT is the preferred modality for comprehensive evaluation, whereas MRI is best reserved for detailed local assessment [^116D3Xm8] or when limiting radiation exposure is a concern.

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity

PET/CT provides **high sensitivity and specificity** for detecting primary tumors, nodal metastases, and distant metastases in oropharyngeal cancer, combining metabolic imaging with anatomical detail, allowing accurate localization and characterization of lesions [^111CNGZq]. Whole-body MRI offers **excellent soft-tissue contrast** and is particularly useful for local tumor delineation and assessment of perineural spread [^116su4E7]; however, it may be less sensitive for detecting small primary tumors and nodal metastases than PET/CT [^113Dj8Sq].

---

## Detection of primary tumors

PET/CT is highly effective in detecting **primary tumors**, especially in cases of **unknown primary (CUP)** [^112PVca4], by providing metabolic information that can identify tumors not readily visible on anatomical imaging alone [^111CNGZq]. Whole-body MRI excels in **local tumor delineation** [^116su4E7] but may miss **small or metabolically inactive tumors** that PET/CT can detect.

---

## Detection of nodal metastases

PET/CT is **superior in detecting nodal metastases** due to its ability to identify **metabolically active lymph nodes**, even when they are not anatomically enlarged [^113QsYnz]. Whole-body MRI relies on **morphological criteria**, which may limit its sensitivity for **small or early nodal metastases** [^116su4E7].

---

## Detection of distant metastases

PET/CT is highly effective in detecting **distant metastases**, including lung and bone metastases, common in oropharyngeal cancer [^116e78z4]. Whole-body MRI is **less sensitive** than PET/CT for detecting **distant metastases**, particularly in the lungs [^1123RkFT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

PET/CT is recommended by major clinical guidelines, including the European Society for Hybrid, Molecular and Translational Imaging (ESHI) and the United Kingdom National Multidisciplinary Guidelines (UKNMG) [^111CNGZq], for **staging, surveillance, and detection of recurrence** in oropharyngeal cancer. Whole-body MRI is recommended primarily for **local tumor assessment and delineation** and not as a **standalone modality** for comprehensive staging or surveillance [^116D3Xm8].

---

## Practical considerations

PET/CT involves **ionizing radiation** and requires **radiotracer injection**, yet provides rapid, comprehensive whole-body imaging and is widely available in clinical practice [^114EhuVp]. Whole-body MRI does **not involve radiation**, making it suitable for repeated imaging and younger patients, but is more time-consuming, expensive, and less widely available than PET/CT [^116GoJfi].

[18 F]FDG-PET/CT is recommended for various clinical applications in head and neck cancer, including staging, identifying lymph node and distant metastases, and detecting unknown primary tumors. It offers high sensitivity and specificity, both over 90%. Furthermore, hybrid imaging aids in detecting recurrent head and neck tumors, especially when postradiogenic or postoperative changes complicate interpretation in morphological CT and MRI.

Other guidelines recommend restaging with [18 F]FDG-PET/CT 3 months after surgery, with additional imaging only if symptoms arise or if results from conventional imaging are inconclusive. In advanced head and neck tumors that cannot be treated surgically, [18 F]FDG-PET/CT should be considered 3–6 months after systemic treatment to assess residual disease. Earlier scans, which might yield false-positive results, should be avoided.

### Whole-body MRI for the staging and follow-up of patients with metastasis [^116GoJfi]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The advent of whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) has introduced tumor imaging with a systemic approach compared to established sequential, multi-modal diagnostic algorithms. Hardware innovations, such as the introduction of multi-receiver channel whole-body scanners at 1.5 T and recently 3T, combined with acquisition acceleration techniques, have made high-resolution WB-MRI clinically feasible. Now, a dedicated assessment of individual organs with various soft tissue contrast, spatial resolution, and contrast media dynamics can be combined with whole-body anatomic coverage in a multi-planar imaging approach. More flexible protocols, e.g. including T1-weighted TSE- and STIR-imaging, dedicated lung imaging, or dynamic contrast-enhanced studies of the abdomen can be performed within less than 45 minutes.

For initial tumor staging, PET-CT, as a competing whole-body modality in oncologic imaging, has proved more accurate for the definition of T-stage and lymph node assessment, using the additional metabolic information of PET for the assessment of tumor viability and therapy response. However, new applications, such as MR-whole-body diffusion imaging, may significantly increase sensitivity in the near future. WB-MRI has shown advantages for the detection of distant metastatic disease, especially from tumors frequently spreading to the liver or brain, and it is especially useful as a radiation-free alternative for the surveillance of tumor patients with multiple follow-up exams. Furthermore, it has been introduced as a whole-body bone marrow screening application. Within this context, WB-MRI is highly acc.

### PET/MRI in head and neck cancer: initial experience [^113QsYnz]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Head and neck cancer ranks among the ten most common malignant diseases. The vast majority of these malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas. The choice of therapy in patients with head and neck cancer depends mainly on tumor location, invasion of adjacent structures, and the presence of metastases.

MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, which is useful for differentiating masses from neighboring tissues, and has facilitated the widespread use of MRI for head and neck imaging. It is considered the modality of choice for imaging tumors of the oral cavity and the pharynx. However, the sensitivity of MRI for metastatic lymph node disease is rather low, as it relies on morphologic criteria for lymph node evaluation.

18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET has superior sensitivity for detecting cervical lymph node metastases compared to both CT and MRI. The recently introduced whole-body PET/MRI systems combine the unique metabolic imaging capabilities of PET with the superb soft tissue contrast of MRI. PET/MRI thus appears to be a promising modality for the imaging of head and neck malignancies.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of FDG-PET/MRI for initial staging of head and neck cancer.

### The role of PET-CT in the management of patients with advanced cancer of the head and neck [^113awqQ8]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

The development of functional imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) has been a major advancement in clinical oncology. Additionally, the integration of functional imaging with CT anatomical imaging (PET-CT) has dramatically increased the clinical applicability of PET. This review discusses the role of PET-CT in head and neck cancer, focusing on its role in staging, detection of unknown primaries, radiotherapy planning, assessment of treatment response, and biological characterization of disease. We also demonstrate why PET-CT should be an integral part of modern management of head and neck cancer.

### FDG-PET/CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^116cfY49]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) plays a major role today in the pre-therapeutic work-up and post-therapeutic monitoring of patients with head and neck tumors. FDG-PET/CT is now routinely used in the head and neck for the delineation of the primary tumor, detection of regional nodal metastases, distant metastases, and second primary tumors. Further indications include assessment of post-treatment response, long-term surveillance to detect recurrence, and, last but not least, detection of an unknown primary tumor. Thus, FDG-PET/CT tremendously facilitates the management of head and neck cancer patients, in whom treatment is often expensive and associated with significant morbidity.

However, the interpretation of FDG-PET/CT studies in the head and neck may be quite challenging due to the inherently complex anatomy, physiological variants, and unusual patterns of FDG uptake after radiation therapy and surgery. Because FDG is not a tumor-specific tracer, it can accumulate in a variety of benign processes including benign tumors, inflammatory, post-traumatic, and iatrogenic conditions. Benign non-physiological FDG uptake may be seen in up to 25% of whole-body PET/CT examinations; FDG uptake may mimic malignant tumors in more than half of these lesions. Lesion characterization on the CT portion of the PET/CT study is therefore of utmost importance as it increases the specificity of PET/CT reporting. Although FDG interpretation pitfalls are common in the head and neck, they have received less attention in the literature.

### Pet/CT and pet/MRI in head and neck malignancy [^111yyEJC]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Combined 2-[18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has an established role in the staging of difficult cases of head and neck (HN) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), looking for an unknown primary, assessing response post-chemotherapy at 3–6 months, and differentiating relapse from treatment effects in patients suspected to have tumour recurrence. The PET NECK trial, comparing PET/CT surveillance versus neck dissection in advanced head and neck cancer, showed survival was similar among patients who underwent PET/CT-guided surveillance and those who underwent planned neck dissection, but surveillance was more cost-effective.

There is growing interest in the use of hypoxia PET tracers, especially in targeting radiotherapy, where the radiotherapy dose can be boosted in regions of hypoxia; the use of 68 Ga peptide tracers in neuroendocrine malignancy; and also in the growing field of combined PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PET/MRI has the advantage of increased anatomical detail and radiation dose reduction combined with the molecular and metabolic data from PET, although PET/CT has the advantage in better sensitivity for imaging lung metastases.

Thus far, there is good agreement between PET/CT and PET/MRI with high correlation between semi-quantitative measurements in primary, nodal, osseous, and soft-tissue lesions imaging. PET/MRI may indeed provide greater accuracy than the currently available imaging procedures in the staging and later treatment response evaluation in HNSCC.

### Positron emission tomography: A promising diagnostic modality for head and neck pathology [^117HH3h5]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to discuss the advantages of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in the diagnosis of head and neck lesions. To illustrate this diagnostic method, we describe the nuclear medicine basic technique, present five cases for comparison of the results between computed tomography (CT) scan and PET, and review the literature.

The five cases show that PET allows assessment of lesions earlier and more definitively than other diagnostic images. PET, a nuclear medicine modality, is a promising tool for diagnosis and follow-up of head and neck lesions. PET allows assessment of changes in the tissue before they would be shown by other diagnostic images. This modality permits differentiation between malignant and benign tumors. It also has the capability to distinguish between scar tissue, necrosis, tumor recurrence, and metastatic disease. It allows the assessment of the patient's progress during therapy, making possible an early identification of nonresponders to therapy.

### Changes in serial multiparametric MRI and FDG-PET/CT functional imaging during radiation therapy can predict treatment response in patients with head and neck cancer [^114QuSuj]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Materials and methods

- **Study design**: Patients with newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, non-metastatic mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without systemic therapy, from two independent prospective quantitative imaging biomarker studies were evaluated. Patients in study 1 were recruited from June 2014 to May 2015. Those in study 2 were recruited from May 2016 to October 2019. Local research ethics committee approval was provided for both studies, and all patients provided written informed consent.

- **Multidisciplinary team evaluation**: All patients were evaluated and reviewed by a multidisciplinary head and neck team. They were treated using a simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy technique over 35 fractions. Radiotherapy treatment volumes were defined using consensus international guidelines and underwent a stringent peer review process.

- **Imaging procedures and evaluation**: Patients in both studies underwent serial multiparametric MRI (DWI, T2) imaging before, during (weeks 2, 3, 5, 6), and after completion (1 month and 3 months) of radiotherapy. Patients also underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging before and during (week 3) radiotherapy. Treatment response was evaluated with post-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT and clinical examination, including nasoendoscopy. Recurrences were confirmed histologically or via imaging, following discussion at a multidisciplinary head and neck meeting.

### Evaluation of improved attenuation correction in whole-body PET/MR on patients with bone metastasis using various radiotracers [^114onVgu]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Whole-body positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) hybrid imaging has gained momentum in oncologic applications during the last decade, given the unique ability to combine excellent soft tissue contrast and other functional imaging parameters provided by MR imaging with the quantification of radiotracer metabolism provided by PET.

While promising, many physical and practical challenges have been subject to interdisciplinary research aiming to further develop hybrid imaging with PET/MR for specific clinical applications. For example, attenuation correction (AC) of human soft tissues in integrated PET/MR has to rely on MR imaging to allow quantification of PET imaging, as attenuation information from computed tomography (CT) is missing. MR images mainly provide proton densities and tissue-dependent spin relaxation properties and cannot be directly converted to linear attenuation coefficients (LAC) at 511 keV as needed for AC of PET data. In addition, the inherently limited field-of-view (FOV) in MRI may lead to truncation artifacts along the patients' arms in MR-based AC, potentially resulting in a bias in PET quantification. Furthermore, the substitution of bone as soft tissue may lead to a systematic underestimation in PET signal. These and other issues have been subject to thorough research to further develop and improve MR-based AC in PET/MR.

### Value of FDG PET/CT in staging of oral cancer: four simultaneous primary malignancies [^113DTT4M]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the head and neck are at increased risk for second primary malignancies (SPMs). We report on a 53-year-old patient with a primary diagnosis of SCC in the anterior floor of the mouth. Panendoscopy suspected an SPM of the right vocal cord. FDG PET/CT, as a whole-body imaging method, confirmed this suspicion and raised concern for a further SPM of both the esophagus and colon. All malignancies were confirmed by biopsy. Subsequently, the patient underwent radiochemotherapy. In summary, FDG PET/CT revealed unexpected multiple SPMs, prevented unnecessary resection of the oral SCC, and enabled individualized therapeutic management.

### Current use of 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and combined positron emission tomography and computed tomography in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^113scfUJ]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

The history and physical examination, along with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, are the cornerstones for identifying new and recurrent cancers of the head and neck. The advent of positron emission tomography (PET) and combined PET/CT imaging technology is a promising development. These modalities have the potential to help stage patients presenting with head and neck cancer, identify responses to nonsurgical therapy, and allow earlier detection of recurrence in the hope of improving survival.

This paper provides a brief history of PET and PET/CT imaging, reviews the literature for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and offers specific recommendations for its use.

### Prospective comparison of 18F-FDG PET with conventional imaging modalities (MRI, CT, and 67Ga scintigraphy) in assessment of combined intraarterial chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma [^112W2VrD]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

To preserve the oral organs and functions in patients with head and neck carcinoma, accurate determination of the appropriate treatment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy is of critical importance. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET relative to that of other conventional imaging modalities in the assessment of therapeutic response after combined intraarterial chemotherapy and radiotherapy as an organ preservation protocol.

- **Methods**: The study was prospectively performed on 23 consecutive patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who completed the treatment regimen and underwent two 18F-FDG PET studies before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 67Ga scintigraphy (only before therapy) as well as MRI and CT (both before and after therapy) were also performed. All images were blindly and independently interpreted without knowledge of histologic findings. The level of confidence in image interpretation was graded by means of a 5-point rating system (0 = definitely no tumor to 4 = definite tumor).

- **Results**: Before treatment, 18F-FDG PET detected primary tumors in all 23 patients and was more sensitive (100%) than MRI (18/23; 78.3%), CT (15/22; 68.2%), and 67Ga scintigraphy (8/20; 40%) with a confidence level of 3 or 4 as a positive tumor finding. After chemoradiotherapy, residual tumors were histologically confirmed in 4 patients (pathologic complete response rate, 19/23; 82.6%). Although post-treatment 18F-FDG PET showed almost equal sensitivity (4/4; 100%) compared with MRI (3/3; 100%) or CT (3/4; 75%), its spec…

### Head-to-head comparison of chest X-ray/head and neck MRI, chest CT/head and neck MRI, and F-FDG PET/CT for detection of distant metastases and synchronous cancer in oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancer [^116e78z4]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the detection rate of distant metastasis and synchronous cancer by comparing clinically used imaging strategies: chest X-ray combined with head and neck MRI (CXR/MRI), chest CT combined with head and neck MRI (CHCT/MRI), and 18 F-FDG PET/CT. These imaging methods were evaluated in the diagnostic workup of patients with oral, pharyngeal, or laryngeal cancer.

This was a prospective cohort study based on paired data. Consecutive patients with histologically verified primary head and squamous cell carcinoma at Odense University Hospital from September 2013 to March 2016 were considered for the study. Included patients underwent CXR/MRI, CHCT/MRI, and PET/CT on the same day and prior to biopsy. Scans were interpreted independently by separate teams of experienced nuclear physicians or radiologists.

The true detection rate of distant metastasis and synchronous cancer was assessed for each imaging strategy:

- **CXR/MRI**: Correctly detected 3 (1%) patients with distant metastasis.
- **CHCT/MRI**: Detected 11 (4%) patients with distant metastasis.
- **PET/CT**: Detected 18 (6%) patients with distant metastasis.

The absolute differences of 5% (between PET/CT and CXR/MRI) and 2% (between PET/CT and CHCT/MRI) were statistically significant in favor of PET/CT. Additionally, PET/CT correctly detected 25 (8%) synchronous cancers, compared to 3 patients (1%) with CXR/MRI and 6 patients (2%) with CHCT/MRI.

The true detection rate of distant metastasis or synchronous cancer with PET/CT was 13% (40 patients), significantly higher than 2% (6 patients) for CXR/MRI and 6% (17 patients) for CHCT/MRI.

### Targeting fibroblast activation protein in newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity - initial experience and comparison to [F]FDG PET/CT and MRI [^116T1GnV]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common tumor entity worldwide and the ninth most frequent cause of death. With an estimated incidence of about 275,000 cases per year, it accounts for more than 90% of all malignancies of the oral cavity. Since the presence of cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis is one of the most relevant negative prognostic factors, and detection of distant metastases shifts therapy from a curative to a palliative approach, accurate tumor staging is of paramount importance for adequate treatment choice and estimation of prognosis.

The utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18 F]FDG) for staging malignancies of the head and neck is well documented. However, specificity of [18 F]FDG is hampered by uptake in inflammatory cells such as neutrophils or macrophages. Since inflammatory processes are very common in head and neck tumors, there is an urgent need for a more specific alternative to [18 F]FDG to further improve preoperative staging and therapy of OSCC.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are located within the tumor stroma and modulate the tumor microenvironment by secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. In OSCC, tumor invasion is promoted by the communication between CAF and tumor cells. A particularity of CAF is the overexpression of fibroblast activation protein α (FAP), which corresponds to a type II transmembrane glycoprotein and acts as a serine protease of the dipeptidyl-peptidase family.

### Detection and quantification of focal uptake in head and neck tumours: (18)F-FDG PET/MR versus PET/CT [^114bdnyH]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Degraded PET/CT image quality due to dental fillings was observed in a 73-year-old man receiving radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma T3N2M0 of the oral cavity. The following images were analyzed:

- **CT image**: Panel (a).
- **Water-only Dixon sequence image**: Panel (b).
- **Fused PET and CT image**: Panel (c).
- **Fused PET and water-only Dixon MR image**: Panel (d).
- **PET image from PET/CT**: Panel (e).
- **PET image from PET/MR**: Panel (f).

The PET/CT image quality was poor, scored as 1, while the PET/MR image quality was good, scored as 3. A lesion with focal uptake could not be excluded on the PET/CT images, while PET/MR data were interpreted as negative for focal uptake. The quality of PET/CT and PET/MR image fusion was comparable, each scoring 3, as indicated by the arrows pointing to dental artifacts.

- **Characteristics of lesions with focal uptake**:

Using all available information from the PET/CT and PET/MR datasets, 202 lesions with focal uptake were detected: 66 malignant and 136 benign. The number of lesions with focal uptake varied from zero to 18 lesions per patient, with a mean of seven lesions (both benign and malignant) per patient. The anatomic distribution of lesions, presumed lesion type, and lesion size are summarized in Table 2. The number and characteristics of benign lesions with focal uptake are detailed in Table 3, and an example is presented in Figure 4. The majority of benign lesions with focal uptake were of inflammatory origin (104 of 136); details are shown in Table 2.

### PET/MR in cancers of the head and neck [^111vUzNA]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

One early application of PET/MRI in clinical practice may be the imaging of head and neck cancers. This is because the morphologic imaging modalities, CT and MR, are recognized as similarly effective tools in cross-sectional oncological imaging of the head and neck. The addition of PET with FDG is believed to enhance the accuracy of both modalities to a similar degree.

However, there are a few specific scenarios in head and neck cancer imaging where MR is thought to provide an edge over CT, including perineural spread of tumors and the infiltration of important anatomical landmarks, such as the prevertebral fascia and great vessel walls. Here, hybrid PET/MR might provide higher diagnostic certainty than PET/CT or a separate acquisition of PET/CT and MR. Another advantage of MR is the availability of several functional techniques. Although some of them might enhance the imaging of head and neck cancer with PET/MR, other functional techniques actually might prove dispensable in the presence of PET.

In this overview, we discuss trends and potential clinical applications of PET/MR in the imaging of head and neck cancers, including clinical protocols. We also discuss potential benefits of implementing functional MR techniques into hybrid PET/MRI of head and neck cancers.

### Methods, detection rates, and survival outcomes of screening for head and neck cancers: A systematic review [^114uGnMr]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers (HNCs) are often diagnosed at advanced clinical stages during their symptomatic phase, leading to a reduced treatment window and poor survival. Screening programs have been suggested as a mitigation strategy.

To examine the effectiveness of HNC screening programs in improving diagnosis and survival in adults, this Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-guided systematic review involved the use of peer-reviewed, English-language journal articles identified from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials between January 1, 2001, and July 15, 2022. Snowballing was applied to retrieve more studies. Eligible articles were original clinical trials and observational studies presenting a universal or risk-targeted screening program of primary HNC in the adult population. Reporting quality was assessed using the JBI's critical appraisal tools.

Database searches yielded 3646 unique citations with an additional 8 studies found via snowballing. Five reviewers assessed the full text of 106 studies. Sixteen articles were ultimately included in the review, involving 4.7 million adults (34.1%-100% male; median age, 30–59 years). Fifteen studies were based in Asia, and 1 in Europe (Portugal). Five reported data from randomized clinical trials. An oral inspection conducted once or once every 2 to 3 years was described in 11 studies for screening oral cancer, while multistep screening involving Epstein-Barr virus serologic testing for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

### Detection and quantification of focal uptake in head and neck tumours: (18)F-FDG PET/MR versus PET/CT [^114s7i2b]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

PET/MR and PET/CT examinations were successfully performed in all patients. Image quality, fusion quality, conspicuity, and anatomic location of focal uptake were good (Fig. 1). There was no statistically significant difference between mean PET/MR and PET/CT rating scores, and there was no mismatch in anatomic location between modalities for any of the lesions with focal uptake. Breathing, swallowing, and motion had no major impact on image quality in 31 patients and degraded image quality in one patient on both PET/MR and PET/CT scans. Dental fillings and implants impaired image quality on PET/MR scans in two patients (6.25%) and on PET/CT scans in four patients (12.5%).

### FDG-PET/CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^112KEMZB]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

FDG-PET/CT imaging has dramatically changed head and neck cancer imaging and management. FDG, however, is not tumor-specific, and various image interpretation pitfalls may occur due to false-positive and false-negative causes of FDG uptake. This article reviews the causes of physiological FDG uptake in the head and neck, and of uncommon patterns of uptake due to benign lesions, artifacts, recent surgery, inflammation, and scarring. Awareness of these tumor mimics, along with accurate clinical information, detailed anatomical evaluation, and — if necessary — correlation with other imaging modalities, such as CECT, US, or MRI, helps to avoid misinterpretation of head and neck PET/CT studies.

### PET/MRI in head and neck cancer: Initial experience [^117BAad3]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

To evaluate the feasibility of PET/MRI (positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) with FDG ((18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose) for initial staging of head and neck cancer, a study was conducted.

The study group comprised 20 patients (16 men, 4 women) aged between 52 and 81 years (median 64 years) with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region. The patients underwent a PET scan on a conventional scanner and a subsequent PET/MRI examination on a whole-body hybrid system. FDG was administered intravenously prior to the conventional PET scan (267–395 MBq FDG, 348 MBq on average). The maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) of the tumour and of both cerebellar hemispheres were determined for both PET datasets. The numbers of lymph nodes with increased FDG uptake were compared between the two PET datasets.

No MRI-induced artefacts were observed in the PET images. The tumour was detected by PET/MRI in 17 of the 20 patients, by PET in 16, and by MRI in 14. The PET/MRI examination yielded significantly higher SUV(max) than the conventional PET scanner for both the tumour (p < 0.0001) and the cerebellum (p = 0.0009). The number of lymph nodes with increased FDG uptake detected using the PET dataset from the PET/MRI system was significantly higher than the number detected by the stand-alone PET system (64 vs. 39, p = 0.001).

The study demonstrated that PET/MRI of the whole head and neck region is feasible with a whole-body PET/MRI system without impairment of PET or MR image quality.

### Detection of distant metastases and distant second primary cancers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Comparison of [F]FDG PET/MRI and [F]FDG PET/CT [^116KsaXy]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and was conducted in line with the guidelines of the Helsinki II Declaration.

- **Study design, patient inclusion, and standard of reference**: Inclusion criteria included adult HNSCC patients who underwent whole-body [18 F]FDG PET/MRI immediately followed by PET/CT. Patients required adequate image quality for image interpretation and an appropriate standard of reference to validate findings (i.e. histology and/or follow-up greater than 2 years after PET/MRI and PET/CT). Exclusion criteria involved standard MRI contraindications and refusal to participate. All potentially eligible patients provided written informed consent and completed both examinations without complications.

During a three-year period, 88 consecutive HNSCC patients, for whom MRI of the head and neck and whole-body [18 F]FDG PET/CT were clinically indicated, underwent a whole-body PET/MRI scan followed by whole-body PET/CT. Both examinations covered the area from the skull base to the mid-thighs. Six patients were excluded due to insufficient image quality (n = 2) or being lost to follow-up (n = 4). Consequently, 82 patients (70 men, 12 women; mean age ± SD = 61.0 ± 12.0 years) were included.

To avoid selection bias, all PET/MRI and PET/CT examinations performed during the study period were included in the analysis. Therefore, throughout the three-year period, one patient was examined seven times, another five times, 13 patients twice, and the remaining 67 patients were examined once.

### PET-MRI fusion in head-and-neck oncology: Current status and implications for hybrid PET/MRI [^111Wdint]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To review the status and clinical effect of PET-MRI image fusion in the staging of head-and-neck cancer and demonstrate its implications for imaging with future hybrid PET/MRI scanners, we reviewed the literature. This overview explores the potential of combining the anatomic and functional imaging capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the potential for molecular and metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). The research question focused on whether these imaging devices might offer synergistic value.

PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose has shown promising results for assessing lymph node involvement in cancer, identifying distant metastases and synchronous and metachronous tumors, and evaluating tumor recurrence or carcinoma of an unknown primary. For morphologic imaging, MRI has several advantages compared with computed tomography in the head-and-neck area, primarily due to its superior soft tissue contrast and fewer artifacts from dental implants. Additionally, MRI enables functional imaging, such as assessing perfusion with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Published data indicate that image fusion may be beneficial in cases of oromaxillofacial cancer recurrence and in evaluating potential metastatic lymph nodes. However, retrospective image fusion is technically demanding in the head-and-neck area, mainly due to the varying patient positions used for different scanners and the anatomical complexity of this region.

### Image fusion between 18FDG-PET and MRI/CT for radiotherapy planning of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal carcinomas [^115g5pPY]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2002). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of tumor extent is important in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. This study reports the use of image fusion between (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) for better target delineation in radiotherapy planning of head-and-neck cancers.

The subjects consisted of 12 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and 9 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who were treated with radical radiotherapy between July 1999 and February 2001. Image fusion between 18FDG-PET and MRI/CT was performed using an automatic multimodality image registration algorithm, which used the brain as an internal reference for registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was determined based on clinical examination and 18FDG uptake on the fusion images. Clinical target volume (CTV) was determined following the usual pattern of lymph node spread for each disease entity along with the clinical presentation of each patient.

Except for 3 cases with superficial tumors, all the other primary tumors were detected by 18FDG-PET. The GTV volumes for primary tumors were not changed by image fusion in 19 cases (89%), increased by 49% in one NPC, and decreased by 45% in another NPC. Normal tissue sparing was more easily performed based on clearer GTV and CTV determination on the fusion images. In particular, parotid sparing became possible in 15 patients (71%) whose upper neck areas near the parotid glands were tumor-free by 18FDG-PET.

### Target volume delineation in oropharyngeal cancer: Impact of PET, MRI, and physical examination [^111yNNJL]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

The sole utilization of computed tomography (CT) scans in gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation for head-and-neck cancers is subject to inaccuracies. This study aims to evaluate the contributions of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and physical examination (PE) to GTV delineation in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).

- **Methods**: Forty-one patients with OPC were studied. All underwent contrast-enhanced CT simulation scans (CECTs) that were registered with pretreatment PETs and MRIs. For each patient, three sets of primary and nodal GTV were contoured. First, reference GTVs (GTVref) were contoured by the treating radiation oncologist (RO) using CT, MRI, PET, and PE findings. Additional GTVs were created using fused CT/PET scans (GTVctpet) and CT/MRI scans (GTVctmr) by two other ROs blinded to GTVref. To compare GTVs, concordance indices (CI) were calculated by dividing the respective overlap volumes by overall volumes. To evaluate the contribution of PE, composite GTVs derived from CT, MRI, and PET (GTVctpetmr) were compared with GTVref.

- **Results**: For primary tumors, GTVref was significantly larger than GTVctpet and GTVctmr (p < 0.001). Although no significant difference in size was noted between GTVctpet and GTVctmr (p = 0.39), there was poor concordance between them (CI = 0.62). In addition, although CI (ctpetmr vs. ref) was low, it was significantly higher than CI (ctpet vs. ref) and CI (ctmr vs. ref) (p < 0.001), suggesting that neither modality should be used alone. Qualitative analyses to explain the low CI (ctpetmr vs. ref) revealed undetermined factors affecting concordance.

### FDG-PET/CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^113s8Z7r]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has evolved from a research modality to an invaluable tool in head and neck cancer imaging. However, interpretation of FDG PET/CT studies may be difficult due to the inherently complex anatomical landmarks, certain physiological variants, and unusual patterns of high FDG uptake in the head and neck. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive approach to key imaging features and interpretation pitfalls of FDG-PET/CT of the head and neck and how to avoid them.

- **Pathophysiological mechanisms and complementary techniques**: We review the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to potentially false-positive and false-negative assessments, and we discuss the complementary use of high-resolution contrast-enhanced head and neck PET/CT (HR HN PET/CT) and additional cross-sectional imaging techniques, including ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

- **Common interpretation pitfalls**: The commonly encountered false-positive PET/CT interpretation pitfalls are due to high FDG uptake by physiological causes, benign thyroid nodules, unilateral cranial nerve palsy, and increased FDG uptake due to inflammation, recent chemoradiotherapy, and surgery. False-negative findings are caused by lesion vicinity to structures with high glucose metabolism, obscuration of FDG uptake by dental hardware, inadequate PET scanner resolution, and inherent low FDG-avidity of some tumors.

The interpreting physician must be aware of these unusual patterns of FDG uptake as well as limitations of PET/CT as a modality to avoid misinterpretations.

### International EANM-SNMMI-ISMRM consensus recommendation for PET/MRI in oncology [^114yiTqE]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). High credibility.

PET/MRI is useful for detecting residual disease in patients after non-surgical therapy, with optimal diagnostic reassurance at 12 weeks after therapy. Residual disease after different kinds of therapy can reliably be detected with PET/MRI, as shown by Queiroz et al. PET/MRI for head and neck cancers can be safely performed without the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents. As shown by Kuhn et al, this approach is still as accurate as contrast-enhanced PET/CT imaging, provided fat-suppressed T2-weighted pulse sequences are used in the head and neck region.

- **Optimal results**: For optimal results in the head and neck, and to obviate a separate MRI acquisition, PET/MRI should additionally contain at least a non-suppressed T1-weighted sequence before contrast and a fat-suppressed post-contrast T1-weighted sequence. As shown by Sekine et al, such a protocol might be useful to determine the resectability of tumors.

- **Whole-body scanning**: After contrast administration, the whole-body T1-weighted MRI scan might be repeated in patients with known or suspected distant metastatic disease or with other primary tumors.

- **Acquisition and activity**: During the MRI acquisition in the head and neck region, which takes approximately 20 minutes using the minimum protocol outlined above, one may keep the PET camera active to obtain a dedicated regional PET dataset with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

- **Tumor characterization**: Functional MRI techniques aid in the characterization of tumors, lymph nodes, and suspected recurrences. However, their value in the setting of FDG-PET/MRI has not been studied in detail. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as part of a PET/MRI protocol appears useful to detect unknown primary tumors.

### Qualitative and quantitative performance of ¹⁸F-FDG-PET/MRI versus ¹⁸F-FDG-PET/CT in patients with head and neck cancer [^116yRCRm]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

MR imaging and PET/CT are integrated in the work-up of head and neck cancer patients. The hybrid imaging technology ¹⁸F-FDG-PET/MR imaging, which combines morphological and functional information, might be attractive in this patient population. The aim of the study was to compare whole-body ¹⁸F-FDG-PET/MR imaging and ¹⁸F-FDG-PET/CT in patients with head and neck cancer, both qualitatively in terms of lymph node and distant metastases detection, and quantitatively in terms of standardized uptake values measured in ¹⁸F-FDG-avid lesions.

Fourteen patients with head and neck cancer underwent both whole-body PET/CT and PET/MR imaging following a single injection of ¹⁸F-FDG. Two groups of readers counted the number of lesions on PET/CT and PET/MR imaging scans. A consensus reading was performed in cases where the groups disagreed. Quantitative standardized uptake value measurements were performed by placing spherical ROIs over the lesions in three different planes. Weighted and unweighted κ statistics, correlation analysis, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for statistical analysis.

- **Results**:
	- κ statistics for the number of head and neck lesions counted (pooled across regions) revealed interreader agreement between groups 1 and 2 of 0.47 and 0.56, respectively. Intrareader agreement was 0.67 and 0.63. The consensus reading provided an intrareader agreement of 0.63.
	- For the presence or absence of metastasis, interreader agreement was 0.85 and 0.70. The consensus reading provided an intrareader agreement of 0.72.

### Integrated whole-body PET/MR hybrid imaging: Clinical experience [^117Xo29j]. Investigative Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Integrated whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) scanners have recently been introduced and potentially offer new possibilities in hybrid imaging for oncologic patients. The integration of PET in a whole-body MR system necessitates new PET detector technology and novel approaches to attenuation correction of PET data based on MR imaging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance and image quality parameters of integrated whole-body PET/MR hybrid imaging in intraindividual comparison with PET/CT in oncologic patients.

Eighty patients participated in a single-injection, dual-imaging protocol consisting of whole-body PET/computed tomography (CT) followed by whole-body PET/MR hybrid imaging. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed following a resting period of 73 ± 13 minutes post-injection of 227 ± 52.7 MBq Fluor-18-Fluordesoxyglucose, with 3 minutes of acquisition time for each of 7 bed positions. This was followed by PET/MR imaging 172 ± 33 minutes post-injection, with 10 minutes of acquisition time for each of 4 bed positions. Positron emission tomographic data for both modalities were reconstructed iteratively.

Two observers assessed the following parameters:

- **Qualitative correlation**: Tracer-avid lesions in PET/CT versus PET/MR and PET image quality of PET/CT versus PET/MR.

- **Magnetic resonance image quality**: Standard sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted), performance of the Dixon sequence for MR-based attenuation correction in comparison with corresponding T1-weighted images, and artifacts in PET/MR data.

### PET/CT versus body coil PET/MRI: How low can you go [^1123RkFT]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has evolved into a mainstay of oncological imaging over the last decade. The interest to integrate PET with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a similar way has increased recently, and simultaneous PET/MRI or sequential PET/CT-MR systems potentially open new perspectives in clinical molecular imaging. Superior soft tissue contrast of MRI compared with CT and less radiation exposure are the most obvious advantages of a simultaneous system.

Other potential improvements — not yet proven in clinical trials — of PET/MRI over co-registered PET/CT include the detection and localisation of liver metastases, detection and characterisation of gynaecological tumours, as well as head and neck cancers. Conversely, PET/CT still has advantages in lesion detection and characterisation, for instance, in bone lesions and lung tumours.

Several technical and clinical issues, such as sequence selection, clinical indications, and workflow considerations, have to be addressed before PET/CT can potentially be replaced by PET/MRI. Clinical MR imaging in oncology indications is mainly focused on one body region, while PET/CT imaging is usually performed as whole-body imaging. However, since PET/MRI should measure up to PET/CT, several controversies are currently being debated in the literature concerning the clinical imaging protocol.

In clinical routine, MRI is typically done with surface coils to achieve sufficient resolution and signal intensity. Also, CT imaging is usually done with sufficient dose.

### To scan or not to scan: The dilemma of posttreatment imaging surveillance of head and neck cancer [^114qdqqH]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Locoregional recurrence remains common after treatment of head and neck cancer, warranting careful surveillance in follow-up. Although randomized data support an initial positron emission tomography/computed tomography several months after treatment, evidence supporting subsequent imaging is limited, and most recurrences ultimately manifest clinically. Cooperative group studies and consensus guidelines vary widely in their recommendations regarding surveillance imaging. Patients with indeterminate findings, new symptoms, or areas difficult to examine in clinic may avoid invasive and potentially morbid interventions with judicious use of subsequent imaging. For any patient undergoing posttreatment imaging, standardized reporting criteria provide a framework for risk stratification that can enhance communication and potentially guide management.

### PET/MR in head and neck cancer - an update [^112fjQPP]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In academic centers, PET/MR has been advancing in the field of clinical nuclear medicine over the past six years since the last review on its applications in head and neck cancer patients in this journal. During this time, older sequential PET + MR machines have largely disappeared from clinical sites, being replaced by integrated simultaneous PET/MR scanners. Evidence from several studies suggests that PET/MR performs comparably to PET/CT in the staging and restaging of head and neck cancer and in radiation therapy planning. PET/MR appears to offer advantages in the characterization and prognostication of head and neck malignancies through multiparametric imaging, which requires precise preparation and validation of imaging modalities.

The majority of current clinical PET/MR studies focus on FDG imaging of squamous cell carcinoma originating from a variety of locations in the upper aerodigestive tract. Future research should aim to address specific histopathological tumor entities, including nonepithelial malignancies such as major salivary gland tumors, squamous cell carcinomas in specific locations, and malignancies imaged with non-FDG radiotracers. With the advent of digital PET/CT scanners, PET/MR is expected to contribute to future technological advancements, such as novel iterative reconstruction techniques and deviceless motion correction for respiration and gross movement in the head and neck region. Despite the potential advancements, the high costs of PET/MR scanners and facility requirements remain a challenge.

### FDG PET/CT in carcinoma of unknown primary [^112PVca4]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two of the main technologies that dominate the imaging of human disease in clinical practice. Major advantages of these techniques include their ability to provide cross-sectional images of the entire body, which is especially important in carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP), because the primary tumor can be located anywhere. Additionally, whole-body imaging may detect or exclude additional metastatic sites, which may have important therapeutic or prognostic consequences. However, CT and conventional MRI, including (contrast-enhanced) T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences, are limited in that they typically only allow for the detection of anatomical abnormalities and abnormal contrast enhancement. Consequently, small lesions and non-enhancing lesions in normal-sized structures may be missed, particularly in CUP, where the primary tumor may be small.

Moreover, functional or metabolic pathological changes can occur in the absence of any corresponding anatomical changes and are not visualized by anatomical imaging at all. Furthermore, large amounts of image data are obtained in a single whole-body CT or MRI examination, making image interpretation complex and time-consuming, and subtle pathological findings may be overlooked. Therefore, sensitivity of CT and anatomical MRI for detecting the unknown primary tumor may be compromised. FDG PET does not have these drawbacks and may be an excellent alternative whole-body imaging modality in patients with CUP, as was already reported by Rege et al.

### Detection of distant metastases and distant second primary cancers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Comparison of [F]FDG PET/MRI and [F]FDG PET/CT [^116Jo93q]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Some authors have focused on discrepancies between PET/MRI and PET/CT and have pointed out that PET/MRI may be superior to PET/CT for the overall clinical management of oncologic patients. However, in our series, due to the similar detection rate of distant malignant lesions with both techniques, we could not confirm these observations.

Recently, it has been shown that the diagnostic performance of PET/MRI is similar to that of PET/CT in primary oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC in terms of detection of metastases and second primary cancers. While the study of Yeh et al. addressed metastases and second primary cancers in the HN region and in distant sites together, our study specifically focused on malignant lesions located outside the HN area. Practice in most institutions includes whole-body PET/CT or PET/MRI at 3–4 months post-treatment, and currently, there are no recommendations regarding imaging of distant anatomic areas in HNSCC patients with suspected loco-regional recurrence or follow-up beyond 3–4 months post-radiotherapy. However, our study suggests that, because of the high prevalence of distant metastases and distant second primary cancers occurring during follow-up (27% in this study), total body imaging with [18 F]FDG PET/CT or with [18 F]FDG PET/MRI should be considered more often. Furthermore, as [18 F]FDG PET/MRI has been shown to provide excellent results for detecting local recurrence after radio(chemo)therapy, loco-regional assessment can, therefore, be reliably complemented with whole-body PET/MRI for distant assessment.

### Positron emission tomography in the evaluation of stage III and IV head and neck cancer [^113u2N9M]. Head & Neck (2001). Low credibility.

Detection of metastatic disease in head and neck cancer patients is critical to preoperative planning because patients with distant metastasis will not benefit from surgical therapy. Conventional radiographic modalities, such as CT and MR, provide excellent anatomic detail but poorly identify unenlarged lymph nodes harboring metastatic disease.

- **Objective**: A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) detection of metastatic disease in patients with advanced-stage head and neck cancer.

- **Methods**: Total body FDG-PET imaging was performed prospectively on 12 consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of stage III or IV mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Chest CT was also performed on all 12 patients. Patients found to have metastatic disease on either CT or PET imaging underwent procedures to obtain histopathologic confirmation of the disease.

- **Results**: Three patients (25%) had FDG-PET scans demonstrating metastatic disease. Two of these patients had no evidence of disease on chest radiograph or chest CT but were noted to have positive FDG-PET imaging within the mediastinal lymphatics. Mediastinoscopy was performed confirming metastatic disease in these patients. The third patient had a peripheral lung lesion detected on chest radiograph, CT, and FDG-PET. This nodule was diagnosed by CT-guided biopsy as squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Conclusion**: FDG-PET scanning detected mediastinal disease in two patients (17%) with advanced-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

### State of the art MRI in head and neck cancer [^116su4E7]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Head and neck cancer affects more than 11,000 new patients per year in the UK, and imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, treatment planning, assessment, and post-treatment surveillance of these patients. The anatomical detail produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideally suited to staging and follow-up of primary tumors and cervical nodal metastases in the head and neck; however, anatomical images have limitations in cancer imaging. Increasingly, functional-based MRI techniques, which provide molecular, metabolic, and physiological information, are being incorporated into MRI protocols. This article reviews the state of the art of these functional MRI techniques with emphasis on those that are most relevant to the management of patients with head and neck cancer.

### FDG-PET delayed imaging for the detection of head and neck cancer recurrence after radio-chemotherapy: Comparison with MRI/CT [^111HyQNH]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

In advanced head and neck cancer, an organ-sparing approach comprising radiation therapy combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy has become an important technique. However, the high incidence of residual masses after therapy remains a problem. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the use of 2–18Ffluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) delayed imaging for the detection of recurrence of head and neck cancer after radio-chemotherapy, and compared the FDG-PET results with those of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT).

Forty-three lesions from 36 patients with head and neck cancer suspected to represent recurrence after radio-chemotherapy (median interval from therapy, 4 months) were studied. PET was performed at 2 hours after FDG injection and evaluated. The results were compared to those of contrast studies with MRI or CT performed within 2 weeks of the PET study, and to histological diagnosis (in all patients suspected of having recurrence) or clinical diagnosis.

- **Lesion-based sensitivity and negative predictive value**: The lesion-based sensitivity (visual interpretation) and negative predictive value of FDG-PET (88% and 91%, respectively) were higher than those of MRI/CT (75% and 67%, respectively).

- **Specificity, accuracy and positive predictive value**: The specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value of FDG-PET (78%, 81%, and 70%, respectively) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of MRI/CT (30%, 47%, and 39%, respectively).

Three of six patients with false positive findings had post-therapy inflammation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that retrospective evaluation with the standardized uptake…

### PET-MRI in the head and neck area: challenges and new directions [^116tNXY2]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Head and neck imaging may gain a clear advantage from PET-MRI if a system is used in which the entire head and neck area is imaged simultaneously by both techniques, rather than only the upper head and neck area, as in the study under discussion. Therefore, we must wait for an integrated system in which simultaneous whole-body PET-MRI is possible. Challenges such as slight streak artifacts in PET datasets and the full quantification of regional radiotracer activity should be addressed. Algorithms and procedures have been developed for MR-based PET attenuation correction. For a long time, this hardware challenge limited the ability of PET-MRI to compete with PET-CT or PET in terms of quantification. Since these hurdles seem to be successfully overcome, the first whole-body PET-MRI systems are expected soon in clinical practice. It may then be expected that integrated PET-MRI for head and neck imaging will likely be a formidable research tool and, in the near future, a routine clinical investigation.

### Comparison of FDG whole-body PET/CT and gadolinium-enhanced whole-body MRI for distant malignancies in patients with malignant tumors: a meta-analysis [^115XxZa2]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

We performed a meta-analysis to compare the performance of whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (WB-PET/CT) with that of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) for the overall assessment of distant malignancies in patients with malignant tumors.

- **Methods**: We performed a meta-analysis of 13 available articles involving 1,239 patients. We calculated sensitivities, specificities, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed using bivariate regression models for both WB-PET/CT and WB-MRI, respectively.

- **Results**: Across nine studies with 1,070 patients, WB-PET/CT demonstrated similar patient-based sensitivity (0.85 versus 0.85) and specificity (0.96 versus 0.97) when compared with WB-MRI. In five studies with 210 patients, WB-PET/CT showed similar lesion-based sensitivity (0.85 vs. 0.88) and specificity (0.90 vs. 0.89) compared to WB-MRI. Findings from four studies involving 511 patients indicated that the combined use of WB-PET/CT and WB-MRI may result in higher patient-based sensitivity (0.89) than WB-PET/CT (0.82) and WB-MRI (0.81) alone.

- **Conclusion**: Both WB-PET/CT and WB-MRI exhibit good diagnostic performance for the overall assessment of distant malignancies in patients with malignant tumors. The combined use may offer additional value over the use of WB-PET/CT and WB-MRI separately.

### Comparison of whole body positron emission tomography (PET)/PET-computed tomography and conventional anatomic imaging for detecting distant malignancies in patients with head and neck cancer: A meta-analysis [^113vYuBs]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the accuracy of whole body positron emission tomography (PET)/PET-computed tomography (CT) and conventional anatomic imaging for detecting distant malignancies in patients with head and neck cancer.

- **Study design**: Meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We performed a meta-analysis of all available studies. We compared the performance of whole body PET/PET-CT with that of conventional anatomic imaging by analyzing studies that had also used conventional anatomic imaging on the same patients.

- **Results**: Across eight studies (1,147 patients), the sensitivity and specificity of PET/PET-CT were 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.88) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.97), respectively, while for conventional anatomic imaging, they were 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29–0.61) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88–0.98), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that PET/PET-CT had higher sensitivity than conventional anatomic imaging for nasopharyngeal cancer (0.82 vs. 0.30) and non-nasopharyngeal head and neck cancer (0.85 vs. 0.62).

- **Conclusions**: Compared with conventional anatomic imaging, whole body PET/PET-CT has excellent diagnostic performance for detecting distant malignancies in patients with head and neck cancer.

### Whole-body MRI and PET-CT in the management of cancer patients [^114EhuVp]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Mortality rate, prognosis, and treatment outcome of cancer patients depend strongly on the detection of malignancy at an early stage and efficient monitoring of the disease. Multimodality diagnostic approaches are now widely applied for tumor detection, staging, and follow-up. However, the introduction of whole-body imaging modalities into clinical practice has substantially expanded diagnostic options.

PET-CT has increased diagnostic accuracy by providing "anatometabolic" information by fusing tumor glucose-uptake measures from the PET examination and an accurate delineation of anatomical structures provided by spiral CT. Since PET-CT is associated with high doses of ionizing radiation, it is mainly used in tumor staging and screening within the scope of tertiary prevention. Here, promising results have been reported for various tumor entities.

MRI provides excellent tissue contrast, detailed morphological information, and the lack of ionizing radiation. MRI has been employed for the assessment of focal pathologies in specific anatomical regions. Whole-body MRI scanners using multiple receiver channels with parallel acquisition techniques now allow tumor screening from head to toe within substantially shorter examination times and without compromises in image resolution. We report our experience with these two novel techniques and discuss their benefits and drawbacks in terms of systemic tumor screening.

### Positron emission tomography/computed tomography true fusion imaging in clinical head and neck oncology: early experience [^111rTfaQ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a new imaging modality that provides simultaneous functional and anatomic information. Its application in head and neck oncology is still evolving.

- **Materials and methods**: Five illustrative cases scanned with this technique are presented.

- **Results**: The clinical application and impact on clinical management are described and discussed.

- **Conclusion**: Our experience indicates that PET-CT will assume a more important role than either CT, magnetic resonance imaging, or PET alone in head and neck cancer imaging.

### Local recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after radio(chemo)therapy: Diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/MRI with diffusion-weighted sequences [^115ETwGy]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Two board-certified radiologists with substantial experience in head and neck (HN) MRI and PET/CT (> 15 years), along with a board-certified nuclear medicine physician with substantial experience in PET/CT and HN MRI (> 10 years), evaluated the images separately and were blinded to all clinical and histopathological data. In case of discrepant evaluations, consensus was reached. Findings were recorded on pre-defined evaluation sheets using a five-point scale for receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis as follows: 1, definitely negative for recurrence; 2, probably negative; 3, indeterminate, suspicious/possibly positive; 4, probably positive; and 5, definitely positive.

The three readers evaluated morphological MRI first, then DWI and PET. All images (MRI, DWI, and PET) were assessed according to the diagnostic criteria established in the literature, taking into consideration diagnostic pitfalls related to radiation-induced changes. Internationally established qualitative and quantitative criteria were applied. Tumours involving the upper aero-digestive tract, the neopharynx (after total laryngectomy), or flaps in the oral cavity/pharynx were considered as local recurrence. On MRI, tumours were diagnosed in the presence of well-defined or ill-defined mass-like lesions with intermediate T2 signal ('evil grey'), moderate contrast enhancement, and restricted diffusivity (high signal on b1000, low signal on ADC). Lesions with high signal on T2, strong contrast enhancement, and high signal on b1000 and ADC were also evaluated.

### Comparison of CT, MRI, and F-18 FDG PET/CT for initial N-staging of oral squamous cell carcinoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^11455dDp]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most frequent cancer entity in the head and neck region and among the most common oncologic diseases. Besides a thoroughly performed clinical exam, imaging plays a central role in diagnosing oral squamous carcinoma. These examinations consist of anamnesis (e.g. with regard to smoking habits) followed by intraoral inspection, neck palpation, and biopsy if necessary. Adequate diagnosis of local tumor extent and early detection of metastases are crucial for early disease detection, therapy monitoring, and clinical staging.

Treatment of OSCC, including resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, is based on clinical exams, biopsy, and a precise imaging-based TNM-evaluation. The diagnostic standard involves computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, neck, and chest. However, recent studies have reported the advantage of diffusion-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences in detecting local disease extent, as well as F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with CT (PET/CT) scanning in determining the extent of nodal spread. Previous studies have shown that the high sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT in determining N-stage can avoid the need for additional diagnostic procedures.

Given the diagnostic advantages of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the detection of lymph node involvement and the precision of new MRI techniques for assessing local invasion, their cost-effectiveness has been assessed for treatment response evaluation but not for initial staging purposes.

### PET/CT and 3-T whole-body MRI in the detection of malignancy in treated oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma [^113Dj8Sq]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

We performed a prospective comparison of the diagnostic capability of integrated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (PET/CT), 3-T whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI), and their combination in detecting malignancy in treated oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OHSCC).

Seventy-nine OHSCC patients at a high risk of residual disease or suspected to have recurrence after the completion of chemoradiation were included in the study. All patients underwent PET/CT and WB-MRI within 10 days of each other. Histology and follow-up data were used as the reference standard. The McNemar test was used to compare sensitivity and specificity, while the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for comparison of diagnostic capabilities.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine patients (36.7%) had residual/recurrent tumors or second primary tumors. Overall, there was a trend towards increased sensitivity and diagnostic capability for PET/CT compared with WB-MRI (72.4% vs 55.2%, p = 0.13; 0.826 vs 0.753, p = 0.24, respectively). The diagnostic capability of combined interpretation of PET/CT and WB-MRI was similar to PET/CT alone (0.827 vs 0.826, p = 0.97) but was significantly higher than WB-MRI alone (0.827 vs 0.753, p = 0.04).

- **Conclusion**: PET/CT showed a trend towards higher diagnostic capability than 3-T WB-MRI in detecting residual/recurrent tumors or second primary tumors in OHSCC. The combined use of PET/CT and WB-MRI provided more added value to WB-MRI alone than to PET/CT alone.

### Initial clinical results of simultaneous 18F-FDG PET/MRI in comparison to 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with head and neck cancer [^111GqSCQ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic capability of simultaneous (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI compared to (18)F-FDG PET/CT, as well as their single components, in patients with head and neck cancer.

In a prospective study, 17 patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for staging or follow-up and an additional (18)F-FDG PET/MRI scan with whole-body imaging and dedicated examination of the neck. MRI, CT, and PET images, along with PET/MRI and PET/CT examinations, were evaluated independently and in a blinded fashion by two reader groups. Results were compared with the reference standard, which was the final diagnosis determined in consensus using all available data, including histology and follow-up. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.

A total of 23 malignant tumors were identified by the reference standard. PET/CT displayed a sensitivity of 82.7%, a specificity of 87.3%, a PPV of 73.2%, and an NPV of 92.4%. Corresponding values for PET/MRI were 80.5%, 88.2%, 75.6%, and 92.5%. There was no statistically significant difference in diagnostic capability between PET/CT and PET/MRI. The PET component of PET/CT showed the highest sensitivity of 95.7%, while MRI exhibited the best specificity of 96.4%. A high inter-rater agreement was noted across all modalities (Cohen's kappa 0.61–0.82).

PET/MRI demonstrated good diagnostic capability in patients with head and neck cancer, comparable to PET/CT. Further studies on larger cohorts are needed to validate these initial findings.

### FDG-PET/CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^115yPPsT]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

A detailed discussion of institutional PET/CT imaging protocols used in head and neck cancer patients is beyond the scope of this article. Nevertheless, familiarity with the basic principles of PET/CT imaging in head and neck oncology is important, as biological factors and the choice of imaging parameters, such as field of view (FOV), slice thickness, or use of iodinated contrast material, may influence the interpretation of PET/CT findings. In most institutions, head and neck tumor patients will often undergo a standard PET/CT examination without intravenous contrast material; the area investigated typically extends from the mid-forehead to the mid-thigh.

Nevertheless, an increasing number of authors advocate the additional use of a dedicated high-resolution head and neck PET/CT (HR HN PET/CT) with a small FOV, longer acquisition time per bed position, and thinner slice thickness. The additional use of intravenous contrast allows full diagnostic CT capability and improves diagnostic performance in the head and neck area. HR HN PET/CT is particularly helpful in identifying subtle morphological findings essential for diagnosing local tumor spread and detecting small lymph node metastases, thus reducing false-negative PET/CT readings. Routinely, PET/CT examinations are performed following a 6-hour fasting period when the measured intravenous serum glucose concentration prior to the study's beginning is within normal limits (< 200 mg/dl). In general, 150–555 MBq (about 5–6 MBq of F 18-FDG per kilogram of body weight) is administered.

### Functional imaging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with diffusion-weighted MRI and FDG PET/CT: quantitative analysis of ADC and SUV [^116bX5Ny]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Over 90% of malignant head and neck tumors in adults are squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Appropriate assessment of superficial and deep tumor spread, regional lymphadenopathy, and distant metastases is essential for staging and therapeutic planning. According to the guidelines of the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), tumor staging requires endoscopy with biopsy and additional imaging.

Morphologic evaluation is preferably done with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. However, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW MRI) are increasingly used in oncologic head and neck imaging to add diagnostic information beyond morphology. Although each modality is based on different physical principles, both modalities may be seen as functional imaging tools as they allow interrogation of tissue with regard to certain biologic properties. FDG PET/CT measures increased cellular glucose metabolism as expressed by the standardized uptake value (SUV). In oncologic imaging, increased SUV may be seen as a sign of increased cell proliferation and may also correlate with the degree of tumor necrosis. The principle of DW MRI as a functional biomarker is based on the assessment of random (Brownian) motion of extracellular water molecules, which is restricted in hypercellular tumor tissue, as expressed by the decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value. In addition, ADC values may also reflect cell proliferation and may be affected by the presence of tumor necrosis and other histopathologic features.

### Positron-emission tomography for head and neck cancer [^117T2Fmj]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Positron-emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging technology that has the potential to improve the staging and detection of tumors compared to more conventional morphologic imaging techniques. It is a noninvasive method that can expose molecular processes in cells and the biological characteristics of tumors. The use of PET for staging and early detection or residual disease may allow additional intervention with more aggressive treatments, potentially improving outcomes for individual patients.

Optimal scanning is highly dependent on the technique of image acquisition and the available technology. The most promising technological development is the combination of CT PET scanners, which will allow exact anatomical correlation with areas of increased tracer uptake. New tracers may facilitate the quantification of cellular processes such as apoptosis or hypoxia, and identify tumors that may respond to certain targeted therapies. This capability may enable tailoring treatment to molecular characteristics and improved outcomes for patients. This review summarizes the available literature for PET in patients with head and neck cancer.

### Detection and quantification of focal uptake in head and neck tumours: (18)F-FDG PET/MR versus PET/CT [^111L4aVh]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

This prospective clinical study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki II declaration. Over a period of 12 months, we included consecutive patients with head and neck tumours in whom MRI of the head and neck and whole-body 18 F-FDG PET/CT were clinically indicated. All participants gave informed consent to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were standard contraindications for MRI and refusal to participate in the study. None of the potentially eligible patients refused to participate, and all were able to undergo both examinations.

Therefore, 32 consecutive patients (13 women, 19 men; mean age 59 ± 18 years) with known or suspected head and neck tumours underwent a whole-body PET/MR scan followed by a whole-body PET/CT scan.

- **Patient indications**:
	- In 13 patients, the indication for imaging was the primary staging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (12 patients) or lymphoma (1 patient). In 18 patients, the imaging was indicated for suspected recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (17 patients) or rhabdomyosarcoma (1 patient). In one patient, the indication was head and neck lymph node metastasis from an unknown primary.

The proof of diagnosis consisted of histology (endoscopic biopsy or surgical resection), follow-up of at least 12 months, or a combination of histology and follow-up. Histologic proof with or without follow-up was available for the primary site in 28 patients, for lymph node status in 18 patients, and for the chest and remainder.
