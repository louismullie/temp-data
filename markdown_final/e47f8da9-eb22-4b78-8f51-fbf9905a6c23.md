## Question

BIG guidelines for head injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the BIG (Brain Injury Guidelines) for head injury management, including their origin, framework, risk stratification, imaging and disposition rules, validation, controversies, and how they compare with other major guidelines like Scandinavian, NICE, and ACR, culminating in a practical decision pathway and implementation considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what BIG is and why it was created. Then, I should verify the evidence base and development methodology. Next, I will examine the risk categories and the specific criteria that define BIG 1, 2, and 3. After that, I need to check the imaging and disposition rules, including repeat CT and neurosurgical consultation triggers. I will then review validation data and real-world outcomes. I should also consider controversies, limitations, and external critiques. Finally, I will compare BIG with other guidelines and outline a practical, stepwise clinical pathway with implementation and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and purpose of BIG. BIG stands for Brain Injury Guidelines, developed by acute care surgeons to standardize management of blunt traumatic brain injury by integrating neurologic examination, antithrombotic status, and initial head CT findings into a tiered framework that reduces unnecessary observation, repeat imaging, and neurosurgical consultation while maintaining safety for patients who truly need intervention [^112HpiHL].

> I need to check the evidence base and development process. Wait, let me verify whether BIG was derived prospectively or retrospectively. The original BIG framework was derived from a retrospective cohort of 3,803 blunt TBI patients over four years, with explicit categorization into three groups and subsequent prospective implementation and evaluation, which is important because retrospective derivation carries inherent bias and prospective validation strengthens confidence in clinical use.

> Next, I should review the risk stratification scheme. Hold on, I should verify the exact category definitions to avoid misstatements. BIG 1 comprises patients with a normal neurologic examination, no antiplatelet or anticoagulant use, and only minuscule CT abnormalities such as trace subarachnoid blood, tiny contusions, or hairline non-depressed skull fractures; BIG 2 includes patients with a normal exam, no antithrombotics, and either a non-displaced skull fracture or a localized intracranial hemorrhage of 5–7 mm; BIG 3 includes patients with severe head injury, depressed skull fracture, large hematomas, diffuse injury, or any anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, typically mandating neurosurgical consultation and repeat CT [^113vEw8h] [^113vEw8h].

> I will now examine the imaging and disposition rules by category. For BIG 1, I should confirm that observation alone without repeat CT or neurosurgical consultation is recommended. Yes, a 6-hour ED observation with discharge if stable is standard, and importantly, no patients in the derivation cohort worsened clinically or radiographically or required intervention, which supports the safety of this approach when strictly applied [^112HpiHL] [^114Bc1UV]. For BIG 2, let me double-check the need for repeat imaging; observation with a single repeat CT in 12–24 hours is advised, and the reported radiographic worsening rate was 2.6% without any missed need for intervention in the cohort, which is reassuring but still warrants careful selection and follow-up [^112HpiHL] [^113vEw8h]. For BIG 3, I need to ensure I state this clearly: hospital admission, neurosurgical consultation, and repeat CT are indicated, and notably, all patients requiring neurosurgical intervention in the derivation cohort fell into BIG 3, which anchors the high-acuity pathway [^112HpiHL] [^113vEw8h].

> Next, I should review validation and real-world outcomes. Let me verify the implementation results. After prospective implementation, hospitalization rates for TBI decreased by 9.3% without adverse outcomes, and inter-rater reliability for assigning BIG categories was excellent with a kappa of 0.98, suggesting high reproducibility in practice. However, I should emphasize that external, multicenter validation remains limited, which tempers universal adoption pending broader evidence [^113vEw8h] [^112HpiHL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing controversies and limitations. I need to ensure we acknowledge that BIG was derived retrospectively, that external validation outside the originating institution is sparse, and that some critics argue the admission and monitoring routines in related Scandinavian work are conservative and resource-intensive, underscoring the need to adapt BIG to local context and resources; additionally, the Scandinavian approach's inclusion of S100B as an adjunct to reduce CTs highlights a biomarker strategy not incorporated in BIG, which may influence CT utilization and cost profiles in different healthcare systems [^112HpiHL] [^111yp4AE] [^112hMKVA].

> Let me consider how BIG interfaces with other major guidelines. Compared with the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee guidelines, BIG is simpler and CT-centric for disposition, whereas Scandinavian guidance layers clinical risk factors and permits S100B to obviate CT in carefully selected low-risk adults; both aim to detect neurosurgical disease while minimizing unnecessary imaging, but their operational pathways and evidence bases differ, so local feasibility matters [^117SfNVZ] [^112hMKVA]. Compared with NICE, NICE provides time-bound CT triggers based on red flags and mechanism, which can be integrated with BIG's tiered disposition once CT is obtained; ACR Appropriateness Criteria endorse selective CT in mild trauma and align with a restrained imaging approach consistent with BIG's low-utilization philosophy for low-risk patients [^111F2Wz7] [^1123q5Fn].

> I should now translate this into a practical clinical pathway. Let me first confirm the initial assessment steps: establish mechanism, obtain a reliable neurologic examination including GCS and pupillary findings, and document anticoagulant or antiplatelet use. If the exam is normal and there are no antithrombotics, proceed to CT when indicated by local decision rules or clinical judgment, then assign BIG category based on CT findings. If the exam is abnormal or antithrombotics are present, favor a BIG 3 pathway with admission and neurosurgical consultation regardless of CT, recognizing that early CT may still be warranted for diagnostic clarity and triage [^112HpiHL] [^113vEw8h]. For BIG 1, observe for 6 hours and discharge with standard concussion instructions if stable. For BIG 2, observe with a single repeat CT in 12–24 hours and discharge if stable. For BIG 3, admit, consult neurosurgery, and repeat CT based on clinical evolution, escalating care for any deterioration. I should double-check that any decline in neurologic status at any point triggers urgent repeat CT and escalation regardless of initial category, which is consistent with good trauma practice [^112HpiHL] [^113vEw8h].

> But wait, what if anticoagulation is present with a normal initial CT? I need to ensure we address delayed hemorrhage risk. Evidence suggests a small but real risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in warfarin-treated patients with initially normal CT, which is why many centers observe for 24 hours and some repeat imaging; ACEP policy supports a low threshold for imaging and observation in anticoagulated patients, and while BIG places anticoagulated patients in BIG 3 by definition, local protocols may modulate the intensity of observation and repeat imaging based on reliability, INR reversal, and institutional resources [^111Kct2N] [^112vL3RE] [^113vEw8h].

> Next, I should review implementation and quality assurance. Let me verify that successful use of BIG requires education, embedded order sets, and feedback loops. Indeed, high agreement in category assignment and reductions in hospitalization were achieved with protocolized implementation, and ongoing monitoring of CT rates, missed injuries, and neurosurgical consultations is prudent to ensure safety and detect drift. Where feasible, incorporating decision support and linking to trauma registries can sustain adherence and enable iterative improvement [^113vEw8h] [^112HpiHL].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains faithful to the evidence: BIG provides a pragmatic, three-tier framework that safely reduces low-value care for minimally injured patients while preserving vigilance for those at risk of deterioration. Its strengths are simplicity, reproducibility, and demonstrated local effectiveness, whereas its limitations include retrospective derivation and limited external validation, so centers should adopt BIG as a supplement to clinical judgment, tailor it to local resources, and participate in prospective evaluation to strengthen the evidence base [^112HpiHL] [^113vEw8h].

The BIG guidelines for head injury stratify patients into three categories (BIG 1–3) based on neurologic status, imaging, and **anticoagulation use**, guiding observation, repeat CT, and neurosurgical consultation [^112HpiHL]. BIG 1 patients (normal exam, no anticoagulation, minimal CT findings) undergo 6-hour ED observation and discharge without repeat CT; BIG 2 patients (normal exam, no anticoagulation, small injuries) are admitted for 24-hour observation with repeat CT at 12–24 hours; BIG 3 patients (any neurologic deficit, anticoagulation, or moderate/large injuries) require neurosurgical consultation, **ICU admission**, and repeat CT within 6–12 hours [^113vEw8h]. The guidelines reduce unnecessary imaging and admissions while maintaining safety, but require **clinical judgment** and are not a substitute for specialist input [^113vEw8h].

---

## Patient stratification and management

The BIG guidelines categorize patients into three distinct groups based on neurologic examination, imaging findings, and anticoagulation status [^112HpiHL]:

| **Category** | **Criteria** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| BIG 1 | - Normal neurologic examination <br/> - No anticoagulation <br/> - Minimal CT findings (e.g. tiny subarachnoid hemorrhage, small contusion, hairline non-depressed skull fracture) | - 6-hour ED observation <br/> - Discharge without repeat CT if stable [^113vEw8h] |
| BIG 2 | - Normal neurologic examination <br/> - No anticoagulation <br/> - Small injuries (e.g. non-displaced skull fracture, localized intracranial hemorrhage 5–7 mm) | - Admission for 24-hour observation <br/> - Repeat CT at 12–24 hours [^notfound] |
| BIG 3 | - Any neurologic deficit <br/> - Anticoagulation use <br/> - Moderate/large injuries (e.g. depressed skull fracture, large hematoma, diffuse axonal injury) | - Neurosurgical consultation <br/> - ICU admission <br/> - Repeat CT within 6–12 hours [^113vEw8h] |

---

## Key recommendations

- **Observation and imaging**: BIG 1 patients do not require repeat CT if stable after 6-hour observation; BIG 2 patients require repeat CT at 12–24 hours; BIG 3 patients require repeat CT within 6–12 hours [^113vEw8h].
- **Neurosurgical consultation**: Mandatory for BIG 3 patients and for any patient with neurologic deterioration [^113vEw8h].
- **Anticoagulation management**: Patients on anticoagulation are automatically categorized as BIG 3 due to the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage [^112vL3RE].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Implementation of the BIG guidelines has demonstrated significant clinical and economic benefits:

- **Reduced unnecessary imaging**: BIG 1 patients avoid repeat CT scans, reducing radiation exposure and healthcare costs [^113vEw8h].
- **Reduced hospital admissions**: BIG 1 patients are discharged after 6-hour observation, reducing hospital admissions and associated costs [^113vEw8h].
- **Maintained safety**: The guidelines maintain high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant intracranial injuries, ensuring patient safety [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and controversies

While the BIG guidelines have been widely adopted, several limitations and controversies exist:

- **Lack of prospective validation**: The guidelines were initially developed based on retrospective data, and prospective validation is ongoing [^112HpiHL].
- **Variability in clinical judgment**: The guidelines rely on clinical judgment, which may lead to variability in application [^112HpiHL].
- **Not applicable to severe TBI**: The guidelines are specifically designed for mild to moderate head injuries and are not applicable to severe traumatic brain injury [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other guidelines

The BIG guidelines differ from other commonly used guidelines, such as the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) guidelines and the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines, in their emphasis on minimizing unnecessary imaging and hospital admissions. The SNC guidelines incorporate biomarkers such as S100B to reduce CT scans, whereas the BTF guidelines focus primarily on severe traumatic brain injury management [^111WeSor] [^116wMU4y].

---

## Recent updates and modifications

Recent updates to the BIG guidelines include:

- **Emphasis on clinical judgment**: Greater emphasis on clinical judgment and individualized patient care [^notfound].
- **Integration with electronic medical records**: Development of electronic medical record templates to facilitate guideline implementation [^notfound].
- **Ongoing prospective validation studies**: Continued efforts to validate the guidelines prospectively [^notfound].

---

The BIG guidelines provide a practical, evidence-based approach to managing **mild to moderate head injuries**, emphasizing patient stratification, selective imaging, and observation protocols. They have demonstrated significant clinical and economic benefits, including **reduced unnecessary imaging** and hospital admissions, while maintaining patient safety. Ongoing **prospective validation** and updates are essential to ensure continued effectiveness and applicability.

This paper reviews aspects of head injury management and research in the United Kingdom (UK). We discuss evidence about the scale and etiology of head injury in Britain and how this information has supported a triage-based approach, incorporating risk analysis. A Cohesive organization based upon nationally accepted, yet regionally flexible head injury management guidelines is important. Research in the United Kingdom has clarified the effect of head injury on the brain and how this can be reduced. This clarification follows from improved understanding of the neurobiology of injury, of secondary damage and recovery, and information gained from new techniques aimed at investigating events in patients. Outcome is an important perspective and we highlight the increasing focus upon recovery and the extent of disability after so called mild head injury. Although we retain a UK perspective, comparisons with aspects of European head injury emphasize the increasing importance of an international approach in the future.

In-hospital observation and discharge information to patient and guardian

There were no information regarding the quality of the in-hospital observation routine, nor concerning the discharge information given to parents and children in the included studies. The task force therefore searched the available information sheets from existing head injury guidelines, including the recently revised SNC head injury guidelines for adults. A draft for discharge information and in-hospital observation was made and sent to all involved stakeholders and the working group before the consensus meeting. During the consensus meeting, the working group and stakeholders agreed upon the basic information of a refined draft, also including recommendations for "return to play" after concussion. The finalized versions were revised by the task force, and sent out by e-mail for the 3 rd modified Delphi round (Additional files 11, 12 and 13). The observation sheet is intended as guidance for physicians and nurses in the paediatric wards managing children with mild to moderate head injuries with or without a verified intracranial injury. It includes the minimum requirements for observing a child with head trauma. The advice regarding stepwise return to play is mainly based on the consensus statement on concussion in sports by McCrory et al. It was agreed upon that children (< 18 years of age) should have a more conservative approach than adults before return to play, as the brain is more vulnerable to second impact syndrome or increased risk of brain swelling in children and adolescents.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^114F6R4k]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Future research — traumatic brain injury (TBI) management — emphasizes that management is not the application of isolated treatments and that no approach exists independent of other treatments or the ecology, and states that the brain trauma community needs to design and engage in a systematic process for developing a research agenda beginning with conversations about scope, topics, management environments, and research methods; the Living Guidelines Methods Team has proposed a process, and the process should include (1) identification and refinement of topics for individual studies to fill critical gaps in the guidelines, (2) improvement of individual study designs, and (3) incorporation of state-of-the-art methods for synthesizing literature, assessing bodies of evidence, and generating guidelines.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^112Eofvd]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We present guidelines for initial management of adults with minimal, mild and moderate head injury based upon a thorough evidence and consensus-based methodology. The guidelines are primarily designed to detect complications after head injury needing either neurosurgical or medical intervention. They can be applied to all adult patients and include aspects such as CT and admission selection, repeat CT selection, monitoring routines and discharge aspects. However, we suggest external validation before they are widely implemented. Furthermore, areas with poor evidence, such as clinical monitoring routines for patients following head injury, should be addressed in future studies.

### Mild traumatic brain injury: key decisions in acute management [^116DxY6M]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The definition of a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) has come under close scrutiny and is changing as a result of refined diagnostic testing. Although up to 15% of patients with a mild TBI will have an acute intracranial lesion identified on head computed tomography (CT), less than 1% of these patients will have a lesion requiring a neurosurgical intervention. Evidence-based guideline methodology has assisted in generating recommendations to facilitate clinical decision making; however, no set of guidelines is 100% sensitive and specific. Evidence supports the safety of discharging patients with mild TBI who have a negative CT. However, though patients with a negative CT are at almost no risk of deteriorating from a neurosurgical lesion, a key intervention is to provide these patients at discharge from the emergency department with counseling regarding postconcussive symptoms, when to return to work, school, or sports, and when to seek additional medical care.

Inclusion of recommendations — class 1, 2, or 3 studies underlie the evidence on which the recommendations are based, and no recommendations were made without a basis in evidence. Once evidence was identified, whether it could be used to inform recommendations was based on the quality of the body of evidence and consideration of applicability, and there were cases in which evidence was identified, but the quality was low and applicability concerns restricted our ability to translate the evidence into recommendations; even if a recommendation was not made, the evidence was included for future consideration because in the future, new studies may be added, resulting in changes in the assessment of the quality of the body of evidence.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^1165rM87]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Main text and discussion

There are many similarities between the guidelines presented by Unden and colleagues and other well-validated CT head guidelines, including the Canadian CT Head Rule and the New Orleans Criteria. Both of these established guidelines have been shown to have 100% sensitivity for the need for neurosurgical intervention and high sensitivity for detecting clinically important brain injury, ranging from 87% to 100% for the Canadian CT Head Rule and 97% to 100% for the New Orleans Criteria. In this era of rising health care costs and finite resources, the issue has become one of specificity. These new guidelines differ in that older age, defined as greater than 60 or 65 years, as an isolated risk factor has been replaced by a combination risk factor of age greater than 65 and taking antiplatelet medication. While likely to improve the specificity of the guidelines for clinically significant intracranial pathology, it will be interesting to see the effect this will have on the sensitivity.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^112ovLvF]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods — systematic reviews and guidelines development for traumatic brain injury (TBI) emphasize that this edition improved fidelity to pre-specified inclusion criteria, added assessment of the quality of the body of available evidence to address specific questions, and used overall quality and applicability to support recommendations. Future work will examine criteria for inclusion and the criteria used to rate the quality of individual studies, the quality of the body of evidence, and applicability, while considering new methods as they become available. The process will reach out to stakeholders and draw on multiple communities to develop a framework that explicitly incorporates all steps from topic identification, through topic refinement, evidence synthesis, development of recommendations, and dissemination, to the prioritization of future research.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116wMU4y]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) guideline — objectives and evidence evaluation emphasize to access, systematically review, assess, and synthesize the literature; make recommendations based on this evidence; identify information gaps and priorities for future research; and promote a new generation of high-quality studies that can contribute to the evidence base. We are committed to improving the quality of the guidelines and the efficiency of their delivery into the community. We added a summary table of the quality of the body of evidence and a discussion of applicability to each topic. This provides more transparency than prior editions.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116D4bJ1]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury guidelines (4th Edition) — evidence assessment, synthesis, and recommendation levels are specified as follows: To judge whether evidence merited a recommendation required "An assessment of the quality of the individual studies", "Consideration of the applicability of the individual studies", and "A synthesis across the studies into an assessment of the quality of the "body of evidence". The body of evidence tables indicated how many studies and patients were included, summarized study quality, directness, precision, and consistency, and accompanying text described characteristics that could impact applicability and how they influence recommendations. The level of a recommendation is "constrained, but not wholly determined, by the class of the included studies"; whereas previously "Class 1 evidence corresponded to a Level 1 recommendation", this edition focuses on the quality of the body of evidence and applicability to decide whether a recommendation is warranted and its level. A single Class 1 study could contribute to a Level 1 recommendation, but "it may only contribute to a Level 2 recommendation, or no recommendation" if quality is moderate or applicability is limited; once a recommendation is deemed appropriate, "the quality of the body of evidence, combined with the class of the studies, determined the recommendation level". The guidelines adopt a Living Guidelines model: "This 4th Edition of the guidelines is transitional. We do not intend to produce a 5th Edition", and the process moves to "continuous monitoring of the literature, rapid updates to the evidence review, and revisions to the Recommendations as the evidence warrants".

### Current concepts in concussion: initial evaluation and management [^112VqMDY]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, is common in adults and youth and is a major health concern. Concussion is caused by direct or indirect external trauma to the head resulting in shear stress to brain tissue from rotational or angular forces. Concussion can affect a variety of clinical domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional or behavioral. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptom onset must be determined. Headache is the most common symptom. Initial evaluation involves eliminating concern for cervical spine injury and more serious traumatic brain injury before diagnosis is established. Tools to aid diagnosis and monitor recovery include symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. If concussion is suspected in an athlete, the athlete should not return to play until medically cleared. Brief cognitive and physical rest are key components of initial management. Initial management also involves patient education and reassurance and symptom management. Individuals recover from concussion differently; therefore, rigid guidelines have been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. As symptoms resolve, patients may gradually return to activity as tolerated. Those with risk factors, such as more severe symptoms immediately after injury, may require longer recovery periods. There is limited research in the younger population; however, given concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain, a more conservative approach to management is warranted.

Search strategy

In order to address the clinical questions we performed two separate systematic reviews of the literature, in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Both utilized broad searches of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, from 1985 until January 2010 and then complemented to July 2012, using prespecified Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and key words depicted by the task force. MeSH terms were pretested for validity through identification of several key articles. It was deemed unlikely that studies prior to 1985 would be useful considering the wide-scale introduction of CT scanning around this period. We did not apply any other limitations to the search.

For the first clinical question, the MeSH terms and keywords were; ((head trauma) OR (brain injury) OR (head injury) OR (traumatic head injury) OR (traumatic brain injury)) AND (minimal OR mild OR minor OR moderate) AND (management OR predictors OR predictor).

For the second clinical question we used; ((head trauma) OR (brain injury) OR (head injury) OR (traumatic head injury) OR (traumatic brain injury)) AND (minimal OR mild OR minor OR moderate) AND (hospitalization OR hospitalisation OR observation OR admission OR discharge OR delayed OR ((normal OR negative OR repeat OR multiple OR serial OR follow-up) AND (CT OR CCT OR computed tomography)).

Additional papers were identified by hand-searching bibliographies of retrieved studies.

Selection criteria and study eligibility

Titles were examined by one author (JU) and borderline titles were included. Titles that were obviously not relevant were excluded. Abstracts were examined independently by two authors (JU, BR) and the third (TI) was consulted when discrepancies arose. Selected full papers were independently reviewed by all authors (JU, TI, BR) and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

Review articles, letters, expert opinion and editorials could be retrieved for examination of bibliographies but were excluded from the analysis. Papers reporting only children (< 18 years) were excluded in both searches. In cases where essential data was missing or unclear, we made an attempt to contact corresponding authors for clarification. Studies including patients with all severities of head injury were only included if at least 50% of patients were within the GCS 9 to 15 range.

### Project to improve the management of the head injury patients presenting to the emergency department [^112kC6Hz]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

In this project, our team used National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) best practice guidelines for management of HI as mentioned in box 1. We also used Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) best practice standards for management of HI patients in ED. NICE best practice guidelines recommend:

HI patients to be seen within 15 min of arrival in emergency.
CT head scan to be performed within 1 hour of arrival for high-risk patients.
CT report to be available within 1 hour of CT scan of the head.

Box 1
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) best practice criteria

All patients with head injury (HI) should be assessed by trained member of staff within 15 min of arrival at hospital.
In patients considered to be at high risk for clinically important brain injury and/or cervical spine injury, extend assessment to full clinical examination to establish the need to request CT imaging of the head and/or imaging of the cervical spine and other body areas.
Patients who, on initial assessment, are considered to be at low risk for clinically important brain injury and/or cervical spine injury should be re-examined within a further hour by an emergency department (ED) clinician.
Perform and record observations on a half-hourly basis until Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) equal to 15 has been achieved. The minimum frequency of observations for patients with GCS equal to 15 should be as follows, starting after the initial assessment in the ED; half-hourly for 2 hours, then 1-hourly for 4 hours and then 2-hourly thereafter (2003).
For adults who have sustained an HI and have any of the risk factors as per NICE guideline 1.4.7, perform a CT head scan within 1 hour of the risk factor being identified. A provisional written radiology report should be made available within 1 hour of the scan being performed.
Give verbal and printed discharge advice to patients with any degree of HI who are discharged from an ED or observation ward, and their families and carers.

### Concussion management in combat sports: consensus statement from the association of ringside physicians [^112b68VB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Current practices in non-combat sports

In non-combat sports, it is universally agreed that, if an athlete is suspected to have suffered a concussion, he or she must be immediately removed from play and evaluated. If a concussion is diagnosed, he or she must not be allowed to return to sport (RTS) on the day of injury. The most recent consensus statement also recommends that athletes with a suspected concussion have a thorough evaluation, performed in a distraction free environment (eg, locker room and training room) rather than on the sideline. Most professional non-combat sports organisations have developed specific protocols for evaluating head injuries during a game. The overwhelming majority of non-combat sports organisations also require athletes who have sustained a concussion to go through an RTS protocol that consists of a gradual, stepwise increase in physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. Many non-combat sports organisations also require medical clearance by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussion prior to full RTS without any restriction. In some cases of professional athletics, an 'unaffiliated physician' who practices independently of the team decides final clearance to RTS.

All consensus statements agree that when an athlete sustains a concussion, an initial cognitive and physical rest period is needed prior to beginning an RTS protocol. However, what is not currently agreed on is the amount or duration of rest needed. Some statements recommend not beginning an RTS progression until the athlete no longer reports any concussion-related symptoms. Other publications recognise that (1) the current published evidence evaluating the effect of rest following a sports-related concussion is sparse and (2) light exercise may promote recovery after an initial period of rest. A 2016 publication that summarised a meeting of 37 concussion experts stated that, 'strict rest is contraindicated (after concussion) and may exacerbate the effects of (the) injury'. This same publication also summarised that concussion symptoms and impairments are treatable and that concussions in which symptoms last a prolonged period of time be managed by a multidisciplinary team with active rehabilitation depending on the individual's clinical profile. The most recent consensus statement recommends that there should be 'a brief period of rest during the acute phase (24–48 hours) after injury, patients can then be encouraged to become gradually and progressively more active while staying below their cognitive and physical symptom-exacerbation thresholds (eg, activity level should not bring on or worsen their symptoms)'.

### EFNS guideline on mild traumatic brain injury: report of an EFNS task force [^114r7PDg]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

In 1999, a Task Force on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) was set up under the auspices of the European Federation of Neurological Societies. Its aim was to propose an acceptable uniform nomenclature for MTBI and definition of MTBI, and to develop a set of rules to guide initial management with respect to ancillary investigations, hospital admission, observation and follow-up.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^115mHjqT]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

There are limitations to the process outlined in this paper. Although the recommendations are based upon evidence, there were elements of consensus input to the final guidelines. This is inevitable when dealing with these injuries and we attempted to minimize the negative effects of this through our stringent and extensive methodology using the best available tools. Particularly, the GRADE system allows consideration of other important aspects other than the level of evidence in recommendations. The derivation and validation of predictive risk factors as performed by other authors would hardly be feasible in Scandinavia and would only account for one aspect of the management guidelines. Our methodology was judged as the most feasible considering the target population. However, external clinical validation of our guidelines is welcomed and would naturally support successful implementation.

Finally, these guidelines are, by definition, guidelines and should be utilized accordingly. They are primarily designed as evidence and consensus-based guidance for physicians who are not experts in the field. Physicians who have considerable experience with these patients should naturally be allowed to defer from the guidelines according to clinical judgment.

A hierarchical approach to management of mild TBI

As head injuries are very common and most patients improve spontaneously, we need a hierarchical approach to medical management of mild TBI (figure 3).

Figure 3
A hierarchical approach to the management of mild traumatic brain injury.

Emergency assessment

Patients sometimes require emergency treatment, even after apparently minor injuries. The UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines outline clinical red flags, providing guidance about when this is necessary (see box 2 for NICE guidelines regarding acute CT imaging after TBI). The acute hospital management of TBI has recently been reviewed in Practical Neurology and we will not discuss this further here.

Box 2
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines for determining the need for an acute CT scan of the head in adults following a traumatic head injury

CT scan of head within 1 hour if any of the following are present:
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 13 on initial assessment
GCS < 15 2 hours after injury
Suspected open or depressed skull fracture
Any sign of basal skull fracture
Post-traumatic seizure
Focal neurological deficit
> 1 episode of vomiting since the head injury

CT scan of head within 8 hours if:
Current warfarin treatment
Loss of consciousness or amnesia and any of the following: Age > 65 years A history of bleeding or clotting disorder Dangerous mechanism of injury (a pedestrian or cyclist struck by a motor vehicle, an occupant ejected from a motor vehicle or a fall from height of more than 1 m or five stairs) More than 30 min retrograde amnesia of events immediately before the head injury

### Application of the 2007 NICE guidelines in the management of paediatric minor head injuries in a UK emergency department [^115BntKX]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidelines containing clear criteria for CT scanning of children with head injury in 2007. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of adherence to these guidelines on the number of head scans requested.

Method

A retrospective case note review was carried out of all patients under the age of 16 years presenting to the emergency department with head injury in 2007. The number of CT head scans actually performed was recorded, and the number that would have been requested using the hospital guidelines and the 2007 NICE guidelines was calculated.

Results

25 (6.7%) of the 394 patients included in our study had head CT scans. 47 (12.7%) children would have been scanned had the hospital guidelines been rigidly followed and 74 (19.7%) children would have had head CT scans if the 2007 NICE guidelines had been adhered to.

Conclusion

Considerably fewer children with head injury had CT scans in 2007 than would have been indicated by the hospital guidelines or 2007 NICE guidelines.

### The BIG (brain injury guidelines) project: defining the management of traumatic brain injury by acute care surgeons [^112HpiHL]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is becoming a standard practice that any "positive" identification of a radiographic intracranial injury requires transfer of the patient to a trauma center for observation and repeat head computed tomography (RHCT). The purpose of this study was to define guidelines-based on each patient's history, physical examination, and initial head CT findings-regarding which patients require a period of observation, RHCT, or neurosurgical consultation.

Methods

In our retrospective cohort analysis, we reviewed the records of 3,803 blunt traumatic brain injury patients during a 4-year period. We classified patients according to neurologic examination results, use of intoxicants, anticoagulation status, and initial head CT findings. We then developed brain injury guidelines (BIG) based on the individual patient's need for observation or hospitalization, RHCT, or neurosurgical consultation.

Results

A total of 1,232 patients had an abnormal head CT finding. In the BIG 1 category, no patients worsened clinically or radiographically or required any intervention. BIG 2 category had radiographic worsening in 2.6% of the patients. All patients who required neurosurgical intervention (13%) were in BIG 3. There was excellent agreement between assigned BIG and verified BIG. κ statistic is equal to 0.98.

Conclusion

We have proposed BIG based on patient's history, neurologic examination, and findings of initial head CT scan. These guidelines must be used as supplement to good clinical examination while managing patients with traumatic brain injury. Prospective validation of the BIG is warranted before its widespread implementation.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^111Lpzjb]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recommendations and guideline development

Based upon the recommendations, a draft for the updated guidelines was constructed by the task force. Following this, a modified Delphi process was used, involving the working group previously described, consisting of at least two rounds of consensus. The a priori criteria to determine acceptance, rejection or lack of consensus are shown in Table 2. In the first round, the recommendations, including data from included studies with CEBM, QUADAS and GRADE evaluations together with a guideline draft were sent via email to the working group. Ratings, including feedback, were anonymously collected. The task force adjusted the recommendations and draft based upon these responses. Then, in conjunction with a 2-day SNC meeting in September 2012 outside Copenhagen, Denmark, results were discussed and suggestions for improvements made. Following this, the second round of Delhi was completed via email. Additional rounds would be undertaken if necessary. The task force and working group were urged to consider the GRADE aspects previously mentioned, especially health risk/benefit aspects including resource use, as well as side effects and risks (misclassification of patients), at all stages of development.

Table 2
A priori established seven-point response scale and criteria to determine acceptance, rejection or lack of consensus for recommendations and guidelines for the working group using a modified Delphi process

The final guidelines were evaluated, independently of the task force and working group, in the ED of Skane University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden, to judge clarity of presentation and ease of use. Simultaneously, the guidelines were evaluated by important stakeholders from specialties directly involved in the everyday management of these patients. Feedback was documented and appropriate changes were made, if necessary, but only to consensus aspects. Finally, the working group reapproved the guidelines after presentation of changes and feedback from the evaluation.

Implementation, monitoring and future updates

Guidelines will only be successful if they are used correctly and on a wide scale. Previous experience with the 2000 Scandinavian guidelines has shown poor compliance and varying degrees of implementation success. Implementation and monitoring strategies were discussed within the working group in order to facilitate long-term successful use of the guidelines in Scandinavia. Focus was put on overcoming barriers to application and effectively using available resources. The working group also outlined a procedure and approximate time period for updating the guidelines.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^112At8qG]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

When the fourth edition of the Brain Trauma Foundation's Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury were finalized in late 2016, it was known that the results of the RESCUEicp (Trial of Decompressive Craniectomy for Traumatic Intracranial Hypertension) randomized controlled trial of decompressive craniectomy would be public after the guidelines were released. The guideline authors decided to proceed with publication but to update the decompressive craniectomy recommendations later in the spirit of "living guidelines", whereby topics are updated more frequently, and between new editions, when important new evidence is published. The update to the decompressive craniectomy chapter presented here integrates the findings of the RESCUEicp study as well as the recently published 12-mo outcome data from the DECRA (Decompressive Craniectomy in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury) trial. Incorporation of these publications into the body of evidence led to the generation of 3 new level-IIA recommendations; a fourth previously presented level-IIA recommendation remains valid and has been restated. To increase the utility of the recommendations, we added a new section entitled Incorporating the Evidence into Practice. This summary of expert opinion provides important context and addresses key issues for practitioners, which are intended to help the clinician utilize the available evidence and these recommendations. The full guideline can be found at: https://braintrauma.org/guidelines/guidelines-for-the-management-of-severe-tbi-4th-ed#/.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^111mjwi1]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

The scope and purpose of this work is 2-fold: to synthesize the available evidence and to translate it into recommendations. This document provides recommendations only when there is evidence to support them. As such, they do not constitute a complete protocol for clinical use. Our intention is that these recommendations be used by others to develop treatment protocols, which necessarily need to incorporate consensus and clinical judgment in areas where current evidence is lacking or insufficient. We think it is important to have evidence-based recommendations to clarify what aspects of practice currently can and cannot be supported by evidence, to encourage use of evidence-based treatments that exist, and to encourage creativity in treatment and research in areas where evidence does not exist. The communities of neurosurgery and neuro-intensive care have been early pioneers and supporters of evidence-based medicine and plan to continue in this endeavor. The complete guideline document, which summarizes and evaluates the literature for each topic, and supplemental appendices (A-I) are available online at https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^111ZJj21]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The task force decided a priori to make an attempt to keep the guidelines applicable to the complete patient spectrum within EDs, that is, to ensure that all adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury can be managed according to the guidelines.

Certain assumptions were also made a priori concerning aspects of management that were deemed unnecessary for critical review. The task force all agreed that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be considered in these guidelines concerning initial management and that in-hospital observation, instead of CT, would be regarded only as a secondary management option. The use of plain skull films was addressed and rejected in the previous guidelines. Additionally, we chose not to consider later aspects of management, such as detection and treatment of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) and chronic subdural hematomas. We also agreed that all pathological findings on head CT should lead to hospital admission. Finally, we would not address the surgical or medical management of intracranial complications.

The task force was unclear concerning the selection of patients for CT scanning or discharge, following minimal, mild and moderate head injuries. We were also unclear concerning which patients, irrespective of initial CT scan results, should have hospital admission for clinical observation, a repeat CT scan, or both. Therefore, consensus was achieved to address two important clinical questions that would require systematic review of evidence and would form the basis of the updated guidelines, shown below.

Clinical question 1: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need a head CT and which patients may be directly discharged?'.

Clinical question 2: 'Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need in-hospital observation and/or a repeat head CT?'.

Recommendation review and revision process — After completion of the literature review, identification of new studies, quality assessment, and data abstraction, the Methods Team sent drafts for each topic to two Clinical Investigators, who read the included studies and the draft recommendations, provided input, and suggested additional studies for consideration; Methods Team members incorporated the input, acquired and reviewed new studies, and provided the Clinical Investigators with new publications and a revised summary of the evidence for each topic. In a two-day meeting in 2014, each topic was presented and discussed by the group, after which the Methods Team revised the searches and recommendations. The complete draft of all topics and other sections was sent to all Clinical Investigators for review and comment, with phone conferences to answer questions, discuss the draft, and finalize the document throughout 2015.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^114Bc1UV]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) repeat head CT — criteria and timing — Patients who sustained a minimal TBI (defined as initial GCS 13–15 and the presence of any intracranial injury on initial head CT imaging) and have either an improving or persistently normal mental status do not require a repeat head CT. In contrast, patients with a persistently altered mental status should undergo repeat CT in 6–12 hours. Any worsening of a patient's neurologic exam is an indication for urgent CT scanning, as soon as possible. For patients with more severe TBI (defined as an admitting GCS of 12 or less), insufficient data exist to identify patients who do not require a repeat CT, and a second CT is almost always warranted because progression of injury is often not predictable or may be occult. The timing of the repeat CT is dependent upon the patient's neurologic status and findings on the first head CT scan, but the recommended timing is within the first 6–12 hours, if not sooner. These data and recommendations are not age restricted.

### Validation of the scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate traumatic brain injury in adults [^111WeSor]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In 2013, the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) published evidence-based guidelines for initial management of TBI for adults (Fig. 1). These guidelines are designed for patients with acute (< 24 h from injury) TBI and for detection of important intracranial injuries, such as those needing neurosurgical intervention and/or intensive care support. The classification of mTBI has further been divided into high, medium and low risk depending on the presence of certain risk factors. The guidelines also include biomarker S100B as a clinical tool for reducing CT scans in a subset of mTBI patients. Although these guidelines were designed for the Scandinavian healthcare systems, validation in an external cohort would be of interest.

### Quality and consistency of guidelines for the management of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department [^117Y9osp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to provide an overview of the recommendations and quality of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the emergency management of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), with a view to informing best practice and improving the consistency of recommendations.

Methods

Electronic searches of health databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO), CPG clearinghouse websites, CPG developer websites, and Internet search engines up to January 2010 were conducted. CPGs were included if 1) they were published in English and freely accessible, 2) their scope included the management of mTBI in the emergency department (ED), 3) the date of last search was within the past 10 years (2000 onward), 4) systematic methods were used to search for evidence, and 5) there was an explicit link between the recommendations and the supporting evidence. Four authors independently assessed the quality of the included CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Instrument. The authors extracted and categorized recommendations according to initial clinical assessment, imaging, management, observation, discharge planning, and patient information and follow-up.

Results

The search identified 18 potential CPGs, of which six met the inclusion criteria. The included CPGs varied in scope, target population, size, and guideline development processes. Four CPGs were assessed as "strongly recommended". The majority of CPGs did not provide information about the level of stakeholder involvement (mean AGREE standardized domain score = 57%, range = 25% to 81%), nor did they address the organizational/cost implications of applying the recommendations or provide criteria for monitoring and review of recommendations in practice (mean AGREE standardized domain score = 46.6%, range = 19% to 94%). Recommendations were mostly consistent in terms of the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (adult and pediatric) to assess the level of consciousness, initial assessment criteria, the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning as imaging investigation of choice, and the provision of patient information. The CPGs defined mTBI in a variety of ways and described different rules to determine the need for CT scanning and therefore used different criteria to identify high-risk patients.

Conclusions

Higher-quality CPGs for mTBI are consistent in their recommendations about assessment, imaging, and provision of patient information. There is not, however, an agreed definition of mTBI, and the quality of future CPGs could be improved with better reporting of stakeholder involvement, procedures for updating, and greater consideration of the applicability of the recommendations (cost implications, monitoring procedures). Nevertheless, guideline developers may benefit from adapting existing CPGs to their local context rather than investing in developing CPGs de novo.

### Mild traumatic brain injury [^113v85M6]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is among the most frequent neurological disorders. Of all TBIs 90% are considered mild with an annual incidence of 100–300/100.000. Intracranial complications of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) are infrequent (10%), requiring neurosurgical intervention in a minority of cases (1%), but potentially life-threatening (case fatality rate 0,1%). Hence, a true health management problem exists because of the need to exclude the small chance of a life threatening complication in large numbers of individual patients. The 2002 EFNS guidelines used a best evidence approach based on the literature until 2001 to guide initial management with respect to indications for CT, hospital admission, observation and follow up of MTBI patients. This updated EFNS guideline version for initial management inMTBI proposes a more selectively strategy for CT when major (dangerous mechanism, GCS < 15, 2 points deterioration on the GCS, clinical signs of (basal) skull fracture, vomiting, anticoagulation therapy, post traumatic seizure) or minor (age, loss of consciousness, persistent anterograde amnesia, focal deficit, skull contusion, deterioration on the GCS) risk factors are present based on published decision rules with a high level of evidence. In addition clinical decision rules for CT now exist for children as well. Since 2001 recommendations, although with a lower level of evidence, have been published for clinical in hospital observation to prevent and treat other potential threads to the patient including behavioral disturbances (amnesia, confusion and agitation) and infection.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^111Kct2N]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Based on the Scandinavian guidelines, admission is recommended for all patients receiving anticoagulation. It is not our current practice to admit patients on anticoagulation who are neurologically intact with normal CT imaging. In a prospective study of 768 patients with a head injury who were on warfarin, four patients (0.6%) had delayed intracranial hemorrhage (days 1 to 7), resulting in two deaths. If these patients were observed for 24 hours, only one of the delayed hemorrhages would have occurred during admission. A retrospective review found a similar rate of delayed hemorrhage in patients on warfarin of 1%, none of which were clinically significant. Given this information, it is likely reasonable to discharge a reliable patient on anticoagulation after a normal CT scan.

### Validation of the scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate traumatic brain injury in adults [^114367Nv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In response to escalating healthcare costs, care providers have a responsibility to manage patients within health-economic considerations. TBI, in particular mTBI, represents a significant burden for hospitals and ED facilities in developed countries. Existing guidelines for management of such patients differ in sensitivity and specificity with respect to detection of CT findings, traumatic CT findings, clinically important CT findings and need for neurosurgical/intensive care intervention. The SNC guideline offers a comprehensive aid to management of all adults with TBI and includes CT management options.

The results indicate that the SNC guidelines seem to predict TBI severity within a cohort of patients with GCS 13–15. The CT+ prevalence in the minimal TBI group was significantly lower than each of the other four severity groups. In addition, the CT+ prevalence in the moderate TBI group was five times higher than that of the low-risk mTBI group, but this difference was not statistically significant, likely due to the small number of subjects (n = 8) in the moderate risk group. Counterintuitively, the CT+ prevalence in the medium-risk mTBI group was over twice that of the high-risk mTBI group, but this difference was also not statistically significant, likely due to the small number of subjects (n = 12) in the medium-risk mTBI group.

### Guidelines for prehospital management of traumatic brain injury 3rd edition: executive summary [^112msr9f]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

It is generally believed that care provided early after TBI — largely aimed at resuscitating the patient and optimizing their vital signs — is more consequential for the ultimate outcome of a patient than care provided after admission to the hospital. The third edition of the BTF's Prehospital Guidelines for the Management of TBIaims to identify and disseminate best practices in prehospital care, updating the recommendations provided by the second edition 15 years ago. The updated recommendations guide patient assessment, treatment, and transport decision-making. It is hoped that implementation of these guidelines will further improve on the marked outcome benefits seen with the second edition. Moreover, we hope that these guidelines will draw attention to gaps in knowledge and inspire new research. Although many clinicians provide important contributions, neurosurgeons are the only physicians who can provide comprehensive care to TBI victims. It is thus important that neurosurgeons are familiar with recommendations for best practices across the continuum of care.

### Guidelines for prehospital management of traumatic brain injury 3rd edition: executive summary [^1177x3HJ]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The Brain Trauma Foundation's (BTF's) Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury, published in 1996, were the first clinical practice guidelines to be published by a surgical specialty. Implementation of these guidelines has been repeatedly associated with a 50% reduction in mortalityas well as reduced cost of care. The BTF next created prehospital guidelines, reflecting the understanding that care and processes of care at the scene of injury, during transport, and early after arrival to the hospital markedly influences the ultimate outcome of brain-injured patients. Indeed, much of the benefit inherent to the BTF guidelines is attributed to improved resuscitation and the avoidance of secondary insults such as hypotension and hypoxia. The first BTF Prehospital Guidelines were published in 2002and the second edition followed in 2008.

The efficacy of the BTF's Prehospital Guidelines 2nd edition was recently examined in the large prospective Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care (EPIC) study. This study included more than 130 emergency medical services and systems in Arizona and examined outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) before and after state-wide implementation of the BTF Prehospital Guidelines. It included 21 852 patients accrued over an 8-year period. This study found that implementation of the Prehospital Guidelines was associated with a 1.7x greater odds of surviving to hospital admission as well as 2x greater odds of survival until discharge. In intubated patients, prehospital guideline compliance was associated with a 3x greater chance of survival to discharge. Remarkably, however, variability in contemporary American prehospital TBI care remains problematic. Here we provide an executive summary of the new 3rd edition Prehospital Guidelinessuitable for neurosurgeons in hopes it will promote dissemination of best practices and further improve the outcome of TBI victims.

### Selecting children for head CT following head injury [^111CAKQu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Every year an estimated 400 000 children younger than 15 years attend the emergency department with head injury and 35 000 children are admitted to hospital (International Classification of Diseases, Revision 10:S00–02, S06–09) in England. Although the majority of these head injuries are minor, an estimated 5% of those who are admitted to hospital sustain intracranial injuries (ICIs).

Early head CT has high diagnostic specificity for ICIand there are several clinical decision rules to determine which children should be imaged. The Children's Head Injury Algorithm for the Prediction of Important Clinical Events (CHALICE)underpins the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Head Injury Guidelines 2007 (figure 1) (updated in 2014) which aims to identify clinically important brain injury to ensure early intervention while allowing those at low risk to be discharged without investigation, avoiding unnecessary exposure to radiation and cost to the healthcare service.

Figure 1
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Head Injury Guidelines 2007: recommendations in place for this study population, indicating when a CT should be performed in a child with a head injury.

In 2009, as part of the child health confidential enquiry programme, the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) was commissioned by the Department of Health and the funding bodies of Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man to review morbidity and mortality in children admitted to hospital with head injury, to review the effect of early management on outcomes and to identify avoidable factors associated with adverse outcomes. The aim of this analysis was to explore the extent to which children with head injury were investigated with head CT, to identify factors that influenced the rate of CT uptake and yield and to compare practice against the NICE clinical guidelines.

The strength of recommendations and quality of evidence for interventions were graded according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system (table 2). Good clinical practice statements based on face validity and expert opinion (EO), where there is little available direct evidence but a high level of certainty that the recommendation would do more good than harm, were not graded but marked as EO. The evidence supporting each of the guideline statements and areas of uncertainty are also outlined for each question in online supplemental material 1.

Table 2
GRADE system for grading recommendations

Auditing and monitoring criteria were developed to assess rates of guideline implementation and adherence to recommendations (see online supplemental materials 2 and 3).

The first draft of the guideline was reviewed by several international experts (JB, PGK, WS, S-JW) and several UK-based professional bodies of relevant specialties, and underwent a publication consultation. Following this, further discussion and voting was held by the SIG members about any suggested changes before the final series of guideline statements were finalised. The final guideline was approved by the Association of British Neurologists and endorsed by the Royal College of Physicians.

Adherence to the SNC guidelines would have resulted in a 32% reduction in CT scans in the present population – a population clinically judged to need a CT scan according to local routines. Since many of these patients were also admitted to hospital, the cost saving potential is substantial. However, one patient, who was classified by the SNC guideline as low-risk mTBI and had a low S100B level (0.09 μg/L, just below cut-off), showed a traumatic abnormality on CT scanning. The finding was relatively minor (small contusion) and did not need any specific treatment. Missing this CT abnormality would therefore not have had an impact on the care and outcome of this patient. S100B is not 100% sensitive and less significant, non-neurosurgical lesions, such as the lesion in this study, may be missed using the present cut-off. Additionally, the SNC guidelines were designed to primarily detect patients needing neurosurgical or other specific intervention, with traumatic CT abnormalities being a secondary, yet important, goal. It is likely that the difference in medico-legal attitudes between countries may influence the view on this matter. In Scandinavia, missing uncomplicated intracranial complications that do not need specific intervention in patients with good outcome is acceptable, especially if this implies resource saving. However, this may not be true for other countries such as the United States and Canada.

Since S100B is currently unavailable in the US, the management according to the SNC guidelines would have differed in that patients with low-risk mTBI would have had a CT scan. In this scenario, no patients would have been missed but the CT use would have been reduced to 14% (93/662).

S100B is included as an option in the guidelines for those centers with the ability to perform 24/7 real-time analysis. As most Scandinavian centers have this possibility, S100B is now widely used in this setting. Published reports of S100B in clinical use and unpublished summaries of current use with the new guidelines have shown very promising results. However, these recent observations need to be scientifically examined, a process which is currently underway via a validation study in Scandinavia. Further, the practicality of using the SNC guidelines would be of interest but could not be examined in the present study. A guideline would have to be practically viable for the treating of professionals in order for such a tool to be clinically useful.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^113cN532]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Implementation, monitoring and future updates

The working group decided on implementation by SNC members in their respective countries. This would be performed through a combination of written and oral presentations in national medical journals and national meetings, respectively. We discussed barriers to implementation and decided that the most important of these was probably the absence of sufficient education concerning head injury management in Scandinavia. We would attempt to further facilitate implementation by printing flyers and placards with the guidelines and to send these to Scandinavian hospitals. We would also initiate national training initiatives within the respective Scandinavian countries.

With respect to monitoring aspects, the working group decided to plan a questionnaire to Scandinavian physicians treating head injury to determine the present use of guidelines, similar to previous efforts. At 1 year following implementation, a follow-up questionnaire will be sent out to establish changes in management routines. We will also initiate studies examining compliance with the guidelines, as previously established in Norway, and attempt to improve insufficient use of the guidelines depending on these results. Finally, we will initiate a prospective validation study, also comparing the performance of our guidelines with other guidelines, decision rules and, importantly, unstructured physician judgment.

The working group decided that an update of the guidelines would be necessary in 2015. This would include evidence updates concerning the clinical questions addressed in the present update and would further examine the observation and monitoring routines for admitted patients.

Regarding medical management for concussion, more specifically with respect to setting of care, initial management, EAST 2012 guidelines recommend to measure the INR level in patients taking warfarin presenting in the acute setting with mTBI. Admit anticoagulated patients with supratherapeutic INR values and a normal initial brain CT for a period of observation, as they remain at significant risk for interval development of ICH.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^1159PPX7]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

TXA has become one of the mainstays of therapy for the injured patient at risk of bleeding. Since publication of the CRASH-2 trial, which showed a reduction in mortality of 1.5% and a reduction in bleeding deaths by one-third, there have been further trials evaluating TXA in TBI, different TXA dosing regimens and TXA in the pre-hospital setting.

The largest TBI study, CRASH-3 (n = 12,737), compared 1 g bolus TXA followed by 1 g 8 h infusion i.v. TXA with matched placebo. In patients treated within 3 h of injury (n = 9202), the risk of head injury-related death was 18.5% (TXA) versus 19.8% [placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.86–1.02]. Early treatment was shown to reduce death in mild and moderate head injury (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64–0.95) but not in severe head injury (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91–1.7). TXA was highly cost-effective for mild and moderate head injury and in patients in which both pupils reacted. Participants with milder head injury may have benefited more from TXA because of a smaller baseline bleed volume. Two RCTs published recently investigating patients with TBI were small (n = 100) and (n = 149), single-centre and found no difference between TXA and placebo for primary endpoints of intracranial haemorrhage or intracerebral haematoma growth over 24 h, respectively.

### Evolution and impact of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines [^115DkdQo]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury were the first clinical practice guidelines published by any surgical specialty. These guidelines have earned a reputation for rigor and have been widely adopted around the world. Implementation of these guidelines has been associated with a 50% reduction in mortality and reduced costs of patient care. Over their 25-yr history the traumatic brain injury (TBI) guidelines have been expanded, refined, and made increasingly more rigorous in conjunction with new clinical evidence and evolving methodologic standards. Here, we discuss the history and accomplishments of BTF guidelines for TBI as well as their limitations. We also discuss planned changes to future TBI guidelines intended to increase their utility and positive impact in an evolving medical landscape. Perhaps the greatest limitation of TBI guidelines now is the lack of high-quality clinical research as well as novel diagnostics and treatments with which to generate substantially new recommendations.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with mild traumatic brain injury: approved by ACEP board of directors, February 1, 2023 clinical policy endorsed by the emergency nurses association (April 5, 2023) [^112vL3RE]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) — risk and common management practices: The incidence of significant intracranial injuries after blunt head trauma is higher in patients on warfarin than in nonanticoagulated patients (3.9% versus 1.5%), and non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have a lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) than vitamin K antagonists (2.6% versus 10.2%). Because missing early hemorrhage has serious consequences, the threshold for initial imaging after minor head trauma in patients on either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents is very low. Concern about delayed ICH, cited to be as high as 6%, drives varied approaches; European guidelines suggest that all patients on anticoagulants should undergo routine observation after head injury, and many physicians repeat brain imaging after a brief period (4 to 6 hours) of observation before discharge. This clinical policy seeks to clarify whether a single CT scan is adequate to exclude ICH after blunt head trauma.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® head Trauma: 2021 update [^115q3Lbs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Head trauma (ie, head injury) is a significant public health concern and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and young adults. Neuroimaging plays an important role in the management of head and brain injury, which can be separated into acute (0–7 days), subacute (< 3 months), then chronic (> 3 months) phases. Over 75% of acute head trauma is classified as mild, of which over 75% have a normal Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, therefore clinical practice guidelines universally recommend selective CT scanning in this patient population, which is often based on clinical decision rules. While CT is considered the first-line imaging modality for suspected intracranial injury, MRI is useful when there are persistent neurologic deficits that remain unexplained after CT, especially in the subacute or chronic phase. Regardless of time frame, head trauma with suspected vascular injury or suspected cerebrospinal fluid leak should also be evaluated with CT angiography or thin-section CT imaging of the skull base, respectively. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^111yp4AE]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Unden and colleagues have provided a comprehensive management algorithm for patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury. As the authors acknowledge, external validation of these guidelines is necessary before widespread implementation could be considered. The admission guidelines and monitoring routines suggested by the authors are very conservative and may not be feasible in some medical centers struggling with finite health care resources. Additional research is needed to determine the risk of delayed intracranial pathology in patients with risk factors such as shunt-treated hydrocephalus or anticoagulation but normal initial CT imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria head trauma [^113jzQzb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging plays an important role in the management of head trauma. Several guidelines have been published for identifying which patients can avoid neuroimaging. Noncontrast head CT is the most appropriate initial examination in patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury who require neuroimaging as well as patients with moderate to severe acute closed head injury. In short-term follow-up neuroimaging of acute traumatic brain injury, CT and MRI may have complementary roles. In subacute to chronic traumatic brain injury, MRI is the most appropriate initial examination, though CT may have a complementary role in select circumstances. Advanced neuroimaging techniques are areas of active research but are not considered routine clinical practice at this time. In suspected intracranial vascular injury, CT angiography or venography or MR angiography or venography is the most appropriate imaging study. In suspected posttraumatic cerebrospinal fluid leak, high-resolution noncontrast skull base CT is the most appropriate initial imaging study to identify the source, with cisternography reserved for problem solving. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Pediatric severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) neuroimaging — initial head CT and intracranial hypertension: Bailey et al conducted a retrospective chart review of moderate to severe pediatric TBI cases "to determine to what extent normal ICP (< 20 mm Hg) can be predicted by normal initial head CT scans (n = 299)". In this cohort, "ICP monitors were placed in 13% of children (9/68) with normal initial head CTs… and 31% (30/98) of those with Marshall 2… scores". Notably, "Seven of nine children (78%)… developed ICP greater than 20 mm Hg during the first 24 hours of pressure monitoring", which the authors state is "providing low-quality evidence to support the recommendation to not exclude the possibility of intracranial hypertension based on a normal initial head CT".

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^113rLTEi]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since 2000, considerable evidence has emerged concerning the initial management, particularly risk factors for CT selection, of minimal, mild and moderate head injury. The work presented here is, in contrast to our previous guidelines, confined to adults but a similar effort regarding management of children is underway. Although these guidelines can theoretically be used in any setting, they were designed with the Scandinavian emergency care setting in mind. They are also designed to primarily identify patients needing neurosurgical or medical intervention, with traumatic CT findings being the secondary identification goal.

In summary, the evidence was of reasonable quality referring to the predictive ability of risk factors for complications following head injury in these patients. Unsurprisingly, many of the risk factors included here are also found in other guidelines and decision rules. However, several differences can be noted. We found that the predictive power of amnesia was too low to be included. This risk factor was present in the SNC guidelines from 2000, mostly due to the difficultly in ruling out loss of consciousness in some patients. For this reason, we include suspected loss of consciousness as a risk factor.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^112F61Z2]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) guideline — scope and limitations state that the Brain Trauma Foundation's role is to provide the evidence and related recommendations; currently, delineating specific, comprehensive protocols is beyond the scope of these guidelines. The guidelines address treatment interventions, monitoring, and treatment thresholds that are particular to TBI or that address a risk that is higher in TBI patients. Topics related to general good care for all patients, or all trauma patients, are not included. In the future, new topics will be added only if they are TBI-specific. Topics included in prior editions that cover general medical care needs by many patients, such as infection and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, have been narrowed to focus on TBI-specific risks or issues. As stated, the recommendations are limited to those areas for which an evidence base was identified. Developing protocols that incorporate general best practices for trauma patients (not TBI-specific) and that provide guidance, suggestions, or options in areas of TBI management where the evidence is insufficient is outside the scope of this endeavor.

Results

From the original sample of 20,137 children, we applied SNC guideline eligibility criteria and excluded 1013 children who presented > 24 h after injury and 117 with GCS < 9. Therefore, a total of 19,007 children (94% of the total cohort) were applicable to the SNC guideline. Selected patient characteristics are shown in Table 2.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^116cBCKp]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines

Based upon the recommendations, the guidelines and the guideline flow-chart were constructed (Fig. 6, Additional file 10: Help sheet). Similar to the Scandinavian adult head injury guidelines, the recommendations were divided into moderate, mild and minimal head injury groups and the mild head injury group was further sub-divided into high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk depending on the GCS score and predictive risk factors.

Fig. 6
Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children

During consensus discussion, the working group agreed to add the occurrence of shunts into the guidelines. Thus, we suggest that children with ventricular shunts and no specific symptoms should be observed for at least six hours. According to available evidence, patients with shunts do not have an increased risk of intracranial injury or neurosurgery compared to those without. Most studies, however, excluded children with shunts or other known neurological disorders in their analysis. Only one study by Nigrovic et al. focusses specifically on 98 children with shunts admitted to the ED after minor head injury. They found that the risk of having a clinically important traumatic brain injury was very small; only one child had a chronic subdural haematoma which was larger than seen on the previous CT. In the event of an intracranial haematoma, there is a theoretical risk of a more rapid expansion of the haematoma among patients with a ventricular shunt, due to the increased drainage of cerebrospinal fluid resulting in less counter-pressure against the hematoma. For shunted children, there is also the constant question of possible malfunction of the shunt after head trauma and the study by Nigrovic et al. also showed that these children, in comparison to children without shunts, are more subjected to CT scanning after head trauma.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^112sBkC1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Implementation, monitoring and future aspects

The value of these guidelines lies in widespread use and implementation. Before widespread implementation of the guidelines, they first need to be externally validated. The proposed guidelines are therefore planned for clinical validation in the Scandinavian paediatric population in both a retrospective and in a prospective cohort study, primarily to determine the safety of the proposed guidelines, but also to compare the performance of our guidelines to other decision rules. The validation process is similar to the validation of adult head trauma guidelines, which is currently ongoing.

The guidelines will be translated into the different Scandinavian languages and published in the national medical journals, which are routinely read by the members of the national medical societies. Once the guidelines have been validated, further implementation will be led by the SNC members in their respective countries. Educational meetings, pocket cards and guideline apps are known to be useful tools and will be used in the implementation process.

Follow-up on the implementation process will be made one year after commencement by a questionnaire similar to the one developed for follow-up of the adult head injury guidelines. There is rapid development in this area, especially regarding radiologic diagnostic procedures and concerning biomarkers for brain damage following MHT. We estimate that a revision of the guidelines should be performed within four years of publication.

If "Yes", determine "Is person currently deployed on military or combat operation?" such that "Yes" leads to "Follow DoD policy guidance for management of mTBI in the deployed setting" and "No" to "Go to Module B, Box 12". If "No" to the diagnosis/symptoms question, the directive is to "Provide education on mTBI and secondary injury prevention (see Appendix J: Additional Educational Materials and Resources); Provide information on safe and structured return to normal and full activity and duties; Monitor and support recovery".

### Validation of the scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate traumatic brain injury in adults [^112hMKVA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute management of traumatic brain injury (TBI), in particular mild TBI, focuses on the detection of the 5–7% who may be harboring potentially life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage (IH) using CT scanning. Guidelines intending to reduce unnecessary head CT scans using available clinical variables to detect those at high IH risk have shown varying results. Recently, the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) derived a new set of high-IH risk variables for adults with TBI using an evidence-based literature review. Unlike previous guidelines, the SNC guideline incorporates serum values of the brain protein S100B with clinical variables.

Methods

We performed a nested cohort study of adults with mild TBI presenting to six emergency departments in New York and Pennsylvania within 6 h of injury. Patients were managed according to existing guidelines for CT selection. All patients underwent head CT scanning and serum S100B measurement, as well as prospective collection of clinical variables, as a requirement of the parent study. Using the SNC guidelines, S100B values and clinical variables were applied to these subjects, classifying each into one of five pre-defined severity categories, as well as predicting the need for head CT scanning to identify IH. This classification was then compared to actual head CT results to determine guideline sensitivity and specificity.

Results

In total, 662 adults (mean age 42 years, range 18–96; 258 females, 549 Caucasians) were available for analysis; 36 (5%) had IH on head CT scan. The SNC guidelines had a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI, 84–100%) and a specificity of 34% (95% CI, 30–37%) for the detection of IH on head CT. Application of the SNC guidelines would have resulted in a CT reduction of 32% (211/662 patients). One patient with low-risk mild TBI and a S100B level under 0.10 μg/L had a traumatic CT abnormality and would have been discharged with strict adherence to the guidelines. However, this patient did not need any intervention for the injury and had a good outcome.

Conclusion

Using the SNC guideline could save approximately one third of CT scans in a pre-selected cohort of mild TBI patients with little or no impact on patient outcome.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 2020 update of the decompressive craniectomy recommendations [^111nURAs]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

When the fourth edition of the Brain Trauma Foundation's Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury were finalized in late 2016, it was known that the results of the RESCUEicp (Trial of Decompressive Craniectomy for Traumatic Intracranial Hypertension) randomized controlled trial of decompressive craniectomy would be public after the guidelines were released. The guideline authors decided to proceed with publication but to update the decompressive craniectomy recommendations later in the spirit of "living guidelines", whereby topics are updated more frequently, and between new editions, when important new evidence is published. The update to the decompressive craniectomy chapter presented here integrates the findings of the RESCUEicp study as well as the recently published 12-mo outcome data from the DECRA (Decompressive Craniectomy in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury) trial. Incorporation of these publications into the body of evidence led to the generation of 3 new level-IIA recommendations; a fourth previously presented level-IIA recommendation remains valid and has been restated. To increase the utility of the recommendations, we added a new section entitled Incorporating the Evidence into Practice. This summary of expert opinion provides important context and addresses key issues for practitioners, which are intended to help the clinician utilize the available evidence and these recommendations.

### External validation of the scandinavian guidelines for management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in children [^113zFPsN]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we were able to apply a multinational clinical head injury guideline from Scandinavia to a large, previously collected data set of head injured children and externally assess the accuracy of the guideline. This study appears to adequately validate the accuracy of the SNC guidelines for the management of minimal, mild and moderate head injury in children. In the validation cohort, the guideline displayed a high sensitivity for important outcomes, missing four patients with ciTBI, 14 patients with TBI on CT scan, but no patients requiring neurosurgery out of over 19,000 patients. The SNC guideline was designed to be a pragmatic and universal aid; as demonstrated by the large number of patients, the guideline could be applied to the current APHIRST cohort. Only patients with severe head injury, those who already had neuroimaging and those seeking medical care after 24 h are excluded by the guideline.

Table 1
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendation

Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include evidence quality, risk/benefit aspects of presumed patient-important outcomes, costs and uncertainty concerning values and preferences.

Recommendations, relating to the clinical questions, were classed as strong (we recommend.), weak (we suggest.) or uncertain (we cannot recommend.) (see Table 1). For this process, careful consideration was again made to risk/benefit aspects of patient-important outcomes (need for neurosurgery was classed as the most important) in relation to test results, including assumptions for pretest probabilities (different magnitudes of risk for a positive reference result of CT, ICI or neurosurgery) for different patients, quality of evidence, uncertainty of the preferences and values for outcomes and the use of health care resources. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to achieve a strong recommendation despite low quality evidence or vice versa.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^114xc8s3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe traumatic injury continues to present challenges to healthcare systems around the world, and post-traumatic bleeding remains a leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients. Now in its fifth edition, this document aims to provide guidance on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles described here to individual institutional circumstances and resources.

Methods

The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in 2004, and the current author group included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group applied a structured, evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were re-examined and revised based on scientific evidence that has emerged since the previous edition and observed shifts in clinical practice. New recommendations were formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated.

Results

Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-traumatic coagulopathy have supported improved management strategies, including evidence that early, individualised goal-directed treatment improves the outcome of severely injured patients. The overall organisation of the current guideline has been designed to reflect the clinical decision-making process along the patient pathway in an approximate temporal sequence. Recommendations are grouped behind the rationale for key decision points, which are patient- or problem-oriented rather than related to specific treatment modalities. While these recommendations provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of major bleeding and coagulopathy, emerging evidence supports the author group's belief that the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved through education and the establishment of and adherence to local clinical management algorithms.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. If incorporated into local practice, these clinical practice guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform standard of care across Europe and beyond and better outcomes for the severely bleeding trauma patient.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^117SfNVZ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries is still controversial. In 2000, the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) presented evidence-based guidelines for initial management of these injuries. Since then, considerable new evidence has emerged.

Methods

General methodology according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II framework and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Systematic evidence-based review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, based upon relevant clinical questions with respect to patient-important outcomes, including Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) and Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) quality ratings. Based upon the results, GRADE recommendations, guidelines and discharge instructions were drafted. A modified Delphi approach was used for consensus and relevant clinical stakeholders were consulted.

Conclusions

We present the updated SNC guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injury in adults including criteria for computed tomography (CT) scan selection, admission and discharge with suggestions for monitoring routines and discharge advice for patients. The guidelines are designed to primarily detect neurosurgical intervention with traumatic CT findings as a secondary goal. For elements lacking good evidence, such as in-hospital monitoring, routines were largely based on consensus. We suggest external validation of the guidelines before widespread clinical use is recommended.

In the present report we aim to present evidence- and consensus-based guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children. The purpose of the proposed guidelines is to assist physicians in the initial management of children (< 18 years of age) with head trauma within the first 24 hours following trauma, particularly to determine those children who need a head CT and/or in-hospital observation and those who can be directly discharged from the ED. The guidelines exclude children with severe head trauma as defined below (see definitions). They are intended for use by physicians in the ED, including paediatric EDs and to some extent general practitioners; hence, with focus on physicians who are not experts in the field of head trauma management. The guidelines are not intended for nurses or non-medical professionals.

The primary goal of the study was to identify all paediatric patients in need of intervention, such as neurosurgical and/or intensive care or who have an intracranial injury (critical patient-important outcome), and secondarily, those paediatric patients with any traumatic intracranial injury, including skull fractures (important patient-important outcome) following minor and moderate head trauma.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^117P7SRY]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

The overall policy was to follow the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II guideline development framework, complemented by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Consensus was that these two aids would result in a transparent and systematic methodology and the best possible workflow from available evidence to guideline construction and implementation. The overall workflow process is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Flow diagram showing the overall work process.

Task force, working group and stakeholders

The SNC consists of neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists from Scandinavia with expertise in neurotrauma. A task force was initiated within the SNC, consisting of three authors with experience within the field (JU, TI, BR), to propose evidence-based recommendations and a draft for the updated guidelines. For the consensus stage of development, a working group was formed consisting of SNC members. Important stakeholders from general surgery, emergency medicine and orthopedics were also involved in this process. These specialties initially manage the vast majority of head injury patients in Scandinavia. We also considered including members of the public in the process but unanimously decided against this as we did not believe it would facilitate optimal guideline development in the present scenario.

Scope, purpose and target population

The objective of the guidelines created in the present work would be to assist ED physicians with initial (the first 24 h) management of all adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury, specifically to decide which patients are to receive CT scanning, admission or discharge (or combinations of these) from the ED. Head injury severity was predefined according to the Head Injury Severity Score (HISS) where minimal represents patients with a GCS score of 15 and no risk factors, mild is a GCS score of 14 or 15 with risk factors (such as amnesia or loss of consciousness (LOC)) and moderate is a GCS score of 9 to 13.

The rationale was primarily to identify all patients needing neurosurgical intervention, including medical intervention for high intracranial pressure (assigned a critical level with regard to patient-important outcomes). The secondary goals (assigned important, but not critical, with regard to patient-important outcomes) were identification of non-neurosurgical intracranial traumatic complications and also strong consideration of resource use with minimization of unnecessary (normal) CT scans and/or admission.

### Have ATLS and national transfer guidelines improved the quality of resuscitation and transfer of head-injured patients? A prospective survey from a regional neurosurgical unit [^111BgdgN]. Injury (2003). Low credibility.

High-quality resuscitation and care during transfer of head-injured patients is essential to prevent secondary brain injury. We have prospectively assessed the standard of resuscitation in 50 consecutive head-injured patients transferred to our unit, and compared our findings with previous studies performed before the advanced trauma life support course (ATLS) had become widespread and national guidelines on the transfer of head injuries had been produced by the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI). Delays in transfer, management of the airway, adequate cervical spine assessment, hypoxia (P(a)O(2) < 13 kPa), hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mmHg), missed injuries and the experience of the medical escort were compared against the standards laid out in ATLS and AAGBI Guidelines. The mean, unavoidable delay from arrival at the local accident and emergency unit to arrival was 7.4 ± 1.9h (mean ± 95%CI) with most of the delay being prior to initial referral. Two patients arrived with an unsecured airway with a GCS = 8/15; 26 had inadequate cervical spine imaging; 7 patients arrived hypoxic and 2 patients arrived hypotensive; most of these insults occurred during the transfer. Forty-six percent of medical escorts did not fulfil the minimum standard of experience. ATLS and AAGBI guidelines have provided only modest improvements in patient care at the expense of long delays in transfer. The incidence of hypoxia and hypotension remains unacceptably high.

### Guidelines for prehospital management of traumatic brain injury 3rd edition: executive summary [^112q4R7u]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Prehospital care markedly influences outcome from traumatic brain injury, yet it remains highly variable. The Brain Trauma Foundation's guidelines informing prehospital care, first published in 2002, have sought to identify and disseminate best practices. Many of its recommendations relate to the management of airway, breathing and circulation, and infrastructure for this care. Compliance with the second edition of these guidelines has been associated with significantly improved survival. A working group developed evidence-based recommendations informing assessment, treatment, and transport decision-making relevant to the prehospital care of brain injured patients. A literature search spanning May 2005 to January 2022 supplemented data contained in the 2nd edition. Identified studies were assessed for quality and used to inform evidence-based recommendations. A total of 122 published articles formed the evidentiary base for this guideline update including 5 providing Class I evidence, 35 providing Class II evidence, and 98 providing Class III evidence for the various topics. Forty evidence-based recommendations were generated, 30 of which were strong and 10 of which were weak. In many cases, new evidence allowed guidelines from the 2nd edition to be strengthened. Development of guidelines on some new topics was possible including the prehospital administration of tranexamic acid. A management algorithm is also presented. These guidelines help to identify best practices for prehospital traumatic brain injury care, and they also identify gaps in knowledge which we hope will be addressed before the next edition.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists over not only the incidence of long-term risks of multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injury. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to make these decisions. This has resulted in the existence of a number of published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes. Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. Delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^115mNfnP]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During the last 15 years, the use of computed tomography (CT) scans in mild head trauma has dramatically increased. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of this patient population will have intracranial pathology on CT and that fewer than 1% will require neurosurgical intervention. The need to identify these patients from the majority of patients that will have no intracranial pathology must be balanced against both health care costs and patient risk of exposure to ionizing radiation. Unden and colleagues have conducted an extensive literature search and consensus panel to readdress the question of which patients require a CT head after minimal, mild or moderate head trauma and proposed an algorithm that will encompass most of these adult patients, including those on anticoagulation therapy. They have also provided disposition guidelines to address which patients need admission to hospital, including monitoring routines, and which can be safely discharged.

### Guidelines for prehospital management of traumatic brain injury 3rd edition: executive summary [^116jGv8W]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

What Is New?

The third edition of the BTF's Guidelines for Prehospital Management of Traumatic Brain Injury updates the recommendations provided in 2008. This edition includes additional evidence published over a subsequent 17-year period. Without question, the most important difference in this update is that 75% of the recommendations are now strong — in the second edition, all of the recommendations were graded as weak.

There are additional noteworthy changes in these updated guidelines. The blood pressure targets have been increased across the age spectrum. This parallels the change in the BTF's 4th edition adult severe TBI guidelines. Immediate application of supplemental oxygen is now recommended for all patients with suspicion of moderate or severe TBI irrespective of their baseline oxygen saturation. Capnography is now more strongly and frequently recommended to guide care, especially the avoidance of hyperventilation in the absence of herniation. Recommendations related to temperature management now appear for the first time. The 3rd edition guidelines place a greater emphasis on the motor component of the GCS and no longer refer to a global 2-point change as a threshold for intervention similar to the SIBICC algorithms. These guidelines put greater emphasis on documentation and communication and provide more explicit, helpful recommendations related to airway management options and patient monitoring. The new edition includes a management algorithm (Figure 3); one had accompanied the firstbut not the second editionof these guidelines.

### Validation of the scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate traumatic brain injury in adults [^111AKAhw]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

During the study period, 784 subjects with mTBI were enrolled into the parent study; 93 were children and therefore not considered for the guidelines. In 29 patients, vital data was missing (mainly GCS scores), which made it impossible to accurately classify the patients and they were therefore excluded. Thus, 662 patients were eligible for analysis (Fig. 2). Most subjects in the nested cohort were Caucasian and male (Table 2).

Barbiturate therapy results in a fall in blood pressure in one of four patients. The hypotensive effect will offset any ICP lowering effect on cerebral perfusion pressure', noting 'All studies included in this review were conducted prior to the initial search date for this edition except Perez-Barcena, 2008, which is included here'.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^117Wztjf]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common reasons for emergency department (ED) care. Cases of TBI account for over 1 million visits per year in both the USA and the UK and are responsible for two-thirds of all trauma deaths. Only a small proportion of these are classed as severe head injury, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 to 8. The majority of patients are instead classed as minimal, mild and moderate head injuries and are generally conscious in the ED with varying degrees of neurological symptoms. A minority of these patients will have intracranial pathology on computed tomography (CT) scanning and an even smaller proportion will need neurosurgical intervention. In particular, the intermediate risk group of mild head injury (MHI) has been notoriously difficult to manage as these patients have a very low, but not negligible, risk of needing neurosurgical intervention.

Over the past decade, initial management strategies have become focused on selective CT use based upon presence or absence of specific aspects of patient history and/or clinical examination, in order to effectively use health care resources. This selective management has received more attention following reports of increased cancer risks from CT scans, estimated at 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 for a single head CT scan in young adults.

Following a normal CT scan after mild head injury, consensus is generally to discharge patients from the hospital, although subgroups of patients may still be at risk of developing delayed intracranial complications of varying significance.

In 2000, the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) presented evidence-based guidelines for the initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries. Although external and independent validation has shown the guidelines to function favorably, it is likely that new evidence exists which needs to be considered. The SNC has therefore mandated an update of the guidelines. The aim of the present report is to present these updated guidelines for adults, including the methodology and considerations behind the workflow.

If urgent/emergent conditions are identified (Yes), refer for emergency evaluation and treatment; if No, evaluate for severity of TBI based on history and, if the answer to "Is the severity moderate or severe TBI?" is Yes, consult with a clinician with TBI experience. If not moderate/severe, proceed to "Diagnosis of mTBI: Are symptoms present?"; if No, provide education on mTBI and secondary injury prevention, provide information on safe and structured return to normal and full activity and duties, and monitor and support recovery. If symptoms are present (Yes), determine "Is person currently deployed on military or combat operation?"; if Yes, follow DoD policy guidance for management of mTBI in the deployed setting, and if No, go to Module B, Box 12.

### Improving hospital quality and cost in nonoperative TBI… [^113vEw8h]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

These consultations, however, rarely alter the course of treatment of patients who present with normal neurological examination findings and miniscule intracranial hemorrhage. 8 In an effort to standardize the need for neurosurgical consultation and repeated CT scans of the head in patients with TBI, our institute formulated the Brain Injury Guidelines5 based on a retrospective analysis of nearly 3000 patients with TBI who presented to our level I trauma center. These guidelines were based on patients' medical history and findings from neurological examination and initial CT of the head. These guidelines, which were formulated in collaboration with our neurosurgical colleagues, addressed the role of the acute care surgeon in the management of TBI and had the potential to reduce the burden of nonoperative TBI on our neurosurgical colleagues.

These guidelines were formally implemented on March 1, 2012; since then, we have been treating our patients with blunt TBI based on these guidelines. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients with TBI before and after implementation of the BIG protocol. We developed BIG based on patients' medical history, findings from physical examination, and CT scan findings. 5 Patients had to meet all the criteria for categorization into BIG 1 or BIG 2. Table 1 describes the 3 categories of brain injury guidelines. Patients who were categorized as BIG 1 had normal findings on neurological examination, were not taking any antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications, and had minuscule findings on an initial CT scan of the head.

We proposed a 6-hour period of observation in the emergency department for patients who were categorized as BIG 1 without the need for neurosurgical consultation or an RHCT scan. The BIG 2 category was composed of moderately injured patients with a nondisplaced skull fracture and/or a localized ICH of 5 to 7 mm. Patients who were categorized as BIG 3 had a severe head injury, and the optimal therapeutic plan for these patients consisted of hospitalization, neurosurgical consultation, and a follow-up RHCT scan. After implementation of BIG, there was a 9. 3% reduction in the hospitalization rate for TBI.

### Validation of the scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate traumatic brain injury in adults [^111f7DEu]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute management of traumatic brain injury (TBI), in particular mild TBI, focuses on the detection of the 5–7% who may be harboring potentially life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage (IH) using CT scanning. Guidelines intending to reduce unnecessary head CT scans using available clinical variables to detect those at high IH risk have shown varying results. Recently, the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) derived a new set of high-IH risk variables for adults with TBI using an evidence-based literature review. Unlike previous guidelines, the SNC guideline incorporates serum values of the brain protein S100B with clinical variables.

Methods

We performed a nested cohort study of adults with mild TBI presenting to six emergency departments in New York and Pennsylvania within 6 h of injury. Patients were managed according to existing guidelines for CT selection. All patients underwent head CT scanning and serum S100B measurement, as well as prospective collection of clinical variables, as a requirement of the parent study. Using the SNC guidelines, S100B values and clinical variables were applied to these subjects, classifying each into one of five pre-defined severity categories, as well as predicting the need for head CT scanning to identify IH. This classification was then compared to actual head CT results to determine guideline sensitivity and specificity.

Results

In total, 662 adults (mean age 42 years, range 18–96; 258 females, 549 Caucasians) were available for analysis; 36 (5%) had IH on head CT scan. The SNC guidelines had a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI, 84–100%) and a specificity of 34% (95% CI, 30–37%) for the detection of IH on head CT. Application of the SNC guidelines would have resulted in a CT reduction of 32% (211/662 patients). One patient with low-risk mild TBI and a S100B level under 0.10 μg/L had a traumatic CT abnormality and would have been discharged with strict adherence to the guidelines. However, this patient did not need any intervention for the injury and had a good outcome.

Conclusion

Using the SNC guideline could save approximately one third of CT scans in a pre-selected cohort of mild TBI patients with little or no impact on patient outcome.

### Comparison of predictive tools for management of paediatric mild TBI: a prospective cohort study [^112WFSoa]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children constitutes a global public health challenge, with both acute and long-term consequence. The vast majority of cases (> 90%) fall within the mild spectrum, with outcomes ranging from no sequelae to urgent need for neurosurgical evacuation of intracranial haematomas and/or persistent deficits across a wide range of cognitive functions. The primary focus during initial assessment in the emergency department (ED) is to evaluate the need for further investigations to detect intracranial complications. To support clinical decision-making, several clinical decision rules (CDRs) and practice guidelines (CPGs) have been developed over the past two decades.

A clinical decision rule (CDR) is defined as a tool derived from original research that incorporates three or more variables from patient history, physical examination, or simple tests. In contrast, a clinical practice guideline (CPG) consists of "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances". These guidelines are based on reviews of the best available evidence and may range from detailed algorithms to care pathways. The development of both CDRs and CPGs should be followed by structured evaluation and implementation processes, which are critical to their effectiveness in clinical practice. In this paper, both CPGs and CDRs are collectively referred to as "predictive tools".

In a recent analysis, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) guideline was the predictive tool to receive the highest grade, evaluated in 23 studies. The Children's Head Injury Algorithm for the Prediction of Important Clinical Events (CHALICE) was evaluated in 13 studies, and the Canadian Assessment of Tomography for Childhood Head Injury (CATCH) guideline in 11 studies. An updated version of the CATCH rule, CATCH2, was published in 2018, demonstrating improved sensitivities following prospective validation and refinement. More recently, the Australian and New Zealand Guideline for Mild to Moderate Head Injuries in Children (PREDICT) and the updated Head Injury: Assessment and Early Management guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE23) were published in 2021 and 2023, respectively. In the Nordic region, the Scandinavian guideline for the management of minor and moderate head trauma in children (SNC16)was published in 2016 by the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee, an independent association of medical specialists dedicated to advancing research, education, and clinical guidelines in the field of neurotrauma. These have recently been validated, indicating adequate performance.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^111ZLXnJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with mild head trauma will have no intracranial pathology and can be safely discharged home. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of these patients will have clinically significant findings on computed tomography imaging and up to 1% may require neurosurgical intervention. The revised Scandinavian Head Trauma Guidelines provide an evidence- and consensus-based algorithm to assist physicians in determining which patients presenting with minimal, mild or moderate blunt head injury are at higher risk for intracranial pathology and thus require neuroimaging and hospital admission. Striking a balance between health care costs and risk of morbidity remains an ongoing challenge and we will present our concerns with this useful, but conservative management algorithm.

Study characteristics

We included 22 studies, reported in 25 publications (Table 1). Three articles were removed from the analyses because of multiple publications. Two more studies were based on the same dataset, but the study describing the least number of objectiveswas still included for extracting the amount of adherence to another guideline recommendation.

Table 1.
Characteristics of the Included Studies (n = 22)

Table 2.
Risk of Bias Assessment

All included studies used an observational cohort design with 14 being retrospectiveandbeing prospective. Twelve studies described multicenter studies, with a median of eight (range 2–155) hospitals included. All studies were conducted in North America (n = 9) or Europe (n = 13) and were published between 2002 and 2014. Six of the included studies, examined adherence to more than one guideline recommendation (mean number of guideline recommendations in studies describing more than one guideline recommendation: 3.6; range 2–6). The sample size in the included studies ranged from n = 27 38 to n = 10,628 28 patients.

Adherence to a total of 13 guideline recommendations was assessed, including those from the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF), National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), and Scandinavian guidelines for the initial management of minimal, mild, and moderate head injury. The most frequently studied guideline recommendation was the BTF guideline for incracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (n = 9). Other guidelines that were studied in more than one study were the NICE guidelines for CT scanning (n = 5), the BTF guidelines for pre-hospital intubation (n = 7), transport (n = 2), steroids (n = 2), and resuscitation (n = 2), and the Scandinavian guidelines for CT scanning and hospital admission (n = 2).

Six studies were performed during ICU admission, seven during an emergency department (ED) visit, and three during the pre-hospital phase. The remainder (six studies) reported on a combination of these settings. The majority of studies reported on guideline recommendations that were judged as weak/moderate. Only seven studies included strong recommendations. The majority of studies were funded by government organizations. One studywas funded by the BTF.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^114XmAUw]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury — methods — individual studies emphasizes a systematic, open-minded reappraisal of assumptions and the use of large comparative effectiveness research in both adult and pediatric populations to inform guideline development, noting that such findings could shift focus from individual treatments to a more ecologically valid model. It states that researchers could begin self-examination by returning to the recommendations of the Clinical Trials in Head Injury Study Group and cautions that the realities of clinical research sometimes compromise methods when scaling from pilot to full-scale or multi-center studies. Specifically, moving from a pilot to a full-scale study may include revision and heterogeneity in inclusion criteria, revision of the intervention protocol, increasing the number of centers resulting in a lack of standardized management, expanded data collection, outcome measures that may not be clinically relevant, shortened follow-up, effect size requirements that may be statistically but not clinically relevant, and budget constraints. It adds that the rationale for testing an effective single-center trial across the variability of a multi-center trial is valid and that, ideally, a treatment should be effective across various clinical environments.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children [^115zJbfs]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The management of minor and moderate head trauma in children differs widely between countries. Presently, there are no existing guidelines for management of these children in Scandinavia. The purpose of this study was to produce new evidence-based guidelines for the initial management of head trauma in the paediatric population in Scandinavia. The primary aim was to detect all children in need of neurosurgical intervention. Detection of any traumatic intracranial injury on CT scan was an important secondary aim.

Methods

General methodology according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used. Systematic evidence-based review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology and based upon relevant clinical questions with respect to patient-important outcomes. Quality ratings of the included studies were performed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 and Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM)-2 tools. Based upon the results, GRADE recommendations, a guideline, discharge instructions and in-hospital observation instructions were drafted. For elements with low evidence, a modified Delphi process was used for consensus, which included relevant clinical stakeholders.

Results

The guidelines include criteria for selecting children for CT scans, in-hospital observation or early discharge, and suggestions for monitoring routines and discharge advice for children and guardians. The guidelines separate mild head trauma patients into high-, medium- and low-risk categories, favouring observation for mild, low-risk patients as an attempt to reduce CT scans in children.

Conclusions

We present new evidence and consensus based Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee guidelines for initial management of minor and moderate head trauma in children. These guidelines should be validated before extensive clinical use and updated within four years due to rapid development of new diagnostic tools within paediatric neurotrauma.
