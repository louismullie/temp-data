## Question

During an engagement to compile the financial statements of a nonissuer an accountant becomes aware that management had stated land at appraised value and that if GAAP had been followed both the land account and stockholders' equity would have been decreased by $1 million a material amount. The accountant decides to modify the standard compilation report because management will not revise the financial statements. Under these circumstances the accountant should

Answer Choices:
A. Issue either an adverse opinion or a qualified opinion depending on materiality because of the departure from GAAP.
B. Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that restricts the distribution of the financial statements to ‚Äúinternal use only.‚Äù
C. Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements.
D. Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that explains the underlying purpose of recording assets at historical cost.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an accountant should do when, during a compilation engagement for a nonissuer, management records land at appraised value and refuses to correct a material GAAP departure, prompting the accountant to modify the compilation report. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the nature of a compilation and the accountant's level of assurance. Then, I should verify the appropriate modification for a known material GAAP departure. Next, I will examine why audit-style opinions are inappropriate. After that, I need to check whether restricting distribution is required or merely optional. Finally, I will consider whether explaining historical cost adds value or distracts from the required disclosure.

> Let me first confirm the engagement type and its implications. A compilation provides no assurance and does not express an opinion, so options that propose issuing a qualified or adverse opinion are fundamentally incompatible with a compilation and should be excluded from consideration [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the correct modification for a material GAAP departure in a compilation. When the accountant becomes aware of a material departure from GAAP and management will not revise the statements, the standard modification is to add a separate paragraph disclosing the departure and its effects on the financial statements, which directly addresses the user's scenario of land overstated by $1 million with a corresponding equity overstatement [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about restricting distribution. I initially thought adding a restriction to internal use only might be required, but I should double-check that. Restricting distribution is not mandated for a compilation with a GAAP departure; it is an optional step the accountant may take if circumstances warrant, so choosing to restrict distribution would be acceptable but is not the primary required action in this case [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I don't conflate audit and compilation requirements. Explaining the accounting principle behind historical cost might educate users, but it is not a required element of a compilation modification and could obscure the essential disclosure of the departure and its effects, so it should not be the chosen answer here [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the accountant should add a separate paragraph disclosing the material GAAP departure and quantifying its effects on the financial statements, which aligns with compilation standards and directly answers the question. Restricting distribution is permissible but not required, and issuing an opinion is inappropriate in a compilation engagement [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements**. In a compilation, the accountant must disclose a material GAAP departure when management refuses to correct it, including the nature of the departure and its dollar effect. Options A and B are incorrect because compilations do not express opinions or restrict distribution, and option D is not required.

---

## Analysis of the situation

The accountant is engaged in a **compilation** of financial statements for a nonissuer. During this engagement, the accountant discovers that management has recorded land at appraised value, which constitutes a departure from GAAP. If GAAP had been followed, both the land account and stockholders' equity would have been decreased by $1 million, a material amount. Management refuses to revise the financial statements, prompting the accountant to modify the compilation report.

---

## Applicable professional standards

According to professional standards for compilations, when the accountant becomes aware of a material departure from GAAP and management refuses to correct it, the accountant must **modify the compilation report** by adding a separate paragraph that discloses the departure and its effects on the financial statements. This disclosure should include:

- The nature of the departure from GAAP.
- The dollar amount of the effect on the financial statements.
- A statement that management has refused to correct the departure.

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Option** | **Description** | **Correctness** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Issue either an adverse opinion or a qualified opinion depending on materiality because of the departure from GAAP. | Incorrect | Compilations do not involve expressing opinions. Opinions are expressed in audit engagements, not compilations. |
| B | Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that restricts the distribution of the financial statements to "internal use only". | Incorrect | Restricting distribution is not a standard requirement or modification for compilations. The appropriate action is to disclose the departure, not restrict distribution. |
| C | Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements. | Correct | This aligns with professional standards requiring disclosure of material GAAP departures in compilation reports when management refuses to correct them. |
| D | Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that explains the underlying purpose of recording assets at historical cost. | Incorrect | Explaining the purpose of historical cost is not required or relevant in this context. The focus should be on disclosing the departure and its effects. |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The accountant should **add a separate paragraph to the compilation report** that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements. This approach complies with professional standards and ensures transparency regarding the material misstatement.

### The WALLET study: examining early memory loss and personal finance [^be6db1f1]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Three important findings emerge from this feasibility study of wealth loss and FE during early memory loss. First, real-world personal finance analysis, achieved by examining an older person's checking account statements, is feasible and meaningful. Through a structured set of analytic steps, we were able to review checking account statements prior to interviews, identify patterns in financial behaviors and outcomes, and collect important details during the interview with the older participant. By doing so, we were able to establish, with a high degree of certainty, whether there was evidence of wealth loss and/or FE for each older person in the study. The feasibility of a person-centered approach to real-world financial management, as proposed by the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Sciences report, is supported by the results of this study. A person-centered approach to financial management has significant ramifications in terms of who may or may not need a conservator or representative payee and the detection of early signs of financial mismanagement, which can render an older adult more vulnerable to wealth loss and FE. Simply declaring that individuals with memory loss lack financial capacity is not supported by these data and runs counter to the principles of autonomy that are so deeply ingrained in our approach to decision-making and responsibility.

Third, early memory loss, financial decision-making, and financial management behaviors were linked in important ways that contribute to the risk of wealth loss and FE. For instance, financial decision-making scores that reflect higher risk or vulnerability were linked to wealth loss in those with early memory problems, yet financial outcomes were not related to scores on a standard test of learning and memory. This finding is consistent with the findings ofand, who found that while the constructs are associated, financial decision-making is a separate construct from cognitive functioning. The majority of our study participants had PCI, which means that they did not have objective evidence of decline but rated themselves as having some cognitive decline. Cognitive vulnerability, either perceived or objectively verified on cognitive testing, was related to an increased number of risky financial management behaviors, including excessive payments in one category, missed bills or late fees, and helping another financially on a regular basis.

### Radiology applications of financial accounting [^fc7b40fb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

A basic knowledge of financial accounting can help radiologists analyze business opportunities and examine the potential impacts of new technology or predict the adverse consequences of new competitors entering their service area. The income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement are the three basic financial statements that document the current financial position of the radiology practice and allow managers to monitor the ongoing financial operations of the enterprise. Pro forma, or hypothetical, financial statements can be generated to predict the financial impact of specific business decisions or investments on the profitability of the practice. Sensitivity analysis, or what-if scenarios, can be performed to determine the potential impact of changing key revenue, investment, operating cost or financial assumptions. By viewing radiology as both a profession and a business, radiologists can optimize their use of scarce economic resources and maximize the return on their financial investments.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022) statement: updated reporting guidance for health economic evaluations [^85173e10]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

How to use CHEERS

The CHEERS 2022 statement (checklist and Explanation and Elaboration report) replaces the 2013 CHEERS statement, which should no longer be used. The new CHEERS checklist contains 28 items with accompanying descriptions (Table 1). Major changes from CHEERS 2013 are described in Table 2. Checklist items are subdivided into seven main categories: (1) Title; (2) Abstract; (3) Introduction; (4) Methods; (5) Results; (6) Discussion; and (7) Other relevant information. Users of the checklist should first consult the Explanation and Elaboration report to ensure the appropriate interpretation of each item description.

Table 1
The CHEERS 2022 checklist

Table 2
Major changes in the CHEERS 2022 statement (compared with CHEERS 2013)

Those using the checklist should indicate the section of the manuscript where relevant information can be found. If an item does not apply to a particular economic evaluation (for example, items 11–13 for cost analyses, or items 16 and 22 for non-modelling studies), checklist users are encouraged to report "Not applicable". If information is otherwise not reported, checklist users are encouraged to write "Not reported". Users should avoid the term "Not conducted" as CHEERS is intended to guide and capture reporting.

As before, in developing the CHEERS Statement, the Task Force recognises that the amount of information required for adequate reporting will exceed conventional space limits of most journal reports. Therefore, in making our recommendations, we assume that authors and journals will make necessary information available to readers using online and supplementary appendices or other means.

In addition to the open access Explanation and Elaboration report, we have also made available templates, an interactive form, and further educational materials for authors, to facilitate appropriate use of the guidance. We encourage authors to visit the CHEERS and EQUATOR websites to locate copies of the checklist, the Explanation and Elaboration report, links to educational resources, templates, translations, a link to the interactive form and future updates.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (CHEERS) statement [^4dccd798]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

As the number of published health economic evaluations continues to grow, we believe more transparent and complete reporting of methods and findings will be increasingly important to facilitate interpretation and comparison of studies. We hope the CHEERS statement, consisting of recommendations in a 24 item checklist, will be viewed as an effective consolidation and update of previous efforts and serve as a starting point for standard reporting going forward.

We believe the CHEERS statement represents a considerable expansion over previous efforts. The strength of our approach is that it was developed in accordance with current recommendations for the development of reporting guidelines, using an international and multidisciplinary team of editors and content experts in economic evaluation and reporting. Similar to the approach taken with other widely accepted guidelines, we have defined a minimum set of criteria though a modified Delphi technique and have translated these into recommendations, an explanatory document with explanations, and a checklist. Unlike some previous reporting guidance for economic evaluation, we have also made every effort to be neutral about the conduct of economic evaluation, allowing analysts the freedom to choose different methods.

There may be several limitations to our approach. A larger Delphi panel with a different composition could have led to a different final set of recommendations. Some less common approaches and contexts (such as public health, developing countries, and system dynamic models) for conducting health economic evaluation may not be well represented by our sample of experts. Additionally, like many Delphi panel processes, we based decisions to reject or accept criteria on arbitrary levels of importance. However, we feel the group recruited to create the statement is sufficiently knowledgeable of the more common applications of economic evaluation, and the rules used to select criteria were created a priori and are consistent with previous efforts.

We believe it will be important to evaluate the effects of implementation of this statement and checklist on reporting in future economic evaluations. As methods for the conduct of economic evaluation continue to evolve, it will also be important to revisit or extend the guidance. The CHEERS Task Force feels that this statement should be reviewed for updating five years from its release.

### SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for protocols of clinical trials [^8ac21ad6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Protocol version

Item 3: Date and version identifier

Explanation

Sequentially labelling and dating each protocol version helps to mitigate potential confusion over which document is the most recent. Explicitly listing the changes made relative to the previous protocol version is also important (see Item 25). Transparent tracking of versions and amendments facilitates trial conduct, review, and oversight.

Funding

Item 4: Sources and types of financial, material, and other support

Explanation

A description of the sources of financial and non-financial support provides relevant information to assess study feasibility and potential competing interests (Item 28). Although both industry funded and non-industry funded trials are susceptible to bias, the former are more likely to report trial results and conclusions that favour their own interventions. This tendency could be due to industry trials being more likely to select effective interventions for evaluation (Item 6a), to use less effective control interventions (Item 6b), or to selectively report outcomes (Item 12), analyses (Item 20) or full studies (Item 31). Non-financial support (eg, provision of drugs) from industry has not been shown to be associated with biased results, although few studies have examined this issue.

At a minimum, the protocol should identify the sources of financial and non-financial support; the specific type (eg, funds, equipment, drugs, services) and time period of support; and any vested interest that the funder may have in the trial. If a trial is not yet funded when the protocol is first written, the proposed sources of support should be listed and updated as funders are confirmed.

No clear consensus exists regarding the level of additional funding details that should be provided in the trial protocol as opposed to trial contracts, although full disclosure of funding information in the protocol can help to better identify financial competing interests. Some jurisdictional guidelines require more detailed disclosure, including monetary amounts granted from each funder, the mechanism of providing financial support (eg, paid in fixed sum or per recruited participant), and the specific fund recipient (eg, trial investigator, department/institute). Detailed disclosure allows research ethics committees/institutional review boards (REC/IRBs) to assess whether the reimbursement amount is reasonable in relation to the time and expenses incurred for trial conduct.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost/value methodology in guidelines — committee economic expertise and conflicts of interest: Each guideline committee "will need at least 1 member with expertise in reviewing published economic studies", and "the inclusion of 2 or more experts may be preferable for guidelines requiring the evaluation and synthesis of a large number of CEAs (and may facilitate assessment of evidence quality)". Conflict management is emphasized: "Conflicts of interest must be carefully managed in any assessment of economic value", and "contracts through academic institutions should not be regarded the same as significant equity interests or other personal or family financial interests, which would be disqualifying".

### Guidelines international network: principles for disclosure of interests and management of conflicts in guidelines [^b302df59]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conflicts of interest (COIs) have been defined by the American Thoracic Society as "a divergence between an individual's private interests and his or her professional obligations such that an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professional actions or decisions are motivated by personal gain, such as direct financial, academic advancement, clinical revenue streams, or community standing". In the context of guideline development, the concerns are not simply about identifying and disclosing direct financial or indirect COIs. Despite this recognition, the management of COIs in guidelines is often unsatisfactory. In response to requests from its international membership and informed by existing syntheses of the evidence and policies of international organizations, the Guidelines International Network Board of Trustees developed guidance on the disclosure of interests and management of COIs. Current approaches are relatively similar throughout the guideline development community, with an increasing recognition of the importance of disclosing and managing indirect COIs. Although there are differences in detail among the approaches, the similarities allow for the formulation of 9 core principles for managing COIs. In formulating these principles, the Guidelines International Network Board of Trustees recognizes that COIs cannot be totally avoided when panel members are being chosen for certain guidelines or in certain settings; thus, the important issue is the management of COIs in a fair, judicious, transparent manner.

6.1. The structure of economic value statements in clinical guidelines — in the interest of consistency and comparability, "we suggest that economic value statements report 3 components: 1) Class of Recommendation; 2) Level of Certainty; and 3) Recommendation", and because interpretation occurs in the clinical context, "the economic value statement should ideally be placed immediately following the clinical recommendation for the intervention of interest".

Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians — COI policy framework explains that, under the assumption that not all external interests present equal levels of threat, the CGC developed a tiered scheme to assess interests and manage COIs, and the policy is based on 3 core tenets: transparency (all participant disclosures and COI management decisions are freely accessible so that readers may independently assess them and make judgments), proportionality (not all COIs carry equal risk, so the management strategy should intensify as the seriousness of the COI increases), and consistency (the policy should be implemented impartially across all variables, including who is reporting the COI, who is managing it, and which factors are considered in grading it). Regarding reporting, any potential participant in work related to ACP clinical guidelines must complete and maintain updated disclosures, including CGC members and members of the CGC's public panel.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee methods update describes current processes and changes, noting that the Clinical Guidelines Committee, with Clinical Policy department staff, develops clinical guidelines and guidance statements and that ACP has been developing guidelines since 1981. Updated methods include more stringent policies about disclosure of interests and conflict management; inclusion of public perspective; full adoption of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods; more standardized reporting formats that consider value of care, patient comorbid conditions, patient values and preferences, and costs; and further clarification of guidance statement methods. ACP develops guidelines in accordance with standards set forth by the Guidelines International Network and National Academy of Medicine and voluntarily completes and posts standard reporting forms with each guideline in the Guidelines International Network library and on ACP's Web site. The article serves as an update to the 2010 methods paper, and the updated methods have been included in Clinical Guidelines Committee publications since 2018.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022) statement: updated reporting guidance for health economic evaluations [^cba8c53c]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

CHEERS is also applicable to studies based on mathematical modelling or empirical research (such as patient level or cluster level human studies). Although CHEERS can be used for systematic reviews of economic evaluation, its use should be limited to assessing the quality of reporting of a study rather than the quality of its conduct. As there is no validated scoring system for the checklist, using it as a scoring tool could lead to misleading findings and is strongly discouraged. If used to assess the quality of reporting in a systematic review, a qualitative assessment of completeness of reporting by item is a more appropriate approach. When applying the CHEERS statement, users may need to refer to additional reporting guidance (for example, for randomised controlled trials, patient and public involvement, modelling, health state preference measures), and these are referenced throughout the Explanation and Elaboration report.

How to use CHEERS

The CHEERS 2022 statement (checklist and Explanation and Elaboration report) replaces the 2013 CHEERS statement, which should no longer be used. The new CHEERS checklist contains 28 items with accompanying descriptions (table 1). Major changes from CHEERS 2013 are described in box 1.

### How to read the new recommendation statement: methods update from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^06e9eefa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Since 2001, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has worked to refine its methods of evidence review and assessment and to create more usable documents in response to clinicians' needs. These changes have resulted in a revised grading system, as well as a new format and new language for the recommendation statement. This paper focuses on the changes to and the new look of the USPSTF recommendation statement. The new recommendation statement comprises 9 sections. Important changes include standardization of the format of the summary statement to specify what service is being recommended in what population; standardization of the headings in the rationale section; a change in the wording of the grade C recommendation and the I statement; and a new section, called "Other Considerations", in which salient issues related to cost-effectiveness, mandates, and other implementation issues are described.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (CHEERS) statement [^6ad6c462]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Economic evaluations of health interventions pose a particular challenge for reporting. There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website: (www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). We hope CHEERS will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the CHEERS statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse CHEERS. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (CHEERS) statement [^51bcee42]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The CHEERS Task Force followed current recommendations for developing reporting guidelines. Briefly, the need for new guidance was first identified through a survey of members of the World Association of Medical Editors. Of the 6% (55/965) who responded, 91% (n = 50) indicated they would use a standard if one were widely available. Next, published checklists or guidance documents related to reporting economic evaluations were identified from a systematic review and survey of task force members. Both of these activities were used to create a preliminary list of items to include when reporting economic evaluations. Recommendations of the minimum set of reporting items were then developed through a modified Delphi panel process. Forty eight individuals identified by the task force with broad geographical representation and representing academia, biomedical journal editors, the pharmaceutical industry, government decision makers, and those in clinical practice were invited to participate. Thirty seven agreed to participate. Participants were asked to score importance on a Likert scale and the average scores, weighted by each individual's confidence in ability to score, were then used to rank items. A cut-off point was applied to the ranked list to determine the minimum number of items important for reporting.

The CHEERS statement recommendations have been independently reviewed and subsequently revised by task force members. The recommendations are entirely those of the task force — the sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the final recommendations. A more complete description of the methods and findings of the Delphi panel are found in the larger explanation and elaboration document.

### A reporting tool for practice guidelines in health care: the RIGHT statement [^a832bb3d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The quality of reporting practice guidelines is often poor, and there is no widely accepted guidance or standards for such reporting in health care. The international RIGHT (Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare) Working Group was established to address this gap. The group followed an existing framework for developing guidelines for health research reporting and the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network approach. It developed a checklist and an explanation and elaboration statement. The RIGHT checklist includes 22 items that are considered essential for good reporting of practice guidelines: basic information (items 1 to 4), background (items 5 to 9), evidence (items 10 to 12), recommendations (items 13 to 15), review and quality assurance (items 16 and 17), funding and declaration and management of interests (items 18 and 19), and other information (items 20 to 22). The RIGHT checklist can assist developers in reporting guidelines, support journal editors and peer reviewers when considering guideline reports, and help health care practitioners understand and implement a guideline.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology policy for relationships with companies: background and rationale [^dc66c25f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO's) new conflict of interest policy reflects a commitment to transparency and independence in the development and presentation of scientific and educational content. ASCO supports thorough and accessible disclosure of financial relationships with companies at institutional and individual levels and calls for rigorous evaluation of content in light of the information disclosed. For abstracts and articles presenting original research, ASCO holds first, last, and corresponding authors to a clear standard of independence. In imposing restrictions, the new policy focuses on the role of these authors rather than of the principal investigator(s) as in the previous policy. ASCO remains actively engaged with the broader scientific community in seeking and implementing efficient, effective approaches to conflict of interest management.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^c5d37aae]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — future and societal costs specifies that cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) from a health care sector perspective should "also capture all future costs", including "total health care sector costs during the added years of life" and "health care costs unrelated to the disease of interest", and that CEAs from a societal perspective "should also include non–health care consumption costs during the added years of life". For a societal perspective, analyses "should include illness- or treatment-related productivity losses resulting from decreased participation in formal and informal labor markets or change in household production, the value of the patient's time spent seeking care as well as any caregiver time, and when relevant, any costs borne by other sectors of the economy, such as education or criminal justice"; when elements cannot be measured, "an impact inventory can be used to discuss the limitations", and "a modified societal perspective may include some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but exclude costs, such as education, from other sectors of the economy".

### Clinical consensus methodology [^0ea4d8ca]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus update process — in accordance with ACOG policy, each published ACOG clinical guidance document is reviewed by the originating committee every 24–36 months to assess its accuracy and continued relevance, an assigned committee reviewer is provided a literature search of relevant new evidence and related materials, and a recommendation about the future disposition of the document (ie, reaffirm, replace, or withdraw) is discussed with and determined by the full committee. Reaffirmed documents are deemed current and accurate and can remain in circulation until a replacement is issued or they become outdated, and some revisions may be possible through issuance of a Practice Advisory. Replacement of a document is recommended if the clinical issues are deemed still to be relevant but the document includes recommendations that may have changed since publication, and a document can remain in circulation until replaced, or immediately be withdrawn. A document is withdrawn from circulation if content is inaccurate or outdated, the content is seen as no longer relevant, or the subject is adequately addressed in other ACOG documents or by another medical organization, and generally, documents are immediately withdrawn only if there is an egregious inaccuracy or a serious issue with the content. During a transition period, the Clinical Consensus Committees will also oversee existing clinical Committee Opinions, review will follow the above-described process for reaffirmation and withdrawal, and if a replacement is warranted, the content will be redeveloped as a Clinical Consensus document.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Guideline economic evaluation — each guideline committee will need at least 1 member with expertise in reviewing published economic studies, and the selection process for the economic expert(s) on a writing committee should consider training, experience, and scholarship in economic evaluations of cardiovascular interventions. For most guidelines, a single expert may suffice, although the inclusion of 2 or more experts may be preferable for guidelines requiring the evaluation and synthesis of a large number of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). Conflicts of interest must be carefully managed in any assessment of economic value, and not all relationships with industry or payers should be considered disqualifying; for instance, contracts through academic institutions should not be regarded the same as significant equity interests or other personal or family financial interests, which would be disqualifying.

### Current trends to consider with evidence-based medicine's importance: societal, financial, legal, and clinical research [^d26b6950]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine and its quality work products enter current clinical practice at a time when physicians face a confusing, contradictory, and changing practice environment. Disparate expectations by patients and policy makers; physician conflicts of interest, and an assumption that doctors control the cost of healthcare, contribute to fears that evidence based medicine in general and guidelines and performance measures in particular, will be misused. An integrated framework for developing evidence based tools is presented.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — committee expertise, search, and perspective: Guideline committees should have "at least 1 member with expertise in reviewing and, ideally, performing economic studies related to cardiovascular disease" and "conflicts of interest must be carefully managed", with the number of individuals dependent on scope; identification of evaluations requires "a careful review of the literature and consultation with subject matter experts", and "both trial-based economic evaluations and population-based economic evaluations can be used to inform economic value statements". Economic value statements "should be based on CEAs that adopted a health care sector perspective" with societal results optionally in supporting text, and "should rely exclusively on studies that use costs that are observed or estimated in the US population".

Supporting text considerations for economic value statements — uncertainty, budget impact, and external references — note that value reassessment "is going to be increasingly important in coming years as the cost of some cardiovascular therapies may change if selected for price negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022", that authors may describe sensitivity to "treatment effect heterogeneity, variation in cost effectiveness between subgroups, or assumptions regarding extrapolation of treatment effectiveness beyond trial follow-up", that "describing the key inputs that are driving uncertainty… should be considered", that "Budget impact" on total health care spending may be included, and that high-quality CEAs from other countries may be referenced when comparisons with US-based analyses provide insights.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — therapies requiring a value statement: Consistent with the 2014 cost/value clinical practice guidelines, we suggest that clinical guidelines include economic value statements about all interventions for which economic evaluations of adequate quality are available, including preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies, and approaches to health care delivery relevant to the clinical guidelines. The decision about whether an economic value statement is appropriate should rely on the judgment of clinical and economic experts on the guideline writing committee, taking into account the clinical and population health relevance, cost, and available evidence. To the extent feasible, guideline committees should consider including economic value statements for: 1) interventions that receive Class 1 and 2A recommendations in the clinical guidelines, and 2) interventions for which an understanding of economic value is likely to influence adoption. An example of the latter would be an intervention that is expected to substantially impact total health care spending, either because it has a high cost or because a large number of individuals are likely to be eligible. When high-quality economic evaluations are scarce, economic value statements may highlight evidence gaps that can be addressed in future research (eg, indeterminate economic value due to a small number of studies). The first step in developing economic value statements is a review of the literature and consultation with subject matter experts in the field to identify all economic evaluations relevant to particular clinical guidelines.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^888e57b8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) was one of the first organizations in the United States to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines and has been developing guidelines since 1981. ACP's Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC), in collaboration with staff from the Clinical Policy department, develops clinical guidelines and guidance statements and continues to refine and enhance its methodology. This article presents an update of the CGC's 2010 paper outlining policies, methods, and presentation format of ACP's clinical guidelines and guidance statements. Updated methods include more stringent policies about disclosure of interests and conflict management; inclusion of public perspective; full adoption of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods; more standardized reporting formats that consider value of care, patient comorbid conditions, patient values and preferences, and costs; and further clarification of guidance statement methods.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022) statement: updated reporting guidance for health economic evaluations [^81e062a4]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The CHEERS 2022 statement

Scope

The CHEERS 2022 statement is intended to be used for any form of health economic evaluation. This includes analyses that only examine costs and cost offsets (that is, cost analysis) or those that examine both costs and consequences. The latter include analyses that consider health consequences (such as, cost-effectiveness/utility analyses (CEAs/CUAs), cost minimisation, cost-benefit/benefit-cost analyses (CBAs)), and broader measures of benefit and harm to individuals (such as extended CEAs/CBAs), including measures of equity (such as distributional CEAs). While we are aware some studies comparing costs are labelled as CBAs, we recommend the use of this term for studies which include a monetary valuation of health outcomes. Although linked to economic evaluation, budget impact analyses and constrained optimisation studies are beyond the scope of CHEERS guidance, as they require additional reporting that addresses population dynamics and feasibility constraints and are addressed in other guidance reports.

The primary audiences for the CHEERS 2022 statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations as well as peer reviewers and editors assessing them for publication. While the statement is not intended to guide the conduct of economic evaluation, familiarity with reporting requirements will be useful for analysts when planning studies. CHEERS may be similarly useful for health technology assessment bodies seeking guidance on reporting, as there is an increasing emphasis on transparency in decision making. Health technology assessment and the use of economic evaluation is also becoming more commonplace globally. In developing the guidelines, the CHEERS Task Force considered issues that may be specific to regions with developing economies and healthcare systems, including providing examples of these by item in the larger report, to ensure the reporting guidance will be useful in any social or political context.

CHEERS is relevant for any intervention intended to affect health and should also be widely applicable for both simple and complex interventions, including programmes of care involving researcher-driven or commercialised products (such as drugs, macromolecules, cell, gene, and tissue based therapies, vaccines, and medical devices); public health and social care interventions; processes of care (such as e-health, care coordination, clinical decision rules, clinical pathways, information and communication, medical and allied health services); and re-organisation of care (such as insurance redesign, alternative financing approaches, integrated care, scope of practice change, and workplace interventions).

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary on the treatment of clavicle fractures [^cc6528ca]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clavicle fractures guideline — non-modifiable risk factors (age and sex) states that the non-modifiable risk factors age and sex do not predict patient reported functional outcomes following mid shaft clavicle fracture regardless of treatment modality, with Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Option: Limited. Option statements are used when low quality evidence, no evidence, or conflicting supporting evidence exist. Nonmodifiable factors do not seem to affect patient reported outcomes; therefore there is no significant benefit or harm of this recommendation, and outcome does not go against standard of care. Surgical treatment of clavicle fracture is the preferred treatment in majority of significantly displaced fractures, while non-operative management could be a reasonable option in high-risk patients. This recommendation does not have any effect on the financial aspect of clavicle fracture treatment, and fracture treatment should be acceptable as it does not change the current standard of care.

### The time is ripe for ESG + nutrition: evidence-based nutrition metrics for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing [^1b185d46]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The globe faces a nutrition crisis. Suboptimal diet is the leading cause of poor health worldwide, with devastating social, environmental, equity, and economic consequences. In 2018, poor diet quality was estimated to cause 12 million deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) globally. In the US, treatment of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers accounted for 1 in 4 dollars in healthcare — and 18% higher spending than in 2009. Solutions to address the global health and economic burdens of nutrition-related disease must re-imagine and reform the food system – including new approaches to influence the private sector, which plays a critical role in supplying and influencing food choices, nutrition, and health outcomes of consumers.

Among different levers, investors – including institutional investors, family offices, and venture capital – are powerful and underutilized stakeholders for stimulating change. The rise of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing presents a remarkable new opportunity to align financial returns with benefits for society and the planet. This paradigm shift recognizes that long-term financial performance is directly linked to environmental and societal impact. From 2012 to 2020, the value of global ESG-driven assets tripled to $40.5 trillion, and now represents nearly half of the world's financial assets under management. Businesses have taken note. In 2021, 60 top global businesses committed to publicly supporting and reporting on a common set of Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics for ESG reporting. And, at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation announced a new International Sustainability Standards Board to develop, consolidate, and govern sustainability disclosure standards for businesses.

ACC/AHA cost–value methodology — committee expertise, evidence standards, and intervention selection are specified as follows: "At least 1 member with expertise in reviewing and, ideally, performing economic studies related to cardiovascular disease should serve on each guideline committee" and "Conflicts of interest must be carefully managed". Evidence identification states that "A careful review of the literature and consultation with subject matter experts in the field is necessary to identify all relevant economic evaluations. Both trial-based economic evaluations and population-based economic evaluations can be used to inform economic value statements". Economic value statements "should be based on CEAs that adopted a health care sector perspective and results from the societal perspective, if available, may be reported in the supporting text", "should rely exclusively on studies that use costs that are observed or estimated in the US population", and "should be based on CEAs that measure health outcomes in terms of QALYs gained or life years gained, and, where available, equal value of life years, and health years in total". Quality guidance notes that "Established quality assessment tools, such as the CHEQUE, can help evaluate the methodological rigor of a health economic study" and "Economic value statements should rely on high-quality studies". Scope guidance states that "Guidelines should consider including economic value statements for: Interventions that receive Class 1 and 2A recommendations in the clinical guidelines" and those "with potential for substantial impact on total health care spending", and that clinical guidelines should include statements about "preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies, and approaches to health care delivery relevant to the clinical guidelines".

Adopt a national process and ethical standards for benefits policy development — Drug coverage benefits and policies require the development of national standards accepted by all payers. All policies should include the following: an unbiased review of the literature and guidelines; reporting of all individuals involved in the policy development, inclusion of content experts and patients in policy development, transparent reporting of conflicts of interest of those involved in the policy development, an external review of the policy by unbiased reviewers, and an ongoing review of the policy for updated evidence. Currently, these national standards are not required for insurance or PBM policy development, and data on rates of initial denials and appeal denials as well as response times should be reported for accountability. Ideally, an independent board with representation from patients, expert medical providers, insurance representatives, and regulators should be developed to review any medication policies that are flagged for possible bias, lack of evidence, or failure to follow standards of care, and this board then would be able to approve the policy or require the policy to be revised.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — out-of-pocket costs and policy context — reports that more than 20% of insured adults and more than 60% of uninsured adults have delayed or foregone health care due to rising medical costs, and among Medicare beneficiaries with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, approximately 1 million adults have annual out-of-pocket costs in excess of $2000. Implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may help by expanding access to Medicare's Low-Income Subsidy (starting in 2024), capping out-of-pocket costs at $2000 per person (starting in 2025) and allowing costs to be spread over the year rather than requiring a single lump payment; additionally, 7 of the first 10 drugs selected for price negotiation are for the treatment of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors. While these reforms will lower cost-sharing for Medicare Part D beneficiaries and costs to Medicare, they are unlikely to benefit patients with other forms of insurance. We suggest that guideline writing committees consider the inclusion of 1 or more recommendations regarding the need for clinicians to discuss out-of-pocket costs with patients at the time of initiation of a new therapy and at regular intervals thereafter, with the goal of identifying financial strain resulting from out-of-pocket costs and preempting cost-related nonadherence.

People who pay for health care aim to maximize value in allocating resources between and within patient groups. With limited health care budgets, new high value innovations will replace, not supplement, lower value interventions. Every society and its health care system must consider the issue of value and be aware that the values of payer, provider, clinician, and patient will always be different. Knowledge, while necessary, is never sufficient when commissioning health care. At times, decision maker's subjective values may outweigh objective evidence.

Intraoperative awareness — postevent evaluation and pharmacologic considerations are outlined as follows: A statement asserts "Benzodiazepines or scopolamine should be administered intraoperatively to prevent awareness after a patient has unexpectedly become conscious". However, the Task Force believes that evidence from the literature is not sufficient to provide guidance regarding this issue and cautions that "the use of scopolamine may result in unintended side effects (e.g., emergence delirium)". Practitioners should speak with patients who report recall of intraoperative events to obtain details and discuss possible reasons; a questionnaire or structured interview may be used to obtain a detailed account; once an episode has been reported, an occurrence report should be completed for quality management; and the patient should be offered counseling or psychological support.

2.2.1. Delphi survey results

The criteria for including a reporting standard was that the median of Delphi expert responses was at least 6 = Agree on the question about its inclusion. In Round 1, the mean ratings for the item inclusion scale ranged from 5.37 to 6.67 (M = 6.06; SD = 0.31; Table S2) with a median agreement ranging from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree. No new standards were suggested. The feedback resulted in the removal of one reporting standard and the clarification and reformulation of 20 standards. The standard on Transparency and replicability was rated as relevant but removed because it is achieved by reporting the other reporting standards. Standard 4.2 Validity and Standard needed a major clarification about the meaning of validity as well as standard. Minor clarifications and reformations, such as grammar or word changes, were made for 19 standards (see open material). The mean ratings in Round 2 ranged from 5.47 to 6.70 (M = 6.20; SD = 0.37; Table S3), with open feedback resulting in minor clarifications and reformulations of nine standards.

2.3. Refining the guideline through expert consensus

The authors finalized the guidelines in an expert consensus meeting. The meeting was held online with nine working and steering group members. The content and structure of the consensus meeting were prepared by the working group, and the meeting was led by the last author (O.K.). Participants had access to the guidelines, inclusion rationales (i.e. elaboration and explanation), and the drafted paper before the meeting, where they also had the option to provide comments and feedback in writing. The meeting included reviewing the Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 findings and discussing the paper draft, including the individual reporting standards and groups. We decided not to carry out another Delphi round since i) the median agreement for each reporting standard in both Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 ranged from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree, ii) no new standards were suggested, and iii) only minor changes were needed after Round 2, which taken together suggest consensus.

### Reporting guidelines: doing better for readers [^9f909343]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There is clear guidance on the responsibilities of editors to ensure that the research they publish is of the highest possible quality. Poor reporting is unethical and directly impacts patient care. Reporting guidelines are a relatively recent development to help improve the accuracy, clarity, and transparency of biomedical publications. They have caught on, with hundreds of reporting guidelines now available. Some journals endorse reporting guidelines while a smaller number have used various approaches to implement them. Yet challenges remain – biomedical research is still not optimally reported despite the abundance of reporting guidelines. Electronic algorithms are now being developed to facilitate the choice of correct reporting guideline(s), while other tools are being integrated into journal editorial management processes. Universities need to consider whether it is responsible to advance careers of faculty based on poorly reported research which is of little societal value. If journals embraced auditing of the quality of articles they publish this would give them and their readers essential feedback from which to improve their product.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^8243c9b6]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Preamble

Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of quality cardiovascular care.

In response to reports from the Institute of Medicine, and a mandate to evaluate new knowledge and maintain relevance at the point of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) modified its methodology. – The relationships among guidelines, data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere.

Intended Use

Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Guidelines are reviewed annually by the Task Force and are official policy of the ACC and AHA. Each guideline is considered current until it is updated, revised, or superseded by published addenda, statements of clarification, focused updates, or revised full-text guidelines. To ensure that guidelines remain current, new data are reviewed biannually to determine whether recommendations should be modified. In general, full revisions are posted in 5-year cycles. –

Modernization

Processes have evolved to support the evolution of guidelines as "living documents" that can be dynamically updated. This process delineates a recommendation to address a specific clinical question, followed by concise text (ideally < 250 words) and hyperlinked to supportive evidence. This approach accommodates time constraints on busy clinicians and facilitates easier access to recommendations via electronic search engines and other evolving technology.

Evidence Review

Writing committee members review the literature; weigh the quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimate expected health outcomes. In developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data. – Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only selected references are cited.

The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, independent Evidence Review Committees (ERCs) that include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians who systematically survey, abstract, and assess the evidence to address systematic review questions posed in the PICOTS format (P = population, I = intervention, C = comparator, O = outcome, T = timing, S = setting).– Practical considerations, including time and resource constraints, limit the ERCs to evidence that is relevant to key clinical questions and lends itself to systematic review and analysis that could affect the strength of corresponding recommendations.

Guideline-Directed Management and Treatment

The term "guideline-directed management and therapy" (GDMT) refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I recommendations. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States.

Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence

The Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, the strength of the recommendation) encompasses the anticipated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports (Table 1). – Unless otherwise stated, recommendations are sequenced by COR and then by LOE. Where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence. When > 1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and no comparative data are available, options are listed alphabetically.

Relationships With Industry and Other Entities

The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time. The Task Force zealously avoids actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All writing committee members and reviewers are required to disclose current industry relationships or personal interests, from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced writing committee and assuring that the chair and a majority of committee members have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1). Members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply. For transparency, members' comprehensive disclosure information is available online. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online.

The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds representing different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators.

Individualizing Care in Patients With Associated Conditions and Comorbidities

Managing patients with multiple conditions can be complex, especially when recommendations applicable to coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting. The guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances. The recommendations should not replace clinical judgment.

Clinical Implementation

Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Consequently, circumstances may arise in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.

### The pap test and bethesda 2014: "The reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. (after a quotation from mark twain) " [^f0ae9825]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The Bethesda System for gynecologic cytopathology has standardized reporting terminology over the past quarter of a century. In doing so, it has allowed for improved communication among practitioners around the world, facilitated large research projects and clinical trials, and has provided the basis from which uniformly accepted risk-based management strategies have been developed. Over time, changes in terminology and the underlying science require revisions, and the third edition of the Bethesda "Atlas" is the result of a yearlong effort to provide such an update. New material was developed and proposed via an Internet bulletin board, allowing for wide commentary that was compiled and incorporated. New images were collected, which comprised many new examples of equivocal presentations and mimics. New background material on the scientific basis supporting the terminology categories, the most current management algorithms, and comprehensive references were included. The effort completely refurbishes this standard reference that forms an inexpensive and, therefore, widely available resource for the world's cytology community.

Budget impact — definition and reporting notes that budget impact refers to the effect of adopting the intervention on total health care expenditures, accounting for both increased spending due to intervention-related costs and downstream savings from improved health in the treated population; high-quality economic evaluations typically also separately report changes in intervention-related costs, the cost of cardiovascular care and the cost of noncardiovascular care, and because budget impact may inform population-level adoption, this information may be included in the supporting text accompanying the economic value statement where available.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2014). Medium credibility.

Nutrition support — Standards of Practice (SOP) and Standards of Professional Performance (SOPP) for registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) are defined as authoritative statements; SOP describe practice through nutrition assessment, nutrition diagnosis (problem identification), nutrition intervention (planning, implementation), and outcomes monitoring and evaluation (4 separate standards) and are responsibilities for which RDNs are accountable, while SOPP describe behavior in the professional role across Quality in Practice, Competence and Accountability, Provision of Services, Application of Research, Communication and Application of Knowledge, and Utilization and Management of Resources (6 professional standards). These SOP and SOPP are evaluation resources with complementary sets of standards and both serve to describe the practice and professional performance of RDNs, though all indicators may not be applicable to all RDNs' practice or to all practice settings and situations, and RDNs operate within the directives of applicable federal and state laws and regulations as well as policies and procedures established by the organization in which they are employed; to determine whether an activity is within the scope of practice of the RDN, the practitioner compares his or her knowledge, skill, and competence with the criteria necessary to perform the activity safely, ethically, legally, and appropriately, and the Academy's Scope of Practice Decision Tool is specifically designed to assist practitioners. Each standard is equal in relevance and importance and includes a definition, a rationale statement, indicators, and examples of desired outcomes, and the materials have been adapted to reflect three levels of practice (competent, proficient and expert) for RDNs in nutrition support. Terminology clarifies that patient/client is used in the SOP as a universal term for direct provision of nutrition care and services, whereas customer is used in the SOPP as a universal term.

Additional practices for inherited metabolic disease testing — Reagents, supplies, and instruments used during routine testing should be the same as those used in test performance establishment or verification, and new reagent lots and shipments should be tested in parallel with old lots before or concurrently with being placed in service to ensure that the new lot of reagent has maintained consistent results for patient specimens. Test performance specifications should be reestablished if the test system has been modified with changes that could affect its performance specifications, such changes include using different or additional equipment or instruments, changing any critical reagent, using different control or reference materials, or using a different specimen collection device, and equipment should be evaluated and monitored to account for basic detection or measurement drift through analysis of quality control data, function checks, and internal electronic checks. Laboratories are encouraged to use available mechanisms for standardizing laboratory practices for preparing and validating reagents and reference materials that are not commercially available, and when available, FDA-cleared reagents should be used for patient testing; the lack of FDA-cleared reagents increases the responsibility of the laboratory to validate any internally developed or shared reagents, standards, or controls, and laboratories also should consider relevant professional guidelines, such as those developed by CLSI and ACMG, that provide additional guidance for specific test methods.

### When and how to update systematic reviews: consensus and checklist [^cd474593]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Other tools are specifically designed to help decision making in updating. For example, the Ottawaand RANDmethods focus on identification of new evidence, the statistical predication toolcalculates the probability of new evidence changing the review conclusion, and the value of information analysis approachcalculates the expected health gain (table 1). As yet, there has been limited external validation of these tools to determine which approach would be most effective and when.

If potentially relevant studies are identified that have not previously been assessed for inclusion, authors or those managing the updating process need to assess whether including them might affect the conclusions of the review. They need to examine the weight and certainty of the new evidence to help determine whether an update is needed and how urgent that update is. The updating team can assess this informally by judging whether new studies or data are likely to substantively affect the review, for example, by altering the certainty in an existing comparison, or by generating new comparisons and analyses in the existing review.

New information can also include fresh follow-up data on existing included studies, or information on how the studies were carried out. These should be assessed in terms of whether they might change the review findings or improve its credibility (fig 1). Indeed, if any study has been retracted, it is important the authors assess the reasons for its retraction. In the case of data fabrication, the study needs to be removed from the analysis and this recorded. A decision needs to be made as to whether other studies by the same author should be removed from the review and other related reviews. An investigation should also be initiated following guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Additional published and unpublished data can become available from a wide range of sources — including study investigators, regulatory agencies and industry — and are important to consider.

### Medicaid and the children's health insurance program: optimization to promote equity in child and young adult health [^b462e9b2]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) — the statement envisions an individualized, family-centered, equitable, and comprehensive child and adolescent health care system, notes that Medicaid and CHIP provide critical support for this vision and currently serve about half of all children, and recommends foundational changes to improve child health, advance equity, dismantle structural racism within the programs, and reduce major state-by-state variations. The recommendations focus on eligibility and duration of coverage; standardization of covered services and quality of care; and program financing and payment, and the statement indicates extensive, coordinated actions that regulation from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or federal legislation can accomplish in the shorter term. The guidance does not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care, and variations taking into account individual circumstances may be appropriate; a separate technical report will address additional program origins, current state, special populations, innovations and waivers, and special coverage and initiatives.

ACOG Clinical Consensus — committee voting and approval procedures specify that after a comprehensive discussion of each recommendation and supporting evidence, a formal committee vote is held for approval of each recommendation statement, with a quorum of two thirds of eligible committee members needed to hold a vote. Eligible voting members include full committee members, young physician members, public members, and ex officio members, while liaisons are excluded from voting, and any member with a conflict of interest that prevents them from voting on the topic will be subtracted from the total number of eligible voting participants. For passage, a 75% approval threshold is needed to move a final recommendation forward, proposed recommendations not meeting this threshold can be revised and reconsidered, and proposed recommendations that do not meet the threshold after a second vote are not incorporated into the Clinical Consensus.

### SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for protocols of clinical trials [^84307b22]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Data management

Item 19: Plans for data entry, coding, security, and storage, including any related processes to promote data quality (eg, double data entry; range checks for data values). Reference to where details of data management procedures can be found, if not in the protocol

Explanation

Careful planning of data management with appropriate personnel can help to prevent flaws that compromise data validity. The protocol should provide a full description of the data entry and coding processes, along with measures to promote their quality, or provide key elements and a reference to where full information can be found. These details are particularly important for the primary outcome data. The protocol should also document data security measures to prevent unauthorised access to or loss of participant data, as well as plans for data storage (including timeframe) during and after the trial. This information facilitates an assessment of adherence to applicable standards and regulations.

Differences in data entry methods can affect the trial in terms of data accuracy, cost, and efficiency. For example, when compared with paper case report forms, electronic data capture can reduce the time required for data entry, query resolution, and database release by combining data entry with data collection (Item 18a). When data are collected on paper forms, data entry can be performed locally or at a central site. Local data entry can enable fast correction of missing or inaccurate data, while central data entry facilitates blinding (masking), standardisation, and training of a core group of data entry personnel.

Raw, non-numeric data are usually coded for ease of data storage, review, tabulation, and analysis. It is important to define standard coding practices to reduce errors and observer variation. When data entry and coding are performed by different individuals, it is particularly important that the personnel use unambiguous, standardised terminology and abbreviations to avoid misinterpretation.

As with data collection (Item 18a), standard processes are often implemented to improve the accuracy of data entry and coding. Common examples include double data entry; verification that the data are in the proper format (eg, integer) or within an expected range of values; and independent source document verification of a random subset of data to identify missing or apparently erroneous values. Though widely performed to detect data entry errors, the time and costs of independent double data entry from paper forms need to be weighed against the magnitude of reduction in error rates compared to single-data entry.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022) statement: updated reporting guidance for health economic evaluations [^acaf1a80]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Health economic evaluations are comparative analyses of alternative courses of action in terms of their costs and consequences. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement, published in 2013, was created to ensure health economic evaluations are identifiable, interpretable, and useful for decision making. It was intended as guidance to help authors report accurately which health interventions were being compared and in what context, how the evaluation was undertaken, what the findings were, and other details that may aid readers and reviewers in interpretation and use of the study. The new CHEERS 2022 statement replaces previous CHEERS reporting guidance. It reflects the need for guidance that can be more easily applied to all types of health economic evaluation, new methods and developments in the field, as well as the increased role of stakeholder involvement including patients and the public. It is also broadly applicable to any form of intervention intended to improve the health of individuals or the population, whether simple or complex, and without regard to context (such as health care, public health, education, social care, etc). This summary article presents the new CHEERS 2022 28-item checklist and recommendations for each item. The CHEERS 2022 statement is primarily intended for researchers reporting economic evaluations for peer reviewed journals as well as the peer reviewers and editors assessing them for publication. However, we anticipate familiarity with reporting requirements will be useful for analysts when planning studies. It may also be useful for health technology assessment bodies seeking guidance on reporting, as there is an increasing emphasis on transparency in decision making.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Budget impact in economic evaluations — Budget impact refers to the effect of adopting the intervention on total health care expenditures, accounting for both increased spending due to intervention-related costs and downstream savings from improved health in the treated population, and high-quality evaluations typically report changes in intervention-related costs, the cost of cardiovascular care (for example, savings from averted major adverse cardiovascular events), and the cost of noncardiovascular care (for example, increased spending due to prolonged survival). The budget impact is directly proportional to the number of eligible patients who receive the intervention, with studies typically reporting the projected effect on health care spending if all eligible patients were to receive the drug, and because budget impact may inform strategies for adoption at a population level, this information may be included in the supporting text accompanying the economic value statement where available.

### Measuring the budget impact of nondiscriminatory cost-effectiveness [^0591ec9f]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Facing limited health care budgets, payers — including CMS — must determine which drugs to cover and what prices to pay. Under the IRA, CMS is required to consider several factors (eg, research and development costs, sales volumes, relative drug effectiveness) in setting maximum fair prices. The degree to which therapeutic benefit is considered relative to other factors is unknown. Incorporating GRACE into price determinations would increase transparency in negotiations and better align pricing with value, providing more efficient incentives to innovators.

### Consensus statement on managing anxiety and depression in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease [^2c0719e8]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials were created to synthesize the key findings from the literature scan, including recommendations from study authors and a compilation of depression and anxiety screening and treatment approaches. These materials were shared with panel members in advance of the first virtual meeting. The 5-step modified Delphi process is described subsequently and in Figure 1. The first virtual meeting was used to gather input on key considerations in developing the consensus statements, including the role of IBD healthcare professionals in providing screening and treatment to patients around anxiety and depression, and key issues related to screening and treatment of anxiety and depression in individuals with IBD. Feedback was obtained from 8 of the 9 panel members at this meeting, and this feedback was used to develop an initial set of draft consensus statements that were shared with panelists for asynchronous review and scoring via XLeap. During the second round, all 9 panelists submitted qualitative feedback and reflected on draft language for the consensus statements. The third round consisted of panelist review and feedback via XLeap on the language for the updated consensus statements that incorporated the feedback provided during the prior round. All 9 panelists provided qualitative feedback on the language of the statements and conducted a rank-order exercise to prioritize statements within the 3 categories of general management, screening, and treatment. Panelists were also encouraged to provide qualitative feedback on their ratings. The mean score and normalized standard deviation for each statement were calculated using XLeap. The normalized standard deviation is an indication of consensus within the group in which below 0.2 indicates general to strong consensus in the group and above 0.3 indicates strong dissent. Two initial draft statements obtained a normalized standard deviation of 0.32, the only statements above the 0.3 threshold for consensus. In these cases, qualitative feedback was used to clarify the statements and, in both cases, these statements were combined with other statements as the primary concern was duplication of other statements. The study team utilized the qualitative feedback and the ratings to create a final set of statements for panel review. The fourth round brought participants together through a virtual meeting to reflect on the previous comments, review feedback, and finalize language for the consensus statements. The final round was conducted asynchronously, and all 9 participants provided feedback on the final statements and input on the final screening tools and treatment approaches to be highlighted.

### Value assessment frameworks: who is valuing the care in healthcare? [^a1367742]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Many healthcare agencies are producing evidence-based guidance and policy that may determine the availability of particular healthcare products and procedures, effectively rationing aspects of healthcare. They claim legitimacy for their decisions through reference to evidence-based scientific method and the implementation of just decision-making procedures, often citing the criteria of 'accountability for reasonableness'; publicity, relevance, challenge and revision, and regulation. Central to most decision methods are estimates of gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), a measure that combines the length and quality of survival. However, all agree that the QALY alone is not a sufficient measure of all relevant aspects of potential healthcare benefits, and a number of value assessment frameworks have been suggested. I argue that the practical implementation of these procedures has the potential to lead to a distorted assessment of value. Undue weight may be ascribed to certain attributes, particularly those that favour commercial or political interests, while other attributes that are highly valued by society, particularly those related to care processes, may be omitted or undervalued. This may be compounded by a lack of transparency to relevant stakeholders, resulting in an inability for them to participate in, or challenge, the decisions. The makes it likely that costly new technologies, for which inflated prices can be justified by the current value frameworks, are displacing aspects of healthcare that are highly valued by society.

Limitations, challenges, and arguments against incorporating resource and value considerations — barriers and gaps are described, including variability in value across settings, integration of long-term costs, and lack of national consensus, while noting hopes for routine cost-effectiveness assessment and acknowledging system-level changes are not addressed. Barriers include "widespread unwillingness to acknowledge that resources are limited, distrust of government and other policy decision makers, and lack of confidence in the science of value determination (cost-effectiveness)". Value "is not constant; it may vary over time and from one location to another", and integrating "long-term costs" like infrastructure into per-treatment costs is challenging. "In the United States, no national consensus has emerged regarding the role of cost-effectiveness considerations in healthcare decision making", but "the writing committee… will encourage routine assessment of cost-effectiveness", and it "recognizes" that a focus on individual procedures "does not address system changes that may improve efficiency of cardiovascular care".

Assessing the quality of economic evidence for guideline value statements requires formal appraisal; the page notes that quality can vary substantially and that each study should undergo a careful quality assessment before incorporation. Factors that determine quality include the population studied, choice of intervention, comparator and outcomes, and overall methodological rigor; generalizability may be limited if the study population differs demographically, clinically, or socioeconomically from the target population, and incorrect assumptions about risks, comparators, or costs can also affect quality.

Prioritized research questions

Of the initial nine questions in SI and II, voting results indicated that the following questions were the highest priority (Table 2):
SII, Q2: What radiologist factors may contribute to variability in IF reporting (interpretation of Lung-RADS instructions for applying the S modifier, knowledge about IFs, opinions/attitudes/beliefs about expectations for reporting IFs, etc.)?
SII, Q3: What are the facilitators and barriers to using the S modifier in reporting (Lung-RADS category 1 and 2 vs. category 3 and 4 nodule findings, radiologist training, type of radiology practice)?
SII, Q4: What are potential educational opportunities and practical tools for improving radiologists' use of the S modifier?
SII Q6: What are the barriers to developing a more robust version of the ACR quick guide that incorporates the relevant ACR IF white papers, which radiologists could use for reporting and ordering clinicians to manage SIFs?
SII, Q8: Should radiologists be making nonimaging follow-up recommendations for SIFs?
SII, Q9: What is the potential role of artificial intelligence or computer-aided detection in identifying, quantifying, and reporting IFs?

Section III: Management of IFs: Stakeholder Perspectives

As noted above, the ACR Lung-RADS lexicon has been widely adopted and is intended to standardize clinical reporting and management of LDCT findings from LCS. However, the use of the S modifier has yet to be standardized across systems because of a lack of agreement on what is clinically significant or potentially clinically significant. This variation is driven by 1) what an individual radiologist may determine and identify as clinically significant or insignificant, 2) what the end-using clinician decides is clinically significant or insignificant, and also potentially 3) what the patient's response is to reading about IFs in the LDCT report.

Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2014). Medium credibility.

Standard 6 — Utilization and management of resources states that the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) uses resources effectively and efficiently, with a rationale that the RDN demonstrates leadership through strategic management of time, finances, facilities, supplies, technology, and human resources; indicators are organized by practice level (Competent, Proficient, Expert) and the "X" signifies the indicators for the level of practice. Key indicators include 6.1 using a systematic approach to manage resources and improve operational outcomes, including identifying efficient work flow patterns to optimize time management and maximize patient/client care outcomes, and selecting clinically-appropriate and cost-effective nutrition support therapy with development of team guidelines and analysis/reporting of utilization and related costs; 6.2 quantifying management of resources in nutrition, dietetics, and nutrition support services using standardized performance measures and benchmarking, with collection of productivity and/or product usage data and analysis to modify practice based on standardized benchmarks; and 6.3 evaluating safety, effectiveness, and value while planning and delivering services and products, considering safe, effective, and cost-effective nutrition support therapy during nutrition assessment and treatment process.

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^65eea7d3]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The recommended costing principles include the following.
Definitions of terms used in studies of vaccine delivery costing should conform closely to the recommended definitions in this Consensus Statement.
The study scope in terms of its purpose, audience, target population, time horizon, and service/output should be clearly stated. It should also state whether data collection will be prospective or retrospective, and whether the analysis will be retrospective or a cost projection.
The perspective of the cost estimation should be stated and justified.
Types of costs to be generated should be clearly defined in terms of start-up/introduction or non-start-up/introduction (sometimes called operating costs), recurrent and capital, undepreciated financial, financial or economic, and incremental or full. Capital costs should be appropriately annualized and depreciated for financial and economic costs and the discount rate justified.
The scope of the inputs to be estimated should be defined, justified, and if needed referenced. For example, do the costs include national and sub-national costs or only facility-level service delivery costs? Are non-immunization costs included?
The "units" in the unit costs for strategies, services, and interventions should be defined, e.g. cost per dose administered.
If incremental costing is conducted, any assumptions made regarding existing health system capacity should be described (see GHCC reference case, pg. 64).
The selection of the data sources, including any adjustments to price data (e.g. inflation or currency conversion) should be described and referenced.
The methods for estimating the quantity of inputs should be described — whether top-down or bottom-up, methods of allocation, use of shadow prices and the opportunity cost of time, and methods for excluding research and evaluation costs.
Costs should be mapped and reported as either inputs or activities: i. Resource inputs include, for example, personnel time, vaccines, injection and safety supplies, vehicles, fuel, per diem and travel allowances, cold chain equipment, stationery, laboratory equipment, and buildings; ii. Program activities include, for example, vaccine procurement, service delivery, training, micro-planning, social mobilization, and advocacy and communication, monitoring and evaluation, surveillance, adverse event following immunization monitoring, and supervision.
Some boundaries around costs included in the analysis may be employed to keep the costing scope feasible and will depend on the purpose of the costing study, with the rationale for any exclusions provided; use discretion about including one-time costs that are unique or unlikely to be replicated or transferable across settings (for example, new vaccine launches with the President). Clarify definition and threshold for including or excluding small costs that have expected small contribution (e.g. < $25) to total costs in aggregate across all sampled units, such as the use of existing office supplies by health facility staff.
The sampling strategy employed should aim for internal and external validity of the data 3. Sampling strategy should be stated, described, and justified, depending on the workstream and costing objectives. Sampling of different service delivery units is desirable as it provides a more representative picture of costs and highlights cost variation and cost drivers for a strategy or vaccine.
Variation in the cost of the intervention by site/organization, sub-population, or by other drivers of heterogeneity should be explored and reported for retrospective analyses when possible.
The uncertainty around the cost estimates should be appropriately characterized when feasible, (e.g. sensitivity analyses; ranges of results for different input parameter scenarios for cost projections; mean and standard deviation for non-representative samples with multiple units; and confidence intervals or credible intervals for retrospective analyses).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria: "stopping rules" 4 should be defined, explaining which costs are included and the respective rationale.
Cost estimates should be communicated clearly and transparently to enable decision-makers to interpret and use the results relevant to the original policy and/or programmatic question.

Statement 2 — Modifying factors: Prior to surgery, clinicians should gather information specific to the patient that modifies severity and/or duration of pain; this is a Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harms. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and the level of confidence in evidence is High. Benefits include to individualize the plan for analgesia for the specific patient and clinical setting, improve patient satisfaction/expectation, minimize overtreatment or undertreatment of pain, engage patient in design of postoperative pain management, reduce potential bias, and decrease disparities in pain management, while risk, harm, cost include information may lead to inaccurate estimates of pain, administrative burden of gathering and documenting information, heightened implicit bias. The benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm; value judgments state this inquiry may not be done routinely and is independent but complementary to assessing risk profile for OUD; intentional vagueness notes the method of inquiry is not specified and may involve written survey, interview, or standardized history; role of patient preferences is None; exclusions are None; policy level is Recommendation.

### Twenty-one years of the international shared decision making conference: lessons learnt and future priorities [^0509db2a]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Various measurement tools have been developed to capture the SDM process and outcomes. This includes patient-reported measures that capture patient's experience of the decision making process, observational measures, where trained assessors rate the observable aspects of a consultation, measures that focus on things that influence the SDM process, for example, control preferences, and measures that focus on patient's attitudes, feelings and values. Syntheses of implementation attempts have also identified several key factors that play an important role in supporting routine implementation of SDM and patient decision aids, including leadership and coordination, training and education, redesigning care pathways, enabling patients to participate in SDM, policy-level support, sustainable patient decision aid resources, guidelines that promote SDM and incentives (financial and non-financial).

While we have learnt a lot about these things over 21 years, there is always more work and innovation to do. We also need to recognise the remaining gap between knowing what works and realising this in routine clinical practice. We also know that these will not be universal, and more work is needed to work out how they work for different groups and in different settings. But we know enough about them and their effectiveness that they can be used to improve SDM — and if we do these things, we can be more certain that patients are more involved in decision making than when they are not used.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022) statement: updated reporting guidance for health economic evaluations [^2da662e4]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Economic evaluations of health interventions are comparative analyses of alternative courses of action in terms of their costs and consequences. They can provide useful information to policy makers, payers, health professionals, patients, and the public about choices that affect health and the use of resources. Economic evaluations are a particular challenge for reporting because substantial information must be conveyed to allow scrutiny of study findings. Despite a growth in published economic evaluationsand availability of reporting guidance, there is a considerable lack of standardisation and transparency in reporting. There remains a need for reporting guidance to help authors, journal editors, and peer reviewers in their identification and interpretation.

The goal of the original Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement, was to recommend the minimum amount of information required for reporting of published health economic evaluations. The statement consisted of a 24-item checklist and Explanation and Elaboration Report.CHEERS was intended to help authors provide accurate information on which health interventions are being compared and in what context, how the evaluation was undertaken, what the findings are, and other details that may aid readers and reviewers in interpretation and use of the study. In doing so, it can also aid interested researchers in replicating research findings. Some checklist items (such as title, abstract) were also included to aid those researching economic evaluation literature. The CHEERS statement consolidated previous health economic evaluation reporting guidelinesinto one current, useful reporting guidance.

Since the original publication of the CHEERS statement, there have been several developments that have motivated an update. These include feedback on perceived limitations of CHEERS, including criticism of its neglect of addressing reporting of cost-benefit analyses.CHEERS has also been observed to be used inappropriately, as a tool to assess quality of methods, for which other tools exist, rather than the quality of reporting. It has also been used as a tool to quantitatively score studies in systematic reviews, an approach that could mislead readers and reviewersas it has not been designed for this purpose.

There have also been methods developments in economic evaluation motivating an update. This includes an update of methods proposed by the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine ("Second Panel"), which contained new recommendations concerning the perspective of economic evaluations, the classification of costs and benefits in a structured table, and the inclusion of related and unrelated healthcare costs in added years of life. Health technology assessment bodies have also updated their guidance on conducting and appraising economic evaluations.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^416de9c0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The case for change

Therapeutic product research and development (R&D) still yields too many late stage failures, with negative impacts on individual health, general public health and the economic health of companies, healthcare systems, and countries. The large majority of assets entering clinical development continue to fail, with persistently high attrition rates even at late‐stage phase III. 1, 2 Patient clinical study participation efforts, institutional resources, and time can be wasted; development costs 3, 4 spiral upward; health system coherence and efficiencies and patient access and outcomes are suboptimal. 5 In response, visions for the future of healthcare systems and R&D 6, 7, 8 are rapidly driving a wealth of innovations, but uncertainties about ultimate outcomes remain.

Inadequate product performance is the obvious but not sole reason accounting for development and marketing/reimbursement failures; inadequate evidence quality is also a problem. Many rejected applications exhibit insufficient evidence of efficacy and/or safety — including clinical relevance and/or methodological deficiencies — with requirements for new clinical studies to resolve outstanding critical uncertainties. 9, 10, 11 Regulators', health technology assessors' (HTAs'), and payers' challenges in adequately assessing product performance and value due to evidence deficiencies thwart positive marketing authorization and access decisions while fueling stakeholder frustration — especially if hindsight shows that critical problems were avoidable.

Vaccine delivery costs Costs associated with delivering immunization programs to target populations, exclusive of vaccine costs.
Vaccine cost At a minimum includes the cost of the vaccine and diluent (if applicable); the analysis should include accounting for wastage rates; the analyst should specify whether this also includes injection supplies (syringes), international shipment, insurance, and customs/duties.
Financial cost Monetary outlays, with straight-line depreciation for capital goods; does not include opportunity costs for use of resources or donated goods and services from sources other than the payer(s) defined in the analysis. Definition is dependent on perspective since monetary outlays are specific to the payer(s) defined in the analysis.
Economic cost The value of all resources utilized, regardless of the source of financing. Includes opportunity costs for use of existing resources and any donated goods or services from any source. Capital costs are annualized and discounted.
Undepreciated financial cost Financial costs without depreciation of capital costs (note: such costs have been termed "initial investment" in some costing tools and referred to as fiscal costs in previous analyses.)
Recurrent cost Value of resources that last less than one year. Start-up activity costs may include recurrent costs.
Capital cost Value of resources lasting more than one year such as equipment, buildings, and trainings. Start-up activity costs may include capital costs.
Incremental cost Cost of adding a new service/intervention or a package of services/interventions over and above an existing program; inclusion of existing resources will depend on assumptions made about excess capacity (i.e. whether resources are underemployed; if there are no slack resources (e.g. all personnel time is fully allocated before the addition of the new service/intervention), then their use for the new service or intervention incurs an opportunity cost that should be included — either by measurement or assumption).
Full cost Baseline cost as well as the additional/incremental cost of the new intervention, including vaccine cost.
Cost projection Estimation of future costs of both recurrent and capital inputs.
Prospective data collection Direct observation of resource use during intervention implementation; i.e. data are collected concurrently with intervention implementation.
Retrospective data collection Data collection after resource use is completed.
Start-up cost Cost of initial one-time programmatic activities. Examples may include initial micro-planning, initial training activities, and initial sensitization/social mobilization/information, education, and communication (IEC); does not include routine or repeated programmatic activities such as refresher training or annual microplanning. Start-up activities may include both recurrent and capital costs; they are defined by the non-repeating nature of the activity, not the type of input.
Micro-costing Focuses on granular accounting of input prices and quantities; disaggregates costs of particular output into specific goods and services consumed.
Bottom-up costing Measures input quantities at the client (e.g. per vaccination administered) or activity level.
Top-down costing Divides overall program cost or expenditures, often including those at administrative levels above service delivery level, by number of outputs to calculate unit cost.
Perspective The point of view considered for costs (and benefits, if included) in a costing study, by whom the costs were incurred. Payers are the disbursing agents for a good or service, and may differ from the original source of funding. A provider perspective includes costs incurred by health service providers (can be limited to the government), a payer perspective includes costs to the payer(s), such as government or an external partner, while the societal perspective includes all costs incurred by providers as well as clients.
Shared cost Shared resources that are not used only for immunization, but also for other productive activities.

### Value-based healthcare: controlling costs through a value analysis committee [^4dd84f23]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Principle 3: Compare Costs to Similar Solutions

Supply chain and finance specialists should provide summary information on pricing, cost comparisons, and general reimbursement for co-chair and general committee review. Transparency from the hospital and/or healthcare system is important to make sound and informed decisions. The physician proposing a new product should work with a supply chain representative to accurately identify similar adopted products and essentially equivalent products on the market for cost comparisons. At the direction of the committee, adopting a new solution may require replacing an existing and similar solution to improve negotiated pricing and supply chain efficiency. Committee members should pause and reflect on whether a proposed new product that addresses the same clinical need as an existing product will add cost without improving quality.

### Clinical evidence 2030 [^4c1329fb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

PRINCIPLE 6: HIGH LEVELS OF TRANSPARENCY UNDERPIN SOCIETAL TRUST

Ultimately, following these principles in a transparent and collaborative manner will reinforce trust and willingness to contribute from all stakeholders, especially patients and healthcare professionals. All stakeholders have a collective responsibility to ensure that evidence reaches the expected level of standards that society needs for it to support impactful decisions. Clinical evidence then becomes a trusted, powerful, and efficient instrument for bringing better medicines to patients faster.

### Standards for conducting and reporting consensus and recommendation documents: European society of cardiovascular radiology policy from the guidelines committee [^99fd4f9b]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedure of the writing group

The panel group is encouraged to organize a brainstorming session to clearly define the specific clinical question addressed in the scientific document. This is important, as a straightforward question will ascertain finding an answer and increase the results' reliability. The objective and rationale for the consensus process should be clear. The population to which the clinical problem applies should be clearly defined. Predefining the consensus document's target audience and potential users is essential, as its content should be adjusted accordingly. It is also recommended to define expected results and their use and impact on this audience. Last, the panel should also specify all outcomes that may be relevant for clinical decision-making.

Expert panel members must be current with current guidelines, standards, and recent publications to achieve reliable consensus results. Hence, all expert panel group members should receive a literature-based summary on the specific topic or clinical problem, as discussed in the following section.

### Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022 (CHEERS 2022) statement: updated reporting guidance for health economic evaluations [^a819330c]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Economic evaluations of health interventions are comparative analyses of alternative courses of action in terms of their costs and consequences. They can provide useful information to policy makers, payers, health professionals, patients, and the public about choices that affect health and the use of resources. Economic evaluations are a particular challenge for reporting because substantial information must be conveyed to allow scrutiny of study findings. Despite a growth in published economic evaluations and availability of reporting guidance, there is a considerable lack of standardisation and transparency in reporting. There remains a need for reporting guidance to help authors, journal editors, and peer reviewers in their identification and interpretation.

The goal of the original Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement, was to recommend the minimum amount of information required for reporting of published health economic evaluations. The statement consisted of a 24-item checklist and Explanation and Elaboration Report. CHEERS was intended to help authors provide accurate information on which health interventions are being compared and in what context, how the evaluation was undertaken, what the findings are, and other details that may aid readers and reviewers in interpretation and use of the study. In doing so, it can also aid interested researchers in replicating research findings. Some checklist items (such as title, abstract) were also included to aid those researching economic evaluation literature. The CHEERS statement consolidated previous health economic evaluation reporting guidelines into one current, useful reporting guidance.

Since the original publication of the CHEERS statement, there have been several developments that have motivated an update. These include feedback on perceived limitations of CHEERS, including criticism of its neglect of addressing reporting of cost-benefit analyses. CHEERS has also been observed to be used inappropriately, as a tool to assess quality of methods, for which other tools exist, rather than the quality of reporting. It has also been used as a tool to quantitatively score studies in systematic reviews, an approach that could mislead readers and reviewers as it has not been designed for this purpose.

There have also been methods developments in economic evaluation motivating an update. This includes an update of methods proposed by the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine ("Second Panel"), which contained new recommendations concerning the perspective of economic evaluations, the classification of costs and benefits in a structured table, and the inclusion of related and unrelated healthcare costs in added years of life. Health technology assessment bodies have also updated their guidance on conducting and appraising economic evaluations.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^46346e5f]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Panel generation and statement development

The panel for this Delphi study was generated through an iterative, inclusive process involving diverse liver organisations around the world (Table 1). The Steering Committee (n = 36) was composed of 2 co-chairs (Mary E. Rinella and Philip N Newsome), representing AASLD and EASL, respectively, and 34 other members nominated by their respective associations with a view to ensuring broad geographic representation.

TABLE 1
Delphi panel characteristics (N = 225)

The consensus process used a modified Delphi method – to incorporate input from the literature and a diverse group of content experts, practitioners, and patient advocates. The steering committee identified 5 areas deemed fundamental to the consideration of a revised nomenclature, namely: (1) What are issues with the current nomenclature, and can they be addressed? (2) What is the importance of steatohepatitis in disease definition and endpoints? (3) How should the role of alcohol be accounted for? (4) How might a name change impact disease awareness, clinical trials, and regulatory approval pathways? and (5) Can an alternative name reduce heterogeneity and allow for future advances? Between late 2021 and early 2022, the steering committee was divided into 6 working groups, each with a designated lead (Sven M. Francque, Mary E. Rinella, Philip N Newsome, Arun J. Sanyal, Vlad Ratziu, and Fasiha Kanwal), responsible for reviews of the literature to inform the development of draft statements for their assigned topic area: patient-centered perspective (Sven M. Francque); pros and cons of the current nomenclature (Mary E. Rinella); defining fatty liver disease in the setting of metabolic dysfunction (Philip N Newsome); disease heterogeneity (Arun J. Sanyal); histopathology (Vlad Ratziu); and how to manage the role of alcohol in dual aetiology (Fasiha Kanwal). The preliminary draft statements were compiled and shared with the larger steering committee for review, and the feedback was incorporated into a revised set of draft consensus statements (Supplemental Table S1).

### GI societies joint statement on ANSI / AAMI ST91: GI societies vote No on AAMI revisions on endoscopic processing [^b7d3763e]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

GI societies joint statement — endoscope reprocessing standard inconsistencies and impractical guidance are identified, noting "One example of inconsistency between the normative and formative sections of the standard relates to routine utilization of drying verification" and "Another example is the inclusion of guidance relative to loaned endoscopes in the formative but not normative section of the standard". The statement adds that "Following are 3 examples that were discussed in multiple workgroup meetings but remain in the document", including a detachable parts section where "any one of the following measures are recommended: (1) Use of single-use biopsy port caps and single-use valves; (2) Sterilization of reusable valves and caps, preferably using steam sterilization when materials are compatible; (3) High level disinfection of valves and caps, either keeping the valve/caps together with the endoscope as a set or tracking the individual valve/cap to the patient and the procedure", with the societies stating "we had successfully explained the impracticality of the third recommended option" yet it remains. It also states, "The standard supports marketing of cleaning verification assays for duodenoscopes" with claims to "(1) measure bacteria on reprocessed endoscopes, or (2) verify that a reprocessed endoscope is safe, or (3) assure proper high-level disinfection or sterilization", and that "such claims are considered illegal by the FDA as no such assays have received 510(k) clearance". Lastly, "The GI societies proposed for the normative section of the standard that endoscope culture and repair history should accompany loaned endoscopes" but "This was moved and then included in the formative section".
