## Question

Metatarsalgia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about metatarsalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining metatarsalgia and its core etiologies. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially the role of weight-bearing radiographs and when to escalate to ultrasound or MRI. Next, I will review common causes and how to distinguish them clinically and radiologically. After that, I need to appraise conservative management, including footwear, orthoses, and injections, and check the strength of evidence. Then, I will examine surgical options and their outcomes, including plantar plate repair and metatarsal osteotomies. Finally, I should consider special populations, summarize a practical algorithm, and highlight evidence gaps and safety considerations, ensuring I cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't anchor prematurely. Metatarsalgia denotes forefoot pain localized to the plantar aspect of the metatarsal heads, typically the second through fourth rays, and often reflects static foot disorders, biomechanical overload, or specific pathologies such as stress fractures, Morton neuroma, plantar plate tears, bursitis, and sesamoid disorders, with prevalence around 10% in the general population and higher in older adults due to age-related biomechanical changes [^6a1dcfe8] [^e69cd1e9].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic foundation before discussing imaging. Weight-bearing radiographs are the essential first step to assess foot statics, metatarsal lengths, intermetatarsal angles, and alignment, and to screen for bony pathology; this is consistently emphasized in contemporary radiology reviews and aligns with best practice for mechanical forefoot pain evaluation [^6a1dcfe8] [^e69cd1e9] [^a8c7c24f]. I should double-check the escalation pathway: if radiographs are negative or equivocal and clinical suspicion remains for soft-tissue etiologies such as Morton neuroma, plantar plate injury, bursitis, or sesamoiditis, MRI is the gold standard, while ultrasound is complementary and enables dynamic assessment; the ACR Appropriateness Criteria explicitly recommend MRI in chronic metatarsalgia when these entities are suspected after negative or equivocal radiographs [^e69cd1e9] [^cd578b87].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes without categorizing them. The most common etiologies include static/mechanical disorders (hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, pes cavus, pes planus, metatarsal length abnormalities), soft-tissue entities (intermetatarsal or subcapitellar bursitis, Morton neuroma, plantar plate tears with second ray syndrome), bony overload (stress fractures, Freiberg infarction), and systemic/inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, crystal arthropathy), with stress fractures and neuroma/plantar plate pathology frequently implicated in practice [^6a1dcfe8] [^77d6977e] [^e69cd1e9]. I need to ensure I keep a broad differential because patients often have overlapping pathology, which can confound a single-diagnosis approach [^fbd01b97].

> Let me consider stress fractures carefully, since missing them delays healing. Stress fractures of the second and third metatarsal shafts are common, radiographs can be negative early, and MRI shows marrow edema with a low-signal fracture line; ultrasound can detect periosteal thickening and cortical irregularity early, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in athletes and those with abrupt load changes and focal tenderness [^6bafb0ca]. I should confirm management implications: prompt offloading is critical to prevent progression, and this is repeatedly emphasized in radiology guidance for metatarsalgia workups [^14b88d43].

> Next, I should review Morton neuroma and plantar plate pathology, and I need to check the imaging signatures. Morton neuroma appears as a hypoechoic mass in the intermetatarsal space on ultrasound and shows a dumbbell-shaped ovoid lesion on MRI with variable enhancement; dynamic ultrasound with Mulder maneuver improves detection, and MRI helps distinguish neuroma from bursitis and define extent when surgery is planned [^89eccd4a] [^d72bd2ca]. For plantar plate tears and second ray syndrome, ultrasound can demonstrate dorsal subluxation and plate disruption dynamically, while MRI delineates the extent of tear and associated synovitis; recognizing this spectrum prevents mislabeling as isolated neuroma and guides targeted treatment [^f63298a9] [^79b93b05].

> I will now examine conservative management, but I should confirm the strength of evidence. Footwear modification with wide toe boxes, metatarsal pads placed just proximal to the metatarsal heads, and activity modification are foundational; metatarsal pad position matters, with optimal pressure relief when the pad's peak pressure sits just proximal to the metatarsal head, and this has been shown in pressure-mapping studies [^57f37c52]. Custom or prefabricated orthoses can offload focal pressure and improve function, and in inflammatory arthritis cohorts, combining insoles with silicone toe orthoses yields better pain and disability outcomes than insoles alone, though much of the orthotic literature remains low quality and heterogeneous [^5765e2ca]. For Morton neuroma, corticosteroid injections can provide short-term relief, but I should remember that concomitant mechanical metatarsalgia increases recurrence risk after alcohol ablation, so addressing biomechanics is essential to durable results [^70a0b11a].

> But wait, what about injectable fillers for plantar fat pad atrophy or high-heeled shoe pain. Small open-label studies suggest hyaluronic acid fillers under the metatarsal heads can improve pain and prolong comfortable wear time in women with metatarsalgia from high heels, with good tolerability and no serious adverse events reported; however, these are uncontrolled, small studies without comparator arms, so I should frame this as promising but low-certainty evidence pending RCTs and regulatory clarity [^2a2e3d24] [^4b161d24] [^83c80460]. I should also note that collagen fillers have been reported unsuccessful in case format, underscoring the need for caution and product-specific data [^e5e9f100].

> Next, I should review surgical options and outcomes, and I need to ensure I distinguish indications. For recalcitrant plantar plate tears with instability, direct plantar plate repair yields predictable improvements in pain and function at up to 2 years, with pooled VAS reductions around 5 points and AOFAS improvements near 40 points in meta-analysis; combining Weil osteotomy with plate repair appears superior to Weil plus PIP arthrodesis for severe instability, with higher rates of complete pain relief and fewer transfer lesions [^598f565a] [^9b32d609]. For isolated metatarsal overload without plate pathology, metatarsal shortening osteotomies can be effective when precisely executed; oblique sliding osteotomies and minimally invasive techniques report high pain relief and low transfer rates, though I should confirm that metatarsal length alone does not reliably predict plantar pressure, arguing for careful surgical planning rather than length-only dogma [^2c65da7d] [^9c02c171] [^1c00a2a5]. For Morton neuroma refractory to conservative care, both open neurectomy and percutaneous decompression with ligament release achieve high satisfaction, with some data suggesting fewer late metatarsalgia symptoms after percutaneous approaches, but I should acknowledge retrospective design limits [^db130b85].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts. In inflammatory arthritis, foot problems are highly prevalent and often persistent despite modern pharmacotherapy; multidisciplinary care with early surgical referral for refractory pain, deformity, or ulcer risk is recommended, and many recommendations remain consensus-based due to limited high-quality trials, highlighting a research gap [^aa9a8bd2] [^426d69f1]. In children and adolescents, metatarsalgia is less common and should prompt evaluation for growth plate–related entities such as Iselin disease at the fifth metatarsal base, where activity modification and offloading are typically effective [^f8d1b5a5]. For primary care, diagnostic accuracy for common foot problems varies, and many GPs prefer podiatry referral for metatarsalgia, underscoring the value of streamlined access to foot specialists and standardized pathways [^0aa9cc8c].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I should verify it aligns with evidence. Start with clinical history and exam to localize pain and identify mechanical drivers, then obtain weight-bearing radiographs to assess statics and exclude bony pathology; if radiographs are unrevealing and suspicion persists for soft-tissue etiologies, proceed to ultrasound for neuroma or dynamic instability and MRI for plantar plate, bursitis, sesamoid, or occult fracture; initiate conservative therapy with footwear, metatarsal pads, activity modification, and orthoses; consider corticosteroid injection for neuroma or bursitis; and reserve surgery for refractory cases, selecting plantar plate repair for instability, targeted metatarsal osteotomy for overload, or neurectomy/decompression for persistent neuroma, with preoperative imaging guiding approach selection [^6a1dcfe8] [^e69cd1e9] [^cd578b87]. I should confirm that this staged approach matches both radiology and surgical literature and that it emphasizes nonoperative care first, which it does [^6a1dcfe8] [^598f565a].

> Finally, I need to highlight evidence gaps and safety. High-quality RCTs are sparse for many conservative and surgical interventions, particularly in inflammatory arthritis and for emerging modalities like HA fillers; guideline statements repeatedly call for larger, methodologically robust trials to define effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and clinicians should communicate this uncertainty when counseling patients [^ec5d2389] [^646dd116]. I should also remind myself to screen for red flags such as infection, malignancy, or vascular compromise when the presentation is atypical or refractory, and to coordinate care across podiatry, orthopedics, radiology, and rheumatology to optimize outcomes and minimize delays in definitive management [^6a1dcfe8] [^e69cd1e9].

Metatarsalgia is **forefoot pain under the metatarsal heads** [^6a1dcfe8], most often from mechanical overload, faulty biomechanics, or specific pathologies such as Morton neuroma, plantar plate tears, stress fractures, or sesamoid disorders [^77d6977e]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with weight-bearing radiographs to assess alignment and exclude bony pathology; ultrasound or MRI is reserved for persistent or unclear cases to detect soft-tissue lesions [^cd578b87] [^e69cd1e9]. First-line management is **conservative**: footwear modification, metatarsal pads, orthoses, activity change, and NSAIDs; corticosteroid injections are used selectively [^a5574171]. Surgery is considered for refractory cases, with plantar plate repair or metatarsal osteotomies tailored to the cause and showing favorable outcomes [^598f565a] [^9b32d609]. Prognosis is **generally good** with conservative care, but recurrence is common without addressing biomechanics or footwear [^f16c2ebc].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Metatarsalgia arises from **multiple factors**:

- **Mechanical overload**: Excessive pressure from high heels, tight shoes, or prolonged standing [^858dfd16].
- **Biomechanical abnormalities**: Hallux valgus, hammertoes, pes planus/cavus, or metatarsal length discrepancies [^58845df6] [^fd34baf0].
- **Specific pathologies**: Morton neuroma, plantar plate tears, stress fractures, sesamoiditis, bursitis, or osteoarthritis [^77d6977e] [^89eccd4a].
- **Systemic conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, or obesity [^aa9a8bd2].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically report:

- **Pain**: Under the metatarsal heads, worsened by weight-bearing or shoes [^6a1dcfe8].
- **Sensations**: Burning, aching, or "walking on a pebble" [^0affa0a9].
- **Associated features**: Calluses, corns, or toe deformities (hammertoes, bunions) [^fd34baf0].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment includes a focused **history** covering footwear, activity, and comorbidities, and a **physical exam** with palpation, range of motion, and provocative tests (Mulder's, Lachman's) [^89eccd4a].

---

### Imaging

- **Weight-bearing radiographs**: First-line to assess alignment, metatarsal length, and exclude bony pathology [^6a1dcfe8] [^a8c7c24f].
- **Ultrasound**: For soft-tissue lesions (neuroma, bursitis, plantar plate tears) [^89eccd4a].
- **MRI**: Gold standard for complex or refractory cases (plantar plate, stress fractures, sesamoid disorders) [^e69cd1e9] [^cd578b87].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line** and effective for most patients:

- **Footwear modification**: Wide toe box, low heels, cushioned soles [^a5574171].
- **Orthotic devices**: Metatarsal pads, arch supports, custom orthoses [^57f37d52].
- **Activity modification**: Reduce high-impact activities, weight loss [^a5574171].
- **Medications**: NSAIDs, topical analgesics [^a5574171].
- **Injections**: Corticosteroids for neuroma or bursitis; hyaluronic acid fillers for fat-pad atrophy (limited evidence) [^89eccd4a] [^2a2e3d24].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** or specific pathologies:

| **Procedure** | **Indication** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Plantar plate repair | Plantar plate tear, second ray syndrome | High success, pain relief, function improvement [^598f565a] |
| Weil osteotomy | Metatarsal overload, transfer lesions | Good pain relief, low recurrence [^2c65da7d] |
| Morton neuroma excision | Refractory neuroma | High satisfaction, low recurrence [^db130b85] |
| Sesamoidectomy | Persistent sesamoiditis | Effective for refractory cases [^notfound] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with conservative care, but recurrence is common without ongoing footwear/orthotic use or biomechanical correction. Surgical outcomes are good when appropriately selected, though complications such as transfer lesions or stiffness can occur [^f16c2ebc] [^598f565a].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **proper footwear**, weight management, and foot-strengthening exercises. Early intervention for deformities (e.g. hallux valgus) helps reduce metatarsal overload [^a5574171] [^5ebdcaf1].

---

Metatarsalgia is a common forefoot pain syndrome with **mechanical drivers**; most patients improve with conservative care, while surgery is reserved for refractory or specific lesions. Accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy — especially footwear and biomechanics — are key to durable relief [^6a1dcfe8].

### Metatarsalgia [^f16c2ebc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Metatarsalgia (ie, metatarsal pain) is one of the most common reports in patients with foot problems. This pain is confined to the area across the plantar forefoot, including the second through fourth metatarsal heads. However, it is frequently accompanied by deformity of the first and fifth rays as well as of the toes. There is great variability in possible causative factors, but all of them seem to be related to gait mechanics, foot anatomy, and foot and ankle deformity. An individualized treatment protocol is required. Nonsurgical management is usually sufficient to achieve satisfactory results. Surgical correction must be precise, and all pain-producing deformities must be corrected. Most patients present with abnormalities of the distal metatarsals. Metatarsal osteotomy, long a staple of treatment, always fails in the long term. Improved equipment and internal fixation methods may lead to better long-term outcomes.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: an educational review [^6a1dcfe8]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metatarsalgia refers to pain in the forefoot, encompassing the metatarsal region, metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ), intermetatarsal space, and the soft tissues beneath the metatarsals, regardless of the underlying cause. The forefoot is commonly reported as the most frequent site of foot pain, affecting approximately 10% of the general population, with the prevalence rising in older adults due to age-related biomechanical changes.

The vast majority of metatarsalgia results from static disorders related to the architecture of the forefoot. Clinical history along with a thorough physical examination typically helps to narrow the differential diagnosis. However, imaging is essential for definitive diagnosis and appropriate management.

The aim of this educational review is to provide an overview of the primary imaging modalities and then to comprehensively detail the main causes of metatarsalgia.

### Metatarsalgia [^77d6977e]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Although causes of metatarsalgia are multifactorial, in practice these most commonly include osseous stress reaction or fracture (including subchondral injury) and interdigital neuroma or plantar plate tear with adjacent pseudoneuroma. The various roles of radiography, ultrasonography, and MR imaging are discussed, and relevant technical issues and imaging findings are reviewed in order to facilitate accurate diagnosis and guide proper treatment of metatarsalgia.

Conclusion

Metatarsalgia is common and usually results from foot static disorders. Weight-bearing radiographs are essential and often sufficient for etiological diagnosis. However, the US with its advantage of enabling dynamic maneuvers and good clinical correlation, along with MRI, which allows for the most precise study of the anatomical structures of the forefoot, collectively provide further diagnostic precision and subsequently guide management.

Some pathologies, such as stress fractures, should not be missed because of the need for rapid offloading. Common pathologies such as bursitis, Morton’s neuroma and second ray disorders are often the result of a chain reaction of static disorders. As far as treatment is concerned, in addition to podiatric treatment with foot orthoses, interventional radiology techniques and in particular corticosteroid infiltrations offer promising prospects before considering surgical intervention.

### The use of collagen injections in the treatment of metatarsalgia: a case report [^e5e9f100]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Metatarsalgia is an increasingly common condition seen in the outpatient setting. A number of conservative and surgical management options are available for this condition. We present an interesting case that was unsuccessfully treated with'dermal filler.' To our knowledge, we have not found any published material in peer-reviewed journals documenting the use of collagen injections in the treatment of metatarsalgia. The authors feel that the lesson learned from this case should be highlighted for other foot and ankle surgeons.

### MR imaging and ultrasound of metatarsalgia – the lesser metatarsals [^fbd01b97]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Metatarsalgia is a common problem for many in the community. The condition includes many different entities, such as interdigital neuroma, synovitis or metatarsophalangeal joint instability, Freiberg infarction, stress fractures, and systemic disorders. Many patients presenting with metatarsalgia have a combination of diagnostic abnormalities. The key is to establish the principal pathology and from there construct an appropriate treatment regimen.

Abstract

Metatarsalgia, characterized by forefoot pain, is frequent and is primarily due to foot static disorders. Initial evaluation with weight-bearing radiographs is essential, allowing precise analysis of the architecture of the foot. Ultrasound is useful for soft tissue and tendon examination and provides the best clinical correlation. Computed Tomography provides detailed bone assessment and is helpful for pre-operative planning. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is the gold standard modality, offering superior soft tissue contrast. The common causes of metatarsalgia include hallux pathologies (hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, and sesamoid issues), bursitis (intermetatarsal and subcapitellar), Morton’s neuroma, second ray syndrome, stress fractures, and systemic pathologies affecting the foot. Combining clinical and imaging data is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management of metatarsalgia. Post-traumatic causes of metatarsalgia are beyond the scope of this article and will not be described.

### Variation in diagnosis and management of common foot problems by GPs [^0aa9cc8c]. Family Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There are indications that the diagnosis and management of common foot problems vary widely in general practice.

Objectives

Our aim was to explore the variation of GPs' diagnosis and management of common foot problems and the possible correlation between GPs' characteristics and their competence to diagnose correctly.

Methods

In a cross-sectional design, 90 GPs in The Netherlands were invited to complete a questionnaire regarding seven vignettes with common foot problems (hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, fasciitis plantaris, tarsal tunnel syndrome, metatarsalgia, corns and calluses, and rheumatoid arthritis), combined with questions covering diagnoses, management options and some GP characteristics.

Results

A total of 72 GPs responded (80%). They most often diagnosed hallux valgus (79%) and rheumatoid arthritis (86%) correctly, and most often hallux rigidus (37%) and tarsal tunnel syndrome (74%) incorrectly. GP characteristics did not correlate with their competence in diagnosing. The most frequently suggested management was referral to a podiatrist. The referral rate to medical specialists was low, except in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (79%).

Conclusions

More than half of the GPs were competent in diagnosing vignettes of common foot problems. This diagnostic competence showed great variation and was not associated independently with GP characteristics. Educational programmes are recommended. Management showed less variation and often included referral to podiatrists. Further research into the effectiveness of specific treatments for different foot problems is recommended.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^858dfd16]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Metatarsalgia or forefoot plantar pain is a common overuse injury with increased stress over the metatarsal head region. Affected individuals typically present with a gradual onset of pain in the forefoot (at 1 or more metatarsal heads) or radiation to the midfoot (cuboid, navicular, and cuneiform bones and the surrounding soft tissues); the pain is exacerbated by walking or running. Habitual use of high-heeled shoes is a common cause of metatarsalgia in women because high heels transfer extra weight and pressure to the forefoot, and cushioning of the fat pad is deteriorated. –

Previous studies on treating metatarsalgia with filler injections include a case report describing the unsuccessful treatment of metatarsalgia with collagen injections.Silicone injections have been successfully used as a soft filler to provide cushioning of the ball of the foot by mechanical supplementation of the plantar fat pad. Although there was no evidence of significant adverse response over long-term clinical follow-up of over 1,500 patients,no silicone product for soft-tissue augmentation has been approved by the US FDA because of safety concerns since silicone fillers cannot easily be removed in case of an adverse event.

### Forefoot: a basic integrated imaging perspective for radiologists [^fdbcdd9f]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging of the forefoot is increasingly requested for patients with metatarsalgia. Awareness with specific anatomic arrangements exclusive for the forefoot and widely variable pathologic entities associated with metatarsalgia helps the radiologist to tailor a cost-effective imaging approach. This will enable reaching a specific diagnosis as much as possible with subsequent proper patient management. This pictorial review aims to provide basic understanding for the different imaging modalities used in studying the forefoot. After that, certain anatomic arrangements exclusive for the forefoot are discussed. The final section of this review describes the imaging findings of some common forefoot problems.

### Treatment of lesser metatarsophalangeal joint instability with plantar plate repair: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^598f565a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Recognition of metatarsophalangeal joint plantar plate injuries has improved over time as the condition has become more widely understood and identified. With the diagnosis of a plantar plate injury as a subset of metatarsalgia becoming more common place, there are multiple surgical options that have been utilized to address the condition. Direct repair of the plantar plate has emerged as the treatment of choice for foot surgeons with a tendency to favor a direct dorsal approach for the repair. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines, to determine the magnitude of change that can be expected in visual analog scale pain and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores postoperatively. A total of 12 studies involving 537 plantar plate tears were included who underwent direct repair of the plantar plate through either a dorsal (10 articles) or plantar approach (2 articles). Summary estimates were calculated which revealed improvement in visual analog scale pain (pooled mean change of -5.01 [95%CI -5.36, -4.66] pre-to postoperative) and improvement in American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society scores (pooled postoperative mean improvement 40.44 [95%CI 37.90, 42.97]) of patients within the included studies. Random effects models were used for summary estimates. I 2 statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity. We concluded there is a predictable level of improvement in pain and function in patients undergoing a direct dorsal approach plantar plate repair with follow-up out to 2 years.

### An innovative method for plantar plate repair: technique guide and case report [^24a32014]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Disruption of the plantar plate is a common cause of forefoot pain, metatarsalgia, and metatarsophalangeal joint malalignment. Although surgical repair of the plantar plate has improved, there has been no consensus on the clinical superiority of any single technique, or combination of techniques, described in the literature to date. In this publication, we report a case of plantar plate injury treated with an innovative new technique with 20-month follow-up.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: an educational review [^7b642032]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The dorsoplantar view of the foot reveals an enlargement of the metatarsophalangeal angle (angle M1–P1 > 15°) and a varus of M1 (angle M1–M2 > 10°).

The subluxation of the sesamoids is assessed both on the frontal and the sesamoid views. This last incidence may also reveal a hypoplasia of the crest in favor of the congenital origin of the deformity and osteoarthritis between sesamoid and metatarsal head.

The lateral view can reveal a flatfoot and dorsal dislocation of P1.

Moreover, radiographs allow for the evaluation of lateral osteoarthritis of the first MTPJ, microtraumatic changes to the medial aspect of the head of M1, and medial capital exostosis.

MRI and CT scan are not necessary for a simple hallux valgus. However, they may be indicated in order to assess the bone or adjacent soft tissues.

Medical treatment is limited to physical therapy, footwear advice, and orthotic use. Surgical treatment aims to realign the big toe, correct deformities, and relieve related pain. Conservative surgery typically involves metatarsal and phalangeal osteotomies, while joint fusion is reserved for severe or recurrent cases, especially in cases of advanced arthritic hallux valgus.

Metatarsalgia secondary to a disorder of foot statics

Hallux pathologies

Hallux valgus

Hallux valgus is the most prevalent pathology of the forefoot. It is most often secondary but congenital in 25% of cases. The risk factors are female gender, wearing narrow shoes with heels, an Egyptian-type foot, and a valgus flatfoot. It results from a triple deformity: lateral deviation of the proximal phalanx (P1) of the hallux in relation to the first metatarsal (M1), a medial deviation of the tip of M1 (metatarsus varus), pronation of the hallux on its axis.

The imaging reference assessment is based on the standard weight-bearing radiographs of the foot (Fig. 2).

### Sagittal chevron shortening osteotomy with lateral wedge for treatment of lesser metatarsal overload: a case report [^21d6dcdc]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Metatarsalgia is a common problem that refers to the tenderness and pain beneath the forefoot. Many metatarsal shortening osteotomies have been described to alleviate metatarsal overload; however, these osteotomies have been associated with a high complication rate of floating toe deformity. We present a case study that describes an innovative technique for the treatment of lesser metatarsalgia that allows for the repositioning of the metatarsal head, using a stable screw fixation designed to minimize the common complication of the floating toe.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^2a2e3d24]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND

Metatarsalgia is a common overuse injury that may be caused by wearing high-heeled shoes.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the decrease in metatarsalgia using a hyaluronic acid dermal filler.

METHODS

A 6-month, open study was conducted in 15 subjects with metatarsalgia because of regularly wearing high-heeled shoes. Hyaluronic acid (20 mg/mL) with lidocaine hydrochloride (3 mg/mL) was injected under the metatarsal heads at baseline. Pain (on a 0–10 scale) under the metatarsal heads when walking in high heels was recorded in a weekly subject diary.

RESULTS

At 6 months after injections, 5 subjects (33.3%) reported no metatarsalgia pain. For subjects with pain, they were able to wear high heels for significantly longer than before the injections (7.2 hours at 6 months vs 3.4 hours at baseline). Significant improvements from baseline were observed at Month 6 for time to onset of pain (3.5 hours longer), time between onset of pain and intolerable pain (1.9 hours longer), and pain sensation (−2.2 grades at onset and −3.8 grades at shoe removal). No adverse events were reported.

CONCLUSION

Injection of hyaluronic acid filler to the forefeet provided a significant effective, long-lasting, and well-tolerated improvement in metatarsalgia because of wearing high-heeled shoes.

Systemic pathologies

Septic arthritis

Arthritis may involve the MTP joints (Fig S2). Septic arthritis of the MTP joints is most commonly seen in diabetic patients and is caused by the spread of infection from an adjacent soft tissue or bone source. Imaging findings include increased joint fluid and synovitis.

MRI can reveal edematous signal modifications with low signal intensity within the bone marrow on T1-weighted images, increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and contrast enhancement post-gadolinium. These findings are non-specific and may also be seen in degenerative, inflammatory, crystal arthropathy, or systemic diseases, especially if multiple joints are involved. Arthritis can progress to osteomyelitis, in which case MRI may reveal marrow replacement (very low T1 signal, high T2 signal, and contrast enhancement after gadolinium), along with potential periosteal reaction, cortical disruption, or even abscess formation.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^a6f6ba4e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Metatarsalgia is a common overuse injury that may be caused by wearing high-heeled shoes.

Objective

To evaluate the decrease in metatarsalgia using a hyaluronic acid dermal filler.

Methods

A 6-month, open study was conducted in 15 subjects with metatarsalgia because of regularly wearing high-heeled shoes. Hyaluronic acid (20 mg/mL) with lidocaine hydrochloride (3 mg/mL) was injected under the metatarsal heads at baseline. Pain (on a 0-10 scale) under the metatarsal heads when walking in high heels was recorded in a weekly subject diary.

Results

At 6 months after injections, 5 subjects (33.3%) reported no metatarsalgia pain. For subjects with pain, they were able to wear high heels for significantly longer than before the injections (7.2 hours at 6 months vs 3.4 hours at baseline). Significant improvements from baseline were observed at Month 6 for time to onset of pain (3.5 hours longer), time between onset of pain and intolerable pain (1.9 hours longer), and pain sensation (-2.2 grades at onset and -3.8 grades at shoe removal). No adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

Injection of hyaluronic acid filler to the forefeet provided a significant effective, long-lasting, and well-tolerated improvement in metatarsalgia because of wearing high-heeled shoes.

### Surgical treatment of metatarsalgia and severe instability of lesser metatarsophalangeal joints [^9b32d609]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The main object of this prospective cohort study was to compare surgical treatment options for primary metatarsalgia and the severe instability of lesser metatarsophalangeal joints. The outcomes of triple Weil osteotomy combined with direct plantar plate repair and triple Weil osteotomy, performed with proximal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis, are analyzed and compared. One hundred thirteen patients (117 feet) were enrolled in the study. They were split into 2 groups. In the first group, undergoing Weil osteotomy, combined with the plantar plate repair, good results, including complete pain reduction, elimination of hyperkeratosis, and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score improvement, were achieved in 84.7% of the cases. The second group, where the combination of Weil osteotomy and proximal interphalangeal joint K-wire arthrodesis was used, demonstrated good results in 52.4% of the cases. Weil osteotomy, combined with the plantar plate repair, achieves better results in comparison to osteotomy, performed with the interphalangeal joint arthrodesis.

### Endoscopic debridement for treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: an Innovative technique and prospective study of 46 consecutive Patients [^dc01dc54]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one the most common pathologies treated by foot and ankle surgeons. When nonoperative therapy fails, surgical intervention might be warranted. Various surgical procedures are available for the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. The most common surgical management typically consists of open versus endoscopic plantar fascia release. Comorbidities associated with the release of the plantar fascia have been documented, including lateral column overload and metatarsalgia. We present an innovative technique for this painful condition that is minimally invasive, allows visualization of the plantar fascia, and maintains the integrity of the fascia. Our hypothesis was that the use of endoscopic debridement of the plantar fascia with or without heel spur resection would provide a minimally invasive technique with acceptable patient outcomes.

Stress fractures

Stress fractures result from an imbalance between bone strength and mechanical stress, constituting the primary bony cause of metatarsalgia. Athletes, particularly runners and military recruits, are prone to fatigue fractures due to the excessive load on normal bone. It begins with bone stress injury, which refers to the bone’s inability to endure repetitive loading, leading to structural fatigue and localized pain and tenderness. This stress reaction can progress to a stress fracture and eventually result in a complete bone fracture. Insufficiency fractures occur due to typical loads on the bone that have been demineralized. They are more prevalent in women and elderly patients.

Metatarsal stress fractures frequently involve the middle and distal thirds of the diaphyses of the second and third rays. Much more rarely, this type of injury involves the cephalic subchondral bone plate.

Initial radiographs may yield negative results for up to two to three weeks. Detectable features include cortical fracture lines or the formation of callus (Fig. 9).

Morton’s neuroma

Morton’s neuroma corresponds to intra- and perineural fibrosis of the common plantar nerve at the level of its bifurcation. Nerve entrapment is considered the primary cause of Morton’s neuroma, in association with microtrauma and ischemia. Risk factors include increased weight bearing, high heels, and foot arch anomalies. It typically occurs in middle-aged women. Clinical manifestations include acute pain between the metatarsal heads, occasionally described as an electric shock, which is alleviated upon shoe removal but worsened or replicated by applying transverse pressure on the metatarsal heads.

Diagnosis is typically established through clinical history and physical examination. However, the complexity of cases and other diagnostic considerations may require the use of clinical imaging to validate the diagnosis.

US is a highly effective modality for identifying Morton’s neuroma. It appears as a hypoechoic mass located in the plantar part of the second or third intermetatarsal space between two metatarsal heads, interrupting the hyperechoic inter-capito-metatarsal fatty column normally continuous with the subcutaneous fat (Fig. 7). The connection to the nerve can be clearly seen with the new US equipment, confirming the diagnosis without the need for an MRI scan. The neuroma may dislocate towards the sole during transverse compression of the forefoot, with a visible and clinically perceptible protrusion: “Mulder’s sonographic sign”. Unlike bursitis, the neuroma deforms but does not collapse during compression.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^4b161d24]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

All study subjects were regular wearers of high-heeled shoes who experienced pain during their daily activities while wearing high-heeled shoes before receiving the study treatment. At baseline, all subjects had the valgus foot and most subjects (86.7%) had at least 1 foot that was pes cavus. Valgus foot (pes valgus pronated foot) deformity is a condition in which the bone segment distal to a joint is angled outward, away from the midline of the body. Pes cavus is a descriptive term for a foot morphology characterized by high arch of the foot that can cause increased weight bearing for the metatarsal heads and associated metatarsalgia and callosities.

At 3 months after a single-injection session comprising an average of 6.2 injections and totaling 1.3 mL of HA filler for both feet, one-third of subjects reported no pain at all and this was maintained at 6 months after injections. Furthermore, even for those subjects still experiencing pain while wearing high-heeled shoes at 6 months after injections, there was a statistically significant reduction in pain (at onset and at shoe removal) and significant increase in mean total time of wearing high-heeled shoes (7.2 hours vs 3.4 hours at baseline).

Furthermore, relieving the pressure under the metatarsal heads by cushioning with HA filler injections led to a reduction in the number and severity of calluses with the mean number of callosities per subject decreasing from 1.9 at baseline to 1.0 at Month 6, by which time no subject had Grade 3 callosities. There can be multiple causative factors that lead to the development of metatarsalgia. One or more of the metatarsal heads may become painful and/or inflamed, usually because of excessive pressure from poorly fitting footwear, such as high-heeled shoes and other restrictive footwear, as well as atrophy of the metatarsal fat pad. Although corns and calluses are not usually a cause of metatarsalgia, the repeated friction and pressure that caused the metatarsalgia can also lead to the development of callosities, which are relatively thick, toughened areas of skin that may become painful after an extended period. Hence, it may be expected that by treating the metatarsalgia with filler injections and thus eliminating the source of friction or pressure, the callosities would also disappear.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^9182ef9a]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Volume restoration of the plantar pad with a single-injection session of HA dermal filler under the metatarsal heads provides a nonsurgical, long-lasting, well-tolerated, and efficient treatment to alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with metatarsalgia because of wearing high-heeled shoes. In addition to pain assessments, further baropodometric experiments are warranted to provide objective evidence of changes in pressure to corroborate these promising results and an important area for future research is to study other fillers.

### Resolution of metatarsalgia following oblique osteotomy [^2c65da7d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Metatarsalgia of the central ray is a major surgical challenge. Without precise correction, transfer lesions may occur at an adjacent metatarsal or patients may have inadequate pain relief. Current surgical treatment strategies do not facilitate precise positioning in different planes, resulting in disappointing outcomes. To achieve better outcomes we used an oblique sliding osteotomy to facilitate precise correction. We hypothesized the procedure would reduce pain in patients with prominent second and/or third metatarsal heads, with few complications. We retrospectively reviewed 32 consecutive patients with 42 osteotomies of the lesser metatarsal bones. The mean and median ages at the time of surgery were 49 and 54 years, respectively, with a minimum followup of 26 months. Thirty-one patients (97%) had relief of plantar pain. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score was 82.4 points. We identified no transfer lesions. The median time to radiographic union was 10 weeks. Although time to bony union can be extended, the oblique sliding osteotomy facilitates intraoperative adjustment to provide the precise positioning critical to eliminating plantar pain.

Sesamoid pathologies

These bones are subject to numerous stresses, both static and dynamic. In this respect, they may be involved in traumatic or microtraumatic pathologies.

Sesamoiditis is a painful inflammatory condition resulting from repetitive injury to the plantar aspect of the forefoot. It corresponds to the edematous stage of sesamoid pathology. Diagnosis may be suspected in the US but is more easily made on MRI. US may reveal infiltration of the adjacent soft tissues, and hyperemia on Doppler imaging with elective pain on examination. Sesamoid bone marrow edema is visible through decreased or normal signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 4). Reactive soft-tissue abnormalities such as tendinitis, synovitis, and bursitis are typically associated findings.

With persistent offending factors, a fracture can occur. Diagnosis must be made early in order to avoid necrosis. Radiographs can reveal fracture lines, separate fragments, periosteal reaction (old fracture). It can be suspected with US findings, (correlated with specific clinical features), revealing a cortical step-off but it is above all CT and MRI that enable it to be diagnosed early.

Osteonecrosis is more common in women and affects both the medial and lateral sesamoids. The US may reveal an irregular appearance of the affected sesamoid with infiltration of the soft tissues. A condensed or fragmented appearance can be seen on the radiographs or CT scan (Fig. 3). On T1-weighted MR images, the necrotic sesamoid appears hyposignal. On fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, the sesamoid is hypersignal during the edematous phase, whereas it is hyposignal in the necrotic phase.

Second ray syndrome (Fig. 8)

It corresponds to instability of the second MTPJ, arising from distension and subsequent rupture of the plantar plate, exacerbated by pre-existing degenerative lesions of the plantar plate. This is favored by various conditions leading to an increased stress of the second MTPJ including a short first metatarsal, hallux valgus, an elongated second metatarsal, metatarsal verticalization (hollow foot, high heels), repetitive trauma to the forefoot, and iatrogenic factors (corticosteroid injections).

Fig. 8 
Second ray syndrome in a 34-year-old woman presenting with pain between the first and second intermetatarsal spaces for two months. US in sagittal plantar view (A) shows plantar plate irregularity (arrowheads), synovitis, and effusion of the 2nd MTP. Sagittal fat-suppressed T2-weighted MR image (B) shows rupture of the plantar plate (short arrow), with dorsal subluxation of P1, metatarsophalangeal synovitis with subchondral bone hypersignal of the head of the second metatarsal on its plantar side (star). Second ray syndrome in a 70-year-old man in terminal phase. Radiograph in lateral view (C) and sagittal MR image in T2-weighted (D) show dorsal dislocation of P1 (long arrows)

The progression of this syndrome typically unfolds in different phases. In initial phase, instability of the second toe is associated with early damage to the plantar plate (simple painful phase). In state phase, subluxation or reversible dislocation of the second toe occurs due to elongation or even plantar plate rupture. In terminal phase, fixed dorsal dislocation of the base of P1 on the second metatarsal head results from plate rupture.

Radiographics are of little use in the early stages of the disease. They may show deviation of the proximal phalanx of the second ray in the early stage. Sagittal instability is best seen on a dorso-plantar view with pseudo-pinching of the joint space.

The US is the examination of choice. Dynamic dorsal dislocation maneuvers help to identify early instability. It may reveal a dorsal subluxation of P1, a lesion of the plantar plate, which may be thinned, partially or completely ruptured. Associated signs like synovitis and effusion of the second MTPJ and tenosynovitis of the flexor muscles of the second ray may be found. They can even precede plantar plate abnormalities.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: an educational review [^79b93b05]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

MRI can also be used to visualize signal abnormalities of the plantar plate (loss of homogeneity with areas of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, thinning, rupture), dorsal subluxation of P1, arthropathy of the second MTPJ and tenosynovitis of the tendons of the flexor muscles. However, it can be particularly challenging in MRI to detect early stages. Indeed, the presence of a physiologic small area of non-fluid hypersignal at the distal attachment of the plantar plate, visible in T2-weighted images may be confusing as it is difficult to distinguish this from a partial lesion.

Plantar venous thrombosis

Plantar vein thrombosis impacts the deep plantar veins, presenting with non-specific localized pain in the plantar foot, swelling, and a sensation of fullness, it is often underdiagnosed. The lateral plantar vein is affected in most of the cases. US is the method of choice for diagnosis, it can show loss of compressibility and venous enlargement, intraluminal content, and perivascular edema with local tenderness. MRI shows perivascular edema and enhancement, intraluminal signal change and venous enlargement, presence of collateral veins, and venous filling defects in post-gadolinium injection images (Fig. 12).

### Comparative effectiveness of treatment options for plantar heel pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^e779b0ad]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of current treatment options for plantar heel pain (PHP).

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Database, Web of Science and WHO Clinical Trials Platform were searched from their inception until January 2018.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with PHP investigating common treatments (ie, corticosteroid injection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, therapeutic exercise, orthoses and/or extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)) compared with each other or a no treatment, placebo/sham control.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Data were extracted and checked for accuracy and completeness by pairs of reviewers. Primary outcomes were pain and function. Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random effects NMA in the short term, medium term and long term. Relative ranking of treatments was assessed by surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities (0-100 scale).

Results

Thirty-one RCTs (total n=2450patients) were included. There was no evidence of inconsistency detected between direct and indirect treatment comparisons in the networks, but sparse data led to frequently wide CIs. Available evidence does not suggest that any of the commonly used treatments for the management of PHP are better than any other, although corticosteroid injections, alone or in combination with exercise, and ESWT were ranked most likely to be effective for the management of short-term, medium-term and long-term pain or function; placebo/sham/control appeared least likely to be effective; and exercise appeared to only be beneficial for long-term pain or function.

Conclusions

Current evidence is equivocal regarding which treatment is the most effective for the management of PHP. Given limited understanding of long-term effects, there is need for large, methodologically robust multicentre RCTs investigating and directly comparing commonly used treatments for the management of PHP.

Other causes of heel pain (Pathway 4)—Although less common, benign and malignant tumors, infection (soft tissue and bone), and vascular compromise must be considered as etiologies of a patient’s heel pain, and the potential morbidity of these conditions is substantial. Proper diagnostic testing along with consultation or referral to the appropriate specialist are paramount in these individuals. In adolescents, calcaneal apophysitis is probably the most frequent etiology of heel pain, and palliative treatment is successful in nearly all cases.

Then, if there is a suspicion of metatarsal stress fracture you can add axial T1 and T2 FS in the plane of the metatarsals. If there is a suspicion of second-ray syndrome, a fine-centered sagittal DP FS sequence can be added.

Contrast injection is rarely required but can help differentiate Morton’s neuroma from a soft-tissue mass or assess suspected inflammatory rheumatism, bone tumors, or soft-tissue tumors. When contrast is used, post-gadolinium sagittal and coronal T1 Dixon sequences are preferred.

The use of new wrist/hand coils in MRI can significantly improve resolution if the forefoot fits within the coil. These coils also provide medial and lateral compression, mimicking Mulder’s maneuver, which is ideal for evaluating Morton’s neuromas. Additionally, they help reduce claw-like deformations during imaging.

Finally, some other imaging techniques should be mentioned including nuclear medicine techniques. Radionuclide imaging studies offer high sensitivity and provide an advantage in deducing functional information regarding bone turnover, rather than solely relying on the anatomical data. For example, scintigraphic assessment of the forefoot can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying stress fractures, arthritis or infection.

### Central metatarsalgia and walking on pebbles: beyond morton neuroma [^0affa0a9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Central metatarsalgia relates to abnormalities of the second, third, and fourth metatarsals and their respective metatarsophalangeal joints. A variety of disorders present with central forefoot pain; they range from traumatic lesions (acute or chronic repetitive), inflammatory and infective disorders, nonneoplastic soft-tissue lesions, and benign tumors to malignant lesions. Patients often present with symptoms of localized pain in the forefoot that worsens on weight bearing (walking or running), which can be sharp or dull and often is perceived as a lump felt inside or underneath the foot and described as walking on a marble or pebbles. These patients are labeled as having central metatarsalgia and are further evaluated with ultrasound or MRI to establish a diagnosis.

Conclusion

In this article, we review metatarsal and intermetatarsal lesions of the foot that present with central forefoot pain and a sensation of walking on pebbles, focusing on conditions mimicking Morton neuroma clinically or on imaging. We also briefly review some other plantar lesions and arthropathy that can present with awareness of lump underneath the foot.

### Midfoot arthritis [^e15a1313]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Midfoot arthritis is a common cause of significant pain and disability. Although the medial tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints provide < 7 degrees of sagittal plane motion, the more mobile lateral fourth and fifth TMT joints provide balance and accommodation on uneven ground. These small constrained TMT joints also provide stability and translate the forward propulsion motion of the hindfoot and ankle joint to the forefoot metatarsophalangeal joints from heel rise to toe-off. Posttraumatic degeneration is the primary cause of midfoot arthritis, although primary degeneration and inflammatory conditions can also affect this area. The result is a painful midfoot that can no longer effectively transmit load from the hindfoot to the forefoot. Shoe modifications and orthotic inserts are the mainstay of nonsurgical management. Successful management of midfoot arthritis with orthoses is predicated on achieving adequate joint stabilization while still allowing function. Surgical intervention typically involves arthrodesis of the medial midfoot, although the best treatment of the more mobile lateral column is a subject of debate.

### A comparison of two podiatric protocols for metatarsalgia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [^5765e2ca]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) forefoot involvement causes disability and metatarsalgia. Our objective was to evaluate, in RA and OA patients, the efficacy of two protocols combining insoles in polypropylene terephtalate (PPT) and custom silicone orthoses for toes on disability and metatarsalgia.

Methods

Twenty-four women (13 with OA, 11 with RA) with metatarsalgia were treated with two protocols: group A (protocol A) wore PPT insoles (T1) for 30 days and for another 30 days silicone orthosis for toes were added (T2). Group B (protocol B) wore PPT insoles and silicone orthosis (T1) for 30 days and in the following 30 days only insoles (T2). At T0, T1 and T2, pain, disability and function (Foot Function Index - FFI), pressure (KPA) and plantar contact areas (cm2) (baropodometer), and gait spatial-temporal parameters (GAITRite®) were assessed.

Results

At T0 versus T2, both protocols reduced FFI-pain, -disability and -functional limitation (p<0.05), with better results of protocol A than protocol B (p<0.05) for FFI-pain and -disability. Both protocols reduced baropodometer foot plantar pressures (p<0.001), with better results for protocol A for right foot pressures (p<0.05) and increased foot contact areas (p<0.05), with no difference between them (p=NS). Gait parameters were not significantly changed by both protocols (p=NS).

Conclusions

In patients with RA and OA with metatarsalgia, the synergic action of silicone toe orthosis and PPT insoles improves FFI, reduces foot plantar pressures and increases foot plantar contact areas. Protocol A, using firstly insoles and then adding silicone toe orthoses, is the more efficacious.

### Hammertoes: anatomy, pathophysiology, and comprehensive treatment strategies [^fd34baf0]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Hammertoe is a common foot deformity that originates from the proximal interphalangeal joint of the lesser toes. The deformity involves an imbalance between the muscles and tendons that control toe movement, leading to deformity. Hammertoes can result from various factors, including genetic predisposition, ill-fitting footwear, trauma, or underlying medical conditions such as neuromuscular disorders or diabetic neuropathy. As the deformity progresses, patients may experience pain, difficulty walking, and development of corns or calluses on the affected toes. Treatment strategies for hammertoes range from nonsurgical to surgical, depending on the severity of discomfort and effect on patient function. Nonsurgical treatment includes wearing appropriate footwear, using orthotic devices, and performing targeted exercises to strengthen and stretch affected muscles. In more advanced cases, surgical options, such as tendon transfers, joint arthrodesis, or arthroplasty, may be considered. A comprehensive understanding of hammertoe anatomy, pathophysiology, and treatment options is crucial for the effective management of this condition.

Bursitis

Intermetatarsal bursitis is a fluid collection developed between two metatarsal heads, secondary to the inflammation of a physiological adventitious bursa. This irritation may be mechanical, in most cases because of a forefoot static disorder, or secondary to inflammatory rheumatism. It is a prevalent cause of metatarsalgia, commonly linked with Morton’s neuroma and plantar plate tears. The expansion of the bursa must be more than 3 mm in transverse diameter but more importantly, it must exhibit a clinical correlation to be considered pathological.

Due to its intermetatarsal location, it is poorly accessible in the US. It can reveal a thin-walled bursa distended with hypoechoic fluid collapsing under compression and accompanied by peribursal hyperemia in acute bursitis. Chronic bursitis may exhibit a thickened bursal wall, and increased echogenic content. It can also mimic soft tissue masses or abscesses if marked synovial thickening is present. On MRI, the T1-weighted image detects mass syndrome, while the T2-weighted image aids in characterizing and distinguishing between fluid and tissue. Intermetatarsal bursitis appears hypointense on T1-weighted and fluid hyperintense on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images (Fig. 5). If gadolinium injection is performed, particularly in the case of an atypical appearance or location, peripheral enhancement may be observed.

Fig. 5 
Intermetatarsal bursitis of the third space in a 48-year-old man presenting with right fourth toe pain aggravated by prolonged standing.

MR images show a hypointense intermetatarsal mass in the T1-weighted short axis (B) and fluid hyperintense mass in the T2-weighted long and short axis (C, D) (arrows)

Subcapitellar metatarsal bursitis results from a fluid collection developed beneath a metatarsal head. The US is actually sufficient for diagnosis. In MRI, it exhibits similar signal characteristics to intercapitometatarsal bursitis but differs in location as it is subcapital (Fig. 6).

### Long-term results of the modified hoffman procedure in the rheumatoid forefoot [^014c20b2]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis commonly affects the forefoot, causing metatarsalgia, hallux valgus, and deformities of the lesser toes. Various types of surgical correction have been described, including resection of the lesser-toe metatarsal heads coupled with arthrodesis of the great toe, resection arthroplasty of the proximal phalanx or metatarsal head, and metatarsal osteotomy. We report the results at an average of five and a half years following thirty-seven consecutive forefoot arthroplasties performed in twenty patients by one surgeon using a technique involving resection of all five metatarsal heads.

Methods

All patients were treated with the same technique of resection of all five metatarsal heads through three dorsal incisions. All surviving patients were asked to return for follow-up, which included subjective assessment (with use of visual analogue pain scores, AOFAS [American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society] foot scores, and SF-12 [Short Form-12] mental and physical disability scores), physical examination, and radiographic evaluation.

Results

All results were satisfactory to excellent in the short term (six weeks postoperatively), and no patient sought additional surgical treatment for the feet. A superficial infection subsequently developed in two feet, and two feet had delayed wound-healing. At an average of 64.9 months postoperatively, the average AOFAS forefoot score was 64.5 points and the average hallux valgus angle was 22.3 degrees . There were no reoperations.

Conclusions

Resection of all five metatarsal heads in patients with metatarsalgia and hallux valgus associated with rheumatoid arthritis can be a safe procedure that provides reasonable, if rarely complete, relief of symptoms.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: an educational review [^339ac43c]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1 
Main angles useful for studying foot statics on weight-bearing radiographs

In the lateral view, the main angles are as follows:
The Djian–Annonier’s angle (angle of the medial arch of the foot): angle between the calcaneal tubercle, the talonavicular joint (apex of the angle), and the medial sesamoid of the hallux (N between 120° and 130°). An angle > 130° defines a flat foot, < 120° a direct hollow foot ;
the talo metatarsal axis (Meary–Tomeno angle): longitudinal axis of the shell of the head of the talus and that of the first metatarsal, normally forming a straight line (0°). A break in this line with an angle with an inferior apex, is seen in flat feet and with an angle with a superior apex in anterior hollow feet ;
the slope of the calcaneus: angle of inclination between the line of the plantar surface of the calcaneus and the ground plane (N between 15° and 25°). It is lowered in the flat foot and increased in the posterior hollow foot;
the slope of the metatarsals: the angle measured between the axis of each metatarsal and the plane of the ground. It normally decreases steadily from the first metatarsal (around 20°) to the fifth metatarsal (5°). The angle of attack of the first metatarsal is reduced in the flat foot and increased in the hollow foot;

### Metatarsal length does not correlate with maximal peak pressure and maximal force [^1c00a2a5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary metatarsalgia of the lesser metatarsals is common and caused by mechanical overload of the affected metatarsal heads. Increased metatarsal length generally is believed to be a factor in the development of primary metatarsalgia. However, there is no clear biomechanical evidence supporting this theory.

Questions/Purposes

We asked whether metatarsal length correlated with plantar-loading parameters under the corresponding metatarsal heads.

Patients and Methods

We prospectively followed two groups of patients 46 (51 feet) with and 45 (51 feet) without metatarsalgia. Each foot was physically examined and underwent standardized full-weightbearing radiography and dynamic pedobarography to assess maximal peak pressure and maximal force under the first, second, and third metatarsal heads. We correlated the relative length of the first and third metatarsals with the corresponding two plantar-loading parameters. We compared maximal peak pressure and maximal force in patients with metatarsalgia with those of symptom-free patients.

Results

The relative length of the first and third metatarsals did not correlate (r < 0.13) with the maximal peak pressure or maximal force under the corresponding metatarsal heads. Maximal force under the first metatarsal head was decreased in the metatarsalgia group. There was no difference in maximal peak pressure between the metatarsalgia and nonmetatarsalgia groups.

Conclusions

Relative metatarsal length had no influence on plantar-loading parameters. Shortening of a symptomatic ray to decrease plantar-loading parameters cannot be supported from a biomechanical rationale.

### Over-the-counter foot remedies [^6a2ec2ad]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Several effective and inexpensive over-the-counter treatments are available for minor but troubling foot problems. In most cases, one week of therapy with topical terbinafine is effective for interdigital tinea pedis. Treatment of plantar warts with 17 percent salicylic acid with lactic acid in a collodion base is as effective as cryotherapy, but treatment must be sustained for several months. Toe sleeves and toe spacers can relieve pain from hard or soft corns. Metatarsal pads can relieve the pressure associated with plantar keratoses. Heel cups often can relieve pain caused by age-related thinning of the heel fat pad. Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of anteromedial heel pain caused by repetitive strain on the plantar fascia. Although the mainstay of therapy is stretching exercises, ready-made arch supports and insoles can be helpful adjuncts.

Summary and conclusions

This guideline highlights the lack of high-quality evidence available to inform the management of foot health in IA, with an absence of RCTs in most treatment areas. Recommendations made in this guideline are therefore predominantly based on expert consensus and low-quality observational studies. Definitive RCTs, with adequate sample sizes and long-term follow-up, are critical to determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of treatments for adults, children and young people with foot problems in IA (see recommendations for research in full guideline).

### Metatarsalgia and Morton's disease: comparison of outcomes between open procedure and neurectomy versus percutaneous metatarsal osteotomies and ligament release with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up [^db130b85]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The present study compared the clinical results of open neurectomy versus a percutaneous procedure for Morton's disease. This was a retrospective study comparing the functional results after 2 surgical procedures: open neurectomy and a percutaneous procedure (with deep transverse metatarsal ligament release and distal metatarsal osteotomies). The present study included 52 patients (26 in each group), and the mean follow-up period was 4 (range 2 to 7) years. The patient evaluation criteria included the presence of painful symptoms of Morton's disease, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) functional scale score, patient satisfaction, and delay for recovery. Percutaneous treatment of Morton's disease and open neurectomy produced complete relief of pain in 25 of 26 patients in each group. At the latest follow-up visit, the mean AOFAS score had significantly improved from 36 ± 11 preoperatively to a mean of 89 ± 18 (p < .001). After 2 years, the functional improvement obtained with the percutaneous procedure persisted, with a stable AOFAS score (96 ± 10). Persistent metatarsalgia was reported by patients who had undergone open neurectomy, with a significantly decreased AOFAS score (81 ± 21, p = .009). The percutaneous procedure for Morton's disease provided excellent functional outcomes (AOFAS score >90) significantly more often with a shorter delay than after open neurectomy (p = .03). At the latest follow-up visit, metatarsalgia due to plantar hyperpressure or bursitis and requiring plantar orthotics was present in 11 of 26 patients (44%) after open neurectomy and in 1 of 26 patients (4%) after the percutaneous procedure (p = .002). Percutaneous treatment of Morton's disease is a reliable procedure providing results as good as those after open neurectomy, with significantly better outcomes in the longer term and a lower rate of late metatarsalgia.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^0271967f]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although there are anecdotal reportson the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal fillers to treat metatarsalgia, suggesting a demand for the procedure, no previous clinical studies have reported the use of HA fillers to treat metatarsalgia in the forefeet. Hyaluronic acid occurs naturally in the body and so, once injected, it will gradually break down and be absorbed by the body. Furthermore, in the event of complications, hyaluronidase may be used to degrade the HA filler and reverse the effect.Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers are widely used for dermal volume depletion and soft-tissue contour defects caused by aging and have demonstrated good tolerability and longevity, as well as good resistance to deformation. The Restylane (RES) Optimal Balance Technology (OBT) gel products are produced using an HA concentration of 20 mg/mL with different degrees of cross-linking and particle size calibration to have distinctive physical properties intended for different indications.As this is the first study evaluating the use of HA dermal fillers to treat metatarsalgia in the forefeet, RES Kysse (previously CE marked in Europe under the brand name Emervel Lips) was chosen for its medium cohesivity and somewhat smaller particles to ensure good tissue integration. Although being relatively firm, but not the firmest gel, the authors predicted that this would be ideally suited to provide a cushioned effect and be optimal for the comfort of the patient. Furthermore, similar to fillers in the forefeet, fillers for lip enhancement need to resist deformation caused by strong and frequent movement of the lips and this gel had previously been shown to have good longevity in the mobile lips. Although this gel is not approved in the United States, FDA-approved RES Defyne is produced by the same XpresHAN technology (OBT) and is also a product that provides shape and contour, albeit with slightly different gel properties than RES Kysse.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the decrease in plantar pad pain by restoring plantar pad volume and cushioning function by injection of an HA dermal filler in the forefeet of subjects with metatarsalgia caused by wearing high-heeled shoes.

### Minimally invasive osteotomies of the second and third metatarsals for the management of metatarsalgia in hallux valgus with plantar plate rupture [^9c02c171]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Distal Minimally invasive metatarsal osteotomies (DMMOs) shorten the metatarsals While allowing automatic adjustment of the metatarsal heads in all three planes through immediate weight-bearing. In hallux valgus (HV) surgery, transfer metatarsalgia can be managed with percutaneous DMMOs.

Purpose

This study is a retrospective study that evaluates the clinical and radiological outcomes of DMMOs limited to the second and third metatarsals for metatarsalgia with plantar plate injury associated with HV.

Study Design

A single-center study of 102 patients who underwent surgery between 2011 and 2020.

Methods

Demographic, radiological, clinical (AOFAS score), and complication data were analyzed. Minimally invasive DMMOs of the second and third metatarsals were performed under fluoroscopic guidance, followed by a chevron osteotomy of M1 to realign forefoot length.

Results

We observed significant metatarsal shortening and AOFAS a signifiant improvement (p < 0.05) with a postoperative value of 92.25 ± 3.7 (range: 71.2-98.2). No recurrences, three cases of transfer metatarsalgia, and six delayed unions were reported DMMOs of the second and third metatarsals appear to be a reliable option for treating metatarsalgia with plantar plate injury in HV.

Conclusion

DMMOs of the second and third metatarsals appear to be a reliable option for treating metatarsalgia with plantar plate injury in association with surgical correction of HV. We observed no recurrence of metatarsalgia, and the risk of transfer metatarsalgia was less than 2.9.

### Mechanical metatarsalgia as a risk factor for relapse of Morton's neuroma after ultrasound-guided alcohol injection [^70a0b11a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although many treatment modalities are available for Morton's neuroma, the injection of the neuroma with alcohol has gained popularity. However, recently, some investigators have observed a progressive deterioration in pain scores for patients initially pain free after the treatment. The purpose of the present retrospective comparative study was to determine whether mechanical metatarsalgia is related to symptom recurrence. We included 104 consecutive cases of ultrasound-guided alcohol injection for Morton's neuroma in 92 patients. Of these 104 cases, 51 were in group A (49%; Morton's neuroma) and 53 in group B (51%; Morton's neuroma associated with mechanical metatarsalgia). We evaluated each patient using a visual analog scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society forefoot scale, and Johnson satisfaction scale, with a mean follow-up period of 24 (range 12 to 39) months. Concomitant functional and mechanical disorders have been identified and treated with orthopedic inserts. The present study compared the clinical results and recurrence of symptoms in patients with isolated Morton's disease or Morton's disease associated with mechanical metatarsalgia. Of the 104 cases, the patients for 93 cases (89%) were completely satisfied or satisfied with minor reservations. No major complications developed. Symptoms recurred in 6 patients (6%), in whom neuroma was associated with mechanical disorders (p = .0269). Ultrasound-guided alcohol injection of Morton's neuroma is a relatively safe and well-tolerated treatment. Symptom recurrence is often associated with mechanical metatarsalgia. The treatment of the concomitant anatomical and functional disorders that target the genesis of the neuroma has an important role in the prevention of recurrence of this pathology.

Imaging and measuring foot statics

Main radiological views

The initial radiographic assessment of metatarsalgia typically begins with weight-bearing views, including standing dorso-plantar (anteroposterior) and lateral views of the foot and a non-weight-bearing medial oblique view.

Depending on the situation, a sesamoid view of the forefoot (Walter muller or Güntz incidence) may also be performed. This radiographic assessment is often sufficient to diagnose deformities and the main bone and joint pathologies.

Foot statics measurements

A number of measurements are used on the radiographic assessment mainly to detect foot statics disorders (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

Fig. 1

### Long-term results of the modified hoffman procedure in the rheumatoid forefoot. surgical technique [^44361cd2]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis commonly affects the forefoot, causing metatarsalgia, hallux valgus, and deformities of the lesser toes. Various types of surgical correction have been described, including resection of the lesser-toe metatarsal heads coupled with arthrodesis of the great toe, resection arthroplasty of the proximal phalanx or metatarsal head, and metatarsal osteotomy. We report the results at an average of five and a half years following thirty-seven consecutive forefoot arthroplasties performed in twenty patients by one surgeon using a technique involving resection of all five metatarsal heads.

Methods

All patients were treated with the same technique of resection of all five metatarsal heads through three dorsal incisions. All surviving patients were asked to return for follow-up, which included subjective assessment (with use of visual analogue pain scores, AOFAS [American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society] foot scores, and SF-12 [Short Form-12] mental and physical disability scores), physical examination, and radiographic evaluation.

Results

All results were satisfactory to excellent in the short term (six weeks postoperatively), and no patient sought additional surgical treatment for the feet. A superficial infection subsequently developed in two feet, and two feet had delayed wound-healing. At an average of 64.9 months postoperatively, the average AOFAS forefoot score was 64.5 points and the average hallux valgus angle was 22.3 degrees. There were no reoperations.

Conclusions

Resection of all five metatarsal heads in patients with metatarsalgia and hallux valgus associated with rheumatoid arthritis can be a safe procedure that provides reasonable, if rarely complete, relief of symptoms.

### Tailor's bunion: a review [^743c287f]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The tailor's bunion is a painful bony prominence on the lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head that occurs in many individuals, but seldom causes symptoms. This article reviews the current literature regarding the presentation, etiology, and management of the tailor's bunion. The first line of management should be conservative, with advice on shoe wear. Orthotics may be useful if a symptomatic tailor's bunion results from excessive subtalar joint pronation. Operative management, indicated when symptoms are not controlled nonoperatively, aims to decrease foot width and the prominence of the tailor's bunion. Procedures can be grouped into resections and distal, diaphyseal, and proximal osteotomies. A distal osteotomy is recommended if medial translation of the head for one-third of the width of the metatarsal shaft produces a normal fourth-fifth intermetatarsal angle. A proximal osteotomy can be performed in the face of larger deformities. The management of recurrent tailor's bunion is still controversial. If the recurrence is due to under-correction, or if the initial procedure was not the best suited to that particular patient, then revision surgery may be helpful, after the cause of the failure has been established. Although unpopular, resection should be considered as the final salvage procedure.

Fig. 7 
Morton’s neuroma in a 76-year-old woman presenting chronic left metatarsalgia with paresthesia of the fourth ray. US in short axis (A, B) shows hypoechoic mass located in the plantar intermetatarsal space, which dislocate (short arrow) during dynamic lateral compression (long white arrows) of the forefoot: Mulder’s sonographic sign MR images of the forefoot in short axis show oval mass in the third intermetatarsal space (long arrows), hypointense in T1-weighted image (C), hyperintense in T2-weighted image (D), overlain by a bursitis (arrowhead)

On MRI, Morton’s neuroma appears as a variable iso-hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images in the neurovascular bundle area, contrasting with the hyperintense fluid of the intermetatarsal bursa (Fig. 7). On T1-weighted images, it appears in the low-intensity signal. It often shows a characteristic dumbbell or ovoid shape on MRI, particularly in coronal views, due to the fusiform thickening of the nerve compressed between the metatarsal heads. Contrast after gadolinium injection varies in intensity but is always homogeneous, unlike bursitis where contrast is peripheral.

### Optimum position of metatarsal pad in metatarsalgia for pressure relief [^57f37b52]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the optimum position of a metatarsal (MT) pad to treat metatarsalgia.

Design

We used a sensing mat with 16 x 16 sensors, 4.4 x 4.4 mm each, to measure plantar pressure in ten metatarsalgia patients walking with an MT pad in various positions. Peak pressures of the MT head and MT pad were analyzed.

Results

Walking without MT pads, the peak pressure of the MT head was 678 +/- 227 and 687 +/- 228 kPa in one proximal and one distal row of three sensors. Placement of the MT pad resulting in peak pressure two sensors proximal to the peak pressure of the MT head did not significantly reduce peak pressure on the MT head. In contrast, placement of the MT pad resulting in peak pressure just proximal to the peak pressures of the MT head reduced the proximal and distal peak pressures on the MT head to 427 +/- 97 and 431 +/- 92 kPa (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Optimum pressure reduction on the MT head is attained when the peak pressure generated by the MT pad is just proximal to the MT head.

### Common foot problems: over-the-counter treatments and home care [^a5574171]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Most foot disorders do not require podiatry referral or complex interventions. After the clinical diagnosis is made, these conditions can typically be managed with over-the-counter (OTC) and home remedies, with guidance from the primary care physician. Stretching and strengthening exercises, along with the use of heel cups, resolve most plantar fasciitis cases and are at least as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid injections. Hallux rigidus is best managed with a hard-soled shoe or rigid insert that relieves pain by restricting motion across the metatarsophalangeal joint. Hallux valgus responds to use of wide toe box shoes, and surgery is not clearly beneficial beyond one year. Plantar warts can be treated effectively at home with OTC salicylic acid and cryotherapy topical agents, which have equal effectiveness to liquid nitrogen. In patients with corns and calluses, OTC topical salicylic acid has short-term benefits, and pads and inserts that more evenly redistribute contact forces have long-term benefits. Inserts are commonly recommended to redistribute forefoot pressure and relieve pain. Several OTC preparations are available for the treatment of tinea pedis, with topical allylamines being the most effective. Although OTC topical treatments have been widely used for onychomycosis, they have poor long-term cure rates compared with prescription oral medications.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^5cb2b0c9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Safety

The mean number of injections under metatarsal heads was 6.2 ± 1.7 and was equally distributed between both sides (Table 3). The mean total volume injected for both feet was 1.3 mL and was equally distributed between both sides (Table 3). One subject had no injection on the right foot and another subject had no injection on the left foot. A retrograde linear threading injection technique was used in the vast majority of subjects (93.3%); an anterograde linear threading injection technique was used for 1 subject (6.7%). Each injection of filler treatment was preceded by an injection of local anesthetic (lidocaine).

TABLE 3. 
Baseline Injections

Pain sensation during injections was limited with 7 subjects (46.7%) reporting to have experienced no pain at all, and for the remaining 53.3% of subjects, the mean pain score on injection was even less than 1 (0.9) on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain) scale (Table 3).

No subject reported any adverse event during this study.

### Clinical outcomes after isolated periarticular osteotomies of the first metatarsal for hallux rigidus: a systematic review [^46fc8c69]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal has been proposed for treatment of hallux rigidus due to the perceived ability to "decompress" the first metatarsophalangeal joint through axial shortening, as well as plantar displacement of the first metatarsal head to correct purported elevation. Additionally, isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal has been proposed for treatment of hallux rigidus because of the perceived safety and efficacy. Furthermore, it has been proposed that undergoing isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal does not prevent the ability to perform revision surgery. The author undertook a systematic review of electronic databases and other relevant sources to identify material relating to the clinical outcomes and need for surgical revision after isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal for hallux rigidus. Information from peer-reviewed journals, as well as from non-peer-reviewed publications, abstracts and posters, and unpublished works, was also considered. In an effort to procure the highest quality studies available, studies were eligible for inclusion only if they involved consecutively enrolled patients undergoing isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal for hallux rigidus, involved a prospective study design, included some form of objective and subjective data analysis, evaluated patients at a mean follow-up ≥12 months' duration, and included details of complications requiring surgical intervention. Four studies involving 93 isolated periarticular osteotomies of the first metatarsal followed up for a weighted mean of 18.6 months were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Peak dorsiflexion range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint for the entire cohort of 93 patients increased 10.4°. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scoring Scale for the entire cohort of 93 patients increased 39 points from a weighted mean of 47.2 preoperatively to 86.2 postoperatively. For the two studies that included it, complete satisfaction or satisfaction with reservations was reported in only 55/75 (73.3%) patients, with the remainder being dissatisfied. A total of 21 (22.6%) procedures underwent surgical revision in the form of hardware removal (n = 8), lesser metatarsal surgery for intractable postoperative metatarsalgia (n = 7), no mention of revision procedure (n = 3), Keller resection arthroplasty (n = 2), and treatment of infection with revision of non-union (n = 1). Two studies specified the grade of hallux rigidus that underwent revision surgery after isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal as follows: grade I, 16.7% (n = 3/18) and grade II, 30.5% (n = 18/59). Finally, a total of 30.5% (n = 18/59) of patients developed postoperative metatarsalgia or stress fracture. Additional prospective studies involving validated subjective and objective outcome measurement tools with computerized gait analysis and long-term follow-up after isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal for the various grades of hallux rigidus, as well as with comparison with isolated cheilectomy and Valenti arthroplasty, would be beneficial. Based on the high incidence of complications until these studies can be completed, routine use of isolated periarticular osteotomy of the first metatarsal for hallux rigidus should be performed with caution or not at all.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^426d69f1]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical referral

(23) In adults or children and young people with foot problems in IA, prompt surgical referral should be considered where there is pain, risk of ulceration, joint damage and/or deformity at the forefoot, midfoot or hindfoot, and usually when multidisciplinary non-operative care has failed or is considered unlikely to be successful. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 99.

Rationale

There is no direct evidence concerning when to consider surgical referral; this recommendation is based on expert opinion. First-line conservative management is appropriate for most people with IA. However, earlier referral for surgical opinion should be considered in certain cases, e.g. where there is significant pain or deformity and the patient is keen to have a permanent resolution while taking into account that commissioning and pathways vary nationally. Inability to wear off-the-shelf footwear may also be considered an indication for surgery. In children and young people with foot problems in IA, the indication for surgical referral is less common, and the range of surgical options is more limited.

When considering a surgical referral, and prior to making it, the patient should be at the centre of the decision and an informed discussion that includes surgical options and the risks and benefits of each should be made. The discussion could cover what an operation involves, the possible complications, how much time off work might be needed, information on the post-operative recovery period, and whether and for how long systemic IA therapies should be withheld (see below) and should factor in that some patients may not want surgery at all. In specialist MDT foot clinics that include a surgeon, this discussion can involve surgical opinion at an earlier stage.

### Effectiveness of foot orthoses versus rocker-sole footwear for first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis: randomized trial [^b8afbbdc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Biomechanical factors are thought to contribute to first MTP joint OA 8, suggesting that mechanical interventions may hold some promise as an effective treatment for this condition. One of the most commonly used interventions is foot orthoses, which are thought to decrease first MTP joint pain by allowing the first metatarsal to plantarflex during the propulsive phase of gait, thereby minimizing dorsal joint compression 9. A similar effect may also be obtained using a footwear modification known as a rocker‐sole, which allows the body's center of mass to “roll over” the base of support, reducing the need for first MTP joint dorsiflexion. However, evidence to support the effectiveness of foot orthoses for first MTP joint OA is limited to case reports 10, 11 and 1 case series study 12. Similarly, the effectiveness of rocker‐sole footwear is largely anecdotal, with only 1 small case series suggesting that rocker‐sole footwear was effective when combined with intraarticular corticosteroid injection 13.

Given the prevalence and impact of first MTP joint OA and the lack of evidence for existing interventions, the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of prefabricated foot orthoses to rocker‐sole footwear in reducing foot pain in people with first MTP joint OA.

### Establishment and validation of a predictive nomogram for hallux valgus with pain under the second metatarsal [^5ebdcaf1]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The first ray plays a key role in maintaining the structure of the medial arch, and as the main load-bearing structure, it is subject to substantial forces during gait.Failure anywhere along the first ray, from the distal phalanx to the talonavicular joint, can result in hallux valgus. First-ray hypermobility (FRH) was considered a pathological entity in previous studies and was seen as a primary cause of hallux valgus.However, the relationship between FRH and hallux valgus remains controversial.

The collapse of the arch of the foot causes the stress on the forefoot of the hallux valgus foot to shift laterally, resulting in a painful callus under the second and third metatarsal heads.Forefoot alterations cause imbalances in weight-bearing distribution that may lead to mechanical overload on the affected metatarsal heads and may evolve into pain and plantar callosities.Initial metatarsalgia treatment is conservative; however, when these conservative measures fail and the metatarsalgia becomes recalcitrant, it requires surgical treatment with or without procedures on the first ray.The primary goal of surgery is to relieve pain and restore an ideal forefoot morphology with normal forefoot pressure distribution. In our study, the multivariate logistic regression results revealed that the HVA (OR = 1.068, 95% CI [1.028, 1.109]) and IMA1–2 (OR = 1.222, 95% CI [1.044, 1.43]) indirectly shows the pathological changes of the hallux valgus foot arch, which is consistent with the reports of previous studies,that is, with the increase in the HVA and IMA1–2, abnormal dynamic factors, such as muscle ligaments, will lead to hallux valgus foot complicated with pain under the second metatarsal head. Therefore, it is proven that HVA and IMA1–2 are risk factors for hallux valgus combined with pain under the second metatarsal head.

Tailor’s bunion (Pathway 5)—definition, contributors, and epidemiology are outlined: Tailor’s bunion (also called bunionette) involves deformity of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) and typically includes lateral prominence of the fifth metatarsal head; numerous factors can contribute such as a prominent lateral condyle, a plantarflexed fifth metatarsal, a splay foot deformity, lateral bowing of the fifth metatarsal, hypertrophy of soft tissues over the lateral aspect of the metatarsal head, and other contributors including a varus fifth toe, hallux valgus with abnormal pronation of the fifth metatarsal, hindfoot varus, and flatfoot; it is seen most commonly in adolescents and adults, with a mean age of presentation of 28 years (range, 16–57 years) and a female-to-male ratio greater than 2:1.

### Metatarsal pain (...) [^f2e8664b]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Plantar Fasciitis Each year, more than 800, 000 Americans younger than 65 years seek outpatient treatment of plantar fasciitis. 5 Stretching is likely effective because it counteracts shortening of the plantar fascia. The plantar fascia is contiguous with the Achilles tendon at its origin, where it then goes on to insert at the toes in individual bands. 6, 7 The plantar fascia is also vulnerable to compressive trauma at the base of the calcaneus, where it is protected only by a fat pad that thins with age.
8. It is likely that plantar fasciitis does not result from inflammation, but instead from repetitive microtears in the contracted fascia. 13 The lack of an inflammatory mechanism could explain why nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do not appear to be helpful and why OTC remedies such as heel cups are at least as effective as steroid injections.

14, 15 A recent Cochrane review found that steroid injections are marginally more effective than placebo in reducing pain, but only for one month. 16 Steroid injections also carry risks such as fascial rupture, infection, and atrophy of the fat pad. Hallux Rigidus Hallux rigidus is common, affecting more than 40% of men and 50% of women by their early 70s. Significant hallux rigidus will develop in 20% of persons by their early 40s. 21 Hallux rigidus presents as joint pain, swelling, and progressive limitation of motion in the great toe, often as a result of osteoarthritis in the metatarsophalangeal joint. As the condition advances, acute flare-ups become more frequent and severe, 22 and they are sometimes mistaken for gout. A large retrospective analysis suggests that hallux rigidus symptoms usually improve without surgery.

23 Although few studies have compared OTC inserts with custom orthotics, rigid inserts and hard-soled shoes relieve pain by restricting motion across the MTP joint. 24, 25 Adding an OTC stiffening shoe insert may improve pain and function for three months or longer. 26 The use of modified footwear is more effective than NSAIDs. 27 Although some experts recommend using a curved sole, or rocker-bottom shoe, to reduce motion at the MTP joint, its effectiveness has not been studied. Hallux Valgus Hallux valgus is known for the characteristic bunion deformity at the first MTP joint.

Results

Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics

Between November 2014 and October 2015, 15 women were enrolled and 14 completed the study; 1 subject discontinued after Week 12 at their own request. Overall, 5 subjects had at least 1 major protocol deviation of no pain evaluation at Month 3 (4 subjects) or at Month 6 (1 subject).

Subjects had a mean age of 47.7 years and they had experienced metatarsalgia for an average of 9.0 years (Table 1). At baseline, all subjects had the valgus foot, mostly of moderate grade (66.7% subjects). Most subjects (86.7%) had at least 1 foot that was pes cavus, mostly of mild (53.8% subjects) or moderate grade (30.8% subjects) (Table 1). Both feet were not necessarily affected by the same morphotype, for example, 71.4% of left feet were pes cavus and 85.7% of right feet. The mean number of callosities per subject was 1.9 (Table 1).

TABLE 1. 
Baseline Demographic and Disease Characteristics

Efficacy

At baseline before injections, all 15 subjects had pain when wearing high-heeled shoes. At 3 and 6 months after a single-injection session, 5 subjects (33.3%; missing values are taken as having pain) reported that they had no pain at all when wearing high heels (Figure 2).

Figure 2. 
Proportion of subjects with pain sensation (missing values are considered as having pain).

Considering only the subjects who reported that they still had pain when wearing high heels, a significant improvement from baseline in the time to onset of pain (T initial) was observed at 3 months after injections and this was maintained at 6 months after injections (Figure 3). At 6 months after injections for subjects with pain, the mean change in time to onset of pain compared with baseline was 3.5 hours per subject (p =.004; Table 2).

### Diagnosis and treatment of forefoot disorders. section 4. tailor's bunion [^a95fc80d]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Medium credibility.

Tailor’s bunion—surgical indications and procedures: Surgical treatment is indicated for patients who have failed nonsurgical care and patients who are not candidates for nonsurgical care, and the goal is to decrease the prominence of the fifth metatarsal laterally. Selection of procedure is based on physical evaluation and radiographic assessment, surgical correction varies from exostectomy to differing types of osteotomies, and resection of the fifth metatarsal head generally is indicated for salvage conditions or in the presence of unreconstructable deformities; Tailor’s bunion deformity generally is addressed with some type of osteotomy. The deformity is described as inherited and progressive, and although nonsurgical measures may be used initially to reduce symptomatology, surgical repair is often necessary.

### Establishment and validation of a predictive nomogram for hallux valgus with pain under the second metatarsal [^30e2862f]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus is often associated with pain in the second-lower metatarsal, and metatarsalgia is often secondary to metatarsalgia after hallux valgus surgery. In cases where conservative treatment fails, surgery is the final solution. Research by Biz et alshowed that minimally invasive surgery with Reverdin-Isham and Akin percutaneous osteotomy combined with previous exostosectomy and subsequent lateral soft-tissue release is a safe, effective and reliable procedure for the correction of mild to moderate hallux valgus. The use of a minimally invasive intramedullary nail device for the correction of moderate and severe hallux valgus has also been proven to be a feasible method.The ideal treatment aim is to improve and eliminate the associated metatarsalgia while dealing with hallux valgus, which helps reduce the burden on patients and avoids the need for a secondary operation.

One of the most important diagnostic and evaluation basis of hallux valgus is X-ray measurement. The change in the X-ray angle of the foot arch can indirectly reflect the degree of change in the function of plantar soft tissue, and plantar pressure measurement can evaluate the change in plantar pressure. Some studies have found that hallux valgus with second submetatarsal pain is related to socio-demographic factors (age, gender, body mass index [BMI], etc.), imaging factors, hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle 1–2 (IMA1–2), medial longitudinal arch angle, relative length of the second metatarsal head and gait factors, such as subpeak pressure, impulse and ground contact area of the first and second metatarsal heads.

Although previous studies have obtained relevant quantitative data, the relationship between hallux valgus and the risk of pain under the second metatarsal head has not been determined. Therefore, this study explored the risk factors affecting the occurrence of hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Our study aimed to clarify the risk factors for the occurrence of hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal, construct an effective model for predicting hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal and provide a valuable reference for the diagnosis and assessment of hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal in clinical practice.

### Plantar vein thrombosis provoked by mechanical strain to the foot: a rare cause of plantar heel pain [^ebecf6cc]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 61-year-old mountain hiker presented with acute pain of the medial-plantar aspect of the right foot. As the location, intensity and acute onset of the pain were atypical for fasciitis plantaris, an ultrasound was performed. This demonstrated a segmental plantar vein thrombosis (PVT), which was confirmed on consequent MRI. Patient was a non-smoker, without a medical or family history of coagulopathies. Four months previously, he suffered from metatarsalgia of the left, thus contralateral, foot, which prompted treatment with bilateral orthoses. In addition to metatarsal padding, medial-arch support was prescribed due to the presence of flexible flatfeet. Following internal medicine consultation, treatment consisted of discontinuing the use of orthoses, rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). At 2-week follow-up, the patient was pain-free. In this case report, PVT, a rare cause for plantar heel pain, is discussed. In addition, a summary of the diagnosis and treatment of PVT is outlined.

Plantar heel pain—presentation, contributing factors, and evaluation emphasize that the most common cause cited is biomechanical stress of the plantar fascia and its enthesis at the calcaneal tuberosity, with localized nerve entrapment also potentially contributory; patients usually present with pain at initiation of weight bearing that eases after minutes then returns with activity, and evaluation should include targeted history, exclusion of neurologic symptoms, and comprehensive lower-extremity examination including assessment of plantar fat pad quality and height.

Common peroneal nerve

The common peroneal nerve arises from the sciatic nerve at the upper superior aspect of the popliteal fossa. It travels distally posteromedial to the short head of the biceps femoris and superficial to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The nerve then wraps around the fibular neck before entering the peroneal tunnel between the peroneus longus and the fibula, where it divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. It supplies the short head of biceps femoris, the lateral compartment of the leg via the superficial peroneal nerve and the anterior compartment of the leg via the deep peroneal nerve. In terms of sensory functions, it provides sensation to the anterolateral region of the leg and dorsum of the foot via the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. It also contributes to the lateral sural cutaneous nerve supplying sensation to the upper lateral leg and the sural nerve supplying the lower posterolateral leg.

Common peroneal neuropathy is the most common mononeuropathy of the lower limb. The two most common sites of entrapment are as it crosses the fibular neck, given its superficial location, and as it travels deep to the peroneus longus. There are many causes of entrapment, including direct compression from crush injury, extended lithotomy position during surgery, prolonged squatting, short-leg cast, ganglion cysts, synovial cysts, varicosities, tumours, hypertrophy of the short head of the biceps femoris muscle, traumatic injury following high fibula fracture (Fig. 7) and knee dislocation [,,–]. Patients can present with the clinical symptoms of foot drop and a slapping gait. MRI findings include an increase in size and T2 hyperintensity of the nerve. MRI can also identify space-occupying lesions causing mass effect, and denervation oedema in the muscles supplied by the nerve. Treatment options depend on the cause, and include surgical treatment for an external compressing mass, activity modification, and consideration of local corticosteroid injections.

### Influence of the length ratio between second and third metatarsals after modified weil osteotomy on clinical outcomes [^565af5ea]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Metatarsalgia is a frequent foot disorder. The objective was to evaluate whether the length ratio between the second and the third metatarsals after Weil osteotomy influences clinical outcomes. This retrospective study included 37 patients (53 feet). Preoperative planning consisted of keeping the second metatarsal greater than or equal to the third metatarsal after Weil osteotomy of the second metatarsal or the second and third metatarsals. Based on postoperative weightbearing and digital AP radiographs after Weil osteotomy, we divided the patients into 2 groups: group 1, the second metatarsal was longer than or equal to the third metatarsal; and group 2, the second metatarsal was shorter than the third metatarsal. We investigated whether there were differences between the groups. In 35 (66%) feet, the second metatarsal was longer than or equal to the third metatarsal (group 1), and in 18 (34%) feet, the second metatarsal was shorter than the third metatarsal (group 2). Postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores were 86.2 and 82.7, respectively (p = .32). Postoperative Visual Analog Scale scores were 1.26 and 1.67, respectively (p = .39). The sample showed 11.3% of transfer metatarsalgia to the third metatarsal. Group 1 had 9% of transfer metatarsalgia, whereas group 2 had 17% of transfer metatarsalgia (p = .40). The presence of a second metatarsal shorter than the third metatarsal, after Weil osteotomy of the second metatarsal or the second and third metatarsals, does not influence outcomes or incidence of transfer metatarsalgia to the third metatarsal.

### Biomechanical effects of prefabricated foot orthoses and rocker-sole footwear in individuals with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis [^1728378a]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder in the world, affecting 10% of men and 13% of women age >60 years 1. Although the knee is the most commonly affected lower extremity region, foot involvement is also common. The most commonly affected region of the foot is the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, with radiographic changes evident in up to 35% of people age >35 years 2. The population prevalence of symptomatic radiographic first MTP joint OA (i.e. both radiographic changes and symptoms) in people age >50 years has recently been estimated as 7.8% 3. First MTP joint OA has a detrimental impact on health‐related quality of life 4, and 72% of those affected report associated locomotor disability 3.

Box 1 
Significance & Innovations

Structural and biomechanical factors are thought to contribute to the onset, progression, and symptomatic severity of first MTP joint OA. During the propulsive phase of gait, the first MTP joint dorsiflexes to assist in the forward transfer of bodyweight. However, in the presence of an overly long and/or wide first metatarsal or proximal phalanx, the proximal phalanx is unable to dorsally rotate on the first metatarsal head, resulting in joint compression and the development of a dorsal exostosis 5. In clinical practice, first MTP joint OA is often managed with foot orthoses, which are thought to decrease pain associated with this condition by allowing the first metatarsal to achieve sufficient plantarflexion in preparation for propulsion, thereby minimizing joint compression 6. Alternatively, pain relief can be achieved using a footwear modification known as a rocker‐sole, in which the sole of the shoe is curved 7. The aim of this modification is to allow the body's center of mass to “roll over” the base of support, reducing the need for first MTP joint dorsiflexion and subsequently decreasing the loads placed on the forefoot and toes.

### Plantar fat pad atrophy: a cause of metatarsalgia? [^78c4a55f]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate if atrophy of the plantar fat pad in splay-foot deformities was a major cause of metatarsalgia. A sonographic method of measuring the thickness of the plantar fat pad under the second and third metatarsal heads was developed. The method was tested on 25 volunteers and the intraobserver reliability was calculated to be 97.1% for the second metatarsal and 96.7% for the third metatarsal. Sonographic measurement of the plantar fat pad was then performed on 100 symptomatic feet Pain frequency and pain intensity were determined by using a verbal rating scale (VRS) and a visual analog scale (VAS). The intermetatarsal angle 1/2 was measured and then compared to the thickness of the fat pad for each patient. A correlation between the increase of the intermetatarsal angle and the decrease of the fat pad thickness could not be demonstrated (r = 0.041). The frequency of metatarsalgia did not correlate with a decrease of the thickness of the plantar fat pad under the second metatarsal head (t statistic: 1.978; Durbin-Watson test: 1.999; p value = .0507) and the third metatarsal head (t statistic: 3.199; Durbin-Watson test: 1.962; p value = .0019). The pain intensity showed a similar lack of correlation with the thickness of the plantar fat pad under the second metatarsal head (t statistic: 1.828; Durbin-Watson test: 2.365; p value = .0706) and the third metatarsal head (t statistic: 1.846; Durbin-Watson test: 2.371; p value = .0678). This study shows that a splay-foot deformity is not associated with a decrease of the thickness of the plantar fat pad. Furthermore, alterations of the thickness of the plantar fat pad are not relevant to the intensity and frequency of metatarsalgia.

### Metacarpophalangeal joint arthritis [^d12c365d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Arthritis of the metacarpophalangeal joint can result in considerable disability and pain. Inflammatory, posttraumatic, crystalline, and osteoarthritis are common etiologies of joint disease. A variety of nonsurgical treatment options have been shown to be effective, including activity modification, anti-inflammatory medications, splinting, and cortisone injections. In addition, newer generation disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs geared toward the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis have shown promise in retarding the inflammatory process. Another, relatively newer, conservative treatment option includes topical anti-inflammatories such as diclofenac sodium that are now approved by the Federal Drug Administration. Surgical treatment options most commonly include arthroplasty and arthrodesis. In the treatment of thumb metacarpophalangeal arthritis, arthrodesis is a popular and generally reliable surgical solution. In the fingers, arthroplasty remains the most common treatment option. Traditional constrained silicone joint replacements remain the most commonly used. Newer generation, unconstrained, surface replacement arthroplasties have shown promise in the treatment of osteoarthritis and select cases of inflammatory arthritis in which there is good bone stock, no or minimal deformity, adequate supporting soft tissues, and good disease control.

### Fifth metatarsal fractures-is routine follow-up necessary? [^17f00390]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fifth metatarsal fractures are common, and the outcome with conservative treatment is generally very satisfactory. Operative treatment is only used for selected injuries, particularly stress fractures. Traditionally these patients are routinely reviewed at a fracture clinic, mainly due to the perceived risk of non-union with a Jones' fracture. In 2011 we introduced a standardised protocol to promote weight bearing as pain allowed with an elasticated support or a removable boot. Patients were discharged with structured advice and a help-line number to access care if required, but no further face-to-face review was arranged. More complex cases were reviewed at a "virtual clinic." Our hypothesis was that the introduction of this standardised protocol would be safe, patient-centred and significantly reduce unnecessary outpatient clinic review.

Patients and Methods

We audited fracture clinic attendance and outcomes 1 year before and 1 year after the protocol was introduced in 2011. All radiographs taken at the Emergency Department (ED) presentation were reviewed and classified independently for validation.

Results

From 2009 to 2010, 279 patients who presented to the ED with fifth metatarsal fractures were referred to a fracture clinic. Of these 279 patients, 267 (96%) attended the fracture clinic, resulting in an overall total of 491 outpatient attendances. Three (1%) were treated operatively for delayed/non-union. From 2011 to 2012, 339 patients presented to the ED with fifth metatarsal fractures - only 67 (20%) were referred to a fracture clinic. 62 (18%) attended clinic appointments with 102 appointments in total. Five (1%) required operative intervention.

Conclusion

Our study showed no added clinical value for routine outpatient follow-up of fifth metatarsal fractures. Patients can be safely discharged and allowed to bear weight at the time of initial ED presentation if they are provided with appropriate information and ready access to experienced fracture clinic staff.

### Interventions for idiopathic toe walking [^e05dee9c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is an exclusionary diagnosis given to healthy children who persist in walking on their toes after they should typically have achieved a heel-toe gait. The literature discusses conservative and surgical interventions using a variety of treatment modalities. Young children and children without a limitation in ankle dorsiflexion (the upwards movement of the foot towards the shin of the leg) are commonly treated with conservative interventions. Older children who continue toe walking and present with limitations in ankle dorsiflexion are sometimes treated with surgical procedures. This systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence for any intervention for the treatment of ITW. The conclusions of this review may support decision making by clinicians caring for children with ITW. It may also assist families when deciding on treatment options for their children with ITW. Many of the treatments employed have financial implications for parents or healthcare services. This review also aims to highlight any deficits in the current research base.

Objectives

To assess the effects of conservative and surgical interventions in children with ITW, specifically effects on gait normalisation, ankle range of motion, pain, frequency of recurrence, and any adverse effects.

Search Methods

On 29 April 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PEDro. We searched the following registers of clinical trials for ongoing and recently completed trials: the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, apps.who.int/trialsearch), and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov). We searched conference proceedings and other grey literature in the BIOSIS databases and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey, opengrey.eu). We searched guidelines via the Turning Research Into Practice database (TRIP, tripdatabase.com) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (guideline.gov). We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials for inclusion in the review if they involved participants diagnosed with ITW gait in the absence of a medical condition known to cause toe walking, or associated with toe walking. As there is no universally accepted age group for ITW, this review includes ITW at any age, who have been toe walking for more than six months, who can or cannot walk with a heel-toe gait, and who may or may not have limited dorsiflexion of the ankle joint.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was improvement in toe walking (defined as greater than 50% of time spent heel-toe walking). Secondary outcomes were active and passive range of motion of the ankle joint, pain, recurrence of ITW after treatment, and adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Main Results

Four studies, comprising 104 participants, met the inclusion criteria. One study did not report data within the appropriate follow-up timeframe and data from two studies were insufficient for analysis. The single study from which we extracted data had 47 participants and was a randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Sweden. It tested the hypothesis that combined treatment with serial casting and botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was more effective than serial casting alone in reducing ITW gait.This study found that more participants treated with BTX improved (defined as toe walking less than 50% of the time, as reported by parents) (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 2.55; 1 trial, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference between groups in passive ankle joint dorsiflexion range of movement on the right with the knee extended (mean difference (MD) -1.48º, 95% CI -4.13 to 1.16; 1 trial, 47 participants), on the right with the knee flexed (MD -0.04º, 95% CI -1.80 to 1.73; 1 trial, 46 participants), on the left with the knee flexed (MD 1.07, 95% CI -1.22 to 3.37), or on the left with the knee extended (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.91). Nor was there a clear difference between the groups in recurrence of toe-walking gait (assessed via severity of toe walking (graded 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe)) on gait analysis, analysed as continuous data: MD 0.34 points, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.78; 46 participants). In principle, MDs greater than zero (i.e.) positive values) would favour BTX and casting and negative values would favour casting alone. We have not reported effects as better or worse because all results were from evidence of very low certainty. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations (outcome assessment was not blinded) and imprecision. Outcomes of pain and active range of motion were not reported in the included study.In terms of adverse events, calf pain was reported twice in the casting-only group and three times in the BTX group. There were three minor skin problems in each group and one reported case of pain directly after BTX injection. The report did not state if calf pain and skin irritation were from the same or different participants. The study authors reported that adverse events did not alter treatment adherence.

Authors' Conclusions

The certainty of evidence from one study, which compared serial casting with serial casting with BTX for ITW in children, was too low for conclusions to be drawn. A further three studies reported outcomes relating to BTX, footwear, exercises, and different types of orthoses as interventions, however the outcome data were too limited to assess their effects.

### Management of foot health in people with inflammatory arthritis: British Society for Rheumatology guideline scope [^aa9a8bd2]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Key facts and figures

IA is an umbrella term encompassing a range of chronic, autoimmune conditions characterised by joint inflammation. These include RA, JIA and spondyloarthropathy (SpA) – which encompasses PsA, AS, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis and undifferentiated SpA.

Despite the introduction of aggressive pharmacological therapies, foot problems frequently occur in IA. Around 90% of people with RA experience foot problems during the course of the disease, including rearfoot and forefoot deformity, tibialis posterior dysfunction, peripheral arthritis, and subluxation and dislocation of the MTP joints, leading to pain and reduced walking ability. The foot is also particularly susceptible to damage in JIA. Foot-related impairment and disability has been shown to persist in over 90% of children and young people with the condition, despite intensive pharmacological therapy, and foot problems are also common in adults with JIA. In SpA, foot problems also include peripheral arthritis, dactylitis and enthesitis, particularly at the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia and tibialis posterior tendon insertions but also at many other sites. In PsA specifically, forefoot deformity affects over 90% of people with the condition, while almost two-thirds experience foot pain.

Other extra-articular features of IA can manifest in the foot, including peripheral neuropathy and entrapment neuropathies. The risk of peripheral arterial disease is also increased in IA, particularly amongst individuals with a history of steroid use. Long-term steroid use can also contribute to poor tissue viability in the foot, and when combined with joint deformity and poor vascular supply, the risk of tissue breakdown is significantly increased. Foot ulcers are common in IA, and in immunosuppressed patients these carry an increased risk of potentially serious infection.

Despite significant advances in the pharmacological management of IA with the advent of whole new classes of medication and a new treatment paradigm, foot problems persist. The impact of foot damage in IA is often underestimated and trivialized, yet people with foot problems consistently report marked reduction in their quality of life, indicating that the impact of foot disorders extends well beyond localized pain and discomfort.

### Hyaluronic acid filler injections under the metatarsal heads provide a significant and long-lasting improvement in metatarsalgia from wearing high-heeled shoes [^83c80460]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The HA filler injections were safe and well tolerated with no adverse events reported during the study. Almost half the subjects (46.7%) reported having experienced no pain at all during the injections, with the remaining subjects reporting very low levels of pain, presumably because local anesthetic was administered before the filler and the filler product itself contains lidocaine anesthetic.

Limitations of this study include the small sample size, absence of a control group, and the use of only 1 filler. Baropodometric measurements were taken before and after the procedure to determine injection volume requirements under each metatarsal head and provide information on the distribution of mechanical stress, as well as posture. However, as this was the first clinical study to evaluate the decrease in plantar pain and the baropodometric pressure measurements were exploratory, the absolute baropodometric values were difficult to interpret because of the large volume of data obtained and further experiments are warranted to provide objective evidence of changes in pressure. Nevertheless, despite having suffered from metatarsalgia for a long time (mean duration of 9 years), the pain assessment results of all subjects consistently demonstrated that the HA filler injections alleviated the pain and discomfort associated with wearing high-heeled shoes and this effect was maintained over 6 months. Although pain assessments are inherently subjective in nature and results are not clinically visible, it is noteworthy that a third of subjects reported that they felt no pain at all when wearing high-heeled shoes at 6 months after the HA injections, clearly illustrating the effectiveness of the HA filler injections.

### Guiding treatment for foot pain [^3353483a]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

In the electrodiagnostic (EDX) approach of the patient who presents with foot pain, numbness, and/or tingling, it is important to consider a broad differential diagnosis of both neuropathic and nonneuropathic conditions, including focal and systemic causes. This article assists the electromyographer in the selection and utilization of the most appropriate EDX studies for evaluation. The EDX findings and impression can then help guide potential treatment options for the patient with foot pain and other symptoms. Moreover, this discussion demonstrates the added value that EDX evaluation of the foot provides to the comprehensive assessment of foot pain.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^df4c6164]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain—initial nonoperative management states that initial treatment options may include padding and strapping of the foot, therapeutic orthotic insoles, oral anti-inflammatories, and a corticosteroid injection localized to the area of maximum tenderness; patient-directed treatments appear to be as important as these approaches in resolving symptoms.

### Nonoperative management of hallux limitus using a novel forefoot orthosis [^594a8410]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallux limitus is among the most common arthritides of the foot and ankle, with increasing incidence in the aging population. Despite its prevalence and disease burden, treatment of the condition remains poorly understood. Many patients will fail initial conservative management, whereas controversy exists surrounding indications for and outcomes of surgery. The present study sought to examine the impact of a novel forefoot orthosis on foot function, pain, and plantar pressure distributions in patients with symptomatic hallux limitus. Nineteen adult patients completed a questionnaire consisting of the 23-item Foot Function Index and a 10-point visual analogue scale measuring pain. Standing pedobarographic maps were generated using a foot scanning system. Participants were instructed to wear the orthosis in athletic shoes for 4 weeks. Eighteen participants (94.7%) experienced improvements in foot function and pain, with 12 (63.2%) reporting complete resolution of pain at the end of the 4-week trial. Mean Foot Function Index scores improved significantly from 43.0% at baseline to 11.0% with the orthosis (p < .001). Similarly, mean visual analogue scale pain scores decreased significantly from 4.87 to 1.18 (p < .001). Pedobarographic analysis while wearing the orthosis demonstrated increased ability of participants to bear weight on the arthritic hallux metatarsophalangeal joint and restoration of physiologic stance. Compared to existing products, the device was well tolerated and did not require footwear modifications or impede normal gait. Overall, the orthosis offers an appealing solution to patients dissatisfied with existing treatment options as well as those who may be averse to or ineligible for surgery.

### Family practice international (...) [^c8d80e03]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The patient may appear more profoundly hypotensive than expected from the injury. Abnormal findings on electrocardiography include changes in ST and T waves, and ventricular arrhythmias and conduction delay. Elevations of cardiac enzymes are common because of direct arterial damage and contusion of the myocardium. Echocardiography is recommended for any patient with ECG changes following chest trauma, and early angiography should be considered. Patients who appear to do well initially may develop serious complications later from arterial damage or associated cardiac ischemia. Morton's Neuroma Morton's neuroma occurs in the third intermetatarsal space and may be related to foot conditions or the use of shoes that cause excessive angulation of the metatarsals. Pain is usually felt in the lateral forefoot, often with paraesthesiae shooting into the toes. Walking exacerbates the pain and tingling.

The differential diagnosis of Morton's neuroma includes stress fracture, synovitis, proximal nerve entrapment or metatarsalgia. The patient may limp and have increased pain when raising the calf. Local tenderness can be elicited over the neuroma, and the mass may be appreciated on examination by a “click” as it moves between the metatarsal heads. A plain radiograph can rule out fracture, tumor and infection, but ultrasound may be the best investigation to visualize the neuroma. Symptoms often can be controlled with conservative therapy based on avoidance of pressures on the foot and the use of pads to separate the metatarsal heads. Pain can be alleviated with localized injection of steroids. Surgery is indicated only if conservative therapy fails. A chest radiograph is essential if pneumothorax is suspected and can provide useful information about other conditions.

When selecting and prioritizing other investigations, the severity of the patient's condition and the most probable diagnosis should be considered. Indicators of severe or life-threatening dyspnea include a respiratory rate of more than 25 breaths per minute, tachycardia greater than 110 beats per minute or bradycardia, a peak expiratory flow of less than 40 percent of predicted value, lower partial pressure of oxygen and elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide, confusion or exhaustion, and difficulty in completing sentences.

### Chevron versus mitchell osteotomy in hallux valgus surgery: a comparative study [^683f610e]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Good clinical results have been reported for chevron and Mitchell osteotomies in mild hallux valgus (HV). The primary aim of the present study was to compare first metatarsal shortening after chevron and Mitchell osteotomies in HV. The secondary outcome measures were the degree of valgus correction, metatarsalgia, and patient satisfaction. A total of 84 patients were included in the present study and were treated from 2005 to 2007; 42 patients were in each group. The outcome measurements-first metatarsal length, HV angle, 1-2 intermetatarsal angle, satisfaction, and metatarsalgia-were taken preoperatively and at follow-up. The Mitchell osteotomy resulted in a significantly larger decrease in the first metatarsal length. No significant difference in transfer metatarsalgia was found. Approximately 30% of patients were mildly or not satisfied after HV surgery. Mitchell osteotomy leads to a larger decrease in the first metatarsal length. Patients with metatarsalgia performed poorly, and no significant differences in metatarsalgia were found. Preventing postoperative metatarsalgia is important for a successful outcome after HV surgery.
