## Question

Explain the importance of regular eye exams for diabetic retinopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the importance of regular eye exams for diabetic retinopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the burden and natural history of diabetic retinopathy to frame why screening matters. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence that regular exams reduce vision loss. Next, I will review guideline-based screening intervals and how they vary by diabetes type, retinopathy severity, and pregnancy. After that, I need to examine real-world adherence gaps and their consequences. Finally, I will consider implementation strategies, including telemedicine and AI, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with clear takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the disease burden and why it matters clinically. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of new blindness in working-age adults, and its prevalence rises with diabetes duration; importantly, early disease is often asymptomatic, so patients may not notice changes until vision is threatened, which is precisely why screening is critical to prevent irreversible loss [^45a75993] [^fd4ebfd4].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of preventable vision loss. Multiple sources converge on the same estimate: with early detection and timely treatment, about 90% of diabetes-related vision loss is preventable, which establishes a compelling case for routine screening from a public health and individual patient perspective [^23a0c2a4] [^70b0be7e].

> I need to check the natural history to ensure the screening cadence aligns with progression risk. DR progresses from nonproliferative to proliferative forms and can develop macular edema; progression is influenced by glycemic control, blood pressure, and duration of diabetes, and early stages are typically silent, reinforcing the need for scheduled exams rather than symptom-driven care [^fcd3c01d] [^563c0cb8].

> Next, I should review guideline-based screening intervals and make sure I distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes. For type 1 diabetes, the ADA recommends an initial dilated exam within 5 years of diagnosis, then annually thereafter, whereas for type 2 diabetes, the first exam should occur at diagnosis given the high prevalence of existing retinopathy, with annual exams thereafter; if multiple annual exams show no retinopathy and glycemic control is good, extending to every 1–2 years may be reasonable, but any retinopathy warrants at least annual exams and more frequent follow-up if disease is progressing or sight-threatening [^8fb59f82] [^f76e6469] [^2235a2cb].

> Hold on, I should verify pregnancy-specific guidance because progression risk increases. For preexisting diabetes, exams should occur before conception or early in the first trimester, with monitoring every trimester and for 1 year postpartum based on severity; gestational diabetes alone does not require routine retinal screening during pregnancy, which I should explicitly state to avoid over-screening [^08053dcc] [^c3a29f1b].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations to ensure I don't overgeneralize adult intervals. Youth with type 1 diabetes should have an initial exam within 5 years of diagnosis and then annually, while youth with type 2 diabetes should be screened at or soon after diagnosis and annually thereafter; less frequent exams may be considered only if glycemic goals are met and exams are normal, but this requires ophthalmologist judgment [^0dcff046] [^ded22c21] [^13c64b2f].

> Next, I should review how severity modifies follow-up. Mild nonproliferative DR is generally followed annually, moderate NPDR every 6–12 months, and severe NPDR or proliferative DR every 3–6 months; the presence of diabetic macular edema, particularly center-involved, typically accelerates follow-up and prompts treatment referral, which I need to emphasize to align screening with action thresholds [^fcd3c01d] [^8fb59f82].

> But wait, what about real-world adherence; I should double-check the magnitude of the gap. National data show only about 54–60% of people with diabetes receive annual eye exams, and many are unaware they have retinopathy; barriers include cost, transportation, lack of perceived need, and limited access to eye care professionals, all of which contribute to preventable vision loss despite strong evidence for screening benefit [^cecec82e] [^b67a717f] [^98f54617].

> Let me consider implementation strategies that meaningfully increase uptake. Telemedicine with validated retinal imaging and remote grading, including FDA-cleared AI systems, can expand access and maintain quality when paired with clear referral pathways; community-based screening, transportation assistance, and education interventions also improve adherence, though multifaceted approaches are often needed to sustain impact [^138d1c0b] [^3ae6e203] [^eb4b78b7].

> I should confirm the role of the exam modality. Dilated fundus examination remains the gold standard for comprehensive assessment, but high-quality retinal photography with expert interpretation or validated AI can be effective screening tools, particularly in underserved settings; importantly, abnormal results or non-gradable images must trigger a comprehensive dilated exam and appropriate referral to preserve the screening-to-treatment continuum [^98f54617] [^138d1c0b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal annual screening for all eternity; I need to ensure risk stratification is explicit. For low-risk patients with consistently normal exams and good glycemic control, extending intervals to every 1–2 years can be reasonable, whereas high-risk patients with poor control, longer duration, or existing retinopathy warrant more frequent surveillance; this balances benefit, burden, and cost while maintaining safety [^f76e6469] [^2235a2cb] [^d602c67d].

> Let me synthesize the clinical takeaways succinctly. Regular, guideline-concordant eye exams are the cornerstone of preventing vision loss from diabetic retinopathy because they detect asymptomatic disease when treatment is most effective; early detection plus timely laser, anti-VEGF therapy, or surgery prevents progression to blindness in the vast majority, and individualized, risk-based intervals ensure efficient, equitable care across diverse populations [^23a0c2a4] [^70b0be7e] [^8fb59f82].

Regular eye exams are essential for diabetic retinopathy because **early detection prevents vision loss** [^45a75993] — over 90% of diabetes-related blindness can be avoided with timely treatment [^23a0c2a4]. DR is often **asymptomatic until advanced** [^c18deeac], so annual dilated exams enable early intervention before irreversible damage occurs [^8fb59f82]. Screening also identifies other diabetes-related eye diseases (glaucoma, cataracts) and supports broader diabetes care by revealing systemic risk [^20154c10] [^863526d8]. Because progression risk rises with duration and poor control, **annual exams are recommended** for most patients, with more frequent visits if retinopathy is present or worsening [^f76e6469] [^45d6fb3f]. Telemedicine and AI can expand access, but results must be communicated to the diabetes care team to ensure coordinated management [^138d1c0b] [^fd98f91b].

---

## Prevalence and progression of diabetic retinopathy

- **Prevalence**: DR affects about 35% of people with diabetes, and 10% have vision-threatening forms [^dc527c14].
- **Progression**: DR progresses from mild non-proliferative changes to severe proliferative disease and macular edema, risking permanent vision loss [^fcd3c01d].
- **Asymptomatic nature**: Early DR is typically silent, so patients may not notice changes until vision is irreversibly damaged [^c18deeac].

---

## Benefits of regular eye examinations

### Early detection and prevention of vision loss

Early detection enables timely treatment that can **prevent or halt progression** to vision-threatening DR [^fd4ebfd4]. Prevention of vision loss is achievable because more than 90% of diabetes-related vision loss can be avoided with early detection and treatment [^23a0c2a4].

---

### Identification of other diabetes-related eye conditions

Identification of **coexisting conditions** such as glaucoma and cataracts, which occur earlier and more frequently in diabetes, is another key benefit [^20154c10]. Comprehensive care is supported when eye exams reveal systemic risk factors and complications, prompting coordinated management [^863526d8].

---

### Monitoring disease progression

Monitoring allows **adjustment of follow-up intervals** based on retinopathy severity and progression, ensuring timely intervention [^f76e6469]. Personalized care is facilitated by tailoring treatment to disease stage and patient-specific risk factors [^d602c67d].

---

## Recommended frequency of eye examinations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended frequency** |
|-|-|
| Type 1 diabetes | Initial exam within 5 years of diagnosis, then annually [^8fb59f82] [^2cd2c0f6] |
| Type 2 diabetes | At diagnosis, then annually [^8fb59f82] [^0d72cdbf] |
| Pregnancy (preexisting diabetes) | Before conception or early first trimester, then each trimester and 1 year postpartum [^08053dcc] [^c3a29f1b] |
| No retinopathy, well-controlled | Every 1–2 years (individualized) [^f76e6469] [^2235a2cb] |
| Any retinopathy present | At least annually; more frequent if progressing [^f76e6469] [^45d6fb3f] |

---

## Consequences of inadequate screening

Inadequate screening leads to **delayed diagnosis**, allowing progression to advanced, sight-threatening DR and irreversible vision loss [^fd4ebfd4]. Increased burden results from higher direct and indirect costs as disease severity and complications rise [^d797420c]. Persistent disparities in access and adherence perpetuate unequal outcomes across populations [^cecec82e].

---

## Advances in screening technologies

- **Telemedicine**: Remote retinal imaging expands access, especially in underserved areas [^fd4ebfd4].
- **Artificial intelligence**: FDA-cleared AI can detect more-than-mild DR and streamline screening workflows [^138d1c0b] [^d602c67d].
- **Integration**: Digital platforms enable continuous monitoring and education, improving engagement and outcomes [^5116ad82].

---

## Role of healthcare providers and patients

Healthcare providers should **educate patients** on the importance of regular eye exams and reinforce adherence at each visit [^ecdedfe2]. Patients should prioritize annual dilated exams, maintain glycemic control, and promptly report vision changes [^9dfb9a8f].

---

Regular eye exams are a cornerstone of diabetes care because they enable **early detection and treatment** of diabetic retinopathy, preventing vision loss and revealing systemic risks. Annual dilated exams are recommended for most patients, with individualized intervals based on retinopathy status and risk, and emerging technologies can improve access and efficiency when integrated with coordinated care [^8fb59f82] [^138d1c0b].

Recommendations for regular eye examinations and screening

In managing DR, equipping patients with the ability to recognise early symptoms and seek professional medical help when necessary is critical in preventing severe vision loss. Highlighting the importance of regular eye examinations is essential, as it aids in the early detection and intervention of DR, thereby potentially halting or slowing the disease’s progression.

Moreover, effective patient education goes beyond merely imparting disease knowledge; it critically aims at enhancing patients’ awareness and their self-management capabilities.This encompasses, among other practices, the establishment of healthy lifestyle habits, such as maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in moderate exercise, as well as the correct use of medication.By improving patients’ self-management skills, the risk of DR and other diabetes complications can be significantly reduced, thereby improving the patients’ quality of life.

Recent studies underscore the efficacy of educational interventions in enhancing self-care management and knowledge among patients with DR. For instance, an educational intervention study by Safaan et al demonstrated significant improvement in self-care practices among patients with DR, emphasising the vital role of such interventions in patient care.

Another study by Mostafa evaluated the effectiveness of an educational programme in improving the knowledge of critically ill patients with DR, further highlighting the critical role of health education in managing this condition.

These findings advocate for the integration of structured educational programmes into DR management strategies, aiming to enhance patient knowledge, self-care practices, and ultimately, quality of life. This approach not only addresses the immediate needs of patients with DR but also aligns with broader objectives of diabetes management, emphasising the importance of patient education and empowerment in chronic disease management.

Patient support and resources

In managing DR, it is essential to provide patients with comprehensive support and resources. These include patient support groups, educational materials, online resources and specialised diabetes management teams, all aimed at delivering detailed information and guidance on daily disease management, available treatment options and recommended lifestyle adjustments.

Patient support groups are invaluable, offering psychological and emotional support that helps patients understand and manage their condition, share experiences and gain treatment insights. This support significantly alleviates the psychological burden and feelings of isolation, fostering a positive attitude towards disease management challenges.

Educational materials and online resources grant patients access to the latest research findings, treatment methods and management strategies. Designed to be easily understandable and cater to patients’ needs, these resources empower patients to make informed medical decisions and enhance their self-management capabilities.

### Narrative review of comprehensive management strategies for diabetic retinopathy: interdisciplinary approaches and future perspectives [^5116ad82]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Policy support and funding from governments and non-governmental organisations are essential to promote research and implementation of innovative solutions in DR management. Funding for remote medical projects, community health programmes and infrastructure construction can not only improve DR treatment outcomes but also improve patients’ quality of life. In addition, encouraging private sector investment in health technology development can further promote innovation and optimisation of DR treatment methods.

In summary, the above-mentioned efforts and innovative strategies can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of DR management, even in resource-limited settings, and offer a brighter future for patients with DR. This will require the joint participation and continued efforts of medical professionals, policy-makers and all sectors of society to ensure that technological advances benefit all patients.

Interdisciplinary management

Telemedicine and digital platforms for early detection and continuous monitoring

In the landscape of DR management, telemedicine and digital platforms represent a transformative shift towards more accessible, efficient and patient-centred healthcare.This paradigm shift is largely driven by advances in digital health technologies, including high-resolution retinal imaging and sophisticated data analytics, which have enabled remote diagnosis and monitoring of DR with a level of precision previously only available in clinical settings.

A key component of these digital platforms is their ability to seamlessly integrate with existing healthcare infrastructures, enabling the smooth transfer of retinal images and patient data between remote primary care providers and specialised ophthalmology centres.This integration not only facilitates early detection of DR by expanding access to specialised diagnostic tools but also ensures that patients receive timely referrals for treatment, thereby preventing progression of the disease to more severe stages.

In addition, these platforms often include educational modules tailored to the needs of patients with diabetes. Through the use of multimedia resources and interactive tools, patients can gain a deeper understanding of their condition, learn about the importance of regular eye exams and become more engaged in their care plans.This educational component is critical as it empowers patients to take proactive steps to manage their diabetes and maintain their eye health, further contributing to positive outcomes.

The continuous monitoring capabilities of these digital platforms also play a crucial role in the management of DR. Through wearable devices or smartphone applications, patients can regularly capture retinal images, which are then automatically analysed by AI algorithms for signs of disease progression.This real-time monitoring allows healthcare providers to adjust treatment plans as needed, ensuring that interventions are as effective as possible. Additionally, these platforms can send reminders to patients for medication adherence and scheduled eye exams, further supporting patient engagement and treatment compliance.

Patient management and education

Patient management and education play a key role in the comprehensive management of DR.Patient management and education strategies are shown in figure 3. The following is a detailed introduction to this aspect.

Figure 3 
Patient management and education. The diagram illustrates comprehensive strategies for the management and education of patients with diabetic retinopathy, including the significance of self-management education, the recommended protocol for regular eye examinations and measures for providing support and resources to patients.

The importance of patient self-management education

Patient self-management education is critical for controlling diabetes and its complications, including DR.This includes providing knowledge on how to monitor and control blood glucose levels, understanding how diet and exercise affect blood glucose levels, and managing daily life with diabetes.This educational process aims to deepen patients’ understanding of diabetes and its complications, especially how to effectively monitor and control blood glucose levels and the impact of diet and exercise on glycaemic control.Through such education, patients’ self-management skills can be improved, reducing the risk of disease progression and improving quality of life.

### Determining direct, indirect healthcare and social costs for diabetic retinopathy management: a systematic review [^d797420c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Studies have found that the financial burden associated with the management of DR is exorbitant, encompassing both direct and indirect costs. All studies concluded that direct and indirect DR costs are considerable and challenging to control, particularly as the disease severity worsens.

To mitigate the diabetic retinopathy burden, we should focus on preventive methods like regular eye screening, control of blood sugar, and control of risk factors that will delay the progression into advanced DR changes.

The difference between direct and indirect costs is tremendous; the cost charge from country to country is different, which has to play another role for the DR management.

### Dilated eye examination screening guideline compliance among patients with diabetes without a diabetic retinopathy diagnosis: the role of geographic access [^036b6920]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Dilated eye examination guideline compliance among patients with diabetes mellitus is low.
Quality of access to public transportation was positively correlated with screening compliance.
Transportation assistance interventions and more comprehensive community-based screening models need to be developed and tested.

The number of American adults 20 years of age and older living with diabetes mellitus (DM) has increased by approximately 75% over the past two decades, with the largest absolute increases in prevalence occurring in those 65 years of age and older.Symptoms of the early stages of DM are frequently missed; in 2010, there were an estimated seven million Americans of all ages living with undiagnosed diabetes.Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of DM; the risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the number of years of living with this condition.Diabetes treatment is complex and poor management is a major risk factor for the development of retinopathy.Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in US adults over the age of 40 despite the availability of effective treatment.By 2050, the number of Americans aged 40 years or older and living with DM is expected to triple to 16 million, with over 3 million having advanced vision-threatening disease.

Early detection of diabetic retinopathy is critical, given that prompt treatment increases the likelihood of preserving vision.Unfortunately, many adults living with DM remain unaware of their ocular condition until their diabetic retinopathy has progressed to a stage at which treatment is difficult.The American Academy of Ophthalmology, to encourage early detection of diabetic retinopathy, endorses annual dilated eye examinations for patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes.Additionally, the American Diabetes Association recommends annual dilated eye examinations after diagnosis of DM, although the guidelines leave some flexibility for less frequent ocular examinations by ophthalmologists or optometrists in the presence of one or more normal eye examination results.

Unfortunately, not everyone who should do so receives annual dilated eye examinations. Factors which influence screening compliance include lack of insurance and healthcare access, knowledge of diabetes-specific ocular risk, and health literacy, cultural, and language barriers.An analysis of Medicare claims data found that slightly more than 50% of patients with newly diagnosed DM had at least one 15-month gap between eye examinations during the first 30 months of living with this condition.Among enrollees of an independent practice association, only 16% of those with diabetes underwent annual eye examination in two consecutive years.Yearly reminders to those enrolled in one large managed care organization yielded only a 28% 1-year reexamination rate.

### Eye care providers' emerging roles in early detection of diabetes and management of diabetic changes to the ocular surface: a review [^d25a0e25]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity, prediabetes and diabetes are growing exponentially—worldwide, and especially in the USA.The effect of diabetes on the retina has been well classified, but there is growing research on the profound effects of metabolic disease on the front of the eye. In the USA, adults visit eye care providers more often than primary healthcare providers, placing eye doctors in a prime position to lead the care and research in this area.Unfortunately, diabetes is often first diagnosed in eye clinics in an advanced stage, only after visible signs of diabetic retinopathy appear. Standardized, non-invasive, early detection tests in an eye care setting could help to reduce the risk for disease onset and/or progression. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the clinical outcomes of obesity, prediabetes and diabetes on the ocular surface, and explore new research which may someday be applied to help identify and better refer patients with undiagnosed prediabetes and diabetes.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^8a5b448b]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

American Optometric Association—Retinal complications of diabetes mellitus—examination frequency guidance states that regular, ongoing examinations are needed for individuals with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and persons with diabetes should have an eye examination more frequently than persons with no history of ocular or general health problems. The recommended frequency is determined by factors including type and duration of diabetes, age, adherence and understanding of treatment, concurrent medical status, ocular findings and symptoms, and subjective vision changes. For individualized schedules when intensive glycemic control is maintained, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial recommended persons with no retinopathy could be reevaluated every four years, mild NPDR every three years, moderate NPDR every six months, and severe NPDR every three months (Evidence Grade: B). Another study suggested three-year retinal examination intervals for persons with mild type 2 diabetes and no retinopathy (Evidence Grade: C). A systematic review favored a reexamination interval greater than one year, but no longer than two years for people with no diabetic retinopathy at diagnosis, found this interval appropriate, safe, and cost-effective, indicated that in high-risk patients with poor glycemic or blood pressure control more frequent examination may be warranted, and stated that a reexamination interval of one year or less would be preferable for people with any diabetic retinopathy on a previous examination (Evidence Grade: B).

Retinopathy Screening and Treatment

General recommendations

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of retinopathy, optimize glycemic control. (A)
To reduce the risk or slow the progression of retinopathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Adults and children aged 10 years or older with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. (B)
Patients with type 2 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes. (B)
Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients should be repeated annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Less frequent exams (every 2–3 years) may be considered following one or more normal eye exams. Examinations will be required more frequently if retinopathy is progressing. (B)
Women with preexisting diabetes who are planning pregnancy or who have become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye examination and be counseled on the risk of development and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy. Eye examination should occur in the first trimester with close follow-up throughout pregnancy and for 1 year postpartum. (B)

Treatment

Promptly refer patients with any level of macular edema, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), or any proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) to an ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. (A)
Laser photocoagulation therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with high-risk PDR, clinically significant macular edema, and in some cases of severe NPDR. (A)
The presence of retinopathy is not a contraindication to aspirin therapy for cardioprotection, as this therapy does not increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage. (A)

Neuropathy Screening and Treatment

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter using simple clinical tests. (B)
Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. (E)
Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. (E)
Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient. (E)

- Pay close attention to any changes in their vision since many eye problems do not show obvious symptoms.
- Learn more about diabetes and vision loss. Let patients know that managing their blood glucose levels and overall health can reduce their risk of visual impairment.

Take these 5 actions to help your patients 1. Know the risks of vision loss and eye diseases for diabetes patients. People with diabetes are at a higher risk of vision loss and eye diseases. However, 60% of people with diabetes do not get annual eye exams. Statistics
- The risk of blindness is 25 times higher in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.
- Glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye disorders occur earlier and more often in people with diabetes compared to those without.
- Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults.
- Diabetic retinopathy is projected to affect 16 million people with diabetes by 2050.
- Evidence supports that using medication to lower blood glucose levels can reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy by 25%.
- More than 90% of diabetes-related vision loss can be avoided with early detection and treatment.
3. Ask your patients about their eye health at each visit.

For example:
- Do you get a comprehensive eye exam with dilated pupils at least once a year.
- Do you know how diabetes can affect your eyes.
- Do you know what to do if you suddenly have a change in your vision. You can refer your patients to an eye health specialist or provide them with more information about recommended eye care for people with diabetes.
4. Help your patients see the connection between diabetes management and healthy vision. Use the following pointers to support healthy diabetes management for your patients: .

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^b0d952c8]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus—retinopathy screening and management: We suggest screening for retinopathy at least every other year (biennial screening) for patients who have had no retinopathy on all previous examinations. More frequent retinal examinations in such patients should be considered when risk factors associated with an increased rate of progression of retinopathy are present. Patients with existing retinopathy should be managed in conjunction with an eye care professional and examined at intervals deemed appropriate for the level of retinopathy.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^65cbc9a2]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion—Vision impairment from diabetes is a significant public health problem which affects the health, economic well-being, and productivity of individuals, families, and society as a whole. Steps to prevent visual impairment in persons with diabetes include optimal glycemic control, the treatment of ancillary risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels, and ongoing comprehensive eye examinations for the early detection and, when needed, treatment of eye and vision problems. All persons with diabetes should be informed of the possibility of developing retinopathy or other nonretinal ocular complications, with or without symptoms, and of the associated threat of vision loss. The natural course and treatment of diabetic retinopathy should be discussed with the person, and the importance of lifelong eye examinations should be stressed; they should be made aware of the benefits of early diagnosis and available treatment options in preserving vision, and should be advised of the availability of vision rehabilitation services to address functional vision issues and provided with referral or treatment for diabetes-related vision loss. Until therapies are available to prevent or cure diabetic retinopathy and other ocular complications of diabetes, emphasis must be placed on diagnosis, careful follow-up, and timely treatment, and doctors of optometry may be the first to examine persons with signs of diabetes or diabetic retinopathy; therefore, they have a key role in identifying individuals with undiagnosed diabetes and reinforcing the importance of diabetes control and appropriate follow-up care to lower the risk for vision loss.

### Dilated eye examination screening guideline compliance among patients with diabetes without a diabetic retinopathy diagnosis: the role of geographic access [^eb4b78b7]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Alternately, results of the present analysis suggest that dispersed eye care access throughout communities could be more effective in increasing dilated eye examination compliance rates.Such screening efforts could specifically target communities with poor transportation access, and could include ongoing efforts to educate those living with diabetes on the importance of regular eye examinations. However, the challenges of increasing compliance rates, particularly in underserved communities, cannot be overemphasized.For example, one previous intervention targeting low-income urban diabetic adults who had not had a recent eye examination found that telephone prompts led to an increased 6-month dilated eye examination rate over those randomized to receive mailed prompts. However, rates for both groups remained suboptimal: 34% vs 20%.Embedding a telemedicine screening program within a federally qualified health center targeting the medically underserved nearly doubled the proportion of diabetic patients who were screening compliant; however, the overall percentage of compliant patients was still below 25%.Our findings, combined with the aforementioned modest intervention results, raise the possibility that in order to substantially increase dilated eye examination rates in the medically underserved urban populations, it may be necessary to combine direct marketing of eye care opportunities, such as tailored phone interventions and intensive community engagement, for the purposes of educating target populations on the need for regular eye examinations. This approach could be combined with eye care modalities delivered via mobile examination units sent directly to patient addresses or to nearby community centers. There has been some success in the use of community health workers to facilitate screening compliance and follow-up rates targeting other conditions; therefore, programs with high visibility, ease of access, and embedded within integrative chronic care models may gradually reduce the number of persons with diabetes who do not undergo annual eye examinations, while simultaneously improving overall diabetes care management.

Study limitations

Our study was limited by the incomplete follow-up of those judged to be noncompliant based on a medical record review. We had only limited success in reaching these patients by phone or mail. Therefore, our compliance rate of 31% is most likely an underestimate of the true rate. This misclassification may have also influenced our ability to accurately identify predictors of compliance. Our relatively small sample size, combined with lack of information in the medical record, prevented us from examining the role of language barriers in compliance rates. Finally, this study took place in an urban setting, so results may not generalize to those living in suburban and rural settings.

### Action on diabetic macular oedema: achieving optimal patient management in treating visual impairment due to diabetic eye disease [^51c46982]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Findings from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) reiterate that long-term success in optimisation of glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c can be challenging.Investigators from DRCR.net identified a need for frequent educational interaction and additional communication with local primary diabetes care providers, as part of a comprehensive approach to the management of vision loss due to DR and DMO.People with diabetes need education to manage their condition and need to be informed of the risks to their sight early in the management of their diabetes care to ensure good compliance with regular eye checks.

Greater collaboration between eye health professionals and general practitioners, practice nurses and community-based diabetes care providers is recommended in order to ensure better coordinated follow-up and timely assessment of diabetes patients with related eye disease. Broader utilisation of and access to community-based diabetes care regimens can be expected to improve standards of patient care, and contribute to greater awareness of the need for improved glycaemic control to reduce diabetes-related complications and morbidity.

Evidence from randomised controlled trials supports treatment of proliferative DR and DMO to prevent progressive vision loss and imaging plays a valuable role in surveillance.Diabetes specialist nurses can help allay patient anxiety, reinforce knowledge of the value of adherence to treatment regimens and encourage appropriate health behaviours.

As an integral part of the patient pathway, ophthalmologists and other healthcare professionals play a vital role in disease management by encouraging and educating patients with DR and/or DMO to achieve important health targets, particularly for blood glucose and blood pressure control, to reduce the risk of progression of vascular complications and preserve visual function.

Summary: Action on DMO: best practice principles.
Foster closer working relationships between diabetes management, general practitioners, and ophthalmology specialties.
Consider the benefits of establishing a dedicated DMO eye clinic service for management and follow-up of patients with diabetic eye disease, for example, facilitate integration of a DSN-led review service and enhance efficiency of diabetes care.
Explore aspirations and opportunities to expand the role of the DSN in the hospital eye clinic, with the specialist nurse acting as the main hub between ophthalmology, endocrinology, diabetology, and primary care services/support.
Tailor clinical practice and follow-up initiatives to improve treatment adherence in DMO.
Set realistic patient expectations when initiating treatment of DMO.
Perform a regular audit of practice outcomes and benchmark performance, preferably using an EMR system.

### Behavioral economics and diabetic eye exams [^265c68cf]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of new blindness among working-age adults in the United States. Timely intervention to prevent vision loss is possible with early detection by regular eye examinations. Unfortunately, adherence to recommended annual diabetic eye exams is poor. Public health interventions have targeted traditional barriers to care, such as cost and transportation, with limited success. Behavioral economics provides an additional framework of concepts and tools to understand low screening rates and to promote regular diabetic eye exams for populations at risk. In particular, behavioral economics outlines biases and heuristics that affect decision-making and underlie pervasive barriers to care, such as not viewing diabetic eye exams as a priority or perceiving oneself as too healthy to need an examination. In this review, we examine the literature on the use of behavioral economics interventions to promote regular diabetic eye exams. From the results of the included studies, we outline how concepts from behavioral economics can improve eye examination rates. In particular, the default bias, present bias, and self-serving bias play a significant role in precluding regular diabetic eye examinations. Potential tools to mitigate these biases include leveraging default options, using reminder messages, providing behavioral coaching, applying commitment contracts, offering financial incentives, and personalizing health messages. When combined with traditional public health campaigns, insights from behavioral economics can improve understanding of pervasive barriers to care and offer additional strategies to promote regular preventive eye care for patients with diabetes.

### Diabetic retinopathy in 2011: further insights from new epidemiological studies and clinical trials [^c455b4d0]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

While the article by Zavrelova et al. shows distinct developmental patterns of DR and associated specific risk factors, it has some shortcomings that future studies should focus on. The most significant one is a lack of information associated with the profile of each cluster that could lead to the optimization of treatment by targeting different patient groups. An understanding of the role of the duration of diabetes across these clusters is also lacking and needs to de further investigated. From a public health perspective, improving our understanding of who is unlikely to progress (or even likely to regress) has economic and clinical implications on differential possible screening intervals in selected patients. Such patients, for example, could be screened yearly for 2 or even 3 times. Conversely, those at higher risk of progression require more frequent monitoring. Another important area of future research is to understand whether patients can change from one cluster to another. For example, it would be interesting to investigate whether these data could be used to help patients who are likely “progressors” to improve their glucose management. Future work investigating these limitations would have significant implications and extend on the findings reported by Zavrelova et al.

In conclusion, considering the current high prevalence estimates of DR and vision-threatening DR and the anticipated tripling of the number of people worldwide to develop type 2 diabetes by 2040, the finding that over 90% of that population are not at risk for developing severe DR in the short term is quite promising. A longer follow-up period (>15–20 years with regular eye examinations) for these patients is therefore warranted to ascertain if this phenomenon persists longitudinally, and what risk factors are associated with progression if it is evident; inform patients about the progression of DR in the three progressive clusters; and finally, optimize these data to better inform patients of the public health initiatives and clinical practices.

Exploring the role of the DSN in diabetic ophthalmic practice

The DSN role exists to educate and support people living with diabetes and their families at all stages of their lives, motivating people to self-manage their diabetes as effectively as possible. The DSN provides expertise as part of dedicated diabetes teams and assists other healthcare professionals in the care they provide. Considered the patient's advocate, the DSN can act as a valuable bridge between healthcare professionals and services in primary, secondary and integrated care. Nurse-led structured education programmes encourage people to manage modifiable risk factors for onset and progression of diabetic eye disease, by optimising control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure and lipid management.

Careful instructions are provided on when and how to self-test blood glucose and what to do with the results. Smoking cessation is stressed, as is the importance of regular eye examination for early identification and initiation of care for patients with retinopathy. The main modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes are overweight and obesity, insufficient physical activity and unhealthy dietary practices.Results of a parallel-group, randomised controlled trial at 56 primary care practices in Central and South United Kingdom found that an internet-based intervention with brief practice nurse support helped people maintain clinically important weight reductions over 12 months.

### Systemic considerations in the management of diabetic retinopathy [^563c0cb8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To highlight the systemic factors which affect onset and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to emphasize the role and responsibilities of ophthalmologists and other eye care providers to ensure that appropriate systemic medical evaluation of the patient with diabetes is being pursued.

Design

Literature review of publications relevant to diabetic retinopathy, blood glucose control, diabetes mellitus type, hypertension, renal disease, elevated serum lipids, exercise, pregnancy, anticoagulation, thrombolysis, smoking, anemia and antioxidant ingestion.

Findings

Intensive blood glucose control and control of systemic hypertension reduce the risk of new onset DR and slow the progression of existing DR. Severe DR may be an indicator of renal disease while severe renal disease and its treatment can affect the progression of DR. Elevated serum lipids are associated with macular exudate and moderate visual loss. Certain types of excessive exercise in patients with advanced stages of retinopathy may aggravate vitreous hemorrhage. During pregnancy, DR should be monitored closely as transient progression of DR can occur. Therapeutic anticoagulation and thrombolysis are not contraindicated at any stage of DR. Anemia can result in progression of DR, smoking in general should be discouraged, and the role of antioxidant therapy requires further study.

Conclusions

Blindness from diabetic retinopathy is now largely preventable with timely detection and appropriate interventional therapy. Routine, repetitive, lifelong, expert clinical retinal examination is essential for the fundamental ophthalmic care of the patient with diabetes. However, diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease and thus optimal ophthalmic care must include diligent evaluation and treatment of concomitant systemic disorders that influence the development, progression and ultimate outcome of diabetic retinopathy. Optimization of these systemic considerations through an intensive, multi-disciplinary, healthcare team-based approach will maximize the ophthalmic and general health of these patients. Ophthalmologists and other eye care providers are critical members of this team with unique responsibilities to ensure that appropriate systemic medical evaluation is being pursued.

### Guidelines on diabetic eye care: the international council of ophthalmology recommendations for screening, follow-up, referral, and treatment based on resource settings [^3c975622]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic and affects populations in both developing and developed countries, with differing health care and resource levels. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of DM and a leading cause of vision loss in working middle-aged adults. Vision loss from DR can be prevented with broad-level public health strategies, but these need to be tailored to a country's and population's resource setting. Designing DR screening programs, with appropriate and timely referral to facilities with trained eye care professionals, and using cost-effective treatment for vision-threatening levels of DR can prevent vision loss. The International Council of Ophthalmology Guidelines for Diabetic Eye Care 2017 summarize and offer a comprehensive guide for DR screening, referral and follow-up schedules for DR, and appropriate management of vision-threatening DR, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative DR, for countries with high- and low- or intermediate-resource settings. The guidelines include updated evidence on screening and referral criteria, the minimum requirements for a screening vision and retinal examination, follow-up care, and management of DR and DME, including laser photocoagulation and appropriate use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors and, in specific situations, intravitreal corticosteroids. Recommendations for management of DR in patients during pregnancy and with concomitant cataract also are included. The guidelines offer suggestions for monitoring outcomes and indicators of success at a population level.

### Disparities in receipt of eye exams among Medicare part B (...) [^cecec82e]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Annual eye exams are an important preventive care practice for persons with diabetes. Early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases can prevent irreversible vision loss. What is added by this report. Nationally, 54. 1% of Medicare Part B fee-for-service beneficiaries with diabetes had an eye exam in
2017. Disparities by state and race/ethnicity were identified. 1). Diabetic retinopathy, the most common diabetes-related eye disease, affects 29% of U. S. adults aged ≥40 years with diabetes and is the leading cause of incident blindness among working-age adults. It is caused by chronically high blood glucose damaging blood vessels in the retina. † Annual dilated eye exams are recommended for persons with diabetes because early detection and timely treatment of diabetic eye diseases can prevent irreversible vision loss §, ¶.

Studies have documented prevalence of annual eye exams among U. S. adults with diabetes; however, a lack of recent state-level data limits identification of geographic disparities in adherence to this recommendation. Dilated eye exams are an important preventive care practice for early detection of diabetic retinopathy. Seventy-three percent of persons with diabetic retinopathy are unaware of their disease. Early detection and timely treatment can prevent irreversible vision loss. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of diabetic retinopathy screening among persons with diabetes is well established, and professional organizations recommend annual screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends that persons with diabetes have annual eye exams, with consideration of biennial exams if there is no evidence of retinopathy on at least one annual eye exam and blood glucose is controlled.

Although annual eye exams are covered for all Medicare Part B fee-for-service beneficiaries with diabetes, only approximately half of these beneficiaries received an eye exam in 2017. Geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in adherence to this preventive care practice were identified. This low prevalence of receipt of annual eye exams could have significant implications for vision loss from diabetes-related eye diseases. CDC’s Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System, which provides data on U. S. vision and eye health conditions and use of eye care, is an important tool to identify trends and assess eye health disparities among persons with diabetes.

### Five-year patterns of diabetic retinopathy progression in US clinical practice [^fcd3c01d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of adult-onset blindness worldwide.–DR is observable via retinal examination and regular screening is recommended for those with diabetes;,however, it may also be present in individuals who are unaware of their diabetes status.

The burden of DR is largely attributed to its progression from mild and asymptomatic to severe and vision-threatening. In earlier stages of nonproliferative DR (NPDR), damage to the retinal microvasculature occurs as a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia and manifests as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, and the development of diabetic macular edema (DME). Without appropriate treatment, the resulting retinal ischemia promotes neovascularization characteristic of proliferative DR (PDR), leading to vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, neovascular glaucoma, and severe vision loss.This progression is accompanied by worsening vision-related quality of life and increasing functional burden.

Clinical guidelines, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Preferred Practice Pattern ® and American Diabetes Association (ADA) Position Statement, recommend regular monitoring for patients with DR to track disease progression and identify those who require referral and/or treatment.Recommended follow-up intervals are dependent on DR severity and the presence of DME, and have been shortened in updated AAO guidance to promote closer monitoring of patients with more advanced disease.Eye examinations are recommended every 1–2 years for patients with diabetes and no evidence of DR and then annually for those with mild NPDR. Current ADA and AAO guidelines recommend follow-up intervals of 6–9 months and 6–12 months for patients with moderate NPDR, respectively, decreasing to every 3–6 months and 3–4 months for those with severe NPDR. ADA guidelines recommend that patients with PDR are monitored every 3 months, whereas the AAO recommends follow-up every 2–4 months, depending on the presence of early or high-risk PDR. In addition to closer monitoring, patients with severe NPDR and PDR are typically indicated for treatment, with panretinal laser photocoagulation and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy representing the preferred treatment strategies in clinical guidance. For patients across all stages of DR, more frequent monitoring and earlier treatment are advised when concurrent DME, particularly center-involved DME, is present.

### Association between diabetic eye disease and other complications of diabetes: implications for care. A systematic review [^863526d8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the associations between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the common micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and how these could potentially affect clinical practice. A structured search of the PubMed database identified studies of patients with diabetes that assessed the presence or development of DR in conjunction with other vascular complications of diabetes. From 70 included studies, we found that DR is consistently associated with other complications of diabetes, with the severity of DR linked to a higher risk of the presence of, or of developing, other micro- and macrovascular complications. In particular, DR increases the likelihood of having or developing nephropathy and is also a strong predictor of stroke and cardiovascular disease, and progression of DR significantly increases this risk. Proliferative DR is a strong risk factor for peripheral arterial disease, which carries a risk of lower extremity ulceration and amputation. Additionally, our findings suggest that a patient with DR has an overall worse prognosis than a patient without DR. In conclusion, this analysis highlights the need for a coordinated and collaborative approach to patient management. Given the widespread use of DR screening programmes that can be performed outside of an ophthalmology office, and the overall cost-effectiveness of DR screening, the presence and severity of DR can be a means of identifying patients at increased risk for micro- and macrovascular complications, enabling earlier detection, referral and intervention with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes. Healthcare professionals involved in the management of diabetes should encourage regular DR screening.

### Disparities in receipt of eye exams among Medicare part B fee-for-service beneficiaries with diabetes-United States, 2017 [^b67a717f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Dilated eye exams are an important preventive care practice for early detection of diabetic retinopathy. Seventy-three percent of persons with diabetic retinopathy are unaware of their disease. Early detection and timely treatment can prevent irreversible vision loss. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of diabetic retinopathy screening among persons with diabetes is well established, and professional organizations recommend annual screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends that persons with diabetes have annual eye exams, with consideration of biennial exams if there is no evidence of retinopathy on at least one annual eye exam and blood glucose is controlled.

Studies have documented enablers and barriers to obtaining regular eye exams. A study using a small sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years found that 37% had an eye exam at least once every 15 months during a 5-year period. Factors associated with more frequent eye exams included older age, being married, higher educational attainment, and a higher score on the Charleson Comorbidity Index (which predicts mortality for a patient with a range of comorbid conditions). Factors associated with lower frequency of eye exams included being male, living ≥20 miles from an ophthalmologist, low cognitive function, and limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (skills and abilities needed to perform certain day-to-day tasks associated with living independently). A study of adults with diabetes in 22 states found that the factors most commonly cited for not seeking annual eye care were not perceiving a need for care and cost or lack of insurance; other factors included a lack of transportation, distance to an eye doctor, and not having or knowing of an eye doctor. These findings highlight a lack of perception of the need for eye care and geographic and transportation barriers. Telemedicine might be a promising health care innovation to address geographic barriers in accessing eye care professionals for diabetic retinopathy screenings. Through following evidence-based recommendations and providing patient education, health care providers can play an important role in improving the rate of receipt of annual eye exams among persons with diabetes. In addition, optimizing systems for eye care referrals and reminders (e.g. clinical decision support tools in electronic health records) and improving care coordination between clinicians managing diabetes and those providing eye care might address barriers attributable to low patient awareness.

### Action on diabetic macular oedema: achieving optimal patient management in treating visual impairment due to diabetic eye disease [^676f8b59]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

This paper identifies best practice recommendations for managing diabetes and sight-threatening diabetic eye disease. The authors provide an update for ophthalmologists and allied healthcare professionals on key aspects of diabetes management, supported by a review of the pertinent literature, and recommend practice principles for optimal patient management in treating visual impairment due to diabetic eye disease. In people with diabetes, early optimal glycaemic control reduces the long-term risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The authors propose more can and should be done to maximise metabolic control, promote appropriate behavioural modifications and encourage timely treatment intensification when indicated to ameliorate diabetes-related complications. All people with diabetes should be screened for sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy promptly and regularly. It is shown that attitudes towards treatment adherence in diabetic macular oedema appear to mirror patients' views and health behaviours towards the management of their own diabetes. Awareness of diabetic macular oedema remains low among people with diabetes, who need access to education early in their disease about how to manage their diabetes to delay progression and possibly avoid eye-related complications. Ophthalmologists and allied healthcare professionals play a vital role in multidisciplinary diabetes management and establishment of dedicated diabetic macular oedema clinics is proposed. A broader understanding of the role of the diabetes specialist nurse may strengthen the case for comprehensive integrated care in ophthalmic practice. The recommendations are based on round table presentations and discussions held in London, UK, September 2016.

### Ocular associations of diabetes other than diabetic retinopathy [^20154c10]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is the most well-known ocular complication of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness among people 20–64 years of age in the U.S. Up to 4 million Americans with diabetes, 40 years of age and older, have retinopathy, and nearly 1 million have sight-threatening retinopathy. In major clinical trials, tight control of blood glucose and blood pressure has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of retinopathy and associated blindness.

A range of ocular diseases is also associated with diabetes, which may lead to vision loss. However, some of these ocular conditions may not be familiar to noneye clinicians (–). In this review, we aim to highlight the frequencies, clinical presentations, natural histories, and management of these ocular conditions. Physicians who manage patients with diabetes may benefit from knowledge of these associated conditions and are thus able to ensure adequate and timely referral and treatment. Routine eye screening for retinopathy of individuals with diabetes offers the opportunity to detect these other ocular diseases early, many of which are sight threatening. Physician education remains an important public health strategy in the prevention of vision loss in patients with diabetes.

Introduction

Diabetes has been estimated to affect over 8% of the world's population and, as a significant cause of mortality and major morbidity, is now posing one of the greatest challenges for our healthcare systems. The global prevalence of diabetes is set to double over the next 20 years, with the vast majority of this increase related to type 2 diabetes. As such, type 2 diabetes is increasingly recognised as a disease pandemic that is arguably one of the largest global health emergencies of the 21st century.

There is therefore an increasing need for knowledge, skills, resources, and infrastructure to deliver the comprehensive healthcare needed to meet the complex demands of this progressive condition. Health policy and interventions should focus on diabetes prevention and early detection, including diabetic eye screening, as well as rehabilitation and long-term care of patients affected by wide-ranging complications of diabetes, such as end organ failure, blindness or amputation.

Healthcare professionals often work in isolation to deliver highly specialised care efficiently and effectively for the individual patient with diabetes and its effects on multiple organ systems. It is not uncommon for a patient to be making frequent visits to community clinics and different hospital clinics to see a variety of specialists and allied healthcare professionals, with seemingly little opportunity for coordination of this complex health management programme between the wider team involved. In a field that is so diverse and rapidly changing, healthcare professionals of all specialties need to be aware of developments across all aspects of diabetes management.

In this article, the authors provide an update for ophthalmologists and allied healthcare professionals on diabetes prevalence, the perspective of the diabetologist on what an ophthalmologist needs to know about diabetes, including developments and challenges in diabetic retinopathy screening. In addition, the paper discusses qualitative research assessment of treatment adherence and patient experience, the role of the diabetes specialist nurse (DSN) and practice principles for the management of people with diabetic eye disease. Summaries with concise ‘take home' messages from each topic are provided to enable the reader to easily focus on or refer to specific issues or areas of interest.

### Awareness and practices regarding eye diseases among patients with diabetes: a cross sectional analysis of the coDiab-VD cohort [^28337e69]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Practices: Frequency of eye examination

Despite a high level of awareness regarding diabetic eye diseases, about one third and one eighth of the participants did not report having had an eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist during the past 12 and 24 months, respectively. This divergence raises the question of the reasons for patients not to more frequently report undergoing eye examination. Our analysis of barriers and facilitators to regular eye examination provided some answers. Guidelines for the screening of diabetic retinopathy clearly state that, whether or not patients present ocular symptoms or unstable diabetes (i.e. poor glycemic control), a yearly eye examination is required since retinopathy may evolve silently. However, one third of our participants reporting suboptimal screening practices believed that only the presence of ocular symptoms justifies an eye examination and one third that stable diabetes is enough to prevent diabetic eye diseases. Analogous results have been reported by others, with the main mentioned reason for skipping examination being the patients’ belief that they did not suffer from diabetic retinopathy. It appears that patients tend to ignore the essentially preventive nature of regular eye examination, hence the necessity for healthcare professionals to emphasise this aspect with patients in the future.

The physicians’ potential role in improving practices also emerged from another barrier mentioned by one third of participants reporting insufficient eye examination: the absence of recommendations from their physician (family physician or diabetologist). The reinforcement of prevention messages delivered by physicians is required since appropriate guidance and information by primary care physicians alongside patient education and recommendations on eye health have been shown to be associated with higher adherence to screening guidelines. Better results could even be achieved knowing that physicians can positively impact screening rates by increasing patient referrals to eye specialists.

Considering that the proportion of patients suffering from preventable eye diseases continues to rise and that screening for diabetic eye disease is one of the most cost-effective medical interventions in ophthalmology, initiatives aiming at improving adherence to screening recommendations are warranted. To achieve this goal, both patients’ and healthcare professionals’ knowledge about screening guidelines need to be strengthened.

### The unmet need for better risk stratification of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^83a61f05]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Progression of non‐proliferative retinopathy to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy and blindness is preventable, particularly when detected at an early stage 7, therefore, the prediction and prevention of progression are crucial. Currently, in the UK, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists guidelines recommend annual screening for all people with diabetes 9 ; however, this may be too infrequent for people at high risk of rapid progression to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy and too frequent for those at a low risk of progression to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy 10, suggesting that a new method for identifying diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes is needed. Identifying people with the greatest risk of progression and greatest potential to benefit from treatment is of the utmost importance; healthcare resources must be prioritized for those who need regular follow‐up and timely treatment during this diabetes epidemic.

### Factors associated with annual vision screening in diabetic adults: analysis of the 2019 national health interview survey [^70b0be7e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes worldwide and in the United States is on the rise.In 2019, 28.7 million people in the United States—or 8.7% of the US population—had diagnosed diabetes mellitus and an additional 8.5 million people were estimated to have undiagnosed diabetes.Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common ocular complication of diabetes and the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 18–64 years in the United States.About one in three people living with diabetes has some degree of diabetic retinopathy and one in ten will develop a vision-threatening form of the disease with these numbers expected to increase in the coming years.Minority Americans, rural Americans, and low-income adults have higher rates of DR and are less likely to receive regular screening exams than their non-minority and wealthier counterparts.

A routine annual eye exam to detect early DR and consequent treatment could prevent 90% of vision loss caused by diabetes.For this reason, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends that all individuals with diagnosed diabetes receive annual dilated eye exams, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screenings minimally once every other year if there is no sign of retinopathy and glycemia is well controlled.Yet, studies have reported that between 23% and 65% of patients with diabetes are not receiving guideline-concordant care.Further, the proportion of Americans with diabetes who receive an annual dilated eye exam has not changed between 2005 and 2016.The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified increasing the proportion of adults with diabetes who have a yearly eye exam as a national public health objective in its Healthy People 2030 Report.

### A review of advancements and evidence gaps in diabetic retinopathy screening models [^dc527c14]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes with a prevalence of ~35%, and is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in people of working age in most developed countries. The earliest stage of DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), may progress to sight-threatening DR (STDR). Thus, early detection of DR and active regular screening of patients with diabetes are necessary for earlier intervention to prevent sight loss. While some countries offer systematic DR screening, most nations are reliant on opportunistic screening or do not offer any screening owing to limited healthcare resources and infrastructure. Currently, retinal imaging approaches for DR screening include those with and without mydriasis, imaging in single or multiple fields, and the use of conventional or ultra-wide-field imaging. Advances in telescreening and automated detection facilitate screening in previously hard-to-reach communities. Despite the heterogeneity in approaches to fit local needs, an evidence base must be created for each model to inform practice. In this review, we appraise different aspects of DR screening, including technological advances, identify evidence gaps, and propose several studies to improve DR screening globally, with a view to identifying patients with moderate-to-severe NPDR who would benefit if a convenient treatment option to delay progression to STDR became available.

Screening

Adults and children aged 10 years or older with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. (B)
Patients with type 2 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes. (B)
Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients should be repeated annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Less frequent exams (every 2–3 years) may be considered following one or more normal eye exams. Examinations will be required more frequently if retinopathy is progressing. (B)
High-quality fundus photographs can detect most clinically significant diabetic retinopathy. Interpretation of the images should be performed by a trained eye care provider. While retinal photography may serve as a screening tool for retinopathy, it is not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam, which should be performed at least initially and at intervals thereafter as recommended by an eye care professional. (E)
Women with preexisting diabetes who are planning pregnancy or who have become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye examination and be counseled on the risk of development and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy. Eye examination should occur in the first trimester with close follow-up throughout pregnancy and for 1 year postpartum. (B)

Treatment

Promptly refer patients with any level of macular edema, severe NPDR, or any PDR to an ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. (A)
Laser photocoagulation therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with high-risk PDR, clinically significant macular edema, and in some cases of severe NPDR. (A)
The presence of retinopathy is not a contraindication to aspirin therapy for cardioprotection, as this therapy does not increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage. (A)

Diabetic retinopathy is a highly specific vascular complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with prevalence strongly related to duration of diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20–74 years. Glaucoma, cataracts, and other disorders of the eye occur earlier and more frequently in people with diabetes.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^74050c26]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

American Optometric Association guideline—introduction and clinical rationale: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both, and the chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage to organs including the eyes. Type 2 diabetes is often undiagnosed for many years, during which time individuals are at risk of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications including visual impairment and blindness. Diabetic retinopathy, the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of new cases of vision impairment among people 20 to 74 years of age, and intensive treatment to maintain blood glucose concentrations close to the normal range has been shown to reduce the risk of development and decrease the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy; early intensive glycemic control appears to have a lasting protective effect due to “metabolic memory.” Undiagnosed disease is common, with an estimated 10 to 25 percent of people with diabetes unaware they have the disease, and signs found during an eye examination may be the initial indication; about 20 to 40 percent of individuals with type 2 diabetes already have retinopathy at the time of first diagnosis. Doctors of optometry may be the first health care practitioners to examine persons with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or ocular manifestations of diabetes, and this Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline provides examination and management recommendations designed to preserve vision and reduce the risk of vision loss through timely diagnosis, intervention, determination of need for future evaluation, and appropriate referral.

### Why eye exams are important | Vision and eye health (...) [^21932c60]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Going to the eye doctor is part of taking care of your overall health.
- Eye exams at every age and life stage can help keep your vision strong. About eye exams Many people think their eyesight is just fine without realizing they may need glasses or contact lenses. But about 11 million Americans over age 12 need vision correction. But that's just one reason to get your eyes examined. Regular eye exams are also an important part of finding eye diseases early to protect your vision. Eye diseases are common and can go unnoticed for a long time. Some eye problems don't have any symptoms in their early stages. A comprehensive dilated eye exam by an eye doctor can find eye diseases in the early stages. This is when treatment to prevent vision loss is most effective. During the exam, your eyes and vision will be tested. Your eye doctor can see behind your eyes and check for signs of health problems as well.

They may even be able to spot other conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Common eye problems Early treatment is critically important to prevent vision loss or blindness from some common eye problems: Cataracts, which cause clouding of the lens, are the leading cause of vision loss in the United States. Diabetic retinopathy causes damage to blood vessels in the back of the eye. It's the leading cause of blindness in American adults. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most preventable causes of vision loss and blindness. Early detection and treatment can prevent or delay blindness from diabetic retinopathy in 90% of people with diabetes. Diabetes can also increase the risk of other eye problems like cataracts or glaucoma. How often to get eye exams Children's eyes should be checked regularly by an eye doctor or pediatrician. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that children have at least one eye exam between age 3 and 5 years.

This can detect amblyopia or risk factors for it. People with diabetes should have a dilated eye exam every year. Some people are at higher risk for glaucoma and should have a dilated eye exam every 2 years:
- Black Americans 40 years and older.
- All adults older than 60, especially Mexican American adults.
- People with a family history of glaucoma.

### Should diabetes retinal screening intervals change? [^fee867f0]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

There is accumulating evidence that the natural history of diabetic eye disease is sufficiently slow that 2-yearly retinal screening, or even longer, may be safe for some patients with diabetes. The information technology underpinning call-recall systems within screening programmes permits a more sophisticated approach to organizing retinal screening, as directed by the clinical evidence. This commentary explores the evidence for moving towards a biennial retinal screening programme for patients with Type 2 diabetes and diabetes duration of less than 10 years. Such an approach may allow capacity to introduce 6-monthly screening for high-risk patients, a targeted approach to recurrent defaulters and possible introduction of new aspects of screening such as optical coherence tomography, in addition to accommodating for the expanding number of patients with diabetes. A UK-four nations group is now critically looking at the evidence for any such changes.

### Screening for diabetic retinopathy: new perspectives and challenges [^fd4ebfd4]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Although the prevalence of all stages of diabetic retinopathy has been declining since 1980 in populations with improved diabetes control, the crude prevalence of visual impairment and blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy worldwide increased between 1990 and 2015, largely because of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Screening for diabetic retinopathy is essential to detect referable cases that need timely full ophthalmic examination and treatment to avoid permanent visual loss. In the past few years, personalised screening intervals that take into account several risk factors have been proposed, with good cost-effectiveness ratios. However, resources for nationwide screening programmes are scarce in many countries. New technologies, such as scanning confocal ophthalmology with ultrawide field imaging and handheld mobile devices, teleophthalmology for remote grading, and artificial intelligence for automated detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy, are changing screening strategies and improving cost-effectiveness. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that retinal imaging could be useful for identifying individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment, which could expand the role of diabetic retinopathy screening beyond the prevention of sight-threatening disease.

Because retinopathy develops over 5 or more years from initial hyperglycemia, screening should be initiated within 5 years of diagnosis in persons with T1D, and pregnancy is a risk factor requiring ophthalmologic examinations repeatedly during pregnancy and for 1 year postpartum.

### Dilated eye examination screening guideline compliance among patients with diabetes without a diabetic retinopathy diagnosis: the role of geographic access [^71480164]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that transportation access is one barrier that could be addressed through interventions designed to lower such barriers via travel vouchers and arranging for transportation to eye care facilities. However, even the provision of free transportation may not mitigate these low compliance rates, especially in economically distressed communities. For example, in one comprehensive community-based eye disease screening program, those who tested positive and needed follow-up care were offered free transportation to the clinic site. Despite this offer, only about 50% of those who agreed to the follow-up examination completed the visit.

Thus, unless they are paired with interventions designed to increase compliance with eye care guidelines, interventions focused solely on lowering transportation barriers may not substantially improve compliance rates. A randomized trial testing an educational intervention targeting African-Americans with diabetes but with no dilated eye examination in the previous 14 months yielded a significantly higher subsequent examination rate in those in the intervention versus usual care arms of the trial (55% vs 27%).In a recent analysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, participants 40 years of age or older with a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes were significantly more likely to report seeing an eye care provider in the previous 12 months if they also indicated a history of receiving diabetes education (57% vs 43%, p<0.001).Although speculative, these findings raise the possibility that those living with diabetes may be more responsive to transportation interventions if they also receive education on the importance of routine eye examinations.

### The effect of educational program based on theory of planned behavior on promoting retinopathy preventive behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes: RCT [^368dd917]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes, a major public health problem affecting more than four hundred million people worldwide. According to a study conducted in 116 countries from 2010 to 2019, the prevalence of diabetes in adults aged 20 to 79 will increase from 6.9% in 2010 to 7.7% in 2030.

Diabetes has been associated with the development of various complications including retinopathy. Studies have shown that people with diabetes are 25 times more likely to be blind than others. Optimal management of diabetic retinopathy should include annual screening, adequate control of associated risk factors and timely treatment.

Currently, with the rising prevalence of diabetes in the world, WHO has declared it as a latent epidemic and believes that increasing patients’ awareness about complications disease. A significant element towards an optimal management, which is often undervalued, is the improvement of knowledge and education among patients with diabetes. Therefore, it is essential to have information about the beliefs and awareness of those at risk in order to develop preventive strategies.

Previous studies assessing knowledge, attitude and practices regarding eye diseases in patients with diabetes for example a study in Turkey showed that 31% of patients with diabetes had not received eye care training and did not know that the disease affects their eyesight. Also in Nepal, only 12% of patients with diabetes were aware of the ocular complication of diabetes. Other studies have emphasized the need to educate patients with diabetes to increase their awareness and performance in the prevention of retinopathy. On the other hand, due to the important role of patients with diabetes in adopting health behaviors to prevent the complication of retinopathy, the importance of performing educational interventions based on appropriate behavioral theories for these patients is even greater. Therefore, in the present study, Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has been used.

According to this theory, a patient’s attitude is his or her favorable or unfavorable evaluation to perform a particular behavior that has been formed through his or her mental perceptions or past experiences. Behavioral intention is the decision of an individual to adopt a behavior, and subjective norms are the effects of different people on the behavior of an individual. Perceived behavioral control refers to patients perception of his or her competence to successfully perform hygiene-related behaviors. Prevention care includes blood sugar control behaviors, regular visits to an ophthalmologist and timely eye examinations, adherence to a medication regimen, and adherence to a proper diet. To measure patients’ behavior more accurately Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) and HbA1C quarterly blood sugar were used. Figure 1 shows Theory of Planned Behavior.

Diabetic retinopathy screening and follow-up—persons with T2D or adult-onset T1D should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist at the time of diagnosis or shortly after diagnosis, and individualized subsequent screening can be based on type and duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), A1C or mean blood glucose (BG), blood pressure (BP), and the presence and grade of retinopathy. In persons with T1D, an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist should be performed within 5 y of diagnosis in children and adolescents. Women who are pregnant and have preexisting T1D or T2D should be monitored with eye examinations every trimester during pregnancy and in the postpartum period as determined by the severity of retinopathy during pregnancy. Persons with greater than mild nonproliferative retinopathy should have examinations at least once a year and more frequently as advised by their eyecare specialist; follow-up with eye care specialists typically should occur on an annual basis, but persons with T1D or T2D who have had a normal ocular examination may be screened every 2 to 3 y. To prevent vision loss, BG, weight, and lipid control should be implemented to slow the progression of retinopathy. Artificial intelligence systems, authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for detecting greater than mild diabetic retinopathy, can be used as an alternative to traditional screening approaches, and these systems can facilitate diagnosis of vision-threatening retinopathy and identification of persons who require ophthalmologic visits for treatment.

### The unmet need for better risk stratification of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^e9042402]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Diabetic retinopathy, one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in working‐age people, is assessed based on the presence or absence of retinal lesions in the fundus.
Current classifications of non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy are not predictive of the risks of rapid progression to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy.
Non‐proliferative retinopathy progression profiles may benefit from assessments of the following lesion characteristics: shape and size of lesion; angiogenic origin; location, including peripheral retina; turnover and dynamics; and concomitant hypertensive retinopathy.
Natural history studies of these changes may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis, progression and management of diabetic retinopathy.

Laser photocoagulation surgery in both trials was beneficial in reducing the risk of further vision loss, but generally not beneficial in reversing already diminished acuity. This preventive effect and the fact that patients with PDR or macular edema may be asymptomatic provide strong support for a screening program to detect diabetic retinopathy.

As retinopathy is estimated to take at least 5 years to develop after the onset of hyperglycemia, patients with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes, who generally have had years of undiagnosed diabetes and who have a significant risk of prevalent diabetic retinopathy at time of diabetes diagnosis, should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination soon after diagnosis. Examinations should be performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is knowledgeable and experienced in diagnosing the presence of diabetic retinopathy and is aware of its management. Subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients are generally repeated annually. Less frequent exams (every 2–3 years) may be cost effective after one or more normal eye exams (–), while examinations will be required more frequently if retinopathy is progressing.

Examinations can also be done with retinal photographs (with or without dilation of the pupil) read by experienced experts. In-person exams are still necessary when the photos are unacceptable and for follow-up of abnormalities detected. This technology has great potential in areas where qualified eye care professionals are not available and may enhance efficiency and reduce costs when the expertise of ophthalmologists can be utilized for more complex examinations and for therapy.

Results of eye examinations should be documented and transmitted to the referring health care professional. For a detailed review of the evidence and further discussion of diabetic retinopathy, see the ADA's technical review and position statement on this subject.

### Assessing the effect of personalized diabetes risk assessments during ophthalmologic visits on glycemic control: a randomized clinical trial [^c7a79bb3]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Optimization of glycemic control is critical to reduce the number of diabetes mellitus-related complications, but long-term success is challenging. Although vision loss is among the greatest fears of individuals with diabetes, comprehensive personalized diabetes education and risk assessments are not consistently used in ophthalmologic settings.

Objective

To determine whether the point-of-care measurement of hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and personalized diabetes risk assessments performed during retinal ophthalmologic visits improve glycemic control as assessed by HbA(1c) level.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Ophthalmologist office-based randomized, multicenter clinical trial in which investigators from 42 sites were randomly assigned to provide either a study-prescribed augmented diabetes assessment and education or the usual care. Adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes enrolled into 2 cohorts: those with a more-frequent-than-annual follow-up (502 control participants and 488 intervention participants) and those with an annual follow-up (368 control participants and 388 intervention participants). Enrollment was from April 2011 through January 2013.

Interventions

Point-of-care measurements of HbA1c, blood pressure, and retinopathy severity; an individualized estimate of the risk of retinopathy progression derived from the findings from ophthalmologic visits; structured comparison and review of past and current clinical findings; and structured education with immediate assessment and feedback regarding participant's understanding. These interventions were performed at enrollment and at routine ophthalmic follow-up visits scheduled at least 12 weeks apart.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean change in HbA(1c) level from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes included body mass index, blood pressure, and responses to diabetes self-management practices and attitudes surveys.

Results

In the cohort with more-frequent-than-annual follow-ups, the mean (SD) change in HbA(1c) level at 1 year was -0.1% (1.5%) in the control group and -0.3% (1.4%) in the intervention group (adjusted mean difference, -0.09% [95% CI, -0.29% to 0.12%]; P=.35). In the cohort with annual follow-ups, the mean (SD) change in HbA(1c) level was 0.0% (1.1%) in the control group and -0.1% (1.6%) in the intervention group (mean difference, -0.05% [95% CI, -0.27% to 0.18%]; P=.63). Results were similar for all secondary outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Long-term optimization of glycemic control is not achieved by a majority of individuals with diabetes. The addition of personalized education and risk assessment during retinal ophthalmologic visits did not result in a reduction in HbA(1c) level compared with usual care over 1 year. These data suggest that optimizing glycemic control remains a substantive challenge requiring interventional paradigms other than those examined in our study.

### The evolution of diabetic retinopathy screening [^dd98de08]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness and has emerged as a global health challenge, necessitating the development of robust management strategies. As DR prevalence continues to rise, advancements in screening methods have become increasingly critical for timely detection and intervention. This review examines three key advancements in DR screening: a shift from specialist to generalist approach, the adoption of telemedicine strategies for expanded access and enhanced efficiency, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, AI offers unprecedented benefits in the form of sustainability and scalability for not only DR screening but other aspects of eye health and the medical field as a whole. Though there remain barriers to address, AI holds vast potential for reshaping DR screening and significantly improving patient outcomes globally.

Highlighted recommendations for care—diabetes mellitus and pregnancy: The recommendations are as follows: type 1 diabetes mellitus—first examination 5 years after onset and yearly thereafter; type 2 diabetes mellitus—first examination at the time of diagnosis and yearly thereafter; and for women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes—first examination prior to conception and then early in the first trimester of pregnancy. Interval recommendations thereafter will be based on findings at first examination. Women who develop gestational diabetes do not require an eye examination during pregnancy, and they do not appear to be at increased risk for developing diabetic retinopathy during pregnancy.
