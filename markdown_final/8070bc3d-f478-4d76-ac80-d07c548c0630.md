## Question

CO₂ poisoning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "CO2 poisoning" and what the appropriate interpretation and management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and whether the user truly means carbon dioxide versus carbon monoxide poisoning. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and mechanisms for the relevant gas. Next, I will review clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and key pitfalls. After that, I need to evaluate the strength of evidence for hyperbaric versus normobaric oxygen, including guideline positions and controversies. Finally, I should consider special populations, cardiac implications, prevention, and summarize a practical approach that aligns with the best available evidence and policies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology because "CO2 poisoning" could mean either carbon dioxide intoxication or carbon monoxide poisoning. Given that the supplied references overwhelmingly address carbon monoxide toxicity and the user's query mirrors typical CO questions, I will interpret this as carbon monoxide poisoning unless new information indicates otherwise, and I will flag that CO₂ narcosis is a different syndrome with different thresholds and management [^116NcHxH] [^116XoiNA].

> Now, I should verify the mechanism to anchor the rest of the reasoning. Carbon monoxide binds hemoglobin with an affinity roughly 200–250 times that of oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin and shifting the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve leftward, which reduces arterial oxygen content and tissue delivery; CO also inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, impairing mitochondrial respiration and contributing to oxidative stress and delayed neurologic injury, so both hypoxic and direct cytotoxic mechanisms operate in tandem [^111JcvWm] [^111k4jH8] [^114mYF4K].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology so I do not understate risk. In the United States, there are tens of thousands of emergency department visits and hundreds of deaths annually from unintentional, non–fire-related CO exposures, with global estimates of around 30,000 deaths per year; exposures concentrate in homes and peak during colder months when heating appliances are used with inadequate ventilation, which should raise my index of suspicion in winter or clustered presentations [^112mudZL] [^115wvimR] [^116ZDCwU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis from symptoms alone. CO poisoning is classically described as a chameleon: headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, confusion, and chest pain are common, and in more severe cases patients may have syncope, seizures, coma, or myocardial ischemia; however, there is no reliable correlation between carboxyhemoglobin levels and symptom severity, so I need to avoid anchoring on a number and instead integrate exposure history and exam findings with objective testing [^1131gquf] [^114mYF4K].

> I should double-check diagnostic pitfalls because they are frequent. Pulse oximetry is unreliable because COHb absorbs light similarly to oxyhemoglobin, yielding falsely reassuring SpO2 values; therefore, I must obtain a COHb level by co-oximetry and not rely on standard pulse oximetry, and I should also avoid noninvasive pulse CO-oximetry for diagnosis in the ED because of accuracy limitations, even though these devices can be useful adjuncts for screening in other contexts [^113iM7uM] [^1125RzCV] [^1144eAqv].

> Let me think about treatment kinetics because timing influences choices. Without oxygen, the COHb half-life is roughly 4–5 hours. 100% normobaric oxygen reduces it to about 60–90 minutes, and hyperbaric oxygen at 2.5–3 ATA shortens it to approximately 20 minutes, which explains the physiologic rationale for aggressive oxygen therapy in suspected CO poisoning even before COHb returns [^114mYF4K] [^111o6MsU].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for hyperbaric oxygen versus normobaric oxygen. The most cited randomized trial, Weaver et al., showed a significant reduction in neurocognitive sequelae at 6 weeks and persistence at 12 months with three HBO sessions within 24 hours, but other randomized trials found no benefit and some methodological critiques have been raised. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews, including Cochrane, report no definitive long-term neurocognitive advantage of HBO over high-flow normobaric oxygen, underscoring ongoing uncertainty and heterogeneity in protocols and outcomes [^112Uucst] [^112ojpYT] [^114Gka4z].

> Hold on, I should verify what major guidelines say so I do not overstate any position. The 2017 ACEP Clinical Policy gives a Level B recommendation to use either HBO or high-flow normobaric oxygen for acute CO poisoning and explicitly states it remains unclear whether HBO is superior for long-term neurocognitive outcomes; BTS guidance supports aiming for maximal oxygen delivery with a reservoir mask irrespective of oximetry because SpO2 is unreliable in CO exposure, which reinforces aggressive normobaric therapy when HBO is not immediately available [^114hXDMf] [^1125RzCV].

> I need to ensure I am precise about special populations. In pregnancy, maternal COHb underestimates fetal exposure because fetal hemoglobin binds CO more tightly, so there is a stronger indication to consider HBO. However, pregnant patients were excluded from trials, so evidence is limited and decisions often rely on pathophysiology and case series. In pediatrics, most policies exclude children from adult recommendations, so management follows pediatric protocols with expert consultation, and for post–cardiac arrest or very severe cases, case series suggest poor outcomes even with HBO, emphasizing early supportive care and realistic prognostication [^114y8DqC] [^116JckUC] [^116j7B1K].

> Let me consider cardiac implications because they materially affect risk stratification. Acute myocardial injury detected by ECG and troponin occurs in a substantial proportion of moderate-to-severe cases and predicts poor outcomes; therefore, I should obtain ECG and cardiac biomarkers in moderate-to-severe presentations to guide monitoring and disposition planning [^114ueNaq] [^114gwJiR].

> I should confirm the practical approach I would take right now. Immediate removal from exposure and 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather at 15 L/min are first-line. Continue oxygen until symptoms resolve and COHb is normalized if available, and consider transfer for HBO when severe features are present, such as loss of consciousness, persistent neurologic deficits, ischemic ECG changes, or pregnancy, while recognizing that transfer delays may erode benefit and that local access to chambers varies widely. Do not rely on SpO2 to titrate oxygen in CO poisoning, and repeat neurologic checks frequently [^1125RzCV] [^111PSQf3] [^112WF9UB] [^115ucQcP].

> But wait, what if the user truly meant carbon dioxide narcosis rather than carbon monoxide poisoning. I should clarify that CO₂ narcosis presents with hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, and progressive somnolence or coma, typically in the setting of chronic lung disease or ventilatory failure, and its management centers on improving alveolar ventilation rather than hyperbaric therapy; the physiologic targets and thresholds differ markedly from CO toxicity, so conflating them would lead to incorrect treatment choices [^116XoiNA] [^116NcHxH].

> In summary, I should emphasize that the weight of evidence supports aggressive oxygenation as the cornerstone, with HBO as a reasonable option for selected patients but without definitive proof of superiority for long-term neurocognitive outcomes. Decisions should integrate severity, timing, comorbidities, pregnancy, and access, and clinicians should avoid overinterpreting COHb levels or relying on pulse oximetry in suspected CO poisoning [^114hXDMf] [^112ojpYT] [^1125RzCV].

CO poisoning is caused by **inhalation of carbon monoxide** from incomplete combustion, leading to hypoxia via COHb formation and mitochondrial dysfunction [^111k4jH8]. Presenting symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, syncope, and, in severe cases, coma or death [^1131gquf]; pulse oximetry is unreliable, so diagnosis requires **COHb measurement** [^1144eAqv]. Immediate treatment is **100% oxygen** (normobaric or hyperbaric) [^1125RzCV] to rapidly clear CO and prevent delayed neurologic sequelae; hyperbaric oxygen is indicated for severe cases or specific populations (e.g. pregnant patients) [^111PSQf3]. Prevention relies on CO detectors, proper appliance maintenance, and public education [^115wvimR].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **COHb formation**: CO binds hemoglobin with ~220× the affinity of O2, forming COHb and reducing O2-carrying capacity [^111JcvWm].
- **Left shift**: COHb shifts the oxyhemoglobin curve left, further impairing tissue O2 delivery [^115TDM4k].
- **Mitochondrial inhibition**: CO inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, causing cellular hypoxia and oxidative stress [^111GfMnn].
- **Delayed sequelae**: Neuronal injury can lead to delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) [^114mYF4K].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms are **nonspecific** and vary with exposure duration and concentration:

| **Severity** | **Symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Headache <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Confusion [^114cty6j] |
| Moderate | - Syncope <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Visual changes [^notfound] |
| Severe | - Coma <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Respiratory failure <br/> - Cardiac arrest <br/> - Death [^1131gquf] |

---

Cherry-red skin is rare and **not reliable** for diagnosis [^115ex1mF].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical suspicion**: Nonspecific symptoms, especially with combustion exposure or clustered cases [^111PSQf3] [^113iM7uM].
- **COHb measurement**: Gold standard; pulse CO-oximetry is unreliable for diagnosis [^1144eAqv] [^111zwvWz].
- **Pulse oximetry**: Falsely normal due to COHb's similar light absorption to oxyhemoglobin [^113iM7uM].
- **Cardiac evaluation**: ECG and biomarkers for myocardial injury in moderate-to-severe cases [^114ueNaq].

---

## Treatment

Immediate removal from exposure and **100% oxygen** are essential [^1125RzCV]. Normobaric oxygen (NBO) at 100% reduces the COHb half-life to ~60–90 minutes, whereas hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) at 2.5–3 ATA reduces it to ~20 minutes and may reduce DNS risk, though evidence is mixed [^111o6MsU] [^114Gka4z]. Indications for HBO include **severe poisoning** (coma, seizures, LOC, COHb > 25–30%), pregnancy, or persistent neurologic symptoms [^111PSQf3] [^114xV9GM] [^112rAoHw]. Supportive care includes airway management, treatment of acidosis, and monitoring for complications [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Mild cases generally recover fully with timely oxygen therapy, whereas **severe cases** have high risks of mortality, persistent neurologic deficits, and DNS [^114mYF4K]. DNS occurs in 12–68% of survivors and may manifest 2–21 days after exposure [^111JcvWm].

---

## Prevention

- **CO detectors**: Install and maintain in homes and workplaces [^115wvimR].
- **Appliance maintenance**: Regular servicing of heating systems, stoves, and generators [^116KwX5e].
- **Public education**: Awareness of CO sources and risks [^116KwX5e].
- **Legislation**: Building codes and regulations for CO detectors [^116KwX5e].

---

CO poisoning is a **preventable** cause of morbidity and mortality; **rapid recognition, COHb testing, and oxygen therapy** are critical, with HBO for severe cases. Prevention through detectors, maintenance, and education is key.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning: pathogenesis, management, and future directions of therapy [^111k4jH8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning affects 50,000 people a year in the United States. The clinical presentation runs a spectrum, ranging from headache and dizziness to coma and death, with a mortality rate ranging from 1 to 3%. A significant number of patients who survive CO poisoning suffer from long-term neurological and affective sequelae. The neurologic deficits do not necessarily correlate with blood CO levels but likely result from the pleiotropic effects of CO on cellular mitochondrial respiration, cellular energy utilization, inflammation, and free radical generation, especially in the brain and heart. Long-term neurocognitive deficits occur in 15–40% of patients, whereas approximately one-third of moderate to severely poisoned patients exhibit cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmia, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and myocardial infarction. Imaging studies reveal cerebral white matter hyperintensities, with delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy or diffuse brain atrophy. Management of these patients requires the identification of accompanying drug ingestions, especially in the setting of intentional poisoning, fire-related toxic gas exposures, and inhalational injuries. Conventional therapy is limited to normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen, with no available antidotal therapy. Although hyperbaric oxygen significantly reduces the permanent neurological and affective effects of CO poisoning, a portion of survivors still have substantial morbidity. There has been some early success in therapies targeting the downstream inflammatory and oxidative effects of CO poisoning. New methods to directly target the toxic effect of CO, such as CO scavenging agents, are currently under development.

Introduction

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is an important cause of poisoning mortality and morbidity in the United States with approximately 15,000 intentional cases annually, accounting for 400–500 reported deaths each year. Specifically, there are over 50,000 CO cases seen in emergency departments in the US annually, with over half requiring hospitalization. It is estimated that CO poisoning results in over $1 billion annually in hospital costs and lost earnings. The most serious complications for survivors of consequential CO exposure are neurologic failure with delayed neurological sequelae (DNS) occurring in up to 50% of patients. While hypoxia, inflammation and lipid peroxidation are known to play a part in the complex mechanism of CO poisoning, another important mechanism of injury is mitochondrial dysfunction. CO targets cytochrome c oxidase, also known as Complex IV (CIV), resulting in bioenergetic failure and propagation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to organ dysfunction.

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning — hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy versus normobaric oxygen: Level B recommendations state that emergency physicians should use HBO2 therapy or high-flow normobaric therapy for acute CO-poisoned patients, while noting it remains unclear whether HBO2 therapy is superior to normobaric oxygen therapy for improving long-term neurocognitive outcomes. The potential benefit described is supporting clinicians who choose not to refer for HBO2 therapy when constrained, and the subcommittee identified no potential harms of implementing this recommendation.

### Hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning [^114cty6j]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide, a byproduct of incomplete hydrocarbon combustion, has been responsible for many accidental poisonings worldwide. The signs and symptoms of poisoning are diverse, ranging from headache, dizziness, and confusion to cardiac and neurological disturbances. Oxygen is the cornerstone of treatment, because it accelerates the dissociation of carbon monoxide from heme proteins. The role of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of CO poisoning is still questionable. Only a few randomized, controlled studies have been conducted, and their results are inconsistent. In the present review, we discuss the conclusions of four randomized controlled studies and propose a hyperbaric oxygen treatment protocol based on these conclusions.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^114mNs6T]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy — randomized trials reporting benefit on neurologic sequelae: A blinded, single-center randomized clinical trial reported improved outcomes with HBO2, with patients receiving 3 HBO2 sessions in which the first session used 3 ATA for 1 hour followed by 2 ATA for 1 hour and the remaining sessions used 2 ATA; HBO2 was initiated up to 24 hours after carbon monoxide exposure. At 6 weeks, HBO2 was associated with a 21% (95% CI 6% to 34%) absolute reduction in neurologic sequelae (46% versus 25%; unadjusted OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.78; NNT = 5), though cerebellar dysfunction at enrollment was imbalanced (15% control versus 4% HBO2 therapy). A smaller Class II trial (n = 60) evaluated 1 session of HBO2 (2.8 ATA for 30 minutes followed by 2 ATA for 90 minutes) versus 100% normobaric oxygen and found a 23% (95% CI 8% to 38%) absolute reduction in neurologic sequelae (23% versus 0%; unadjusted OR = 0.06; 95% CI 0 to 1.03; NNT = 4.3); all subjects presented within 6 hours of exposure, but patients with loss of consciousness were excluded.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113iM7uM]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide/smoke inhalation — patient presentation states that carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas with a high affinity for binding to red cell hemoglobin, thus preventing the binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin and leading to tissue hypoxia (although pulse oximetry may appear to be normal); a significant reduction in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs occurs with carbon monoxide poisoning; it is also a cellular toxin which can result in delayed or persistent neurologic sequelae in significant exposures; with any form of combustion, carbon monoxide will be generated; people in a fire may also be exposed to cyanide, and cyanide toxicity may need to be considered in the hemodynamically unstable patient removed from a fire.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^116UDzDV]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning — epidemiology in the United States notes that it is the third leading cause of unintentional poisoning death in the United States; despite death rates declining by 80% since the introduction of the catalytic converter in 1957, CO poisoning still caused 491 accidental and 1,747 suicidal deaths in 1998, with diagnosed nonfatal cases estimated from 15,000 to 40,000 events per year, and because misdiagnosis is common the true numbers are likely much higher.

### Inhaled carbon monoxide: from toxin to therapy [^114pSfUB]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is usually recognized as a toxic gas that can be used to assess lung function in the pulmonary function laboratory. The toxicity of CO relates to its high affinity for hemoglobin and other heme molecules, producing carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO). Despite that blood HbCO levels are commonly measured in patients with CO poisoning, the clinical presentation often does not correlate with the HbCO level, and clinical improvement in the patient's condition does not correlate with HbCO clearance. In patients with CO poisoning, administration of 100% O₂ is standard practice. If available, hyperbaric O₂ can be used, although this is controversial. Measurement of exhaled CO might be useful to estimate HbCO, such as in smoking cessation programs, but assessment of HbCO using pulse oximetry can be misleading. Endogenous CO is generated as the result of heme oxygenase activity. It is becoming increasingly recognized that the results of heme oxygenase activity, specifically CO production, might have important physiologic functions. These include effects on vascular function, inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and signaling pathways. Given the abundance of basic science supporting a therapeutic role for CO, clinical trials are exploring this potential.

### Blood cells as a cellular biomarker for mitochondrial function in a experimental model of acute carbon monoxide poisoning with treatment [^115dbCJ6]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another objective for this study was to investigate a novel succinate prodrug (NV354) in our rodent model of acute CO poisoning. The current standard of care for CO poisoning consists of supportive care and use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). While these current treatments may mitigate symptoms and reduce immediate mortality, survivors are still at risk for developing cognitive and motor function deficits well after the acute CO symptoms have subsided. To address this critical gap in therapy, our team has developed a library of novel, plasma stable succinate prodrugs, whose intracellular cleavage yields bioavailable succinate, which in turn increases ATP-linked respiration at Complex II (CII). The drug does not act on CO itself but may compensates for cellular injury to prevent organ failure.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the dose-dependent effect of CO exposure on mitochondrial function in the brain using a rodent model; (2) to evaluate the ability of blood cell respirometry to act as a biomarker for CO severity; and (3) to evaluate the effect of a mitochondrially targeted therapeutic.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy — trial variability and potential harms: Trials vary widely in the interpretation of HBO2 for prevention of neurologic sequelae, and a lack of standardization across trials (including timing of delivery [< 6 versus > 6 hours], dose [2 versus 2.5 to 3 ATA], outcomes, and follow-up) makes definitive conclusions difficult; although potential harms such as barotrauma, lack of access to immediate medical care while in the chamber, and long-distance transfers are concerns, existing data make it difficult to determine whether these harms outweigh potential benefits.

### Carbon dioxide intoxication: the clinical syndrome, its etiology and management with particular reference to the use of mechanical respirators… [^116XoiNA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION Carbon dioxide intoxication is now recognized as a syndrome that can occur in persons with disorders which greatly reduce alveolar ventilation. The symptoms and clinical findings in this condition vary in character and severity and may simulate other disease entities. With moderate acidosis and hypercapnia, the patient may have no complaints, or the only symptoms noted may be weakness, lassitude, irritability, mild confusion, or headache. More severe respiratory acidosis can cause carbon dioxide narcosis with coma, respiratory depression and circulatory failure. Frequently, severe or prolonged narcosis results in the death of the patient. Retention of carbon dioxide is most commonly observed in individuals with chronic lung disease which results in impaired ventilation, particularly obstructive emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis.

On this background carbon dioxide intoxication can develop when ventilation becomes mechanically more difficult; e.g., with a respiratory infection: 637–670.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^112WF9UB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning — evidence synthesis and methodological considerations indicate mixed findings for hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2): Across the 5 original trials, support was inconsistent, with three studies (1 Class II and 2 Class III) finding no benefit and two Class II trials reporting benefits; in the no-benefit studies, therapy was initiated up to 12 hours after exposure, benefit may diminish with delays of more than 6 hours, and two studies used 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA) regimens considered potentially suboptimal.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2024 update [^115z2xnM]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) — management emphasizes differential diagnosis, avoidance of ascent with symptoms, timely descent, and selective medication use. Care should exclude mimics "such as carbon monoxide poisoning, dehydration, exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and hyponatremia". People with AMS "should avoid moving to higher sleeping elevations", and those with mild–moderate illness may stay at current altitude with symptomatic therapy, but "descent should be initiated for AMS if symptoms worsen or fail to improve after 1 to 3 d", while "persons with severe AMS should cease ascending and descend to lower elevation". Acetazolamide and dexamethasone are "generally not necessary" for mild AMS but may be used in moderate–severe cases; dexamethasone "should be strongly considered along with descent", and acetazolamide is "likely better for the prevention rather than the treatment of AMS", though may be considered when dexamethasone is unavailable. After symptom resolution, individuals "may resume ascending", but "further ascent or reascent… is contraindicated if there are ongoing symptoms", and "prophylactic doses of acetazolamide should be used during reascent". For suspected or confirmed HACE, those with access to care "should receive supplemental oxygen sufficient to achieve an SpO₂ > 90%", and in remote settings "descent should be initiated", with "supplemental oxygen or a portable hyperbaric chamber" if descent is not feasible, and "all persons with HACE should also be started on dexamethasone".

Carbon monoxide poisoning affects approximately 5000 children per year in the United States and can be challenging to diagnose and treat. The mainstay of treatment is oxygen therapy and supportive care, or hyperbaric oxygen therapy in severe cases. Severe intoxication can be fatal, however, even with these treatments. We present a case of carbon monoxide poisoning treated with the use of veno-veno (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning — randomized controlled trial of HBO2 with sham control describes that all patients received ≥ 3 days of mask O2, the HBO2 group had 3 sessions with up to 3 additional if symptoms persisted at a maximum treatment pressure of 2.8 ATA each session, and controls received sham HBO2, with the trial double blinded, N = 191, and patients of all severity included. The primary outcome, persistent neurologic sequelae defined as ≥ 2 of 7 neuropsychological test scores ≥ 1 SD below predicted, occurred in 74% of HBO2-treated patients and 68% of controls (OR 1.7; 95% CI 0.8–4.0; P = 0.19, NS), with number needed to harm = 16.7; delayed neurologic sequelae occurred in 4.8% of HBO vs 0% NBO group, with no significant difference between HBO2 and control groups in 6 of 7 neuropsychological test scores after 3 treatments and no difference at 1 mo but with inadequate follow-up. Limitations noted include lost to follow-up 54%, suicidal patients 69%, mean time to treatment 7.1 h, poor follow-up at 1 mo, diminished generalizability because of the high oxygen dose of the control arm, and cluster randomization; classification was II for persistent neurologic sequelae data and X for delayed neurologic sequelae data.

Oxygen therapy and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) kinetics in CO poisoning indicate that administration of oxygen speeds elimination of CO; without therapy the elimination half-life of CO is 4 to 5 hours, with 100% oxygen at normal atmospheric pressure decreasing this to approximately 1 hour, and HBO2 further decreasing the half-life to 20 minutes at 2.5 atmospheres absolute pressure; based in part on these effects, HBO2 has been advocated as therapy for more than 40 years.

### Hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning [^114Gka4z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Poisoning with carbon monoxide (CO) remains an important cause of accidental and intentional injury worldwide. Several unblinded non-randomized trials have suggested that the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) prevents the development of neurological sequelae. This has led to the widespread use of HBO in the management of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning.

Objectives

To examine randomized trials of the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) compared to normobaric oxygen (NBO) for the prevention of neurologic sequelae in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966-present), EMBASE (1980-present), and the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, supplemented by a manual review of bibliographies of identified articles and discussion with recognized content experts.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials involving non-pregnant adults acutely poisoned with carbon monoxide (regardless of severity), with adequate or unclear allocation concealment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted from each trial information on: the number of randomized patients, types of participants, the dose and duration of the intervention, and the prevalence of neurologic symptoms at follow-up.

Main Results

Seven randomized controlled trials of varying quality were identified; one was excluded because it did not evaluate clinical outcomes. Of the six remaining trials, two represent incomplete publications (one interim analysis, one abstract). Of these six trials, four found no benefit of HBO for the reduction of neurologic sequelae, while two others did. Although pooled analysis does not suggest a benefit from HBOT (OR for neurological deficits 0.78, 95%CI 0.54 to 1.12, p = 0.18), significant methodologic and statistical heterogeneity was apparent among the trials, and this result should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, design or analysis flaws were evident in all trials. Importantly, the conclusions of one positive trial may have been influenced by failure to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, while interpretation of the other positive trial is hampered by apparent changes in the primary outcome during the course of the trial.

Authors' Conclusions

Existing randomized trials do not establish whether the administration of HBO to patients with carbon monoxide poisoning reduces the incidence of adverse neurologic outcomes. Additional research is needed to better define the role, if any, of HBO in the treatment of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning. This research question is ideally suited to a multi-center randomized controlled trial.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning — loss of consciousness and coma subgroup findings: "Two studies randomized patients both with and without loss of consciousness from CO poisoning to HBO2, and non-HBO2 treatment groups", but "Weaver et al10 did not present outcomes data on patients who lost consciousness separately from the aggregate". In another trial, "loss of consciousness is one of the 13 criteria used to define "severe CO poisoned" in their study. In this "severely CO-poisoned" subset (N = 139; 73% all subjects), HBO2 was associated with a 20% absolute increase in poor neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge". Specifically, "Neurologic sequelae at hospital discharge were reported in 85% of HBO2-treated and 65% of control patients with severe CO poisoning (reported OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 11.9; P = 0.03)", though "If any multiple-measures statistical correction is used, this finding becomes no longer statistically significant, and outcomes at 1-month follow-up were the same in both treatment groups". Additional data note that "the 2 Class III studies that enrolled only patients who did not lose consciousness produced conflicting results". For patients with loss of consciousness or coma, "Raphael et al12 randomized patients who had loss of consciousness or coma (groups B1 and B2, n = 286) to receive either 1 or 2 HBO2 treatments", and this arm "did show that outcomes are worse in the more severe poisoning group, regardless of treatment group assignment".

### Carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning in the burned pregnant patient: an indication for hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^112rAoHw]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a small molecule poison released as a product of incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide binds hemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery. This effect is exacerbated in the burned pregnant patient by fetal hemoglobin that binds CO 2.5- to 3-fold stronger than maternal hemoglobin. With no signature clinical symptom, diagnosis depends on patient injury history, elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels, and alterations in mental status. The standard of care for treatment of CO intoxication is 100% normobaric oxygen, which decreases the half-life of CO in the bloodstream from 5 hours to 1 hour. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is a useful adjunct to rapidly reduce the half-life of CO to 20 minutes and the incidence of delayed neurologic sequelae. Because of the slow disassociation of CO from hemoglobin in the fetus, there is a far stronger indication for HBO2 in the burned pregnant patient than in other burn patient populations. Cyanide intoxication is often a comorbid disease with CO in inhalation injury from an enclosed fire, but may be the predominant toxin. It acts synergistically with CO to effectively lower the lethal doses of both cyanide and CO. Diagnosis is best made in the presence of high lactate levels, carboxyhemoglobin concentrations greater than 10%, injury history of smoke inhalation from an enclosed fire, and alterations in consciousness. While treatment with hydroxocobalamin is the standard of care and has the effect of reducing concomitant CO toxicity, data indicate cyanide may also be displaced by HBO2. Carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning presents potential complications impacting care. This review addresses the mechanism of action, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of CO and cyanide poisonings in the burned pregnant patient and the use of HBO2 therapy.

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning — epidemiology, kinetics, and sequelae in emergency department populations include substantial burden and measurable benefits of oxygen therapy. There are approximately 50,000 emergency department visits per year, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 annual deaths from severe toxicity. CO binds hemoglobin with an affinity approximately 220 times that of oxygen, producing an elimination half-life of 4 to 5 hours without therapy; oxygen therapy decreases the elimination half-life to 85 minutes (range, 26 to 148 minutes) with normobaric oxygen and to 20 minutes with hyperbaric oxygen. Neurologic sequelae can be delayed by 2 to 21 days and have been described in 12% to 68% of poisoned patients, and mortality risk can be up to a 3-fold increase at a median follow-up of 7.6 years after exposure.

Carbon monoxide poisoning represents a potentially preventable and reversible cause of mortality and morbidity if sources and cases can be identified. The elderly have been shown to be particularly at risk. Concerns continue to be raised about potential unrecognised cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. These concerns arise from difficulties in knowing who to suspect as a potential victim of poisoning as well as how, when and what to test. In general carbon monoxide has no helpful unique clinical presentation and is known to mimic common illnesses as well as exacerbate established diseases. As a gas it is undetectable by the human senses and is potentially present in most households. This paper reviews the issues associated with carbon monoxide poisoning including pointers to early diagnosis and discussion of pathophysiology and management.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless and colorless gas that can lead to fulminant and life-threatening intoxications. Besides an early diagnosis, an appropriate treatment of the intoxication is important. In this context the reduction of CO concentration in blood and tissues is crucial revealing hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBO) as a highly promising tool. However, the benefit of HBO in CO intoxications is still considered controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence of the role of HBO treatment in isolated CO intoxication.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not prevent delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae in a prospective observational study with propensity score matching in 224 patients with acute carbon monoxide toxicity [^112Znxpe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It is important to prevent the development of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) in acute carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication, but no effective treatment has been clearly identified. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is one of the treatment options in acute CO poisoning; however, whether it can prevent the development of DNS is controversial.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of normobaric oxygen (NBO) and HBO in preventing DNS.

Methods

This prospective observational study was conducted on all patients with CO poisoning admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital from 2016 to 2019. We followed-up patients to determine whether symptoms of DNS occurred at ≤ 6 months. We matched the propensity score to an equivalent distribution of potential covariates.

Results

A total of 224 patients with CO poisoning were enrolled in this study. NBO was used for 26 patients and HBO for 198 patients. DNS occurred in 40 patients. There were significant differences between the NBO and HBO groups in terms of carboxyhemoglobin, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay. The incidence of DNS was 19.2% in the HBO group, which was higher than the 7.7% observed in the NBO group, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.18). After propensity score matching, the incidence of DNS did not differ between the NBO and HBO groups (8.3% vs. 10.4%, p > 0.99).

Conclusion

There was no difference in the incidence of DNS between groups receiving HBO and NBO in acute CO intoxication.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning (acute) [^114QmV7z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gas, and poisoning causes hypoxia, cell damage, and death. Exposure to carbon monoxide is measured either directly from blood samples and expressed as a percentage of carboxyhaemoglobin, or indirectly using the carbon monoxide in expired breath. Carboxyhaemoglobin percentage is the most frequently used biomarker of carbon monoxide exposure. Although the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning can be confirmed by detecting elevated levels of carboxyhaemoglobin in the blood, the presence of clinical signs and symptoms after known exposure to carbon monoxide should not be ignored.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of oxygen treatments for acute carbon monoxide poisoning? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 100% hyperbaric oxygen, oxygen 28%, and oxygen 100% by non-re-breather mask.

At a glance
- Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death if inhaled.
- Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it. What it is Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas. Symptoms The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as "flu-like. " If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping, drunk, or under the influence of other substances can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. Risk factors Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning.

Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100, 000 visit an emergency department, and more than 14, 000 are hospitalized. Reducing risk CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps. Chimneys, charcoal, and portable appliances Have your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to build up inside your home or cabin. Never burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal
- red, gray, black, or white
- gives off CO. Never use a portable gas camp stove indoors. Do not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors.

Portable generators Never use a generator inside your home or garage, even if doors and windows are open. Only use generators outside, more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors, and vents. When using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup CO detector in your home.

### Acute carbon monoxide poisoning treatment by non-invasive CPAP-ventilation, and by reservoir face mask: two simultaneous cases [^112zRK2Q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Treatment focuses on the rapid elimination of CO and management of hypoxia. Oxygen is the cornerstone of therapy, and usually applied via a reservoir face mask. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy eliminates CO faster, but requires extensive equipment and expertise. Non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation using a tight mask provides a higher inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO₂) compared to a reservoir face mask, and increases gas exchange. As this modality is widely available, it might represent a supplemental approach to current treatment of CO poisoning. We present two simultaneous cases of a married couple of 31- and 34-year-old patients, who concurrently suffered CO intoxication due to a faulty gas heater in their apartment. Both reported similar symptoms of headache and weakness, and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb)-levels at admission were 21% in both patients. One patient was treated by non-invasive CPAP-ventilation support with a FiO₂ of 100%, whereas the other was treated by conventional oxygen inhalation. In the patient treated by CPAP, COHb-levels fell quickly to 6% within one hour, and reached 3% after 90 min, whereas it took six hours to reach the same levels in the patient with conventional treatment. This vividly illustrates the potential of CPAP therapy as an alternative to conventional oxygen inhalation in the treatment of CO poisoning.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning [^111PSQf3]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

CO is an insidious poison with many sources of exposure. CO poisoning produces diverse signs and symptoms, which often are subtle and can be misdiagnosed easily. Failure to diagnose CO poisoning may result insignificant morbidity and mortality and allow continued exposure to a dangerous environment. In the ED, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for occult CO exposure. Headache, particularly when associated with certain environments, and flulike illness in the wintertime with symptomatic cohabitants should raise the index of suspicion in the ED significantly for occult CO poisoning. Emergency treatment of CO poisoning begins with inhalation of supplemental oxygen and aggressive supportive care. HBOT accelerates dissociation of CO from hemoglobin and may prevent DNS. Absolute indications for HBOT for CO poisoning remain controversial, although most would agree that HBOT is indicated in patients who are comatose, are neurologically abnormal, have a history of loss of consciousness with their exposure, or have cardiac dysfunction. Pregnancy with an elevated CO-Hgb level (> 15–20%) also is widely considered an indication for treatment. HBOT may be considered in patients who have persistent symptoms despite NBO, metabolic acidosis, abnormalities on neuropsychometric testing, or significantly elevated levels. The ideal regimen of oxygen therapy has yet to be determined, and significant controversy exists regarding HBOT protocols. The emergency physician may be confronted with the difficult decision regarding disposition and even transfer to a hyperbaric facility. Often the local medical toxicologist, poison control center, or hyperbaric unit can assist the emergency physician with the decision-making process.

### Diagnosis and management of inhalation injury: an updated review [^115TDM4k]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic toxicities

CO has an affinity for hemoglobin 200 to 250 times greater than oxygen and exposure results in hypoxia and ischemia. Unlike inhalation injury, CO has deleterious effects at the level of hemoglobin and more specifically the ability for oxygen delivery. CO acts to displace oxygen from hemoglobin (forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb)) and binds to cytochrome c oxidase. COHb shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, ultimately leading to decreased oxygen delivery at the tissue level and interfering with cellular respiration at the mitochondrial level. Symptoms of CO toxicity include confusion, stupor, coma, seizures, and myocardial infarction. CO diagnosis requires the use of a Co-oximeter (not available in every blood gas lab), since elevated COHb levels may be present despite normal PaO₂ and oxygen saturation readings. Available since 2005, newer, non-invasive CO-oximetry monitors permit more rapid diagnosis. CO poisoning is associated with an increased risk of mortality even at long-term follow-up (median of 7.6 years). Complications of CO poisoning include persistent and delayed neurologic sequelae and myocardial injury, as well as functional effects on leukocytes, platelets, and vascular endothelium. Treatment of CO poisoning involves providing 100% oxygen, which shortens the half-life of COHb to about 45 min.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been used to treat CO poisoning and can further reduce the COHb half-life to about 20 min. The benefits of HBO were evident in a study of 75 patients with acute CO poisoning. Three treatment sessions were administered within 24 h and neuropsychological tests were administered at various points throughout the study. They found the rates of cognitive sequelae were reduced at 6 weeks and 12 months after CO poisoning in patients with three HBO sessions. It should be pointed out that the theoretical basis for HBO up to 24 h after exposure is to facilitate the clearance of CO from cytochrome c oxidase in the brain, rather than to increase its clearance from hemoglobin in the blood. Logistical factors have limited the utilization of HBO. A systematic review found that not enough evidence exists at this point to determine definitively whether HBO reduces adverse neurologic outcomes after CO poisoning. Continued advancements in HBO technology combined with increased ICU accessibility will likely result in the generation of more clinical studies in this area.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning caused by water pipe smoking: a Case series [^116bRAMw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Carbon monoxide-related symptoms caused by water pipe smoking may be a frequent occurrence. This might often be overlooked, because patients will not always identify the smoke exposure as the cause of their presenting complaints and may well withhold this information.

Case Report

A series of three patients who were 15 to 28 years of age presented to the emergency department with nonspecific symptoms and were found to have carbon monoxide poisoning from water pipe smoking. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case series might improve recognition of this phenomenon. Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause serious problems, yet it could be easily diagnosed and treated. Identifying this condition can expedite treatment and prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests in an attempt to explain its symptoms.

### Pre-labor exposure to carbon monoxide: should the neonate be treated with hyperbaric oxygenation? [^117NZip2]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A woman was admitted to hospital in the 39th week of gestation due to syncope, followed by nausea and headache. The patient's history revealed a 10-hour, unintentional exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), secondary to burning charcoal for indoor heating. Because of monitored fetal distress, a cesarean section was performed. The newborn had an Apgar score of 4, 9, and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes post-delivery, respectively. The 1-minute Apgar was low due to lack of spontaneous breathing, reduced tonus, bluish coloration, and reduced response to pain. The neonate's carboxyhemoglobin level seven hours post-CO exposure was 22%, and arterial pH was 7.28. Neurological examination 30 minutes after delivery showed no pathology. The neonate was treated with 100% normobaric oxygen for 12 hours. We discuss the treatment options for fetal CO poisoning and specific considerations that had to be taken into account in the present case.

### Global, regional, and national mortality due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning, 2000–2021: results from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^116KwX5e]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Most carbon monoxide poisonings occur in the home, with some studies reporting that as many as 80% happen within residences. Out-of-date, ill-maintained, or incorrectly installed heating systems have been linked to many cases of residential unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning. Homes that rely solely on biomass fuels for heating or cooking can put residents at high risk for carbon monoxide poisoning. Even in warmer climates or in warmer months, carbon monoxide poisoning is possible under such circumstances. A study from South Korea showed that a transition away from wood and charcoal as the most commonly used fuels led to a drastic decrease in carbon monoxide poisoning deaths. Even though data are scarce on acute carbon monoxide poisoning incidents and fatalities in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, a few studies have found elevated levels of carbon monoxide indoors, well above the WHO recommended thresholds. These studies noted that, particularly in rural areas, switching to clean fuels might not be an immediately feasible solution, and recommended addressing housing characteristics in other ways (eg, improving home ventilation by increasing window area) in the short term. Increased public health education about the sources and dangers of carbon monoxide, and the risks of using alternative heating and cooking equipment indoors, could help to reduce the occurrence of severe carbon monoxide poisoning events under these conditions. Education of health professionals to recognise the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning can also help to reduce the risk of future, more severe poisoning events. Additionally, when used properly, carbon monoxide alarms are cost-effective tools for preventing severe outcomes of carbon monoxide poisoning, and increased education and legislation around their use could further reduce mortality. Findings from studies looking at the effectiveness of carbon monoxide alarms have been mixed and do not always show significant decreases in poisoning events, but these studies often cite scarce data and inconsistencies in usage as challenges to conclusive evidence. Laws around carbon monoxide alarm use are highly variable across countries; if such laws exist, they often require only newly constructed residential homes and apartment buildings to contain carbon monoxide alarms. Even with laws mandating carbon monoxide alarm installation in most of the USA, only an estimated 50% of homes have carbon monoxide alarms in working order. Further research is necessary to pinpoint the specific catalysts and inform future priority setting and resource allocation for preventive interventions.

### Carbon monoxide toxicity [^1131gquf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide accounts for thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Clinical effects can be diverse and include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, syncope, seizures, coma, dysrhythmias, and cardiac ischemia, and severe toxicity generally affects the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Because of its complex pathophysiology, effects of toxicity can be acute or delayed. The diagnosis can be elusive, as carboxyhemoglobin levels do not always correlate with the degree of poisoning. Even when the diagnosis is certain, appropriate therapy is widely debated. Normobaric oxygen is the standard therapy, and the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear.

### Carbon monoxide exposures – United States, 2000–2009 [^116ZDCwU]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of unintentional poisoning deaths in the United States. CO is an odorless, colorless gas that usually remains undetectable until exposure results in injury or death. CO poisoning is preventable; nonetheless, unintentional, non — fire-related CO poisoning is responsible for approximately 15,000 emergency department visits and nearly 500 deaths annually in the United States. National estimates of CO exposures have been based on secondary data sources, such as hospital administrative records, and are limited to exposures treated within the health-care system. To describe more completely the national burden of CO exposure and risk factors associated with vulnerable populations, CDC used data from the National Poison Data System (NPDS) to characterize reported unintentional, non — fire-related CO exposures, including those that were managed at the site of exposure and were not treated at a health-care facility. Among 68,316 CO exposures reported to poison centers during 2000–2009, a total of 30,798 (45.1%) were managed at the site of exposure with instructions from the poison center by telephone, 36,691 (53.7%) were treated at a health-care facility, and the management site for the remainder was unknown. Although symptoms varied slightly between persons managed on-site and those treated at a health-care facility, most CO exposures occurred at home and most often involved females, children aged ≤ 17 years, and adults aged 18–44 years. Surveillance and analysis of data from NPDS and secondary sources might provide a more comprehensive description of the burden of CO exposure in the United States and assist in the development of interventions better targeted to high-risk populations.

Carbon monoxide poisoning — notes and educational pearls highlight that pulse oximetry is inaccurate due to the carbon monoxide binding with hemoglobin, and as maternal carboxyhemoglobin levels do not accurately reflect fetal carboxyhemoglobin levels, pregnant patients are more likely to be treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Clinicians should consider cyanide toxicity if carbon monoxide poisoning is from a fire. Pertinent assessment findings include that early and repeat assessment of patient's mental status and motor function are extremely useful in determining response to therapy and the need for hyperbaric therapy, along with identification of possible etiology of poisoning, time of symptom onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatment, and response to therapy.

### Global, regional, and national mortality due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning, 2000–2021: results from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^115wvimR]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, deaths due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning are largely preventable. Despite this, approximately 30 000 people die annually worldwide from carbon monoxide poisoning. Although unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning mortality has decreased over the past 21 years, the decline has not been consistent over time or across regions. The need for increased public health surveillance to fully understand the scope of the problem is great. Improved accessibility of safe heating and cooking equipment, increased use of carbon monoxide alarms, and public education to understand the causes of, and risks associated with, carbon monoxide exposure are needed to spur further reductions in mortality.

### Carbon monoxide intoxication: an updated review [^115nds2Q]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO), a highly toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, is a relatively common cause of human injury. Human toxicity is often overlooked because CO is tasteless and odorless and its clinical symptoms and signs are non specific. The brain and the heart may be severely affected after CO exposure with carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels exceeding 20%. Damage occurs because the affinity of hemoglobin for CO is 210 times higher than for O₂. Hypoxic brain damage predominates in the cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter and basal ganglia, especially in the globus pallidus. Diagnosis requires clinical acumen and a high index of suspicion, combined with epidemiological data, clinical examination, analysis of ambient air CO and patient COHb levels; also required are cardiology evaluation including ECG as well as neurological evaluation including brain imaging (CT and/or MRI, MR spectroscopy), and neuropsychological testing. Although immediate O₂ breathing is sometimes an adequate treatment, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is favored. Subsequently, only symptomatic therapy is available for the long-term sequelae of CO poisoning.

Introduction

Deaths due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning are often preventable. Quantification of mortality from carbon monoxide poisoning is essential to draw attention to this threat and reduce unnecessary deaths. To our knowledge, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is the only study that has estimated carbon monoxide poisoning mortality globally. Other studies have sought to estimate the morbidity and mortality associated with carbon monoxide poisoning at the country or regional level and to identify risk factors for such poisoning events. However, many of these studies have been done only in countries in which high-quality mortality data are available, focused on a single country, or relied on previous iterations of the GBD. Due to differences in the time periods covered, case definitions, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding systems used, the ability to make comparisons across studies is limited.

Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is odourless, colourless, and tasteless, making it undetectable to the human senses. It is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels, such as wood, coal, and natural gas. Common household sources include heating and cooking equipment, such as furnaces, wood stoves, charcoal grills, gas stoves and heaters, and generators, as well as vehicle exhaust. Unintentional fatal carbon monoxide poisonings mostly occur within residences and are more common during the winter months when heating systems are employed, windows are closed, and ventilation is reduced. High levels of carbon monoxide or prolonged periods of exposure to the gas can quickly lead to severe bodily harm through multiple mechanisms, such as interrupting the delivery of oxygen throughout the body, impeding the use of oxygen, causing oxidative stress, or impairing cellular function. Mild carbon monoxide poisoning often presents with non-descript symptoms, such as nausea, headache, and fatigue, and more severe poisoning can manifest in several ways, including loss of consciousness, acute cardiac events, and death. Although prompt removal from the source of exposure and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have been recommended as two strategies for reversing the effects of, and reducing lasting harm due to, carbon monoxide poisoning, there is currently no true antidote, underscoring the importance of prevention.

### Hyperbaric oxygen for acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^112Uucst]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning commonly have cognitive sequelae. We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric-oxygen treatment on such cognitive sequelae.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic acute carbon monoxide poisoning in equal proportions to three chamber sessions within a 24-hour period, consisting of either three hyperbaric-oxygen treatments or one normobaric-oxygen treatment plus two sessions of exposure to normobaric room air. Oxygen treatments were administered from a high-flow reservoir through a face mask that prevented rebreathing or by endotracheal tube. Neuropsychological tests were administered immediately after chamber sessions 1 and 3, and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after enrollment. The primary outcome was cognitive sequelae six weeks after carbon monoxide poisoning.

Results

The trial was stopped after the third of four scheduled interim analyses, at which point there were 76 patients in each group. Cognitive sequelae at six weeks were less frequent in the hyperbaric-oxygen group (19 of 76 [25.0 percent]) than in the normobaric-oxygen group (35 of 76 [46.1 percent], P = 0.007), even after adjustment for cerebellar dysfunction and for stratification variables (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.92]; P = 0.03). The presence of cerebellar dysfunction before treatment was associated with the occurrence of cognitive sequelae (odds ratio, 5.71 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.69 to 19.31]; P = 0.005) and was more frequent in the normobaric-oxygen group (15 percent vs. 4 percent, P = 0.03). Cognitive sequelae were less frequent in the hyperbaric-oxygen group at 12 months, according to the intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Three hyperbaric-oxygen treatments within a 24-hour period appeared to reduce the risk of cognitive sequelae 6 weeks and 12 months after acute carbon monoxide poisoning.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) treatment algorithms and carboxyhemoglobin thresholds state that published CO poisoning treatment algorithms commonly attempt to risk-stratify patients to provide HBO2 only to those most likely to benefit, yet although the ability of carboxyhemoglobin levels to predict mortality, morbidity, or response to therapy is universally considered poor, various algorithms still recommend HBO2 if carboxyhemoglobin levels exceed 15%, 20%, 25%, or 40%, regardless of signs or symptoms.

Inhalation injury consists of a multitude of insults, the first of which is the toxic gases inhaled during the combustion of organic and inorganic substances. Significant morbidity and mortality in patients with burn injury occur due to the varying effects of these gases. This section of the compendium initially addresses two classically described inhaled gases: carbon monoxide and cyanide, followed by a discussion of a gas associated with illicit drug use: metamphetamine. Understanding the varying effects of the toxic gases at the scene of injury may facilitate the development of specific treatment regimens for inhalation injury.

### Anesthesia-related carbon monoxide exposure: toxicity and potential therapy [^113scQVC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) during general anesthesia can result from volatile anesthetic degradation by carbon dioxide absorbents and rebreathing of endogenously produced CO. Although adherence to the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation guidelines reduces the risk of CO poisoning, patients may still experience subtoxic CO exposure during low-flow anesthesia. The consequences of such exposures are relatively unknown. In contrast to the widely recognized toxicity of high CO concentrations, the biologic activity of low concentration CO has recently been shown to be cytoprotective. As such, low-dose CO is being explored as a novel treatment for a variety of different diseases. Here, we review the concept of anesthesia-related CO exposure, identify the sources of production, detail the mechanisms of overt CO toxicity, highlight the cellular effects of low-dose CO, and discuss the potential therapeutic role for CO as part of routine anesthetic management.

Carbon monoxide poisoning — hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) versus normobaric oxygen for long-term neurocognitive outcomes: The clinical question asked, "In ED patients diagnosed with acute CO poisoning, does HBO2 therapy as compared with normobaric oxygen therapy improve long-term neurocognitive outcomes?" Level B recommendations state, "Emergency physicians should use HBO2 therapy or high-flow normobaric therapy for acute CO-poisoned patients", and "It remains unclear whether HBO2 therapy is superior to normobaric oxygen therapy for improving long-term neurocognitive outcomes", with Level A and Level C recommendations "None specified". For this question, "Two hundred sixteen articles were identified in the search; 43 articles were selected from the search results for further review, with 7 studies included for this critical question", and background notes that "Long-term neurocognitive deficits as a result of CO poisoning, generally referred to as neurologic sequelae, are some of the most feared clinical outcomes of acute CO toxicity", while "its benefits and use in acute CO poisoning remain controversial".

### Diagnosis and management of inhalation injury: an updated review [^117VhQgp]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite important advances in the care of patients with inhalation injury, which continues to be largely supportive, morbidity and mortality remain high. Inhalation injury can feature supraglottic thermal injury, chemical irritation of the respiratory tract, systemic toxicity due to agents such as carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide, or a combination of these insults. The resultant inflammatory response may cause higher fluid resuscitation volumes, progressive pulmonary dysfunction, prolonged ventilator days, increased risk of pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

In this review we describe the recent advances made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inhalation injury, diagnostic criteria and injury severity, complications, current treatment options, and future avenues of research.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is common in modern society, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States annually. Over the past two decades, sufficient information has been published about carbon monoxide poisoning in the medical literature to draw firm conclusions about many aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical management of the syndrome, along with evidence-based recommendations for optimal clinical practice. This article provides clinical practice guidance to the pulmonary and critical care community regarding the diagnosis, management, and prevention of acute CO poisoning. The article represents the consensus opinion of four recognized content experts in the field. Supporting data were drawn from the published, peer-reviewed literature on CO poisoning, placing emphasis on selecting studies that most closely mirror clinical practice.

### Early carbon monoxide intoxication: happy to be poisoned? [^111gtPM8]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is the commonest cause of death by poisoning in the UK and chronic exposure is thought to be a frequently missed diagnosis. Early recognition of carbon monoxide poisoning is vital to institute prompt treatment and to prevent exposure to others. An incident of mass exposure to carbon monoxide is presented where euphoria, lasting several hours, was the only symptom reported in approximately one quarter of the casualties. This has not been reported previously and we believe that mild carbon monoxide intoxication should be included in the list of differential diagnoses of inappropriate euphoria.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning — randomized controlled trial of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) versus sham: A randomized controlled trial (Design 1), double-blinded, with N = 152 and patients of all severity included evaluated HBO2 delivered as 3 sessions within 24 h after ≥ 3 h mask O2; the HBO2 group received 3 sessions with maximum HBO2 treatment pressure 3.0 ATA for the first session and 2.0 ATA for the subsequent 2 sessions, while controls received sham HBO2. The primary outcome was neurologic sequelae at 6 wks defined as either symptoms+aggregate of 6 neuropsychological test scores ≥ 1 SD below predicted or no symptoms+aggregate of 6 neuropsychological test scores ≥ 2 SD below predicted, with blinded assessment. At 6 weeks, neurologic sequelae occurred in 25.0% of HBO2-treated patients and 46.1% of controls (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.20–0.78; P = 0.007), with NNT = 4.8; the incidence of neurologic sequelae decreased but remained statistically significant at 6 and 12 mo, and there was no significant difference between groups in overall/mean neuropsychological test scores, depression, activities of daily living, or subscores of the 36 item short form general health survey. Reported limitations included lost to enrollment/declined to participate 54%, lost to follow-up 5%, suicidal patients 31%, and mean time to treatment 5.6 h.

Carbon monoxide poisoning — patient safety considerations advise to consider affixing a carbon monoxide detector to an equipment bag that is routinely taken into scene (if it signals alarm, don appropriate respiratory protection and exit scene) to assist with detection of occult CO toxicity; remove patient and response personnel from potentially hazardous environment as soon as possible; and provide instruction to the patient, the patient's family, and other appropriate bystanders to not enter the environment where the carbon monoxide exposure occurred until the source of the poisoning has been eliminated. Do not look for cherry red skin coloration as an indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, as this is an unusual finding, and CO oximeter devices may yield inaccurate low/normal results for patients with CO poisoning. All patients with probable or suspected CO poisoning should be transported to the nearest appropriate hospital based on their presenting signs and symptoms.

For therapy, entries include "Randomized, controlled trial or meta-analyses of randomized trials", "Nonrandomized trial", "Case series", "Case report", and "Other (eg, consensus, review)". For diagnosis, entries include "Prospective cohort using a criterion standard", "Retrospective observational", "Case series", "Case report", and "Other (eg, consensus, review)". For prognosis, entries include "Population prospective cohort", "Retrospective cohort", "Case series", "Case report", and "Other (eg, consensus, review)". The schema notes that "Some designs (eg, surveys) will not fit this schema and should be assessed individually", and lists objectives: "Objective is to measure therapeutic efficacy comparing ≥ 2 interventions", "Objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests", and "Objective is to predict outcome including mortality and morbidity".

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^1153xgJ5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning — Weaver et al observational analysis combined clinical trial participants and eligible nonenrolled patients (238 total patients included in analysis) to evaluate neuropsychiatric testing at 6 wks, 6 mo, and 12 mo, with the primary outcome of 6 wk cognitive sequelae. Interventions were 75 patients received HBO2; 163 did not receive HBO2, of whom 146/163 received 100% O2 for a mean time of 6.9 h and 17/163 received no therapy. At 6 wks, sequelae occurred in 37% (87/238) overall, 24% (18/75) with HBO2, 41% (60/146) with O2 therapy only, and 53% (9/17) with no therapy; risk factors for 6 wk cognitive sequelae were age ≥ 36 y and CO exposure duration ≥ 24 h, with risk factor reduction with HBO2 therapy in patients ≥ 36 y: OR 0.3 (0.2–0.6). The class rating is III (for 6 wk cognitive sequelae), and limitations note that "The mixing of clinical trial data with data from patients not enrolled in the clinical trial makes this a large case series only".

Methods

Literature search

The methodology of this systematic review was designed and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statementsand guidelines from the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE). A literature search was done on Pubmed, Embase and Scopus and the terms undertaken were: "neonates" AND ("hypocapnia" OR "hypercapnia"). Additional studies identified during a manual search were also included.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies that satisfied the following criteria were included into our literature review: (1) full text available in English, (2) human subjects and (3) peer-reviewed journals. Exclusion criteria were established to eliminate studies beyond the scope of the review: editorials; letters and case reports; duplicate publications; and use of animal models. The publication years were not restricted due to a limitation in the number of studies available.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^111b8U1J]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy — scope and key clinical questions address adult emergency department patients with suspected or diagnosed acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and are based on a systematic review with graded evidence. The policy evaluates whether noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) measurement can accurately diagnose CO toxicity, whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) compared with normobaric oxygen improves long-term neurocognitive outcomes in diagnosed patients, and whether cardiac testing can predict morbidity or mortality. It updates the 2008 ACEP clinical policy, which concluded that although HBO2 is a therapeutic option for CO-poisoned patients, its use cannot be mandated, and this revision revisits HBO2 and addresses pulse CO oximetry and cardiac testing.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) versus normobaric oxygen — Class II randomized trial (Weaver et al): In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving 152 patients, all enrolled patients received either 3 sessions of HBO2 therapy or normobaric oxygen with sham HBO2; at 6 weeks after poisoning, HBO2 was associated with a 21.1% (95% CI 6% to 34%) absolute reduction in neurologic sequelae (46.1% versus 25.0%) with an unadjusted OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.78), and at 12 months the absolute reduction was 14.5% (95% CI 1% to 28%) with unadjusted OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.98); no differences were found in several secondary outcomes at 6 weeks, and a Class III analysis that included 91 eligible but non-enrolled patients found that age 36 or older and CO exposure duration of 24 hours or greater were risk factors for 6‑week cognitive sequelae, whereas symptoms and initial CoHb level were not independent risk factors.
