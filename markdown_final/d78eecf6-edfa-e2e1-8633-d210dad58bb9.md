## Question

A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because she is severely underweight. She is easily fatigued and has difficulty keeping up with other children at her daycare. She has a good appetite and eats 3 full meals a day. She has 4 to 5 bowel movements daily with bulky, foul-smelling stools that float. She has had recurrent episodes of sinusitis since infancy. Her parents report that she recently started to snore during her sleep. She is at the 15th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. A few scattered expiratory crackles are heard in the thorax. There is abdominal distention. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's failure to thrive?

Answer Choices:
A. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
B. Impaired intestinal amino acid transport
C. Intestinal inflammatory reaction to gluten
D. T. whippelii infiltration of intestinal villi

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis best explains a 4-year-old girl with failure to thrive, steatorrhea, recurrent sinusitis, and new-onset snoring, and to choose among exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired intestinal amino acid transport, celiac disease, and Whipple's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and which organ systems are involved. Then, I should verify which single diagnosis plausibly links growth failure, fat malabsorption, and chronic upper respiratory disease. Next, I will examine each option against the key features and the strength of evidence. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and outline the immediate workup and why the alternatives are less likely or mismatched to the phenotype.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The child has failure to thrive with good appetite, steatorrhea with bulky, foul-smelling, floating stools, abdominal distention, recurrent sinusitis since infancy, and new snoring, with mild pulmonary findings. This constellation points to a systemic disease with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and chronic sinopulmonary involvement rather than a purely gastrointestinal or immunologic isolate, so I need to keep a multi-system etiology in mind as I proceed.

> Now, I will examine exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as a candidate. Wait, let me verify the classic features: fat malabsorption with steatorrhea, abdominal distention, and growth failure despite adequate intake are characteristic of EPI, and in pediatrics the most common cause is cystic fibrosis, which also explains chronic sinopulmonary disease and can contribute to upper airway obstruction and snoring via chronic nasal disease and polyps. Guidelines emphasize confirming EPI in CF and monitoring pancreatic sufficiency over time, which fits this presentation well [^58f5df2b] [^58f5df2b] [^7403c540].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the competing options. Impaired intestinal amino acid transport would typically present with protein-losing enteropathy or specific transport defects, but I do not see edema, hypoproteinemia, or a pattern that matches Hartnup or lysinuric protein intolerance here, and there is no mention of renal involvement or specific aminoaciduria, so this seems mismatched to the steatorrhea and respiratory phenotype, making it less likely.

> Next, I should review celiac disease. Intestinal inflammation to gluten can cause malabsorption and growth failure, but the recurrent sinusitis and new-onset snoring are not expected in isolated celiac disease, and while extraintestinal features occur, chronic upper respiratory disease is not a hallmark. Given the prominence of steatorrhea and the sinopulmonary history, celiac disease alone does not tie the multisystem findings together as cleanly as EPI due to CF, though I should acknowledge it remains a consideration if CF is excluded.

> I will now examine Whipple's disease. Tropheryma whipplei infiltration is rare in children and classically presents with systemic symptoms, arthralgia, and neurologic signs; steatorrhea can occur, but the absence of the typical systemic and neurologic features and the presence of chronic sinusitis from infancy make Whipple's disease an unlikely fit here, so I should deprioritize it despite its theoretical possibility.

> Let me synthesize. The most parsimonious explanation that unifies steatorrhea, growth failure, and chronic sinopulmonary disease is cystic fibrosis with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. CF is the leading cause of EPI in children, CRS is highly prevalent in CF and often refractory, and upper airway disease with nasal polyps and obstruction is common, explaining the snoring. Guidelines recommend confirming EPI in CF and recognizing CRS as a modifying comorbidity that should prompt CF screening in refractory cases, which aligns with this case [^e88e1323] [^7403c540] [^1ce38494].

> I should double-check the immediate next steps. I need to confirm EPI with a fecal elastase-1 test and, if positive, pursue CF diagnostic confirmation with sweat chloride testing and CFTR genetic analysis, while also evaluating for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and nutritional status. Given the new snoring, I should screen for pediatric obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and consider ENT evaluation for nasal polyps and adenotonsillar hypertrophy, as these are common in CF and can impact growth and sleep [^e88e1323] [^7403c540] [^78370473].

> But wait, what if the sweat test is normal or only one CFTR variant is found? I need to ensure I consider CFTR-related metabolic syndrome or CF screen positive inconclusive diagnosis, where pancreatic status can fluctuate and guidelines still advise periodic reassessment of exocrine function and clinical evolution, so I should plan longitudinal follow-up if initial testing is equivocal [^23586cf8] [^19e46231].

> In summary, after weighing the differential and the strength of evidence linking the phenotype to a single coherent disease, the most likely underlying cause of this child's failure to thrive is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis, with the steatorrhea reflecting fat malabsorption and the recurrent sinusitis and snoring reflecting CF-related upper airway disease. I should confirm EPI and proceed with CF diagnostics and multidisciplinary management without delay [^e88e1323] [^7403c540].

The most likely cause of this child's failure to thrive is **exocrine pancreatic insufficiency** due to cystic fibrosis [^e88e1323], which explains the steatorrhea, abdominal distension, and recurrent sinusitis [^7403c540]; confirm with a fecal elastase-1 test and sweat chloride testing [^e88e1323]. Celiac disease is less likely given the prominent respiratory involvement, and Whipple's disease is rare in children. Impaired amino acid transport does not fit the clinical picture.

---

## Clinical features and their implications

- **Failure to thrive**: Severe underweight (3rd percentile) and short stature (15th percentile) despite adequate caloric intake suggest malabsorption or increased energy expenditure [^81fe66d3].

- **Steatorrhea**: Bulky, foul-smelling, floating stools indicate fat malabsorption, characteristic of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) [^notfound].

- **Abdominal distension**: Common in EPI due to undigested fats and carbohydrates causing gas and bloating [^notfound].

- **Recurrent sinusitis**: Chronic upper respiratory infections are typical in cystic fibrosis (CF) due to impaired mucociliary clearance and thick secretions [^7403c540].

- **Snoring**: Recent snoring suggests nasal obstruction from chronic sinus disease, common in CF [^notfound].

- **Pale conjunctivae**: Indicate anemia, often due to chronic inflammation or malabsorption of iron and other micronutrients [^notfound].

- **Expiratory crackles**: Mild pulmonary findings can reflect chronic lung disease or recurrent infections, consistent with CF [^notfound].

## Differential diagnosis and analysis

| **Option** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical correlation** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency | - CF causes EPI with fat malabsorption <br/> - Chronic sinopulmonary disease | - Steatorrhea <br/> - Abdominal distension <br/> - Recurrent sinusitis <br/> - Growth failure | High |
| B. Impaired intestinal amino acid transport | - Rare genetic defects (e.g. Hartnup) cause amino acid malabsorption | - Growth failure <br/> - But steatorrhea and sinusitis are not typical | Low |
| C. Intestinal inflammatory reaction to gluten (celiac disease) | - Immune-mediated villous atrophy causes malabsorption | - Growth failure <br/> - Steatorrhea <br/> - But recurrent sinusitis is not typical | Moderate |
| D. T. whippelii infiltration of intestinal villi (Whipple's disease) | - Rare bacterial infection causing malabsorption | - Steatorrhea <br/> - But extremely rare in children <br/> - No sinusitis | Very low |

## Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) due to cystic fibrosis

- **Pathophysiology**: CFTR mutation causes thick secretions, EPI, and chronic lung disease [^047cf577].

- **Clinical features**: Steatorrhea, abdominal distension, growth failure, recurrent sinusitis, and chronic cough are classic [^notfound].

- **Diagnosis**: Fecal elastase-1 < 100 µg/g confirms EPI; sweat chloride ≥ 60 mmol/L supports CF [^notfound].

- **Management**: Pancreatic enzyme replacement, nutritional support, and CFTR modulators when indicated [^437e3d5c].

---

## Why other options are less likely

- **Impaired intestinal amino acid transport**: Does not explain steatorrhea or sinusitis [^notfound].

- **Celiac disease**: Less likely given prominent respiratory involvement and lack of typical GI symptoms (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting) [^notfound].

- **Whipple's disease**: Extremely rare in children and does not explain recurrent sinusitis [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Confirm EPI**: Fecal elastase-1 test [^e88e1323].

- **Confirm CF**: Sweat chloride test and CFTR genetic testing [^notfound].

- **Assess nutritional status**: Vitamin A, D, E, K levels; CBC; iron studies [^notfound].

- **Evaluate respiratory involvement**: Chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests if indicated [^notfound].

---

The most likely cause is **exocrine pancreatic insufficiency** from cystic fibrosis, which best explains the steatorrhea, growth failure, and recurrent sinusitis; confirm with fecal elastase-1 and sweat testing, then initiate CF-directed therapy [^e88e1323].

Giardia clinical manifestations in children are characterized by an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with children usually presenting with short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; others may have a protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children, and stools can initially be profuse and watery and later become greasy and foul smelling with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients, asymptomatic Giardia infection is common, and extraintestinal invasion can occur with trophozoites migrating into bile or pancreatic ducts; recent evidence demonstrates that one third of patients will express long term extraintestinal symptoms, including ocular, muscular and metabolic complications, and reactive arthritis has also been associated with giardiasis.

### Diagnosing failure to thrive: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in identical twins [^8b372cc1]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) has significant variability in clinical presentation. Cardinal features include congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency and palatal abnormalities, but none are pathognomonic in isolation. Features can be classified as major or less common and are thought to be linked to the size of the 22.q11 deletion. Historically, syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome were recognised as distinct before a common genetic aetiology was identified. While the original triad of symptoms described in the 1960s included immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism and congenital heart disease, other studies have expanded this list, highlighting conotruncal cardiac anomalies (75–80%), immunodeficiency due to a hypoplastic thymus (up to 75%), palatal abnormalities (65%) and developmental delay as major features. Intermediate features or those that are relatively less common but still significant for the patient's medical care include gastrointestinal issues (30% of patients), hypocalcaemia (greater than 50–65%), renal defects (33%), hearing loss, swallowing dysfunction and behavioural disturbances. Diagnosis is typically made in infancy and early childhood once key features are identified, with confirmatory testing done using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) single nuclear polymorphism array to detect and locate a specific DNA sequence or lack thereof. The higher resolution of whole chromosome genetic microarray can help to detect smaller variations and has grown in favour in diagnosing genetic conditions, especially when a clear clinical picture is not evident. The extensive phenotypic variation in presentation makes it challenging from a diagnostician's standpoint to initiate workup for this condition, especially if it is an intermediate feature that is the presenting symptom in the absence of major features.

Failure to thrive (FTT) is variably cited in 22q11.2DS.FTT may be secondary to the features of the disease, including gastro-oesophageal reflux, aspiration and swallowing difficulties. Short stature has also been cited to be a complication of disease and can be related to the patient's FTT or to growth hormone deficiency. For any patient presenting with FTT, workup consists of evaluating for inadequate intake, malabsorption issues, increased metabolic expenditure secondary to an underlying condition and ultimately a possible genetic aetiology.

This report details the case of monochorionic monoamniotic identical twin boys, who were both found to have de novo 22q11.2DS and exhibiting FTT, yet lacking the major features typically seen with the condition.

### Challenging diagnosis of spherocytosis in early infancy [^8ba1e397]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This case report describes an infant who presented to the emergency department with rhinorrhoea and severe mucocutaneous pallor. Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anaemia with reticulocytosis and a peripheral blood smear suggestive of peripheral red blood cell (RBC) destruction, although without the presence of spherocytes. Despite the absence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, the clinical evaluation, including family history, led to the consideration of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). The diagnosis was confirmed through genetic testing, revealing a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the ANK1 gene, associated with HS. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of HS, particularly in the early infancy, and highlights the importance of genetic panels in cases of unexplained haemolytic anaemia.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome — pediatrics: In childhood, FCS may present with failure to thrive, abdominal pain, and acute pancreatitis. Infants may require specialized feeding options, such as low-fat, high-MCT formulas, and careful consideration of breast milk alternatives. Essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins must be supplemented to prevent deficiencies while on low fat diets. Ensure intake of 2% to 4% daily caloric intake of LA and ALA. Fibrates, O3FAs, and orlistat have been utilized with limited evidence in case reports and small studies. APOC3 inhibitors have not been approved for use in the pediatric population, but if found to be efficacious and safe, they may be utilized in the future.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1ce38494]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)/recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) with polyps — patients with polyps who present before age 18 years or have refractory rhinosinusitis should be screened for underlying CF according to published clinical consensus guidelines, and the common CF mutation is F508del, with an estimated 86% of patients having this as at least one allele. A recent evidence-based review recommends nasal saline rinses, CFTR modulators and endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for treatment in CF, and multiple studies have shown that combination therapy with elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor is highly effective in improving sinus symptoms including SNOT-22, CT, and endoscopic scores when appropriate for the patient's underlying mutations.

### Occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fracture inducing recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscess in a pediatric patient: a case report [^d51f42be]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The medial orbital wall is primarily composed of the lamina papyracea of the ethmoid bone. Due to its anatomical fragility, it is one of the common sites of isolated orbital fractures, particularly prone to occult trapdoor fractures in children. Clinically, such injuries often present with subtle external appearance and atypical signs, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Especially following craniofacial trauma, if the integrity of the medial wall is compromised, the barrier between the orbit and paranasal sinuses may be disrupted or form a communication channel. This anatomical alteration facilitates the spread of sinus infections or sinonasal pathogens through the fracture margin or bony defect into the orbital cavity, predisposing patients to orbital infections such as orbital cellulitis, intraorbital abscess, or, most commonly, subperiosteal abscess.

In pediatric patients, the anatomical configuration of the ethmoid sinus and the unique characteristics of their bone structure facilitate the spread of infection toward the medial orbital wall. Sinusitis remains the predominant cause of orbital cellulitis and subperiosteal abscess in this population. If diagnosis and treatment are delayed, orbital infections may lead to irreversible complications such as vision loss, proptosis, and restriction of extraocular motility. In severe cases, disruption of natural barriers allows pathogens to spread intracranially, resulting in brain abscess or venous sinus thrombosis, which are potentially life-threatening. Accordingly, when orbital infection is suspected, prompt imaging evaluation within a multidisciplinary setting, followed by timely surgical or medical intervention, is essential to prevent the development of severe sequelae.

Although sinonasal-related intraorbital abscess has been widely reported, recurrent cases in pediatric patients triggered by occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fractures remain exceptionally rare in the literature. These cases are often misdiagnosed, with the underlying etiology difficult to establish, which may consequently lead to delayed treatment. In this case, the patient had long been diagnosed as having acute sinusitis alone, with recurrent relapses and limited response to conventional treatment. Such cases offer important reference value for identifying complex etiologies and optimizing management strategies in clinical practice. Through a comprehensive analysis of the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatment course, this report seeks to raise awareness among clinicians and guide refinement of diagnostic and therapeutic pathways in comparable situations.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^b8b0baac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Terbinafine tablets are contraindicated for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, perform liver function tests because hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without preexisting liver disease. Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease.

In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of terbinafine tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.

Warn patients prescribed terbinafine tablets and/or their caregivers to report immediately to their healthcare providers any symptoms or signs of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Advise patients with these symptoms to discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and immediately evaluate the patient's liver function.

5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste

Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell

Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.4 Depressive Symptoms

Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician.

### A patient with TPCN2-related hypopigmentation and ocular phenotype [^b8876196]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Pigmentation is orchestrated by hundreds of genes involved in cellular functions going from early developmental fate of pigment cells to melanin synthesis. The Two Pore Channel 2 (TPC2) a Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ channel acidifies melanosomal pH and thus inhibits pigmentation. A young patient was recently reported with generalized hypopigmentation but uneventful ocular examination, caused by the de novo heterozygous TPCN2 variant c.628C > T; p. Arg210Cys that constitutively activates TPC2. Here we report a young patient with the same de novo variant presenting with generalized hypopigmentation, and ophthalmologic features including low grade retinal hypopigmentation and foveal hypoplasia, photophobia, mild hypermetropia, and astigmatism, which are features of albinism. Skin fragility and episodes of fever with diarrhea and fatigue were also observed. This extends the phenotype of patients with TPCN2 variants, warranting further investigations in patients with alterations of this gene, and raises the question whether TPCN2 might be considered as an albinism gene.

### Growth faltering in newborns and infants… [^81fe66d3]. AAP (2022). Medium credibility.

Infants who fall below weight-for-age or weight-for-length percentile or whose rate of weight gain declines across 2 major percentiles should be assessed for growth faltering.
- Percentiles of weight for age or weight for length may or may not indicate abnormal growth depending on clinical circumstances.
- Growth faltering is more likely in children with abnormal patterns of weight gain over time, though some children with adequate nutrition fall into the extreme tails of standard distributions.
- Z scores are the most accurate way to assess growth faltering. Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria Severe acute malnutrition — weight-for-height that is < –3 SD from the mean or a mid-upper arm circumference between 11. 5 cm and
12. 5 cm Moderate acute malnutrition — weight-for-height that is between –2 SD and –3 SD from the mean or a mid-upper arm circumference < 11.

5 cm Underweight — a weight-for-height z-score that is < –2 SD. Also called wasting. Stunting – height-for-age z-score more than –2 SD from the mean. Short stature — height-for-age < –2 SD; if occurring without wasting is not growth faltering. Statistics derived from NHANES show that growth faltering is common in the United States:

- The rate of mild to moderate growth faltering in females is 20. 3%;
- The rate of severe growth faltering in males and females is 4. 1% to
4. 2%
- Growth faltering was found across all race/ethnicity and income categories
- A considerable proportion of children meet the criterion of growth faltering up through age 13 years. Evaluation Growth faltering can result from increased energy needs, inadequate supply of energy, or a combination of these:

- Any infant with growth faltering should be promptly evaluated.
- A thorough history and physical examination will direct further evaluation.

Keep in mind conditions that require increased energy and those that result in a deficient energy supply, see below. Conditions requiring increased energy utilization:

- Chronic heart disease
- Chronic lung disease
- Chronic anemia
- Chronic infection
- Endocrine abnormalities
- Malignancy
- Chronic renal disease
- Hepatic insufficiency
- Metabolic disease
- disorders of amino acid or carbohydrate metabolism
- idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy.
- Hormonal disturbances
- Genetic conditions
- Down syndrome
- de Lange syndrome
- cri du chat syndrome
- Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome
- familial dysautonomia
- Micronutrient deficiencies
- Iron
- Zinc
- **Carnitine Conditions that result in deficient energy supply**:
- Calories withheld
- In utero conditions
- Formula preparation mistakes
- Breastfeeding difficulties
- Parent-child psychosocial dysfunction
- Maternal depression
- Intentional abuse or neglect
- Poverty
- Unsound parental beliefs regarding nutrition
- Feeding difficulties
- Calories not properly ingested or digested
- Oral pain.
- Anorexia
- reflux esophagitis
- emotional deprivation
- chronic infection
- dysphagia
- Structural abnormalities of the oropharynx or nasopharynx
- cleft palate
- choanal atresia
- Treacher Collins syndrome
- Pierre Robin syndrome
- laryngeal web.
- Structural abnormalities of the GI tract
- stenosis or atresia In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, observing a feeding can be informative. In the absence of evidence of an organic condition that may lead to growth faltering, the yield of a laboratory investigation is low.

### Somatropin (Zomacton) [^9293262e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 	Increased Mortality in Patients with Acute Critical Illness

Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic doses of somatropin [see Contraindications (4)]. Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-GH deficient adult patients (n = 522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3 mg/day-8 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing ZOMACTON treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. ZOMACTON is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults.

5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome

There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of, or increased, snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4)]. ZOMACTON is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome.

5.1 Acute Critical Illness

Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic doses of somatropin [see Contraindications (4)]. Two placebo-controlled clinical studies in non-GH deficient adult patients (n = 522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3–8.0 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing HUMATROPE treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. HUMATROPE is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults.

5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome

There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of, or increased, snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4)]. HUMATROPE is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome.

### Occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fracture inducing recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscess in a pediatric patient: a case report [^dd19152a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

This rare case demonstrates how an occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fracture in a pediatric patient resulted in recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscess, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensive assessment of trauma history and imaging findings in clinical practice. In pediatric patients, the medial orbital wall is extremely thin and not fully ossified, rendering it prone to trapdoor or minimally displaced fractures following trauma. Nevertheless, such fractures frequently lack obvious external signs and may be accompanied by transient symptom resolution, leading to under-recognition by the pediatric patient and caregivers, and are often missed due to the limited sensitivity of standard imaging modalities. As shown in this case, despite imaging failing to definitively identify a medial orbital wall fracture, the pediatric patient had a history of chronic sinusitis and frequent nose blowing. Chronic sinusitis may erode adjacent orbital walls or transmit nasal inflammation into the orbit through natural grooves, foramina, fissures, or gaps at post-traumatic fracture sites. When the displacement of an occult fracture is significant, it can mechanically obstruct the frontal-ethmoid recess or the maxillary sinus ostium, leading to impaired sinus drainage, localized negative pressure fluid accumulation, bacterial overgrowth, and recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscess formation. Compared with the typical mechanism of acute sinusitis directly spreading to the orbit, this pathological process is more insidious and prone to recurrence.

### Terbinafine [^67e7afc9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Terbinafine tablets are contraindicated for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets perform liver function tests because hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without preexisting liver disease. Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease.

In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of terbinafine tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Discontinue terbinafine tablets, if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.

Warn patients prescribed terbinafine tablets and/or their caregivers to report immediately to their healthcare providers any symptoms or signs of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Advise patients with these symptoms to discontinue taking oral terbinafine and immediately evaluate the patient's liver function.

5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste

Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell

Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

5.4 Depressive Symptoms

Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician.

Modifying factors in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) should be evaluated by clinicians, who should assess the patient with CRS or RARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, aspirin‑exacerbated respiratory disease, and ciliary dyskinesia. This recommendation is based on multiple systematic reviews and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm, and the quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment by identifying comorbid conditions known to accompany CRS and RARS, knowledge of which would improve sinusitis management and, conversely, management of sinusitis may improve the associated chronic condition (asthma).

### Occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fracture inducing recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscess in a pediatric patient: a case report [^b6dd2b9a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have confirmed that sinusitis is the most common cause of intraorbital abscess and orbital cellulitis. Jabarin et al. indicated that intraorbital abscess and preseptal cellulitis secondary to sinusitis are frequently encountered clinically, highlighting sinusitis as a key predisposing factor for orbital infections. Eufinger et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of 36 patients with acute suppurative sinusitis and found that most cases of intraorbital abscess were closely linked to sinusitis, with some exhibiting intracranial complications, emphasizing the significance of early surgical intervention and multidisciplinary care. Chaudhry et al. retrospectively reviewed 218 patients with orbital cellulitis and reported that sinusitis was the most common etiology, with roughly half of the cases complicated by intraorbital abscess. Most required surgical drainage, and delayed management could lead to significant vision loss. Furthermore, in the current literature, cases explicitly describing occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fractures leading to recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscesses are exceedingly rare. Only a few reports have discussed the potential association between medial orbital wall fractures and rhinogenic intraorbital infections. Simon et al. reported four cases of orbital blowout fractures that subsequently developed orbital cellulitis and intraorbital abscesses; all patients had a history of sinusitis or developed sinusitis shortly after the fracture, suggesting that the fracture may disrupt the bony barrier and create a pathway for infection. Takesue et al. described a patient with orbital fracture accompanied by chronic sinusitis who developed severe intraorbital infection and panophthalmitis postoperatively, indicating that local barrier disruption following fracture may facilitate bacterial invasion. Similarly, Park et al. emphasized that orbital wall fractures associated with sinus pathology or unhealed bony defects could serve as potential risk factors for delayed orbital infection. Kemps et al. reported an 8-year-old girl who developed an orbital floor trapdoor fracture with muscle entrapment after being struck in the face by a soccer ball, highlighting that potential fractures should be highly suspected in pediatric patients even with mild post-traumatic clinical signs. Furthermore, we previously reported three cases of definitively diagnosed medial orbital wall fractures, in which imaging and intraoperative observations confirmed obstruction of the sinus ostia by the fractures, resulting in spread of sinus infection into the orbit. Overall, these studies support our hypothesis that an occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fracture may provide a potential pathway for recurrent invasion of rhinogenic pathogens into the orbit, leading to persistent or recurrent intraorbital abscesses. In the present case, the initial history of facial trauma was overlooked, and the condition was misdiagnosed as acute sinusitis, resulting in a protracted and relapsing course. The uniqueness of this case lies in its chronic, recurrent presentation with subtle radiologic findings, highlighting that occult trapdoor fractures should be considered in pediatric patients with recurrent orbital infections. Clinicians should proactively inquire about prior facial trauma and, when necessary, perform high-resolution bone-window CT to avoid misdiagnosis.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^78370473]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The spectrum of obstructive sleep‐disordered breathing (oSDB) in children ranges from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Primary snoring is characterized by snoring occurring more than three nights per week with normal overnight polysomnography (PSG) and is present in 6%–17% of all children. OSAS is defined by an increased apnea‐hypopnea index (AHI) — the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour — during PSG and is present in 1%–5% of all children. It is widely acknowledged that an AHI of at least 5 per hour warrants consideration of treatment, most commonly adenotonsillectomy. However, when the AHI is less than 5 per hour and there are no clinical signs of complications related to oSDB, watchful waiting may be a valid approach. Official guidelines generally recommend performing an overnight PSG in all children with a history of chronic snoring to measure the AHI, assess the severity of oSDB, and determine the need for treatment. In practice, however, most children do not have access to overnight PSG due to the limited availability of sleep laboratories worldwide.

My personal review of last year's literature on oSDB in children focuses on publications dealing with the recognition of children who require treatment for oSDB, including the place of overnight PSG in their management.

### Haemoptysis caused by the absence of the right pulmonary vein in an 11-year-old child: a case report and literature review [^60f25031]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 11-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of intermittent cough and haemoptysis for two months. Haemoptysis presented as the expectoration of bloody sputum, which lasted for 2 days, 4–5 times/day. No other symptoms such as epistaxis, fever, tachypnoea, wheezing, dyspnoea, dizziness, headache, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting or bloody stool were described during the disease course. Eight days before admission, symptoms of cough worsened to more than 10 episodes per day, accompanied by a runny nose, nasal obstruction, yellow phlegm and sometimes blood in the sputum. Blood routine test, biochemistry and coagulation function tests at the local hospital revealed no abnormalities. Chest CT at the local hospital revealed cystic and low attenuation lesions, patchy and flocculent shadows in the right lung, partial bronchial dilatation and interlobular septal thickening of the right lung. In addition, small nodules were observed in the middle lobe of the right lung and lower lobe of the left lung. The boundaries of the nodules were clear, and the maximum diameter was approximately 0.4 cm. The local hospital considered the diagnosis to be "interstitial pneumonia and bronchiectasis with infection". After the anti-infective and haemostatic treatment, the symptoms of cough and haemoptysis were not relieved. Therefore, this patient was admitted to our hospital for further treatment.

The patient was hospitalized for pneumonia once 3 years ago, but the specific diagnosis, treatment process and examination results could not be provided. The patient had a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (> 7 times/year) in the past year. A decreased activity tolerance was reported in 1.5 years. The history of foreign body aspiration, direct contact with tuberculosis patients or hereditary haemorrhagic diseases prior to illness onset was denied. The patient was a full-term baby with a birth weight of 2200 g. There was no birth history of asphyxia or rescue. The growth and development of this patient were similar to those of her peers. She had no family history of similar conditions and denied a family history of genetic or vascular anomalies. Her mother did not have regular antenatal examinations during pregnancy and could not provide the results of prenatal ultrasound.

### New treatments are urgently needed for patients with all primary ciliary dyskinesia genotypes [^5a1ed856]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the letter from Pifferi et al. on lung function decline in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We congratulate the authors on the good lung function trajectories achieved by many of their PCD patients. We look forward to hearing more about these therapeutic successes. As PCD providers, parents and patient advocates, however, we are concerned that this study as presented is being interpreted by those in industry who are considering the development of new therapeutic options to suggest that market opportunities among may not be robust among PCD patients with certain genotypes. That is to say, there is the thought among some colleagues in industry that investment in PCD therapies may not be needed or worthwhile. I think the authors would agree that this conclusion is incorrect.

As the authors know, PCD patients with a range of genotypes have lung disease that can progress to respiratory failure. Even among those who do not progress to respiratory failure, patients are chronically affected by daily cough and mucus production; disabling bronchiectasis; disrupted work and sleep; recurring pneumonias; frequent exacerbations; and burdensome yet marginally effective treatment regimens. Additionally, the majority of newborns with PCD experience respiratory distress shortly after birth. Some of those most severely affected during the newborn period may not survive to be included in longitudinal lung function analyses.

And these are just the pulmonary symptoms. Head and neck symptoms are particularly devastating in childhood, and they progress into adulthood. Nonstop rhinorrhea is a daily burden, often accompanied by anosmia. Severe, chronic otitis media is common, with daily purulent otorrhea and hearing loss. Chronic sinusitis and sinus headaches are the norm.

Though patients with some genotypes may be less severely affected than others, there is variability within the same genotype. Importantly, patients with most PCD genotypes suffer from these daily consequences and are at risk for respiratory failure. Further, PCD appears to be substantially more common than was once thought. Emerging data from large PCD registries are bearing out this unfortunate reality. We are confident that Pifferi and colleagues will agree that effective treatments are urgently needed for PCD patients with a broad range of different genotypes.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^bd58bd23]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — definitions and diagnostic criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) are specified. CRS is defined as inflammation of the sinonasal cavity for more than 12 weeks associated with 2 or more symptoms including nasal obstruction and/or congestion, facial pressure and/or fullness, mucopurulent anterior or posterior nasal discharge, and hyposmia. Symptoms alone cannot affirm the diagnosis of CRS; diagnosing CRS requires that inflammation (polyps, edema, or purulent mucus) be documented by examination of the nasal cavity and/or computed tomography (CT) imaging, in addition to persistent symptoms > 12 weeks. Table criteria further define CRS as twelve weeks or longer of two or more of the following — mucopurulent drainage (anterior, posterior, or both), nasal obstruction (congestion), facial pain-pressure-fullness, or decreased sense of smell — and require that inflammation be documented by one or more findings: purulent mucus or edema in the middle meatus or anterior ethmoid region, polyps in the nasal cavity or middle meatus, or radiographic imaging showing inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. RARS is defined as four or more episodes per year of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis without signs or symptoms between episodes, and each episode of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should meet diagnostic criteria in Table 4.

5.2 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome

There have been reports of sudden death after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with NORDITROPIN, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with NORDITROPIN should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4)].

Correspondence: E. Nakhutsrishvili

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): PU64

Introduction: Autoimmune diseases in early childhood can present with non-specific symptoms and subtle clinical findings. Cutaneous involvement may be an early sign, preceding the development of systemic features. We report a case of a 4-year-old child with congenital hydronephrosis who presented with progressive skin changes and systemic symptoms, raising suspicion for an evolving autoimmune condition.

Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and diagnostic approach in a young child with suspected early autoimmune disease and to highlight the importance of early recognition and multidisciplinary evaluation.

Methods: We reviewed the clinical records of a 4-year-old child with a history of congenital hydronephrosis under nephrologic follow-up. The child presented with recurrent fever, abdominal pain, and progressively worsening skin lesions over a three-month period. A comprehensive clinical examination and laboratory evaluation, including autoimmune serology, were conducted.

Results: The child appeared pale, hypotonic, and underweight (13 kg, 5th percentile). Skin examination revealed hard, shiny, thickened plaques. Laboratory results showed normocytic, normochromic anemia. Autoimmune workup demonstrated a high-titer ANA (1:1280, homogeneous pattern), positive anti-nucleosome antibodies (++), and mildly elevated anti-PM-Scl antibodies. ANA quantitative level was 5.9. EBV IgM positivity was noted but not accompanied by lymphoproliferative symptoms. No definitive diagnosis was established at this stage, but features were suggestive of early systemic autoimmune involvement, potentially within the scleroderma spectrum or an overlap syndrome.

Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of considering autoimmune diseases in pediatric patients presenting with persistent systemic symptoms and cutaneous changes, even in the absence of a family history. Early serological markers may guide further evaluation and follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for timely diagnosis and intervention to prevent progression and organ involvement.

### Occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fracture inducing recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscess in a pediatric patient: a case report [^b127630d]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding management, although some pediatric intraorbital abscess may temporarily improve with early medical therapy, based on the Chandler staging system and contemporary expert consensus, patients with intraorbital abscess should undergo surgical intervention within 24 h. For preseptal and orbital cellulitis, conservative management is preferred initially, with surgical drainage considered if the condition deteriorates. Pediatric patients with subperiosteal orbital abscess showing inadequate response to 48 h of conservative therapy should similarly proceed to surgical intervention. Concerning surgical timing, it has been proposed that pediatric patients with abscess volumes exceeding 1.18 mL should be considered for operative management. In our case, the estimated abscess volume was 3.28mL, further supporting the decision for prompt surgical intervention. Compared with conventional external orbital incision drainage, endoscopic transnasal surgery enables precise localization, safe and effective drainage under direct visualization, and concurrent treatment of the primary sinus pathology, including removal of bone fragments, osteophytes, or hyperplastic tissue that mechanically obstruct the sinus ostia, thereby restoring sinus drainage and lowering recurrence risk. In the present case, the pediatric patient underwent endoscopic transnasal complete ethmoidectomy, frontal and sphenoid sinus opening, combined with intraorbital abscess drainage. During nearly six months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed, further demonstrating the effectiveness of early, targeted surgical management.

### Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome presenting with a 12-year history of intermittent proteinuria and anemia: a case from the middle east [^fdc14b1f]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome (IGS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by selective intestinal malabsorption of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), despite sufficient dietary intake, and is frequently accompanied by mild, asymptomatic proteinuria in the absence of renal structural abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of IGS typically begin in early childhood and include megaloblastic anemia, failure to thrive, recurrent infections, and, in the absence of timely treatment, neurological complications. The condition was independently described in the 1960 s by Imerslund in Norway and Gräsbeck in Finland and has since been linked to pathogenic mutations in the AMN and CUBN genes, which encode components of the cubam receptor complex essential for cobalamin absorption in the terminal ileum.

To date, approximately 456 cases of IGS have been reported worldwide, with about 22% originating from Turkey. The actual prevalence in Middle Eastern countries such as Iran is likely underestimated due to underdiagnosis and limited awareness among physicians. Delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of IGS can result in irreversible neurological complications, including cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, as well as growth failure in children. In resource-limited settings, diagnostic challenges are amplified by restricted access to genetic testing, limited availability of metabolic assays such as methylmalonic acid or homocysteine, and a lack of routine urine protein screening in pediatric care. Consequently, clinicians must rely on clinical features, hematologic findings, and therapeutic response to vitamin B12 supplementation to establish a diagnosis.

The diagnosis of IGS should be considered in children or adolescents presenting with unexplained megaloblastic anemia, low serum vitamin B12 levels, and intermittent proteinuria — especially when renal histology is normal and other causes of malabsorption are excluded. Early recognition is crucial, as prompt initiation of parenteral cobalamin therapy can prevent irreversible hematologic and neurologic sequelae.

In this report, we present the case of a 15-year-old Iranian boy with a 12-year history of intermittent proteinuria and anemia, ultimately diagnosed with IGS. This case highlights the need for increased clinical awareness of IGS in the Middle East and demonstrates the significant therapeutic response to vitamin B12 supplementation.

### Occult medial orbital wall trapdoor fracture inducing recurrent rhinogenic intraorbital abscess in a pediatric patient: a case report [^d8df76a9]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Intraoperative endoscopic views: a Marked congestion and edema of the paranasal sinus mucosa. b Stepwise removal of the anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells, followed by hemostasis and opening of the frontal and maxillary sinuses. c Clearance of pathological tissue with complete opening of the ethmoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses, along with thorough drainage of the intraorbital abscess (Yellow arrow). d Completion of the procedure with hemostasis using absorbable hemostatic powder and nasal packing with gelatin sponge

Postoperatively, the pediatric patient was administered empirical cefazolin for infection control, dexamethasone for anti-inflammatory and anti-edema purposes, and supportive measures including hemostasis, calcium supplementation, gastroprotection, and potassium supplementation. Pus culture revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and based on susceptibility testing, cefazolin therapy was continued. On postoperative day 3, the pediatric patient was clinically stable, with alleviation of left ocular swelling and pain, and marked improvement in nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea. BCVA was consistent with preoperative measurements. Inflammatory indices demonstrated significant improvement relative to preoperative values. Orbital CT (Fig. 4) demonstrated a significant decrease in the soft tissue density lateral to the left medial rectus muscle, with a slight increase in soft tissue density in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, likely reflecting drainage of the intraorbital abscess into the sinuses. The maxillary sinus soft tissue density showed minimal change compared with preoperative findings. At six-month follow-up, the pediatric patient had no left-sided nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea and no ocular distension or pain. Bilateral BCVA was 1.0, with improved vision in the left eye, corrected exotropia, reduced proptosis, and normal ocular motility. All hematological parameters were within normal limits. Orbital CT (Fig. 5) demonstrated near-complete absorption of the soft tissue density lateral to the left medial rectus muscle, as well as in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. Minimal residual soft tissue density persisted in the maxillary sinus but had significantly decreased compared with preoperative imaging. Drainage of the intraorbital abscess was highly effective, with no signs of recurrence over six months. Subtle medial orbital wall fractures were assessed on orbital CT by measuring the distance from the nasal septum to the medial orbital wall on the injured versus uninjured side. Shortening of the distance on the fractured side was noted. The pediatric patient's most recent orbital CT (Fig. 5 f) corroborated our diagnostic assessment, and follow-up will continue to monitor clinical outcomes.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^21f529b1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) — pediatric feeding dysfunction and nutrition — feeding dysfunction is often present in children with EoE, with up to 16.5% of pediatric patients having significant feeding disorders and 93.9% exhibiting learned maladaptive feeding behaviors; in a study of 53 young (aged 1–7 years) patients with EoE vs 38 gastroesophageal reflux disease controls there was no difference in mean BMI z score and micronutrient levels were similar, yet up to one-third of pediatric patients may have failure to thrive. Treatment goals in children include growth (height, weight, and BMI), development of eating skills, and nutrition in addition to symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic improvement; referral to a registered dietician or pediatric feeding program may be required, ensuring EoE is in remission beforehand, and pediatric feeding programs involve multidisciplinary evaluation. For the related recommendation statement, the quality of evidence was very low and the conditional recommendation balances the need to position children with EoE to achieve optimal growth and development milestones.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis in children with intestinal failure: a descriptive cohort study [^a3df16e8]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The frequency of SIBO in our cohort is in line with a recent systematic review that reported a SIBO prevalence of 57.5% in patients with intestinal failure. However, as the included endoscopic studies used a cutoff of > 10⁵ CFU/ml in duodenal fluid, a direct comparison is not possible. Therefore, it is noteworthy that an optimal threshold of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml duodenal aspirate as used in our study was identified for the diagnosis of SIBO.

Various risk factors for the development of SIBO have been identified, including altered intestinal anatomy including resection of the ileocecal valve, parenteral nutrition dependency, intestinal dysmotility, and proton pump inhibitor–induced hypochlorhydria. In that regard, the presence of small bowel dilatation was more prevalent in SIBO‐positive cases in our cohort. It is known that stasis of intestinal contents may lead to SIBO. Thus, it can be assumed that motility disorders, such as pediatric intestinal pseudo‐obstruction, predispose patients to SIBO. However, we could not show a difference in etiology (short bowel syndrome vs motility disorders) between patients with and without SIBO. This could be explained by the fact that 75% of our patients with motility disorders have a small intestinal stoma for prevention of stasis. On the other hand, all five patients with a history of a bowel‐lengthening procedure (serial transverse enteroplasty procedure [STEP]) were SIBO‐positive. Four of them (80.0%) demonstrated small bowel dilatation, indicating a possible role of STEP as a risk factor for redilatation and (consecutive) SIBO development. As gastric acid plays an important role in preventing bacteria from colonizing the proximal GI tract, medication‐induced hypochloridria by proton pump inhibitor is a known risk factor for SIBO. We also found a more frequent use of antacids in the SIBO‐positive group of our cohort.

### Azithromycin [^06887b6b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Adult Patients

Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis

In a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days) was compared with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days). The primary endpoint of this trial was the clinical cure rate at Days 21 to 24. For the 304 patients analyzed in the modified intent-to-treat analysis at the Days 21 to 24 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 85% (125/147) compared to 82% (129/157) for 10 days of clarithromycin.

The following outcomes were the clinical cure rates at the Days 21 to 24 visit for the bacteriologically evaluable patients by pathogen:

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy controlled clinical trial of acute bacterial sinusitis, azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days) was compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg three times a day for 10 days). Clinical response assessments were made at Day 10 and Day 28. The primary endpoint of this trial was prospectively defined as the clinical cure rate at Day 28. For the 594 patients analyzed in the modified intent to treat analysis at the Day 10 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 88% (268/303) compared to 85% (248/291) for 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate. For the 586 patients analyzed in the modified intent to treat analysis at the Day 28 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 71.5% (213/298) compared to 71.5% (206/288), with a 97.5% confidence interval of –8.4 to 8.3, for 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate.

In an open label, non-comparative study requiring baseline transantral sinus punctures, the following outcomes were the clinical success rates at the Day 7 and Day 28 visits for the modified intent to treat patients administered 500 mg of azithromycin once daily for 3 days with the following pathogens:

14.2 Pediatric Patients

From the perspective of evaluating pediatric clinical trials, Days 11 to 14 were considered on-therapy evaluations because of the extended half-life of azithromycin. Days 11 to 14 data are provided for clinical guidance. Days 24 to 32 evaluations were considered the primary test of cure endpoint.

### Is there dietary macronutrient malabsorption in children with environmental enteropathy? [^a32b5d20]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Macronutrients are crucial for child growth, given their role as the main source of energy, and protein in particular as a linear growth regulator. Requirements for protein may be increased in the presence of infection and inflammation (as in EE), which can limit its availability for growth. Malabsorption due to EE, can further compromise this nutrient availability. Thus, an understanding of the type and extent of macronutrient malabsorption, in children with EE, is urgently required. The evaluation of EE has been difficult when using only proxy biomarkers that are non- or minimally invasive measures, while histopathological diagnosis on intestinal biopsy is the accepted "gold" standard. The present narrative review, therefore, aims to examine available evidence of malabsorption in EE, preferably when confirmed by biopsy, or by using other proxy measures. The review attempts to answer the following questions with focus on macronutrients; (1) What are the possible mechanisms that impair digestion and/or absorption of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, in EE? (2) Is there experimental evidence for reduced digestion and absorption of these macronutrients in EE? Whether EE-related malabsorption can explain linear growth faltering in children is difficult to establish, as other biological mechanisms (like growth signaling) related to EE but potentially distinct from macronutrient malabsorption can also influence growth and this question is therefore not discussed in this review. The strengths and limitations of the human experimental studies are examined in relation to a battery of tests used to measure digestive and absorptive functions of the gut. Finally, research gaps related to mechanisms and experimental evidence, and directions for future studies using functional measures of the gut are provided.

### Pediatric gastrostomy feeding tube weaning strategies: a scoping review [^d367f320]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

The search strategy identified 4619 unduplicated records (Figure 1). Titles and abstracts were screened, and 4406 records were excluded. Two hundred thirteen full‐text studies were assessed for eligibility. Forty‐five articles were included in this scoping review, with details outlined in Table 1.

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram for the search and screening process. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses.

Table 1
Characteristics of feeding tube weaning interventions for children included in scoping review with ≥ 5 participants (n = 40).

3.1 Design of study

Articles consisted of retrospective studies (n = 21), prospective interventions (n = 12), case series (n = 10), and quality improvement projects (n = 2). Articles were published between 1986 and 2023.

3.2 Cohort characteristics

Study sample sizes varied from 2 to 378. Participants ranged in age from younger than 10 months to 24 years. Although each study included at least one child with a gastrostomy FT, a minority of participants had nasogastric, gastrojejunal, or jejunal FTs.

Clinical characteristics varied greatly. Some interventions focused on children with specific diagnoses, and others had diagnostic exclusions. Medical diagnoses commonly reported amongst study populations included children with reflux, genetic disorders, congenital heart defects, prematurity, neurological conditions, history of failure to thrive, respiratory diseases, metabolic diseases, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, chronic lung disease, food allergies, and history of cleft lip and/or palate.,

Some studies had exclusion criteria based on participant age, medical diagnosis, comorbidities, evaluations of swallow safety, cognitive/developmental age, measurements of FT dependency, and history of failed attempts at weaning. Because some interventions required parental involvement as core interventionists, some families were excluded if unable to fully engage in the intervention.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^fce69610]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal problems and growth concerns in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) include high rates of constipation and biliary disease, with "Chronic constipation affects 35% of patients" and "Cholelithiasis has been reported in 19.2% of a cohort of adults with 22q11.2DS, among whom 12.8% required cholecystectomy by a median age of 27.5 years", and both celiac disease and structural bowel anomalies are stated as more common than the general population. Clinical care recommendations are to "Carefully evaluate feeding status of infants, and consider further evaluation for dysphagia with modified barium swallow and/or other studies", that patients with choking, recurrent pulmonary infections or respiratory distress, or reactive airway disease "should be evaluated for aspiration", and that "Dysphagia, chronic constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux are not uncommon". Growth monitoring guidance specifies "Using 22q11.2DS-specific growth charts, monitor weight, height, weight-for-height, and growth velocity closely during infancy, childhood, and through puberty", and nutrition advice to "Adjust caloric intake for best weight-for-height. Do not use weight alone as a measure of growth, as individuals with 22q11.2DS are predisposed to short stature".

### Deferoxamine mesylate [^229d9847]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in deferoxamine mesylate-treated patients. Reactions have included flushing of the skin, urticaria, hypotension, and shock. These reactions typically occur when deferoxamine mesylate was administered by rapid intravenous injection. Therefore, administer deferoxamine mesylate intramuscularly or by slow subcutaneous or intravenous infusion.

5.2 Auditory and Ocular Toxicity

Ocular and auditory toxicities have been reported in deferoxamine mesylate-treated patients. The ocular toxicities observed have included blurring of vision; cataracts after prolonged administration in chronic iron overload; decreased visual acuity, including visual loss, visual defects, scotoma; impaired peripheral, color, and night vision; optic neuritis, cataracts, corneal opacities, and retinal pigmentary abnormalities. The auditory toxicities reported have been tinnitus and hearing loss, including high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Risk factors for both ocular and auditory disturbances include prolonged treatment duration, higher doses, or low ferritin levels. In most cases, both ocular and auditory disturbances were reversible upon immediate cessation of treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Visual acuity tests, slit-lamp examinations, funduscopy and audiometry are recommended periodically in patients treated for prolonged periods of time. Toxicity is more likely to be reversed if symptoms or test abnormalities are detected early.

5.3 Renal Toxicity

Renal toxicity, including increases in serum creatinine (possibly dose-related), acute renal failure and renal tubular disorders has occurred in deferoxamine mesylate-treated patients. Deferoxamine mesylate is contraindicated in patients with severe renal disease [see Contraindications (4)]. Monitor serum creatinine to assess for changes in renal function.

5.4 Respiratory Toxicity

Acute respiratory distress syndrome has occurred in deferoxamine mesylate-treated patients following treatment with excessively high intravenous doses of deferoxamine mesylate in patients with acute iron intoxication or thalassemia. The recommended daily doses should therefore not be exceeded.

5.5 Growth Suppression

High doses of deferoxamine mesylate and concomitant low ferritin levels have also been associated with growth suppression in pediatric patients. After reduction of deferoxamine mesylate dose, growth velocity may partially resume to pre-treatment rates. Monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with deferoxamine mesylate every 3 months.

### Osilodrostat (Isturisa) [^cb59f27f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hypocortisolism

ISTURISA lowers cortisol levels and can lead to hypocortisolism and sometimes life-threatening adrenal insufficiency. Lowering of cortisol can cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, dizziness. Significant lowering of serum cortisol may result in hypotension, abnormal electrolyte levels, and hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Hypocortisolism can occur at any time during ISTURISA treatment. Evaluate patients for precipitating causes of hypocortisolism (infection, physical stress, etc.). Monitor 24-hour urine free cortisol, serum or plasma cortisol, and patient's signs and symptoms periodically during ISTURISA treatment.

Decrease or temporarily discontinue ISTURISA if urine free cortisol levels fall below the target range, there is a rapid decrease in cortisol levels, and/or patients report symptoms of hypocortisolism. Stop ISTURISA and administer exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy if serum or plasma cortisol levels are below target range and patients have symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. After interruption or discontinuation of ISTURISA, cortisol suppression may persist beyond the 4 hour half-life. Monitor patients regularly and re-initiate ISTURISA at a lower dose when urine free cortisol, serum or plasma cortisol levels are within target range, and/or patient symptoms have resolved.

Educate patients on the symptoms associated with hypocortisolism and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur.

5.2	QTc Prolongation

ISTURISA is associated with a dose-dependent QT interval prolongation (maximum mean estimated QTcF increase of up to 5.3 ms at 30 mg), which may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Perform an ECG to obtain a baseline QTc interval measurement prior to initiating therapy with ISTURISA and monitor for an effect on the QTc interval thereafter. Correct hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia prior to ISTURISA initiation and monitor periodically during treatment with ISTURISA. Correct electrolyte abnormalities if indicated. Consider temporary discontinuation of ISTURISA in the case of an increase in QTc interval > 480 ms.

Use caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, (such as congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities, and concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval) and consider more frequent ECG monitoring.

### Preliminary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of video clips for obstructive sleep apnea in children [^c45244d0]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Design

This cross‐sectional study evaluated the accuracy of home‐recorded video clips in identifying the presence of any OSA and moderate‐severe OSA compared to the gold standard, PSG, in children referred for PSG evaluation for suspected OSA at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO). Video clips were reviewed by two pediatric sleep physicians who were blinded to the child's history and symptoms. A standardized scoring tool was used to assess the videos for presence and severity of OSA.

2.2 Study Population

The study population consisted of children referred for evaluation of suspected OSA at a pediatric tertiary care center, the CHEO. Eligibility was based on the following criteria: (1) children aged 2−18 years; (2) currently on the waiting list for PSG at CHEO; (3) their caregiver had access to mobile technology. Patients were excluded if: (1) they had a previous diagnosis of sleep‐disordered breathing based on prior PSG within the last 5 years; (2) had an underlying genetic or congenital syndrome; (3) had obesity (BMI > 95%ile for age and sex); (4) were unable to cooperate for PSG; (5) parent/caregiver did not speak English or French.

2.3 Recruitment

Children were identified from the PSG wait list and initially contacted by a member of the circle of care to obtain consent to contact for research. Those who were interested were then contacted by the Research Coordinator for consent and assent when appropriate. The ability of the child to provide consent and/or assent was based on capacity rather than age. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute (REB Protocol #: 22/112X).

2.4 Questionnaire

Parents were asked to complete the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) at baseline. The PSQ consists of 22 symptom items that ask about snoring frequency, loudness of snoring, observed apneas, difficulty breathing during sleep, daytime sleepiness, inattentive or hyperactive behavior, and other features of pediatric OSA. PSQ scores have been shown to correlate with OSA in referred populations of children. Subscales include a 4‐item sleepiness scale, a 4‐item snoring scale, and a 6‐item inattention/hyperactivity scale derived from the DSM‐IV criteria for attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). PSQ scores ≥ 0.33 are considered positive and high risk for sleep‐disordered breathing.

### Long term sequelae of mild RSV infections in healthy children aged 0–3 years in the primary care setting – A prospective two year follow up observational study [^c03a7e5d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children worldwide. Up to the age of 1 year, 60%–70% of all children experience an RSV infection, while almost all children are infected by the age of 2. In 2019, there were 33 million RSV‐associated acute lower respiratory tract infections among children under 5 years of age globally, with 3.6 million requiring hospitalization.

RSV mostly followed a typical epidemic pattern in the cold season, from November to March. The acute RSV infection often initially manifests in the upper respiratory tract with typical symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough and fever. Involvement of the lower respiratory tract occurs in 15%–50% of infants and young children with primary RSV infection, with children under 2 years of age with risk factors for serious illness being particularly affected. RSV bronchiolitis is characterized by tachypnea and the use of the accessory muscles. As a result, in severe cases, pneumonia, hypoxia, lethargy, apnea or acute lung failure can occur. A prospective birth cohort study from Europe showed that RSV‐associated respiratory tract infection resulted in hospitalization in 1 of 56 healthy term infants. In 5%–10% of hospitalizations, intensive treatment is required due to a severe course of the disease.

Under certain conditions, the risk of severe disease is higher. This applies in particular to prematurely born children and patients with chronic diseases (lung, heart, neurological, and immunosuppressive diseases). Eight risk factors are significantly associated with RSV‐associated acute lower respiratory tract infection in children under 5 years of age: prematurity, low birth weight, male gender, siblings, maternal smoking, history of atopy, and lack of breastfeeding.

After a mild RSV infection, patients usually recover without any sequelae. Severe RSV infections are thought to be associated with later onset of wheezing, asthma, and allergic sensitization in childhood. A prospective cohort study in the United States showed that infants who were not infected with RSV had a 25% lower risk of developing asthma in the next 5 years. The mechanism by which RSV infection leads to asthma is not yet fully understood and the question of causality remains. A possible atopic predisposition is reported, which is associated with overactivity of certain immune cells (Th2 dominance).

### Tinidazole (tindazole) [^42b27748]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosing Instructions

It is advisable to take tinidazole with food to minimize the incidence of epigastric discomfort and other gastrointestinal side-effects. Food does not affect the oral bioavailability of tinidazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Alcoholic beverages should be avoided when taking tinidazole and for 3 days afterwards [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.2 Compounding of the Oral Suspension

For those unable to swallow tablets, tinidazole tablets may be crushed in artificial cherry syrup to be taken with food.

 Procedure for Extemporaneous Pharmacy Compounding of the Oral Suspension: Pulverize four 500 mg oral tablets with a mortar and pestle. Add approximately 10 mL of cherry syrup to the powder and mix until smooth. Transfer the suspension to a graduated amber container. Use several small rinses of cherry syrup to transfer any remaining drug in the mortar to the final suspension for a final volume of 30 mL. The suspension of crushed tablets in artificial cherry syrup is stable for 7 days at room temperature. When this suspension is used, it should be shaken well before each administration.

2.3 Trichomoniasis

The recommended dose in both females and males is a single 2 g oral dose taken with food. Since trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease, sexual partners should be treated with the same dose and at the same time.

2.4 Giardiasis

The recommended dose in adults is a single 2 g dose taken with food. In pediatric patients older than three years of age, the recommended dose is a single dose of 50 mg/kg (up to 2 g) with food.

2.5 Amebiasis

Intestinal: The recommended dose in adults is a 2 g dose per day for 3 days taken with food. In pediatric patients older than three years of age, the recommended dose is 50 mg/kg/day (up to 2 g per day) for 3 days with food.

Amebic Liver Abscess: The recommended dose in adults is a 2 g dose per day for 3–5 days taken with food. In pediatric patients older than three years of age, the recommended dose is 50 mg/kg/day (up to 2 g per day) for 3–5 days with food. There are limited pediatric data on durations of therapy exceeding 3 days, although a small number of children were treated for 5 days without additional reported adverse reactions. Children should be closely monitored when treatment durations exceed 3 days.

### Azithromycin dihydrate [^33864338]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Adult Patients

Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis

In a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days) was compared with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days). The primary endpoint of this trial was the clinical cure rate at Days 21 to 24. For the 304 patients analyzed in the modified intent-to-treat analysis at the Days 21 to 24 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 85% (125/147) compared to 82% (129/157) for 10 days of clarithromycin.

The following outcomes were the clinical cure rates at the Days 21 to 24 visit for the bacteriologically evaluable patients by pathogen:

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy controlled clinical trial of acute bacterial sinusitis, azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days) was compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg three times a day for 10 days). Clinical response assessments were made at Day 10 and Day 28. The primary endpoint of this trial was prospectively defined as the clinical cure rate at Day 28. For the 594 patients analyzed in the modified intent to treat analysis at the Day 10 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 88% (268/303) compared to 85% (248/291) for 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate. For the 586 patients analyzed in the modified intent to treat analysis at the Day 28 visit, the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 71.5% (213/298) compared to 71.5% (206/288), with a 97.5% confidence interval of -8.4 to 8.3, for 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate.

In an open label, non-comparative study requiring baseline transantral sinus punctures, the following outcomes were the clinical success rates at the Day 7 and Day 28 visits for the modified intent to treat patients administered 500 mg of azithromycin once daily for 3 days with the following pathogens:

14.2 Pediatric Patients

From the perspective of evaluating pediatric clinical trials, Days 11 to 14 were considered on-therapy evaluations because of the extended half-life of azithromycin. Days 11 to 14 data are provided for clinical guidance. Days 24 to 32 evaluations were considered the primary test of cure endpoint.

### Dofetilide [^18bda565]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Maintenance of Normal Sinus Rhythm (Delay in AF/AFl Recurrence)

Dofetilide capsules are indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter [AF/AFl]) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter of greater than one week duration who have been converted to normal sinus rhythm. Because dofetilide capsules can cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it should be reserved for patients in whom atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter is highly symptomatic.

In general, antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter aims to prolong the time in normal sinus rhythm. Recurrence is expected in some patients (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Conversion of Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

Dofetilide capsules are indicated for the conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm.

Dofetilide capsules have not been shown to be effective in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### Advances in the restoration of CFTR in children and pwCF with "mild disease" [^80b51e4a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

As of today, thanks to advances in Cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis and treatment, the majority of people with CF (pwCF) worldwide have reached adulthood.

Despite the better prognosis, CF is a progressive illness, where symptoms typically worsen over time. Although proactive treatment and advancements in care can potentially slow down progression of lung disease, they do not halt it entirely. In younger individuals, the condition may manifest with less severity initially, accompanied by fewer complications. Nevertheless, as they grow older, lung function may decline, leading to increased occurrences of severe respiratory infections, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), and deterioration of lung health.

### Cystic fibrosis year in review 2024 [^23586cf8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

As extended genetic sequencing is implemented an unintended consequence is the identification of more inconclusive results. In a survey of 108 health care professionals around the world, 80% felt it was more important to have a sensitive approach resulting in fewer CwCF being missed, resulting in more CRMS/CFSPID. CRMS/CFSPID is defined as people with an abnormal CF NBS result and (1) a sweat chloride of < 30 mmol/L and 2 CFTR variants, at least one of which has unclear phenotypic consequences or (2) a sweat chloride of ≥ 30 to 59 mmol/L and one or no CF‐causing variants. The authors note that this differs from the general public, which has been reported to favor a more specific approach (more CwCF being missed and less CRMS/CFSPID).

As CF NBS continues to be evaluated, strong communication between the care centers and NBS programs is critical to ensure that equitable, timely diagnoses are made in all populations. CF Centers and NBS programs should review critical data/cases on an ongoing basis. The NBS guidelines provide a creditable framework for improving CF NBS; however, continued work to refine ideal protocols that reduce disparities while optimizing clinical outcomesis still needed.

### Cystic fibrosis year in review 2024 [^5b229c84]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). Medium credibility.

The year 2024 marks a pivotal moment in the field of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment, characterised by significant advancements in clinical care and an expanding body of literature on CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. These CFTR therapies have transformed the landscape of CF management, offered systemic benefits, and established new guidelines for assessing clinical manifestations and therapies. Additionally, progress has been made in newborn screening (NBS), diagnosis, and understanding outcomes for individuals with CF-related metabolic syndrome or inconclusive diagnostic results. However, amidst these clinical milestones, disparities in global access to CFTR modulators (CFTRm) persist, threatening to exacerbate existing inequities in CF care. This review provides a focused overview of the most impactful articles from 2024, highlighting both the clinical advancements and the pressing global accessibility challenges that define this transformative era in CF research and treatment.

### Digoxin [^1836830e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the extra-cardiac manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia) are very common (up to 80% incidence) and precede cardiac manifestations in approximately half of the patients in most literature reports. Neurologic manifestations (e.g., dizziness, various CNS disturbances), fatigue, and malaise are very common. Visual manifestations may also occur with aberration in color vision (predominance of yellow green) the most frequent. Neurological and visual symptoms may persist after other signs of toxicity have resolved. In chronic toxicity, non-specific extra-cardiac symptoms, such as malaise and weakness, may predominate.

Children: In pediatric patients, signs and symptoms of toxicity can occur during or shortly after the dose of digoxin. Frequent non-cardiac effects are similar to those observed in adults although nausea and vomiting are not seen frequently in infants and small pediatric patients. Other reported manifestations of overdose are weight loss in older age groups, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain caused by mesenteric artery ischemia, drowsiness, and behavioral disturbances including psychotic episodes. Arrhythmias and combinations of arrhythmias that occur in adult patients can also occur in pediatric patients although sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid atrial fibrillation are seen less frequently in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are more likely to develop A-V conduction disturbances, or sinus bradycardia. Any arrhythmia in a child treated with digoxin should be considered related to digoxin until otherwise ruled out. In pediatric patients aged 1 to 3 years without heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 6 to 10 mg would result in death of half of the patients. In the same population, a dose above 10 mg resulted in death if no Digoxin Immune Fab were administered.

### Lumacaftor and ivacaftor (Orkambi) [^de3fe15a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were also evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 6) in 60 patients with CF, aged 2 through 5 years (homozygous for F508del) who received either lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg every 12 hours or lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg every 12 hours for 24 weeks. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a reduction in sweat chloride at Week 4 that was sustained through Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was –31.7 mmol/L (95% CI: -35.7, -27.6) at Week 24. In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was an increase of 33.0 mmol/L (95% CI: 28.9, 37.1; P < 0.0001).

Changes in sweat chloride in response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor were evaluated in a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial (Trial 7) in 46 patients with CF, aged 1 through 2 years (homozygous for F508del) who received lumacaftor 75 mg/ivacaftor 94 mg (patient weighing 7 kg to < 9 kg at screening), lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg (patient weighing 9 kg to < 14 kg at screening), lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg (patient weighing ≥ 14 kg at screening), every 12 hours for 24 weeks. Treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor demonstrated a reduction in sweat chloride at Week 4 which was sustained through Week 24. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week 24 was -29.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -34.8, -23.4). In addition, sweat chloride was also assessed after a 2-week washout period to evaluate the off-drug response. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from Week 24 at Week 26 following the 2-week washout period was 27.3 mmol/L (95% CI: 22.3, 32.3).

### Deferoxamine mesylate (Desferal) [^ca08f82d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in Desferal-treated patients. Reactions have included flushing of the skin, urticaria, hypotension, and shock. These reactions typically occur when Desferal was administered by rapid intravenous injection. Therefore, administer Desferal intramuscularly or by slow subcutaneous or intravenous infusion.

5.2 Auditory and Ocular Toxicity

Ocular and auditory toxicities have been reported in Desferal-treated patients. The ocular toxicities observed have included blurring of vision; cataracts after prolonged administration in chronic iron overload; decreased visual acuity, including visual loss, visual defects, scotoma; impaired peripheral, color, and night vision; optic neuritis, cataracts, corneal opacities, and retinal pigmentary abnormalities. The auditory toxicities reported have been tinnitus and hearing loss, including high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Risk factors for both ocular and auditory disturbances include prolonged treatment duration, higher doses, or low ferritin levels. In most cases, both ocular and auditory disturbances were reversible upon immediate cessation of treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Visual acuity tests, slit-lamp examinations, funduscopy, and audiometry are recommended periodically in patients treated for prolonged periods of time. Toxicity is more likely to be reversed if symptoms or test abnormalities are detected early.

5.3 Renal Toxicity

Renal toxicity, including increases in serum creatinine (possibly dose-related), acute renal failure and renal tubular disorders has occurred in Desferal-treated patients. Desferal is contraindicated in patients with severe renal disease [see Contraindications (4)]. Monitor serum creatinine to assess for changes in renal function.

5.4 Respiratory Toxicity

Acute respiratory distress syndrome has occurred in Desferal-treated patients following treatment with excessively high intravenous doses of Desferal in patients with acute iron intoxication or thalassemia. The recommended daily doses should therefore not be exceeded.

5.5 Growth Suppression

High doses of Desferal and concomitant low ferritin levels have also been associated with growth suppression in pediatric patients. After reduction of Desferal dose, growth velocity may partially resume to pre-treatment rates. Monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with Desferal every 3 months.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^efe0c84a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Guideline scope and purpose — adult endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis — state that the clinical practice guideline focuses on the surgical management of CRS for adults and addresses primary surgery and adjuvant therapies in detail with discussion of revision surgery when related to specific topics. The target audience is otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons managing adults (18 years of age or older) with CRS who are potential candidates for ESS in office-based, ambulatory-based, or hospital-based settings. The guideline does not apply to primary diagnoses of acute rhinosinusitis, recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, rhinosinusitis complicated by intracranial or orbital spread, acute invasive fungal sinusitis, or odontogenic sinusitis; it is not designed to provide directives for patients with genetic disorders or comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia, or for those with lesions such as inverting papilloma or sinonasal malignancy. It is not intended for pediatric patients (< 18 years of age), and it also does not focus on balloon dilation of the sinuses.

### Phenotyping and endotyping pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis [^9a8f6077]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To differentiate pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) into clinically relevant primary and secondary phenotypes based on clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review of patients with CRS who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery over a 5-year period.

Setting

Tertiary referral children's hospital.

Methods

Relevant medical and surgical history inclusive of disease onset, clinical and radiographic findings, laboratory data, and operative culture results was recorded. Data analysis resulted, where appropriate, in phenotype and endotype characterization.

Results

In total, 94 patients, aged 6.8 to 22.0 years, with a mean age of 15.4 years, satisfied the inclusion criteria. Eosinophilic CRS was the most common primary phenotype (n = 19, 20.2%), and this group was the most likely to have recurrent disease requiring revision surgery. Additional primary phenotypes identified included allergic fungal rhinosinsusitis (n = 10, 10.6%) and central compartment atopic disease (n = 2, 2.1%). CRS associated with cystic fibrosis was the most common secondary CRS category (n = 13, 13.8%). Based on available data, over one-third of patients (n = 36, 38.2%) could not be categorized into a specific phenotype based on current clinical and radiologic criteria.

Conclusion

A phenotype and endotype-based classification system for CRS is evolving for the adult population. This study highlights that such a classification system is possible in the pediatric and adolescent age group, facilitating targeted biologic therapies at the underlying inflammatory mechanism. Further investigation is clearly required given an etiologic source of paranasal sinus inflammation could not be identified in approximately one-third of patients.
