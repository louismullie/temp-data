## Question

What are the key laboratory tests to order in a patient with suspected dementia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order for suspected dementia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic framework and whether we are dealing with a Tier 1 universal panel versus Tier 2–4 targeted tests. Then, I should verify the exact components of the Tier 1 "cognitive lab panel" and why each test is included. Next, I will consider the evidence base and yield for detecting treatable contributors. After that, I need to check when to escalate to Tier 2–4 testing and which tests those include. Finally, I should integrate special scenarios like atypical or rapidly progressive presentations and reconcile any conflicting guidance, such as HIV or syphilis testing, before summarizing a practical, prioritized list with caveats about interpretation and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Contemporary guidelines endorse a multi-tiered, stepwise approach: Tier 1 tests are obtained in essentially all patients with a cognitive–behavioral syndrome, while Tier 2–4 tests are reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, or when management would change with more specific information, which aligns with both the DETeCD-ADRD and European intersocietal recommendations for biomarker-based workflows in memory clinics [^5b832617] [^51a75a2b].

> I will now examine the Tier 1 "cognitive lab panel" components and make sure I'm precise. The Alzheimer's Association DETeCD-ADRD recommends, in all or almost all patients, a panel including complete blood count with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel with renal and hepatic panels, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, vitamin B12, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; this is echoed in primary care summaries and workflow diagrams, and it operationalizes the principle of screening for common, treatable comorbidities that can worsen cognitive–behavioral syndromes even if they are not the sole etiology [^5b832617] [^0c5440f4] [^d0cbd65b].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for each element so I don't overstate anything. TSH and vitamin B12 are classic because they are common in older adults, can produce neuropsychiatric symptoms, and are readily treatable; homocysteine is included because it can signal functional B12 deficiency and is associated with vascular risk and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment; CBC, CMP, and electrolytes uncover anemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and metabolic derangements that can acutely decompensate cognition; CRP and ESR serve as inexpensive, broad screens for inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes that might alter management or prognosis, even if they are non-specific [^d0cbd65b] [^350e9b8b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "reversible dementia". I should double-check the yield. Meta-analyses cited by DETeCD-ADRD suggest that only about 0.3% to 0.6% of dementia syndromes are at least partially reversible, whereas roughly 9% have a common comorbid condition identified that may exacerbate symptoms; this supports the stance that the Tier 1 panel is best framed as identifying contributors and comorbidities rather than expecting frequent cure, and it argues against a shotgun approach to broader panels in every patient [^350e9b8b] [^aa9ba586].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to Tier 2–4 testing and which tests those are. Tier 2 tests are reasonable when clinical suspicion points to a specific etiology after Tier 1, such as syphilis serology when risk factors or atypical features are present, HIV testing in higher-prevalence settings or when risk is unclear and history is unreliable, autoimmune encephalitis panels when there are subacute fluctuations or psychiatric features, heavy metal testing when exposure is plausible, and genetic testing in early-onset or strongly familial cases; Tier 3–4 tests include CSF Aβ42, tau, and p-tau for etiologic clarification, FDG-PET for metabolic patterns that help distinguish AD from FTD or LBD, and amyloid PET when uncertainty persists and results would change management, all of which should be contextualized by pretest probability and patient goals [^56861bc0] [^1cc1b45e] [^ae6e1685] [^e0d493b6].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or rapidly progressive? I need to ensure I don't miss urgent mimics. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia warrant expedited evaluation and often inpatient workup; in these scenarios, broader infectious, autoimmune, and prion disease testing may be indicated, including CSF 14–3–3 for suspected CJD and targeted infectious or paraneoplastic panels, ideally coordinated by a dementia subspecialist given the broad differential and the potential for time-sensitive treatment [^c959e95d] [^abc71d8e] [^ed16946b].

> I should confirm the role of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's pathology so I don't overgeneralize. In specialized care settings, BBMs such as p-tau217 or p-tau181 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios can be used as triage tests when sensitivity is at least 90% and specificity at least 75%, or as confirmatory tests when both are at least 90%, but they are not substitutes for comprehensive clinical evaluation and should be interpreted in the context of pretest probability; importantly, the Alzheimer's Association BBM guideline does not recommend BBMs before a full clinical workup, and many commercially available assays still have variable performance and limited certainty of evidence, so I need to be cautious about when and how to deploy them [^229e2c89] [^6f856bac] [^fce35fc5] [^bdc0a8cb].

> Let me reconsider conflicting guidance on HIV and syphilis so I don't overtest or undertest. The AAN practice parameter advises against routine syphilis testing unless clinical suspicion is present, and NICE-aligned guidance similarly does not include HIV or syphilis in initial dementia workups without risk factors; conversely, some neurology-focused perspectives argue for routine HIV testing in all patients with cognitive impairment given changing epidemiology and the unreliability of histories in cognitively impaired patients, so I should individualize based on local prevalence, risk profile, and the quality of history obtained, documenting shared decision-making when testing is pursued outside routine indications [^eb8bc2c6] [^c05242fb].

> I should double-check that I'm not omitting essential non-laboratory elements that shape test selection. Structural neuroimaging with brain MRI without contrast is a Tier 1 test alongside the cognitive lab panel, and its results often refine the differential and guide the need for further biomarker testing; likewise, a careful medication review, depression screening, and functional assessment are integral to distinguishing neurodegenerative disease from treatable contributors and should precede or accompany Tier 1 labs in routine practice [^0c5440f4] [^c05242fb].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the practical summary is clear and prioritized. For essentially all patients with suspected dementia, order the Tier 1 cognitive lab panel: CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel with renal and hepatic panels and electrolytes including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, fasting glucose or A1c as appropriate, TSH, vitamin B12, homocysteine, CRP, and ESR; add HIV and syphilis testing when risk factors, atypical features, or epidemiology raise suspicion, and escalate to Tier 2–4 testing such as autoimmune encephalitis panels, heavy metals, CSF Aβ/tau, FDG-PET, or amyloid PET when diagnostic uncertainty remains or results would change management, always anchoring decisions in pretest probability and patient preferences [^5b832617] [^56861bc0] [^1cc1b45e].

---

For suspected dementia, order a **Tier 1 cognitive lab panel** [^5b832617] in all patients: CBC, CMP, TSH, vitamin B12, homocysteine, CRP, and ESR [^0c5440f4]. These tests screen for **treatable contributors** (e.g. hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency, metabolic derangements, infections, inflammation) and are recommended by the Alzheimer's Association and AAFP [^5bc33891]. Add **HIV and syphilis testing** only if risk factors or clinical suspicion exist [^eb8bc2c6] [^c05242fb]. Reserve **Tier 2–4 tests** (e.g. CSF, amyloid PET, genetic testing) for atypical, early-onset, or rapidly progressive cases, or when diagnostic uncertainty remains after Tier 1 results [^32b68449] [^c959e95d].

---

## Tier 1 laboratory tests (routine for all patients)

The **Tier 1 cognitive lab panel** should be obtained in all patients with suspected dementia [^5b832617]:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Detect anemia, infection, hematologic disorders |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | Assess renal, hepatic function; electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | Screen for hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism |
| Vitamin B12 | Detect deficiency causing cognitive impairment |
| Homocysteine | Identify functional B12 deficiency; cardiovascular risk |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) | Screen for inflammation/infection |
| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) | Screen for inflammation/infection |

---

These tests are **low-cost, widely available, and have an acceptable yield** for common comorbidities that can exacerbate cognitive symptoms [^d0cbd65b] [^350e9b8b].

---

## Tier 2 laboratory tests (selective, based on clinical suspicion)

Tier 2 tests are **reserved for patients with specific risk factors or clinical features** [^32b68449]:

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| HIV antibody/antigen test | Risk factors, endemic regions, or clinical suspicion [^71bc2288] |
| Syphilis serology (RPR/VDRL, FTA-ABS) | Risk factors or clinical suspicion [^eb8bc2c6] |
| Autoimmune panel (ANA, ENA, anti-dsDNA) | Suspected autoimmune encephalitis or vasculitis |
| Heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic) | Occupational/environmental exposure history |
| Genetic testing (APOE, PSEN1, PSEN2, APP) | Early-onset dementia or strong family history [^4100abb2] |

---

## Tier 3 and 4 laboratory tests (specialist-ordered, for complex cases)

Tier 3 and 4 tests are **reserved for atypical, early-onset, or rapidly progressive cases**, or when diagnostic uncertainty persists after Tier 1 and 2 evaluations [^c959e95d]:

- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis**: Amyloid-beta 42, total tau, phosphorylated tau for AD pathology confirmation [^1cc1b45e].
- **Amyloid PET imaging**: Confirm amyloid pathology when CSF is contraindicated or inconclusive [^e0d493b6].
- **FDG-PET**: Differentiate AD from FTD or LBD when diagnosis is uncertain [^ae6e1685].
- **Genetic testing**: For suspected hereditary dementias (e.g. FTD, Huntington's) [^5efb9ae1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Alzheimer's Association (DETeCD-ADRD)**: Recommends Tier 1 testing for all patients; Tier 2–4 tests based on clinical suspicion and diagnostic uncertainty [^5b832617] [^32b68449].
- **American Academy of Neurology (AAN)**: Recommends screening for depression, B12 deficiency, and hypothyroidism; no routine HIV or syphilis testing unless clinically suspected [^eb8bc2c6].
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: Recommends CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, glucose, calcium, renal and hepatic function; additional tests (HIV, syphilis, ESR, homocysteine) as indicated [^c05242fb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine Tier 1 tests**: CBC, CMP, TSH, vitamin B12, homocysteine, CRP, ESR for all patients [^5b832617].
- **Selective Tier 2 tests**: HIV, syphilis, autoimmune panel, heavy metals, genetic testing based on clinical suspicion [^32b68449].
- **Specialist-ordered Tier 3–4 tests**: CSF analysis, amyloid PET, FDG-PET, advanced genetic testing for complex or atypical cases [^1cc1b45e] [^e0d493b6].

---

A **structured, tiered approach** ensures efficient, cost-effective evaluation while identifying treatable contributors and guiding further diagnostic steps [^e230440a].

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic formulation in suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders — three-step approach and implementation guidance emphasize that the first step is to delineate the patient's cognitive functional status, the second step is to characterize the specific clinical profile of the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the third step is to establish the most likely brain disease (or condition) causing the clinical syndrome; a structured and individualized approach detailed in Recommendations 4 to 9 should be used, and for a majority of individuals with a typical presentation of dementia due to AD a first tier of clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging should be sufficient, after which clinicians decide if data are sufficient to reference established clinical diagnostic criteria or if additional tests or referrals are needed, noting that molecular biomarker confirmation may be desired and that despite increasing age raising the likelihood of multiple processes, a specific primary etiologic diagnosis is most likely and should be established and communicated.

2.7 What additional diagnostic testing might a specialist or dementia subspecialist consider?

Beyond AD and ADRD, the list of conditions or diseases that can contribute to or cause cognitive or behavioral impairment and dementia syndromes is extensive, and the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and testing for less common syndromes is complex and often requires dementia subspecialist assessment. The high strength assigned to Recommendation 15 about tiered specialized testing was motivated by the workgroup's consensus, consistent with other international guidelines and practice parameters, that a shotgun approach to dementia diagnostic testing is wasteful and potentially harmful and that while many patients can be confidently diagnosed using a thorough clinical evaluation and Tier 1 diagnostic tests, some patients require more specialized diagnostic and biomarker testing.

Less widely available diagnostic tests and tests for less common comorbidities or conditions associated with dementia were classified into Tiers 2 to 4 (Table 4). Individual circumstances will lead clinicians to pursue a judicious approach to ordering these additional tests in some individuals depending on the complexity of the patient, the proficiency of the clinician, the availability of resources, and the desired level of diagnostic certainty.

### Initial evaluation of the patient with suspected dementia [^f2e9dfa8]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Dementia is a common disorder among older persons, and projections indicate that the number of patients with dementia in the United States will continue to grow. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia account for the majority of cases of dementia. After a thorough history and physical examination, including a discussion with other family members, a baseline measurement of cognitive function should be obtained. The Mini-Mental State Examination is the most commonly used instrument to document cognitive impairment. Initial laboratory evaluation includes tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone and vitamin B12 levels. Structural neuroimaging with noncontrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging also is recommended. Other testing should be guided by the history and physical examination. Neuropsychologic testing can help determine the extent of cognitive impairment, but it is not recommended on a routine basis. Neuropsychologic testing may be most helpful in situations where screening tests are normal or equivocal, but there remains a high level of concern that the person may be cognitively impaired.

### Practice parameter: diagnosis of dementia (an evidence-based review). Report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^af5eefff]. Neurology (2001). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of dementia — clinical questions and evidence review methods define the scope and search strategy. The Committee formulated four questions to be addressed in the practice parameter, including "Are the current criteria for the diagnosis of dementia reliable?", "Are current diagnostic criteria sufficiently accurate to establish a diagnosis for the prevalent dementias in the elderly?", "Do laboratory tests improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of dementing illness?", and "What comorbidities should be evaluated in elderly patients undergoing an initial assessment for dementia?". The literature search "was conducted using MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica, and BIOSIS" and "yielded 1,175 articles of which approximately 300 articles were identified as relevant to our search questions"; for Alzheimer's disease (AD) reports, the committee "included only those based on more than 25 patients", and "An additional 300 articles" were incorporated from other sources. Articles were "classified based on the quality of evidence (Class I through IV, table 1)" for grading recommendations.

### Evaluation of suspected dementia [^74128eb6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

As the proportion of persons in the United States older than 65 years increases, the prevalence of dementia will increase as well. Risk factors for dementia include age, family history of dementia, apolipoprotein E4 genotype, cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic anticholinergic use, and lower educational level. Patient history, physical examination, functional assessment, cognitive testing, laboratory studies, and imaging studies are used to assess a patient with suspected dementia. A two-visit approach is time-effective for primary care physicians in a busy outpatient setting. During the first visit, the physician should administer a screening test such as the verbal fluency test, the Mini-Cognitive Assessment Instrument, or the Sweet 16. These tests have high sensitivity and specificity for detecting dementia, and can be completed in as little as 60 seconds. If the screening test result is abnormal or clinical suspicion of another disease is present, appropriate laboratory and imaging tests should be ordered, and the patient should return for additional cognitive testing. A second visit should include a Mini-Mental State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, and verbal fluency and clock drawing tests, if not previously completed.

### The Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for specialty care [^9a7aaa5c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Basic (Tier 1) diagnostic tests, including a cognitive laboratory panel (Recommendation 8) and structural neuroimaging (Recommendation 9) should be routinely obtained in all patients with a cognitive–behavioral syndrome to inform a confident etiological diagnosis. Importantly, Recommendations 8 through 11 apply to fewer patients than those who begin the process, as some patients in whom there is an initial concern that prompts the evaluation process will, once Recommendations 1 through 7 are followed, be assessed with high confidence to have a cognitive functional status of "cognitively unimpaired" and will not require further testing or evaluation (see Figure 2). Conversely, whether in the primary or specialty setting, for most individuals with typical presentations of AD dementia, the relevant information often would be available at this point to arrive at a confident clinical diagnosis of the likely etiology and to proceed with a disclosure visit emphasizing that such a diagnosis remains probabilistic and clinical judgment based and is not biomarker confirmed. Molecular biomarker confirmation is necessary for consideration of new disease‐modifying therapies that target amyloid plaques.

Several readily treatable common comorbid conditions, including infections, dehydration, hypothyroidism, and vitamin B 12 deficiency, may contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms and may cause subacute or acute clinical decompensation (see Box 4 on delirium in companion article for primary care). Acute mental status changes may be solely due to such conditions, but acute‐on‐chronic decompensations are usually an indication that a patient with a chronic brain disease causing progressive cognitive decline has developed a common comorbid condition.

A description of first‐line routine laboratory testing as "labs for reversible causes of dementia" can be misleading; the conditions being evaluated are rarely the primary etiology of a gradually progressive cognitive–behavioral syndrome but may exacerbate cognitive or behavioral impairment in individuals with underlying neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders (e.g. VCID). The DETeCD‐ADRD Workgroup aimed to provide practical guidance for Tier 1 "cognitive lab panel" testing (Table 4) that should be obtained in all or almost all patients evaluated for suspected cognitive–behavioral syndromes due to their relatively low cost, wide availability, and acceptable yield. The workgroup adopted a multidisciplinary and US health‐care–centric perspective to estimate risk–reward calculus by integrating usual practice, recommendations from other guidelines and practice parameters, and limited evidence.

Recommendations 8 and 9 provide guidance regarding the basic (Tier 1) diagnostic tests, including a cognitive laboratory panel and structural neuroimaging, that should be routinely obtained in all patients with a cognitive–behavioral syndrome to inform a confident etiological diagnosis. Importantly, Recommendations 8 through 11 apply to fewer patients than those who begin the process, as many patients in whom there is an initial concern that prompts the evaluation process will, once Recommendations 1 through 7 are followed, be assessed with high confidence to have a cognitive functional status of "cognitively unimpaired", and will not require further testing or evaluation (see Figure 2).

Several readily treatable common comorbid conditions, including infections, dehydration, hypothyroidism (TSH), and vitamin B 12 deficiency, are often observed and may contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms, and may cause subacute or acute clinical decompensation (see Box 4 on delirium). Acute mental status changes may be solely due to such conditions, but acute‐on‐chronic decompensations are usually an indication that a patient with a chronic brain disease causing progressive cognitive decline has developed a common comorbid condition.

A shotgun approach to first‐tier diagnostic testing is not recommended as it is costly and can be harmful. A judicious and stepwise approach that prioritizes common and treatable conditions, and less invasive and more cost‐effective testing, is recommended as the first‐tier approach to diagnostic testing in a patient suspected of having a cognitive–behavioral syndrome due to AD/ADRD. Such approaches to routine lab testing in AD/ADRD have been recommended in specialty society practice parameters;, health‐care systems such as the Veterans Health Administration; and in guidelines by world, European Intersociety Consensus Recommendations, and national health service authorities and commissions, but lack consistency, detail, a multi‐disciplinary perspective, and specificity to the United States.

2.7 How to use this guideline

These recommendations are designed to support clinicians, patients, caregivers, policy‐makers, and healthcare decision‐makers in making evidence‐informed decisions, specifically regarding which BBM test(s) to use and whether it/they should be used as a triaging or confirmatory test for AD pathology in specialized care settings. The recommendations are not meant to restrict, limit, delay, or deny clinical use, insurance coverage, or patient access to biomarker testing when deemed appropriate by a qualified healthcare provider. Furthermore, these recommendations do not substitute for clinical judgment nor encompass all possible considerations in the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of AD. We advise clinicians to exercise discretion and adapt their approach based on individual patient circumstances and emerging evidence.

2.5.1 Test accuracy

The panel decided not to make recommendations for or against specific tests; this decision reflects several considerations, including variability in how tests are developed, validated, and implemented across laboratories. Furthermore, manufacturers and laboratories do not typically rely on meta‐analyses to determine test cutoffs for abnormality, and some are even recommending two cutoff approaches. These inconsistencies further support the panel's position that ranking or endorsing specific tests is premature at this time. Instead, test accuracy data and accuracy judgments reported in this guideline are meant to serve as a resource for clinicians implementing the recommendations to aid them in choosing which test(s) to order.

The panel aligned clinical thresholds for acceptable accuracy of BBM tests based on what clinicians in real‐world settings would find acceptable and used recent expert opinion as a starting point for that discussion. Therefore, a given test was judged "accurate" at the triaging level if the point estimate for Sn was at least 90% and the Sp at least 75%. For the "confirmatory" level, the point estimates had to be at least 90% for both Sn and Sp.

A given patient's pretest probability for AD pathology will vary according to clinical presentation, age, and known risk factors. Therefore, the panel chose not to report predictive values associated with individual tests, since these metrics would be highly dependent on pretest probability. Instead, we note that a test with a Sn of 90% and Sp of 75% (our "triage" thresholds) would have a PPV of 47%, 78%, or 94%, and NPV of 97%, 88%, 65%, when applied in a population with a pretest probability of 20%, 50%, or 80%, respectively. A test with a Sn of 90% and Sp of 90% (our "confirmatory" thresholds) would have a PPV of 69%, 90%, or 97%, and NPV of 97%, 90%, 69%, when applied in a population with a pretest probability of 20%, 50%, or 80%, respectively.

Because Youden's index cutoff is not always an optimal combination of Sn and Sp, we supplemented with analyses of fixed sensitivity at 90% and fixed specificity at 75% when data were available.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

DETeCD-ADRD diagnostic evaluation — iterative diagnostic formulation and multi-tiered testing — recommends a structured and multi-tiered approach beginning with Tier 1 assessments and tests, with clinicians formulating Tier 1 results and deciding whether additional tests are needed to gain sufficient confidence, often requiring two or more problem-focused visits using a validated standardized instrument. Recommendations 8 and 9 provide guidance for basic (Tier 1) diagnostic tests, including a cognitive laboratory panel and structural neuroimaging, that should be routinely obtained in all patients with a cognitive-behavioral syndrome to form a confident etiologic diagnosis. Recommendations 8 through 11 apply to fewer patients because many individuals evaluated will, once Recommendations 1 through 7 are followed, be assessed with high confidence as "cognitively unimpaired" and will not require further testing or evaluation. For typical presentations of AD dementia, clinicians can often reach a confident clinical diagnosis that remains probabilistic and clinical judgment based and is not biomarker confirmed, whereas molecular biomarker confirmation is necessary for consideration of new disease-modifying therapies that target amyloid plaques. Several readily treatable comorbid conditions — such as infections, dehydration, hypothyroidism (TSH), and vitamin B12 deficiency — are often observed, may contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms, and may cause or exacerbate acute clinical decompensation. A shotgun approach to first-tier diagnostic testing is not recommended as it is costly and can be harmful; instead, a judicious and stepwise approach prioritizing common and treatable conditions and less invasive and more cost-effective testing is recommended as the first-tier approach in patients suspected of having a cognitive-behavioral syndrome due to AD/ADRD. The phrase "labs for reversible causes of dementia" can be misleading; "cognitive lab panel" may be more suitable, and the conditions assessed are rarely the primary etiology of a gradually progressive cognitive–behavioral syndrome but often exacerbate impairment in individuals with underlying neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders.

Tier-1 cognitive lab panel and potentially reversible dementia — Meta-analyses suggest that 0.3% to 0.6% of dementia syndromes may be at least partially "reversible"; while in ≈ 9% of dementia syndromes a common comorbid condition may be observed. The DETeCD-AD-ADRD Workgroup provides practical guidance for Tier-1 lab testing via a cognitive lab panel that should be obtained in all or almost all patients evaluated for suspected cognitive–behavioral syndromes due to their relatively low cost, wide availability, and acceptable yield for common comorbid conditions. The cognitive lab panel recommended by the workgroup includes screening tests for TSH and vitamin B12 deficiency, and homocysteine is included because hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with functional B12 deficiency.

### How does additional diagnostic testing influence the initial diagnosis in patients with cognitive complaints in a memory clinic setting? [^c2aad6ef]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Background

patients suspected of dementia frequently undergo additional diagnostic testing (e.g. brain imaging or neuropsychological assessment) after standard clinical assessment at a memory clinic. This study investigates the use of additional testing in an academic outpatient memory clinic and how it influences the initial diagnosis.

Methods

the initial diagnosis after standard clinical assessment (history, laboratory tests, cognitive screening and physical and neurological examination) and the final diagnosis after additional testing of 752 memory clinic patients were collected. We specifically registered if, and what type of, additional testing was requested.

Results

additional testing was performed in 518 patients (69%), 67% of whom underwent magnetic resonance imaging, 45% had neuropsychological assessment, 14% had cerebrospinal fluid analysis and 49% had (combinations of) other tests. This led to a modification of the initial diagnosis in 17% of the patients. The frequency of change was highest in patients with an initial non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia diagnosis (54%, compared with 11 and 14% in patients with AD and 'no dementia'; P < 0.01). Finally, after additional testing 44% was diagnosed with AD, 9% with non-AD dementia and 47% with 'no dementia'.

Conclusion

additional testing should especially be considered in non-AD patients. In the large group of patients with an initial AD or 'no dementia' diagnosis, additional tests have little diagnostic impact and may perhaps be used with more restraint.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2 CONCLUSIONS

The cornerstone of the diagnostic assessment of a patient with symptoms concerning AD or ADRD is the history and examination. Although advances in molecular biomarkers of brain diseases leading to cognitive impairment will likely enable their detection in some patients at an asymptomatic stage, the ability of proficient clinicians to recognize and diagnose patients in the early symptomatic stages of these illnesses is critical to optimize early management and hopefully minimize the adverse impact of these diseases on daily function and safety. Although it is common for a history to be taken and an examination to be performed without the use of specific validated instruments, evidence indicates and the DETeCD‐ADRD workgroup strongly believes that the use of such instruments will lead to better outcomes. Instruments to assess symptoms in daily life and their impact on function can be given to patients and informants prior to an office visit and can serve as a mechanism for structuring the history and efficiently identifying areas for focused clinical interviewing while also providing a list of pertinent negatives. A brief neurologic exam tailored to the patient is also important, as is a mental status exam augmented with a validated cognitive assessment instrument. The score on the test should not be interpreted in isolation, but should be integrated with information from the HPI, the patient's demographic background and psychosocial history, family history and other information relevant to the risk profile, medical history, medications, and other relevant information. For proficient clinicians, the synthesis of this information should lead to a diagnostic formulation of the patient's cognitive functional status and cognitive‐behavioral syndrome. In some cases, neuropsychological assessment or additional consultation(s) may be required to develop or further refine these first two steps of the diagnostic formulation.

If a patient has MCI or dementia, an evaluation should be done to determine the likely etiology, if possible, as discussed extensively in the companion articles. These diagnostic elements set prior probabilities on the differential diagnosis of likely etiology (‐ies), which informs clinical decision making regarding Tier 1 to 4 tests and other assessments in the evaluation process. See the primary care companion article for discussion of structural neuroimaging and cognitive lab panel blood tests. In some cases, the steps in this process may be relatively straightforward, and in others they may be quite complex. See the specialty care companion article for discussion of specialized functional and molecular neuroimaging and for fluid molecular biomarkers. Ultimately, the evaluation process should lead to a diagnostic formulation that is communicated clearly and compassionately to the patient and care partner, along with a discussion of management and prognosis.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^95688de2]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Alzheimer's Association blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) — clinical implications and recommendation strength emphasize evolving evidence and cautious guidance: Guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to make decisions based on evidence, which reduces variability and promotes standardization of care. Assays for the same biomarker frequently use different methods, resulting in varying performance characteristics, and therefore must be evaluated as separate tests. Even for tests that are already clinically available, only a handful of peer-reviewed published studies met our inclusion criteria, so the evidence base is early and somewhat fragile, with the evidence for at least one test rated as either "low" or "very low" certainty. Ultimately, the panel decided that patients would benefit from a set of "conditional recommendations with low certainty" with an accompanying systematic review of the most accurate and promising tests, noting that without this providers may either select BBMs that are less promising or refer patients for more invasive and expensive testing. The recommendations do not account for proprietary business decisions, such as a company's intent to pursue regulatory approval for a research-use-only (RUO) assay.

### Practice parameter: diagnosis of dementia (an evidence-based review). Report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^eb8bc2c6]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the 1994 practice parameter for the diagnosis of dementia in the elderly.

Background

The AAN previously published a practice parameter on dementia in 1994. New research and clinical developments warrant an update of some aspects of diagnosis.

Methods

Studies published in English from 1985 through 1999 were identified that addressed four questions: 1) Are the current criteria for the diagnosis of dementia reliable? 2) Are the current diagnostic criteria able to establish a diagnosis for the prevalent dementias in the elderly? 3) Do laboratory tests improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of dementing illness? 4) What comorbidities should be evaluated in elderly patients undergoing an initial assessment for dementia?

Recommendations

Based on evidence in the literature, the following recommendations are made. 1) The DSM-III-R definition of dementia is reliable and should be used (Guideline). 2) The National Institute of Neurologic, Communicative Disorders and Stroke — AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised (DSM-IIIR) diagnostic criteria for AD and clinical criteria for Creutzfeldt — Jakob disease (CJD) have sufficient reliability and validity and should be used (Guideline). Diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia may be of use in clinical practice (Option) but have imperfect reliability and validity. 3) Structural neuroimaging with either a noncontrast CT or MR scan in the initial evaluation of patients with dementia is appropriate. Because of insufficient data on validity, no other imaging procedure is recommended (Guideline). There are currently no genetic markers recommended for routine diagnostic purposes (Guideline). The CSF 14-3-3 protein is useful for confirming or rejecting the diagnosis of CJD (Guideline). 4) Screening for depression, B(12) deficiency, and hypothyroidism should be performed (Guideline). Screening for syphilis in patients with dementia is not justified unless clinical suspicion for neurosyphilis is present (Guideline).

Conclusions

Diagnostic criteria for dementia have improved since the 1994 practice parameter. Further research is needed to improve clinical definitions of dementia and its subtypes, as well as to determine the utility of various instruments of neuroimaging, biomarkers, and genetic testing in increasing diagnostic accuracy.

2.2.3 Core element six: Iterative diagnostic formulation and multitiered diagnostic testing

By following recommendations to this sixth core element in the evaluation process, the clinician should be able to integrate information about risk profile, history of symptoms, and examination findings to develop an opinion regarding the cognitive functional status and, at least preliminarily, a cognitive–behavioral syndromic diagnosis, if present. There should also be sufficient information for most primary care clinicians to arrive at a first decision point about whether consultative input should be obtained (i.e. from a neuropsychologist, specialist physician, or dementia subspecialist).

To achieve the goals of this three‐step diagnostic formulation, the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG recommends a structured and multi‐tiered approach to assessment and testing that begins with a fundamental set of Tier 1 assessments and tests, supplemented as needed by other tests tailored to the patient (see Figure 2). The clinician should formulate the results of the Tier 1 assessments and tests and decide which, if any, additional tests may be required to gain sufficiently high confidence in the presence or absence of a specific diagnosis. A stepped approach to diagnostic evaluation is also a cornerstone of other national, international, and intersocietal guidelines.,

FIGURE 2
In a primary care setting, this diagram shows the implementation of the seven core elements of the diagnostic evaluation process, illustrating how each clinical practice recommendation fits into the typical workflow, using the first tier of assessments and diagnostic tests. Ultimately, the goal is to evaluate a person with cognitive and/or behavioral symptoms to determine whether they have cognitive impairment and if so its impact on daily function (cognitive functional status), the cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the likely etiology (‐ies) of the impairment. This diagnostic formulation should then be disclosed clearly and compassionately, and a treatment plan can then be initiated. CBC, complete blood count; CRP, C‐reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TSH, thyroid‐stimulating hormone.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Tests listed in Tier 2 are reasonable to obtain in some patients when there is suspicion for one of these etiologies based on clinical characteristics, risk profile, or the results of other lab tests or diagnostic studies. Tests listed under Tiers 3 and 4 are warranted only under special circumstances and include tests typically performed by a specialist or dementia subspecialist when diagnostic uncertainty remains regarding the etiology of cognitive impairment, including when there may be atypical or rare or rapidly progressive conditions. Tests listed under Tier X are clinically emerging in specialist/subspecialist settings but may not be validated in diverse real‐world populations and clinical settings, widely accessible, reimbursed, or readily interpreted without high proficiency.,

In the following sections, we focus on FDG PET, CSF analyses for amyloid and tau, and amyloid PET. These three types of tests, as well as newer fluid and imaging biomarkers, can provide invaluable and, in some cases, highly accurate data that often helps increase confidence in the etiology of the cognitive–behavioral syndrome — and in some cases may help assess the severity of the disease. These three modalities were vetted by the workgroup for use in the diagnosis of AD (and in the case of FDG PET for ADRD). At the time the guideline was finalized, the strength of recommendation for these three biomarkers was lower than for the other recommendations. New evidence and greater accessibility in the context of disease‐modifying therapies will require a reconsideration of the strength of these recommendations. The workgroup fully expects that fluid and imaging biomarker testing for suspected neurodegenerative diseases in the context of cognitive–behavioral impairment and dementia will play a much larger role in the next few years as AD and ADRD diagnostics and therapeutics advance in all clinical settings.

Good practice statement on BBM testing — A BBM test should not be obtained before a comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional, and test results should always be interpreted within the clinical context. The panel urges clinicians to consider the pretest probability of AD pathology for each patient when deciding whether or not to use a BBM test.

2.3 Guideline scope

The panel identified two key clinical questions that warrant recommendation in this first iteration of the guideline:
Should a BBM test be incorporated as a triaging test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of individuals with cognitive impairment (including those with MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?
Should a BBM test serve as a substitute for CSF analysis or amyloid PET as a confirmatory test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?

A triaging test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out AD pathology with high probability, whereas a positive result should be confirmed using another method, such as CSF AD biomarkers or amyloid PET.

A confirmatory test refers to a test for which a negative result rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability.

Input on these questions was gathered during the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), where experts in the field provided insights to inform the development of this guideline.

This guideline is not intended to serve as a comprehensive clinical pathway or appropriate use recommendations for the broader diagnostic workup or treatment decision‐making in individuals with MCI or dementia. It does not address the use of BBMs for screening purposes, use in non‐specialty settings, or use in people with no cognitive concerns or only subjective memory impairment.

Recommendations 12 through 14 provide guidance regarding referral to a specialist or a neuropsychologist and the elements of these assessments. Recommendations 15 through 19 provide guidance regarding hierarchical use of Tier 2 to 4 diagnostic tests (specialized labs, imaging, genetic testing) and consultations, if needed, to determine cause(s) of (and potential contributors to) the cognitive–behavioral syndrome with a high level of confidence. Importantly, Recommendations 12 through 19 apply to fewer and fewer patients and circumstances still and the strength of these recommendations varies. For additional detail on the specialist or dementia subspecialist guideline, see Dickerson BC, et al.aimed toward specialists.

2.4 Core element seven: diagnostic disclosure

Recommendations 10 and 11 provide guidance regarding the seventh core element of the process — the communication of diagnostic findings and recommended management and follow‐up care. The patient and care partner's understanding and appreciation of the illness — together with the clinician's judgment — should guide education, communication, and documentation of diagnostic findings and disclosure. In this context, the clinician should honestly and compassionately communicate the name/stage of the syndrome and the disease causing it; treatment options and expectations; prognosis; and potential safety concerns — and the certainties, likelihoods, and unknowns related to these — and medical, psychosocial, and community resources for education, care planning and coordination, and support services. A separate article in this special issue provides guidance about principles of the diagnostic disclosure process as well as when immediate or full diagnostic disclosure may not be recommended or feasible.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic workflow for suspected AD/ADRD emphasizes sequential formulation: In most cases, the goal is to determine whether the patient has a diagnosable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior, with the first step being determination that a person does or does not have dementia and integration of reliable history with performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains; the second step — determination of the cognitive-behavioral syndrome — may warrant additional information or specialist consultation, and a neuropsychological evaluation by a neuropsychologist proficient in AD/ADRD assessment is often invaluable and can also be very helpful to suggest next steps; third, clinicians implicate a specific disease and/or consider the likely cause(s) of cognitive impairment or dementia, recognizing a persistent differential diagnosis and using risk and resilience factors and established clinical diagnostic criteria while the field evolves toward separating clinical syndromes from likely neuropathologic changes informed by core and ancillary biomarkers.

The workgroup attempted to phrase each recommendation as a practical action that is considered one of a series of steps in the evaluation and disclosure process. Recommendations 1 through 11 were purposefully written (and re‐written several times after several rounds of modified‐Delphi discussions and voting by the workgroup) so that they could be assigned the highest strength of recommendation. That is, the benefit of performing the recommended action, as part of the goal‐oriented and dynamic evaluation and disclosure process delineated in Figures 1 and 2, outweighs the potential harm and burden in the majority of circumstances. In so doing, the workgroup sought to describe the fundamental principles and steps of the process of a patient‐centered evaluation that should usually be performed from start to finish.

FIGURE 1
For patients who may be exhibiting symptoms and/or signs of cognitive impairment due to AD or ADRD, the three steps of the diagnostic formulation may be accomplished by following a process of seven core elements. AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADRD, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, Dx, diagnosis; Hx, history.

Recommendation 8 — laboratory tests for cognitive or behavioral symptoms — states that testing should be multi-tiered and individualized, and clinicians should obtain routine Tier 1 laboratory studies in all patients (Strength of Recommendation A). In all, or almost all, patients, a basic Tier 1 cognitive lab panel includes complete blood count (CBC) with differential; complete metabolic (e.g. Chem-20) panel with renal and hepatic panels, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); vitamin B12 level; homocysteine level; C-reactive protein (CRP); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

### Should older adults be screened for dementia? It is important to screen for evidence of dementia! [^1221d6c6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2007). Low credibility.

Multiple arguments for considering routine dementia screening have been presented. Furthermore, dementia diagnoses are widely unrecognized. As a result, persons with dementia are missing important clinical care and treatment interventions. By distinction, the problems of defining, diagnosing, and treating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are not yet resolved, and MCI is not ready for a screening recommendation. Dementia screening approaches, including cognitive testing and functional assessment, must be evaluated on their scientific merits, including sensitivity and specificity for recognizing affected individuals in at-risk populations. Screening tests must be "cost-worthy", with the benefits of true-positive test results justifying the costs of testing and resolving false-positive cases, with due consideration for proper diagnostic evaluation and potential harms. With the tremendous number of new cases projected in the near future and the expected emergence of beneficial therapies, considerably more research is needed to develop more efficient screening systems.

Evidence classification and recommendation definitions — diagnostic study evidence is categorized from Class I to Class IV, ranging from "a well designed prospective study in a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using a 'gold standard'… in a blinded evaluation" to "any design in which test is not applied in blinded evaluation OR evidence provided by expert opinion alone or in descriptive case series (without controls)". Practice recommendations are defined as Standard (principle reflecting "a high degree of clinical certainty" usually requiring Class I evidence or overwhelming Class II evidence), Guideline (recommendation reflecting "moderate clinical certainty" based on Class II or strong consensus of Class III evidence), Practice Option ("clinical utility is uncertain"), and Practice Advisory ("emerging and/or newly approved therapies or technologies" based on at least one Class I study, with possible modest effect, limited response, or cost-benefit concerns).

FIGURE 3
In a specialty care setting (usually general neurology, geriatric psychiatry, or geriatrics), this diagram briefly illustrates how each primary care clinical practice recommendation fits into the typical workflow (see Figure 2 for details). Additional detail is provided on how higher tier assessments and diagnostic tests fit into the specialty care workflow. In some specialty care settings, the assessments and tests illustrated in Figure 4 are performed to arrive at the 3‐step diagnostic formulation. This diagnostic formulation should then be disclosed clearly and compassionately, and a treatment plan can then be initiated.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or may exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.,

Specialized neurobehavioral assessments and neurologic examinations are also used to monitor status, as well as to disentangle the adverse effects of prior or current treatments (e.g. parkinsonism, dyskinesias, cognitive side effects of medications, sleep and mood changes) from the symptoms of disease(s) and comorbid conditions. Recommendation 12 provides additional detail on patient characteristics that warrant specialist referral.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, contributing to an estimated 60% to 80% of all dementias. According to the Alzheimer's Association Facts & Figures report, approximately 7.2 million Americans are living with AD dementia in 2025. This number is projected to double by 2060, highlighting a growing public health crisis as the population ages. Pathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of extracellular cortical plaques composed of amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These pathologies manifest many years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, marking a prolonged preclinical phase during which progressive brain damage occurs.

For decades, the options for ante mortem detection of AD pathology have been limited to tests that are either expensive, such as positron emission tomography (PET), or invasive but safe when properly performed, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ‐based biomarker analysis. Furthermore, these tools remain out of reach to most healthcare providers, even in many specialized clinical settings. Despite these barriers, there are multiple reasons why patients and clinicians seek in vivo confirmation of AD pathology. A key driver is higher diagnostic accuracy, since AD is often misdiagnosed without biomarkers, even in specialist settings. Furthermore, identifying the presence or absence of AD pathology can help narrow the etiology of cognitive impairment, guide appropriate care strategies, and provide valuable prognostic information for patients and their families. The recent regulatory approvals of new amyloid targeting therapies for AD, which require biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology to determine treatment eligibility, further highlights the need. As these therapies are receiving regulatory approval and being marketed in different parts of the world, the demand for biomarker‐based diagnostics to accurately identify eligible patients, enable early intervention, and ascertain when treatment is likely to be most effective, is expected to rise substantially.

Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (AD/ADRD) — laboratory panels and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use are described as follows: Brain MRI without contrast, when available and not contraindicated, is appropriate for evaluation of AD/ADRD, and strong evidence supports the utility of brain MRI against gold-standard neuropathologic examinations. Other panel tests are informative about potential comorbidities such as dehydration (e.g., suggested with a blood urea nitrogen: creatinine ratio ≥ 20:1), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are included as broad, non-specific, and inexpensive screens for insidious systemic processes. In contemporary practice, structural brain images may reveal atrophy patterns supportive of a particular neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.

### FDA clears first blood test used in diagnosing… [^64e34a68]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: The U. S. Food and Drug Administration today cleared for marketing the first in vitro diagnostic device that tests blood to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio is for the early detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease in adult patients, aged 55 years and older, exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease. While amyloid plaques can occur in other diseases, being able to detect the presence of plaque, along with other evaluations, helps the doctor determine the probable cause of the patient's symptoms and findings. These plaques can be detected and visualized using amyloid positron emission tomography brain scans, often years before clinical symptom onset, to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. PET scans, however, are a costly and time-consuming option and expose patients to radiation.

The Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio measures two proteins, pTau217 and β-amyloid 1–42, found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient's brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. Similar FDA-authorized/cleared tests, one from the same company as this new test, are used with cerebrospinal fluid samples, which are collected through an invasive lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap. This new Lumipulse test only requires a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and much easier for patients to access. During review of the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio, the FDA evaluated data from a multi-center clinical study of 499 individual plasma samples from adults who were cognitively impaired.

The samples were tested by the Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1–42 Plasma Ratio and compared with amyloid PET scan or CSF test results. These findings indicate that the new blood test can reliably predict the presence or absence of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease at the time of the test in patients who are cognitively impaired. The test is intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information.

Diagnosis of dementia — conclusions and practical recommendations: The CSF 14-3-3 protein assay is useful for confirming CJD, whereas no laboratory tests are appropriate for routine clinical evaluation of suspected AD. For imaging, structural neuroimaging with noncontrast CT or MR in the routine initial evaluation of dementia is appropriate (Guideline); linear or volumetric MR or CT measurement schemes are not recommended for routine use at this time (Guideline); for suspected dementia, SPECT cannot be recommended for routine use in initial or differential diagnosis as it has not demonstrated superiority to clinical criteria (Guideline); PET imaging is not recommended for routine use in the diagnostic evaluation of dementia at this time (Guideline).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dementia: 2024 update [^14b0c11d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dementia is defined by significant chronic or acquired impairment in a single domain or loss of two or more cognitive functions by brain disease or injury. It is a common chronic syndrome in adults and constitutes the fifth leading cause of death in patients > 65 years of age. Multiple etiologies of dementia exist, most notably Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as other neurologic diseases such as vascular dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus. In addition to aiding clinicians in selecting the most appropriate imaging test for patients suspected of one of these dementia syndromes, this document highlights the most appropriate initial imaging tests for patients with suspected mild cognitive impairment and rapidly progressive dementia, as well as the most appropriate pre- and posttreatment imaging tests for patients undergoing therapy with antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Guidelines on whom to test usually emphasize the presence of a pedigree (family history) consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of dementia or a related condition, or a young patient with dementia. It may take substantial time and effort to collect and document the relevant information in the family history. The decision to perform genetic testing should be made in partnership with the patient and family after appropriate education regarding the potential implications of such testing for the patient and blood relatives. This education and counseling process, ultimately leading to a decision regarding whether to perform genetic testing and the interpretation and disclosure of genetic test results requires specialized expertise and proficiency and should be done, when possible, with an experienced genetic counselor involved.

A growing array of probabilistic genetic risk factors for AD have been and are being identified, which should be considered separately from deterministic genetic abnormalities. The strongest probabilistic genetic risk factor for AD is the APOE gene. Considerations regarding the potential clinical utility of evaluating probabilistic genetic risk variants, such as APOE genotype, are different from considerations regarding testing for deterministic genetic mutations. The workgroup agreed with a variety of guidelines and expert groups who have recommended against testing for this risk allele in the diagnostic evaluation of individual patients suspected of having MCI or dementia due to AD. The workgroup appreciated the potential for APOE allele genetic testing to become useful in future clinical practice as part of composite diagnostic biomarker panels, but at the time of this writing the preponderance of current evidence does not support its broad clinical utility in diagnostic evaluation. Counseling and testing for APOE genotype play an important role in safety considerations, patient‐centered risk‐benefit discussions, and shared decision making involved in amyloid‐modifying therapies (see Box 2). However, in those cases, APOE genotyping would be for therapeutic decision making rather than diagnostic evaluation purposes.

Because CSF is obtained via lumbar puncture, this procedure is usually performed by a specialist, often a neurologist. AD CSF biomarkers are useful in cognitively impaired patients in whom the etiological diagnosis is equivocal, where there is only an intermediate level of diagnostic confidence, or when having very high confidence in the etiological diagnosis is needed (such as in the consideration of a patient's candidacy for AD disease‐modifying therapy). Those may include individuals at very early clinical stages (e.g. early MCI) or with atypical clinical presentations. CSF biomarker analysis in the evaluation of a patient with MCI or dementia should be performed after Tier 1 studies — structural MRI and laboratory tests tailored to the patient — have been obtained. In this context, Recommendation 17 is also consistent with other international clinical practice guidelines, and steering committee recommendations of the US Veterans Health Administration.

In CSF, a decreased concentration of one form of Aβ (Aβ42) is a marker of amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain, while an increased concentration of total tau (t‐tau) reflects injury to neurons, and an increased concentration of specific isoforms of hyperphosphorylated tau can not only reflect neurofibrillary tangles but also correlate highly as measures of amyloid plaques. A ratio of t‐tau to Aβ42, Aβ42 to Aβ40, or p‐tau181 (or p‐tau217) to Aβ42 are at present the best‐performing markers of AD neuropathologic changes, and are more accurate than individual levels of these proteins alone. These CSF biomarkers of AD have been validated against autopsy, and ratio values of CSF Aβ42 have been further validated against amyloid PET imaging, with overall values for sensitivity and specificity of 85% to 90% and 80% to 84%, respectively.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

A description of first‐line routine laboratory testing as "labs for reversible causes of dementia" can be misleading; the term "cognitive lab panel" may be more suitable. The conditions being evaluated in such a panel are rarely the primary etiology of a gradually progressive cognitive–behavioral syndrome, but often exacerbate cognitive or behavioral impairment in individuals with underlying neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders (e.g. VCID). It is highly unlikely for a hormonal or vitamin deficiency, or metabolic, infectious, autoimmune, toxic, neoplastic, or paraneoplastic condition to mimic the clinical phenotype of typical AD/ADRD; it is more likely for a subsyndromal delirium caused by these conditions to secondarily becloud and decompensate cognitive–behavioral function in an individual with underlying AD/ADRD pathological changes. It is also possible, though very uncommon, for some of these conditions to primarily cause atypical dementia syndromes: reports of very rare instances (with insufficient long‐term follow‐up) notwithstanding, meta‐analyses suggest that 0.3% to 0.6% of dementia syndromes may be at least partially "reversible"; while in ≈ 9% of dementia syndromes a common comorbid condition may be observed.

Recommendation 12 — Referral for atypical, early-onset, or rapidly progressive cases — A patient with atypical findings or in whom there is uncertainty about how to interpret the evaluation, or that is suspected of having an early-onset or rapidly progressive cognitive–behavioral condition, should be further evaluated expeditiously, usually including referral to a specialist (Strength of Recommendation A). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered to be urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management, and atypical, rapidly progressive or early-onset (young age of onset, age < 65 years) dementias pose unique diagnostic and care challenges that may require comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation and specialist assessment, interpretation, or management.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

While multiple barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure of AD/ADRD exist in primary care, individuals with typical AD dementia can and should be readily diagnosed with confidence in the primary care setting. By gaining proficiency with the testing and processes recommended in this guideline, most PCPs should find it relatively straightforward to suspect and then diagnose dementia likely due to AD in a patient with a typical presentation of gradually progressive memory loss and difficulty with judgment and problem solving, and often spatial and/or temporal orientation, which have impacted ADLs, and in whom cognitive lab panel and brain MRI are also supportive (i.e. unrevealing in the former and consistent with AD in the latter). However, some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management.

Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, cortical visual dysfunction), sensorimotor impairment (e.g. visual field cut, limb apraxia or rigidity, myoclonus, eye movement abnormalities, incoordination, gait abnormalities), or profound mood and behavioral symptoms (e.g. disinhibition, manic‐like behavior, flat or indifferent affect, or severe depressive or anxious mood or psychotic thought content). Patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing and studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The DETeCD‐ADRD Workgroup aimed to provide practical guidance for Tier‐1 lab testing via a cognitive lab panel that should be obtained in all or almost all patients evaluated for suspected cognitive–behavioral syndromes due to their relatively low cost, wide availability, and acceptable yield as a broad evaluation for common comorbid conditions. The workgroup adopted a multidisciplinary and US health‐care–centric perspective to estimate risk–reward calculus by integrating usual practice, recommendations from other guidelines and practice parameters, and the limited evidence to otherwise support or refute the utility of cognitive lab panel tests for common comorbid conditions.

The cognitive lab panel (Table 5) recommended by the workgroup includes screening tests for TSH and vitamin B12 deficiency, which are common in older adults, can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms and decompensation of cognitive–behavioral syndromes, and their treatment can improve symptoms. Homocysteine is included because hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with functional B12 deficiency (and may not always readily detected by B12 levels in blood), cardio‐ and cerebrovascular risk, and VCID. Other panel tests are informative about the potential existence of common comorbid conditions such as dehydration (e.g. suggestive with a blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio > 20:1), hypo/hypernatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia (and hypocalcemia), hypo/hyperglycemia, anemia, uremia, and hepatic dysfunction. Finally, ESR and CRP are included as broad, non‐specific, and inexpensive screens for insidious systemic processes including inflammatory/autoimmune, infectious, or neoplastic processes (e.g. undetected lung, liver, or colon cancer) which may change management and prognosis.

"Because of its frequency, hypothyroidism should be screened for in elderly patients (Guideline)".

4.4 Strengths and limitations

This CPG is grounded in a systematic review of the peer‐reviewed literature and developed using the GRADE approach. The use of GRADE ensures a transparent, structured, and evidence‐based process for evaluating the certainty of evidence and formulating recommendations. This methodology strengthens the credibility and reproducibility of the guideline and allows for explicit linkage between evidence and recommendations. The panel acknowledges the inherent limitations in the published literature available to inform these recommendations and has made efforts to transparently describe where data gaps or uncertainties remain.

In contrast, regulatory submissions are typically informed by data provided by industry sponsors and submitted to regulatory agencies in the context of product approval or licensure. These data, while often robust, are generally not peer‐reviewed or publicly available at the time of regulatory decision‐making. As a result, some tests that may have received regulatory approval or clearance at the time of this publication may not have been included in the systematic review or the panel's EtD process required for this guideline if peer‐reviewed data were not available or accessible.

To enhance the clinical relevance and applicability of the guideline, the panel was intentionally multidisciplinary and diverse in composition. It included experts from a broad range of specialties (e.g. neurology, geriatrics, nursing), as well as methodologists with expertise in guideline development and evidence synthesis. Panelists represented a variety of geographic regions, countries, gender, and years of clinical experience to promote inclusive perspectives and reduce potential biases. This diversity enriched the deliberative process and ensured that the recommendations are applicable across a wide range of clinical contexts and patient populations.

The panel acknowledged that the prevalence of brain amyloid in people with cognitive impairment has varied across populations where it has been studied, and there are many other clinical populations where amyloid testing with gold standard tests (PET or lumbar puncture or post mortem pathology) has been quite limited. Additionally, a given patient's pretest probability for AD will vary according to clinical presentation and known risk factors.

2.2 Target audience

This guideline's primary target audience includes specialists involved in the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment in specialized care settings. A specialist in this context is defined as a healthcare provider, typically, but not exclusively, in neurology, psychiatry, or geriatrics, who spends at least 25% of their clinical practice time caring for adults with cognitive impairment or dementia. Not all clinicians in these fields are dementia specialists, and providers in other areas of practice may identify as a specialist based on their specific knowledge and training. Specialists are proficient in assessing, diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders, understanding and interpreting the results of brain imaging, CSF, and BBM tests, and clearly communicating the results of the aforementioned tests and their implications to patients and families. Primary care providers, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants working in these specialized care settings are also included in the primary target audience. While non‐specialty care providers working in primary care settings and healthcare professionals in nursing homes and long‐term care facilities are not the intended target audience, this guideline may serve as a resource to enhance their understanding of BBM use in AD diagnostic workup, particularly as such tests are being increasingly marketed for use in non‐specialty care settings.

This guideline is intended to inform clinical decision‐making, support the development of standards of care, guide laboratory practices, and assist clinicians in selecting appropriate BBM tests for individual patients. In addition, it may help inform the use of BBMs and their incorporation in clinical trial outcomes or decisions in clinical trials with adaptive design.

The secondary target audience includes individuals affected by MCI or dementia, their caregivers, policy‐makers involved in dementia care and healthcare decision‐making, and laboratory medicine specialists involved in using BBMs.

2.3 Core element six: iterative diagnostic formulation and multi‐tiered diagnostic testing

By following recommendations to this sixth core element in the evaluation process (see Figures 1, 2, and 3), the clinician should have integrated information about risk profile, history of symptoms, and examination findings to develop an opinion regarding the cognitive functional status and, at least preliminarily, a cognitive–behavioral syndromic diagnosis, if present. There should also be sufficient information for most primary care clinicians to arrive at a first decision point with regard to whether consultative input should be obtained (i.e. from a neuropsychologist, specialist, or dementia subspecialist). In the primary care setting, two or more problem‐focused visits would usually be required to arrive at this point in the diagnostic evaluation process, especially when involving an informant/care partner and allowing sufficient time to assess cognition via a validated standardized instrument.

To achieve the goals of this three‐step diagnostic formulation, the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG recommends a structured and multi‐tiered approach to assessment and testing that begins with a fundamental set of Tier 1 assessments and tests, supplemented as needed by other tests tailored to the patient (see Figures 2, 3). The clinician should formulate the results of the Tier 1 assessments and tests and decide which, if any, additional tests may be required to gain sufficiently high confidence in the presence or absence of a specific diagnosis. A stepped approach to diagnostic evaluation of potential cognitive impairment or dementia is also a cornerstone of other national, European and international guidelines including the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2018 Guidelines on dementia diagnosis and care, Canadian (5th Canadian Consensus Conference on Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia) guidelines, the World Health Organization mhGAP 2016 Intervention Guide, and the 2024 European Intersocietal Recommendations for the biomarker‐based diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders. It is ultimately each clinician who, depending on her or his proficiency, the available data and resources, and the goals of evaluation, must — in partnership with each patient‐care partner dyad — guide the evaluation process to achieve the desired confidence in the syndromic and etiological diagnosis.

At present, many clinicians restrict HIV testing to those with risk factors. Clearly, they should have increased suspicion in patients from HIV-endemic regions, men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users and sex workers. However, restricting testing to these will miss cases. The HIV antibody–antigen test is a quick, cheap, non-invasive and highly reliable test that should, in our opinion, be performed in all patients presenting to neurologists with cognitive impairment. This practice is supported by the British HIV Association guidelines for HIV testing, listing dementia as a neurological indicator disease (table 1). Additionally, the Association of British Neurologists and British Infection Association National Encephalitis Guidelines recommend HIV testing for all patients with suspected encephalitis, regardless of perceived risk factors. By contrast, the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) dementia guidelines currently state that the initial investigation of dementia (usually in primary care) should not include testing for HIV or syphilis, unless there are risk factors or the clinical picture dictates. However, the classical clinical picture is not always present. As the HIV population ages, the spectrum of disease is changing; furthermore, HIV may promote other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Also, performing HIV testing on the basis of risk factors assumes that a detailed sexual history is routinely taken, and that the answers are reliable in a person with cognitive impairment. For these reasons, we feel that HIV testing should be a routine investigation for patients with dementia presenting to neurologists.

2.2.4 Core element seven: Diagnostic disclosure

Recommendations 10 and 11 provide guidance regarding the seventh core element of the process — the communication of diagnostic findings and recommended follow‐up care. These require that the patient and care partner's understanding and appreciation of the illness — together with the clinician's judgment — guide education, communication, and documentation of diagnostic findings and disclosure. In this context, the clinician should honestly and compassionately communicate the name/stage of the syndrome and the disease causing it; treatment options and expectations; prognosis and potential safety concerns — and the certainties, likelihoods, and unknowns related to these — and medical, psychosocial and community resources for education, care planning and coordination, and support services. A separate article in this special issue provides guidance about the principles of the diagnostic disclosure process as well as when immediate or full diagnostic disclosure may not be recommended or feasible.

2.3 DETeCD‐ADRD recommendations for elements of the diagnostic evaluation process typically performed in specialty or subspecialty care settings

In addition to the core elements of the diagnostic evaluation process and their implementation in the first 11 recommendations, which should be considered in all settings, we provide additional recommendations applicable to the specialist settings. Recommendations 12 and 13 pertain to whom to refer to a specialist and what would usually be expected from a specialist's evaluation. Recommendation 14 summarizes guidance regarding neuropsychological referral and assessment. Recommendations 15 through 19 provide a framework for the hierarchical use of Tier 2 to 4 diagnostic tests (specialized labs, imaging, genetic testing) and consultations, if needed, to determine the cause(s) of (and potential contributors to) the cognitive–behavioral syndrome with a high level of confidence. Recommendations 12 through 19 apply to fewer and fewer patients who are going through this process; the strength of these recommendations applies to this smaller group of patients who are deemed to need more specialized evaluation.

Blood-based biomarker (BBM) testing for confirmatory use — In patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized memory-care, the panel suggests using a high-sensitivity and high-specificity BBM test as a confirmatory test in the diagnostic workup of AD (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). A confirmatory test refers to a test in which a negative test rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability. For confirmatory testing, the panel defined acceptable diagnostic test accuracy to be at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity for a reference test (CSF AD biomarkers, amyloid PET, or AD neuropathology).

To accomplish the three steps of the diagnostic formulation, the evaluation follows a multi‐tiered approach so the clinician can select assessments and tests that follow a structured process but that are tailored to the individual patient's circumstances. Depending on the proficiency of the practitioner and the profile of the patient, this evaluation can be initiated and, in many situations, completed in any clinical practice setting. The three steps of the diagnostic formulation may be relatively straightforward to determine by following a process of seven core elements (Figure 1) and using the first tier of assessment and diagnostic tests in a primary care setting (Figure 2), or they may require additional consultation (e.g. neuropsychological evaluation) and tiers of assessments and tests in the primary care (Figure 2), specialty (Figure 3), or dementia subspecialty settings (Figure 4).

The panel cautions that there is significant variability in diagnostic test accuracy and that many commercially available BBM tests do not meet these thresholds, especially using a single cut-off. These tests do not serve as a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation and should be used only as part of a full diagnostic workup in specialized care settings with careful consideration of pretest probability of AD pathology.

Appropriateness and caution for BBM testing — In the following clinical scenarios, a BBM test may not be appropriate: when shared decision-making discussions with the patient find that there would be low utility in knowing whether AD pathology is present. In the following clinical scenarios, a BBM test may not be appropriate or should be interpreted with extra caution: patients with obvious modifiable or temporary conditions that are likely to account for the patient's cognitive impairment; patients with limited life expectancy, as the clinical significance and prognosis of AD pathology are not well-defined in these populations; patients with a history of conditions that can affect the brain and that may impact levels of a given BBM in ways that have not been well-studied; patients with medical conditions that may affect the levels of a given BBM; and patients taking certain medications that may impact levels of a given BBM.

Vigorous efforts are underway worldwide to explore CSF for biomarkers of other neurodegenerative diseases — including specific markers of FTLDand synucleinopathies, and for biomarkers of neurodegeneration that may be less specific to these pathologic conditions such as neurofilament light chain (a marker of axonal neuronal injury) and neurogranin (a marker of synaptic dysfunction). When the differential diagnosis is broader in the evaluation of a patient with rapidly progressive or atypical cognitive–behavioral or other neurologic symptoms, CSF may be a critically important test when there is a suspicion for infectious disease, immune‐mediated encephalitis, prion disease (e.g. Creutzfeldt–Jacob disease), subacute cerebrovascular or demyelinating disease, or cancer presenting with primary neurologic symptoms (paraneoplastic syndrome).

Both the lumbar puncture and the AD‐related assay are reimbursed by Medicare (CMS) and usually also by other payors in the United States. The assays are often performed in centralized laboratories as send‐outs from local labs. Global efforts are working to better standardize CSF amyloid and tau threshold values across laboratories as new assays are continually developed. The interpretation of results in the clinical context, however, may be difficult, because a sizeable percentage of cognitively normal older adults harbor these pathologic markers of AD, with the percentage increasing with age over ≈ 60 (20%–40% of cognitively normal older adult patients have AD pathological changes). That is, just because a patient with cognitive impairment has abnormal amyloid and tau biomarkers does not mean AD is the etiology primarily driving or even potentially substantially contributing to cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of older adult patients with what appears clinically to be probable AD dementia are found to have multiple types of pathologic changes at autopsy, including other proteinopathies and evidence of VCID; emerging evidence suggests that co‐pathologies may influence CSF AD biomarker findings. And much of the research to date has not included ethnically and racially diverse participants.

Finally, when considering a lumbar puncture, it is always important to assess safety and communicate risks and burdens appropriately to patients. The safety of lumbar puncture for CSF collection in the evaluation of patients suspected of having AD has been well established in many thousands of patients. The most critical element of the safety and tolerability of this procedure is the experience and proficiency of the clinician, and knowledge of the potential contraindications to lumbar puncture, including use of anticoagulant medications, some blood clotting disorders, recent seizures, intracranial lesions associated with increased intracranial pressure, papilledema, and impaired consciousness.

Objective and Scope

A panel of clinicians, subject-matter experts, and guideline methodologists convened by the Alzheimer's Association conducted a systematic review and formulated evidence-based recommendations for using blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease (AD) within specialized care settings. The scope focuses on individuals with objective cognitive impairment, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, who are undergoing evaluation by providers trained and experienced in memory disorders, where AD is the suspected underlying etiology.

Methods

The panel conducted a systematic review to assess the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs in detecting AD pathology. The BBMs of interest included plasma phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) tests measuring the following analytes: p-tau217, ratio of p-tau217 to non-p-tau217 ×100 (%p-tau17), p-tau181, p-tau231, and ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. The reference standard tests included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), or neuropathology. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and the GRADE evidence-to-decision (EtD) Framework to develop its recommendations.

Recommendations

The key recommendations in this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) are: (1) BBM tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity can be used as a triaging test and (2) BBM tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity and specificity can serve as a substitute for amyloid PET imaging or CSF AD biomarker testing in patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care for memory disorders. The panel cautions users of this guideline that there is significant variability in diagnostic test accuracy and many commercially available BBM tests do not meet these thresholds, especially using a single cutoff. Additionally, these tests do not serve as a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional and should be used only as part of a full diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings, and with careful consideration of pretest probability of AD pathology.

Conclusions and Practical Implications

This CPG provides performance-based, brand-agnostic recommendations for the use of BBMs in the diagnostic workup of suspected AD within specialized care settings. By linking recommendations to a systematic review and associated living updates, and using a robust and transparent methodology, the guideline ensures scientific rigor, adaptability, and sustained relevance as evidence evolves. Clinicians are encouraged to stay informed about emerging paradigms-such as biomarker combinations or ratios and multi-threshold testing-that may further refine the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs as the field evolves.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — initial psychiatric evaluation and laboratory assessment should include, at a minimum, history of onset and progression, review of medical problems and medications (including over-the-counter and herbal), assessment of functional abilities, physical and focused neurological examinations, and a psychiatric examination with brief cognitive assessment across attention, memory, language, and visuospatial skills using age- and education-adjusted norms; recommended laboratory studies include complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry battery (including glucose, electrolytes, calcium, and kidney and liver function tests), measurement of vitamin B12 level, and thyroid function tests, with additional tests such as toxicology studies, syphilis serology, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV testing, serum homocysteine, lumbar puncture, or electroencephalogram as indicated, and elements of the history may need to be obtained from caregivers, sometimes without the patient present to allow full disclosure of sensitive information.

Alzheimer's Association balance of effects — When a BBM test with acceptable accuracy is used by a trained specialist, the panel judged the desirable effects to be large and undesirable effects to be small to moderate; hence, the balance of effects probably favors the use of BBM tests over CSF, PET scan, or no testing to confirm AD pathology, and in most health care settings BBM tests can enhance diagnostic pathways and expand access to timely care when implemented thoughtfully.

The recent commercialisation of the first disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease emphasises the need for consensus recommendations on the rational use of biomarkers to diagnose people with suspected neurocognitive disorders in memory clinics. Most available recommendations and guidelines are either disease-centred or biomarker-centred. A European multidisciplinary taskforce consisting of 22 experts from 11 European scientific societies set out to define the first patient-centred diagnostic workflow that aims to prioritise testing for available biomarkers in individuals attending memory clinics. After an extensive literature review, we used a Delphi consensus procedure to identify 11 clinical syndromes, based on clinical history and examination, neuropsychology, blood tests, structural imaging, and, in some cases, EEG. We recommend first-line and, if needed, second-line testing for biomarkers according to the patient's clinical profile and the results of previous biomarker findings. This diagnostic workflow will promote consistency in the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders across European countries.

3 RECOMMENDATIONS

3.1 Recommendations and remarks

The panel formulated two recommendations and one good practice statement for the use of BBM tests in the diagnostic workup of patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care. These conditional recommendations favor the use of BBM tests and offer acceptable minimum diagnostic test accuracy for triaging and confirmatory tests (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Recommendations and remarks for the use of BBM tests in patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care

3.2 Summary of identified studies

Forty‐nine, observational studies assessed the diagnostic test accuracy of plasma biomarkers of interest for determining AD pathology in patients with cognitive impairment to inform recommendations. Across these studies, 31 different BBM tests were evaluated in our systematic review and are summarized in Table 3 below:

TABLE 3
List of assay/analyte combinations studied in the systematic review.

Eighty‐four studies that would have otherwise met eligibility criteria were ultimately excluded due to cognitively impaired and unimpaired populations being analyzed together, such that we were unable to separate data on only cognitively impaired individuals.

Demographic data reported in primary studies were occasionally reflective of combined populations (i.e. instances where test accuracy data was reported according to cognitive status but demographic data was not). The mean sample size across studies was 560 participants (range: 70 to 2244). Mean age across studies ranged from 62.6 to 85.9 years, and the percentage of males ranged from 33.8% to 60%. Across the 32 studies that evaluated and reported apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotyping, carriers ranged from 27.1% to 56.2% of the population.

3.3 EtD framework

The panel used the GRADE EtD framework for diagnostic test accuracy studies to systematically assess and transparently document the factors influencing the recommendation, including the diagnostic test accuracy, certainty of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, values and preferences, resources required, cost‐effectiveness, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. The completed EtD form (Table S1) summarizes the judgments, research evidence, and additional expert input for each EtD factor.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 5
Multiple tiers of tests considered in the evaluation of patients with or suspected of having cognitive impairment.

Brain MRI without contrast, when available and not contraindicated, is appropriate for evaluation of AD/ADRD. In the past, the major role of structural neuroimaging in dementia assessment was to assist in the exclusion of non‐neurodegenerative etiologies of cognitive impairment or dementia (such as tumors, inflammatory conditions, infectious processes, etc.) or the identification of features of unusual forms of dementia (such as prion diseases). In contemporary practice, structural brain images may reveal atrophy patterns supportive of a particular neurodegenerative disease diagnosis. Strong evidence supports the utility of brain MRI against gold‐standard neuropathologic examinations. For example, in some patients presenting with a history and examination typical for an early clinical stage of suspected AD, the brain MRI may show clear evidence of atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and lateral temporal and parietal cortices with ventricular enlargement. When a proficient clinician's hypothesis is that the patient's cognitive impairment is likely due to AD with relatively little else in the differential diagnosis, and a brain MRI is supportive of this hypothesis, the clinician may be reasonably confident in the clinical diagnosis, although specific molecular biomarkers are required to confirm the diagnosis for treatment with disease‐modifying therapy. In other cases, there may not be evidence of abnormality, or the abnormalities may not be consistent with those hypothesized from the clinical presentation. In these cases, additional higher‐tier testing may be warranted. Finally, MRI plays a critical role in the detection of evidence of microhemorrhage associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which influences risk–benefit considerations for the use of anticoagulants and is a critical element of appropriate patient selection and monitoring for amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities in patients who receive disease‐modifying therapies.

3.2 Determining the need for initial workup and determining the level of concern for AD

The HCP should assess whether the patient has objective cognitive symptoms that warrant further evaluation (Figure 1, Step 1). If no objective cognitive symptoms are present and/or the patient declines further workup, no additional follow‐up should be conducted. It may be suggested that the patient be reassessed in 6 to 12 months if the cognitive symptoms persist. If the patient has objective cognitive symptoms and is amenable to further testing, an initial workup should be initiated. The initial workup may occur during the same visit or at a follow‐up visit.

The initial workup should include cognitive screening, depression and/or neurobehavioral screening, and routine bloodwork to evaluate for potential treatable causes of cognitive impairment (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid abnormalities) (Figure 1, Step 2). Upon reviewing the results of the initial workup, the HCP should determine the patient's level of risk for AD in accordance with local clinical and practice standards. If AD is suspected as the cause of cognitive impairment, the HCP should discuss the results with the patient and care partner, ensuring their interest in continued workup before proceeding. Conversely, if the patient's cognitive impairment is not thought to be caused by AD, the patient should be evaluated for non‐AD causes of cognitive impairment.

3.3 Conducting a BBM test in primary or secondary care

The next step is to conduct a BBM test in either primary or secondary care (Figure 1, Step 3). This choice is driven by how comfortable the primary care HCP is in interpreting and disclosing BBM test results and associated wait times for specialty care. If the HCP is comfortable interpreting a BBM test, an AD BBM test for triaging can be ordered and conducted in primary care. Structural neuroimaging tests, such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, can also be ordered concurrently or sequentially if these resources are readily available. BBM tests are anticipated to become more accessible than structural imaging modalities, potentially leading to quicker availability of BBM test results. Consequently, some patients may choose to forego neuroimaging at this stage.

2 METHODS

The Alzheimer's Association convened a multi‐disciplinary DETeCD‐ADRD CPG expert workgroup composed of 10 voting members from primary care, specialty and subspecialty care, long‐term and palliative care, health economics, and bioethics, and retained a team from Avalere Health with expertise in developing clinical appropriate use criteria and practice guidelines. Staff from the Alzheimer's Association and Avalere teams supported the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG workgroup in developing the guideline through a formalized process modeled after that described in the American Academy of Neurology Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual, the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, ensuring that the process was transparent, that conflict of interest was managed appropriately, that the workgroup was composed of multidisciplinary experts who were engaged in all steps of the process, and that the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Recommendations and Report underwent external peer review by a group including a patient advocate (all in accordance with best practices described in the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust). Details of the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG developmental process and methods, summarized briefly here, can be found in supporting information.

The process included a systematic review of the published evidence focused on the diagnosis of MCI and dementia likely due to AD based on six PICOTS (patient population/intervention/comparator/outcome/timing/setting) framework questions formulated by the workgroup and was conducted and independently graded by the Pacific Northwest Evidence‐based Practice Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Of the initially identified 7374 potentially relevant articles, abstracts, and titles, 1908 articles underwent full‐text review, and 133 primary studies or systematic reviews met criteria for inclusion and assessment by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method. In aiming to place the evidence into a realistic clinical context, the workgroup also considered non–evidence‐based clinical experience‐informed factors including deductive inferences from accepted clinical principles; the relative value of the benefit compared to the risk of harm and burden of the action; the availability of the resources to perform the action; the cost of the action; and the availability of potentially effective alternative approaches, consistent with best practices in guideline development.

These tests are not intended to diagnose MCI or dementia, and a positive screening test result should lead to additional testing that can include blood tests, radiology examinations, and a medical and neuropsychological evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and determine its subtype.

Further investigative procedures

After comprehensive assessment, additional investigations can be considered to exclude other causes of cognitive decline or to support diagnosis of specific dementia subtypes. Echoing previous NICE guidance, the recommendation is that structural brain imaging should be used to rule out reversible causes of cognitive decline and to assist with subtype diagnosis, unless diagnosis and subtype are already clear. Further tests should only be considered if they would change management. The primary new recommendation in this section is that advanced imaging such as amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) should not be routinely used to make a diagnosis.

Accepting that there are situations where imaging or tissue biomarkers may be useful, best practice is to only consider these additional investigations after full clinical assessment and with discussion of potential risks and benefits. There is acknowledgment that evidence around efficacy of these tests is mixed. In terms of choice of test, two recommendations are reproduced directly from NICE guidance:

▪ If the diagnosis is uncertain and Alzheimer's disease is suspected, consider either: FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose-PET-CT), or perfusion SPECT (single-photon emission CT) if FDG-PET is unavailable or Examining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for: either total tau or total tau and phosphorylated-tau 181 and either amyloid beta 1–42 or amyloid beta 1–42 and amyloid beta 1–40.
▪ If a diagnosis cannot be made after one of these tests, consider using the other one.

The potential for a single gene disorder as a cause for dementia in small groups of patients is acknowledged, especially for those with frontotemporal dementia, early-onset Alzheimer's, Huntington's chorea or motor neurone disease features. Best practice is described as only considering genetic testing in individuals with age of onset less than 55 years, or with family history of dementia of same type in first or second degree relative. The guideline signposts to national and local genetic testing protocols and resources.

This article distills this information to provide a resource to support clinicians in the implementation of this approach in clinical practice. The companion articles provide context for primary care and specialty clinicians with regard to how to fit these instruments into the workflow and actions to take when integration of performance on these instruments with clinical profile and clinician judgment support potential cognitive impairment.

### Primary care practitioner perspectives on the role of primary care in dementia diagnosis and care [^2413b700]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Theme 1: PCPs' Role as First Point of Contact

PCPs generally felt that they were the first people in the health care system to identify patients' cognitive problems, whether by noticing something was wrong, such as a missed appointment or problems with medications, or when a family member or patient confided in them. They also felt they should be responsible for parts of the dementia evaluation and treatment, such as conducting a cognitive assessment, laboratory workup, seeking to delay the worsening of symptoms, and providing medications.

We're responsible for identifying people who have potential dementia and doing initial workup, so being able to do some sort of cognitive assessment tool whether it's us or some other staff in my clinic, and then do a basic lab workup and know when or not to order neuroimaging. And then referral and the supportive services that people need. I think the primary care clinic should be able to take on some of that whether it's through social work, behavioral health integration, or complex care management.

PCPs also understood the challenges patients with suspected dementia face navigating the health care system. However, the majority felt they needed confirmation of diagnosis from a specialist following a workup, even when they felt confident in their own diagnosis. Most expressed a desire to be more confident giving a diagnosis but felt that would require more training and time. PCPs overall reported minimal training in dementia (Table 1). Those who did have formal training reported exposure to content in medical school, residency, and through continued medical education courses, as well as using evidence-based resource support for point-of-care clinical decisions such as UpToDate.

Theme 2: PCPs' Trusting Relationships With Patients

Participants felt that PCPs were uniquely positioned to provide dementia care because of their trusting relationships with patients. They felt that the trust built through ongoing relationships enabled strong communication and helped decrease anxiety for patients in the face of a confusing and scary diagnosis. Many considered long-term relationships with their patients to be a privilege they valued highly.

I think trust is a big thing… dementia is a scary thing for patients. Having that core of trust in the relationship for established patients and being able to as a provider guide patients and caregivers through that… that's golden… To be able to leverage that in the care of patients with dementia… [i]t's a privilege… a real service that you can provide your patients.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Which patients might be considered for a referral to a specialist?

Some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. An evaluation by a specialist or a dementia subspecialist should be strongly considered if a patient presents with atypical cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, apraxia, agnosia), sensorimotor dysfunction (e.g. cortical visual abnormalities, movement or gait disorders), accompanying mood/behavioral disturbance (e.g. profound anxiety, depression, apathy, psychosis, or changes in personality), rapid progression, or fluctuating course (e.g. suggestive of potential superimposed delirium, LBD, or VCID; Figure 3). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing within weeks or months) are urgent medical problems requiring prompt examination, and in some cases, in‐patient evaluation and management. Patients with atypical forms of neurodegenerative dementias may have substantially different care and management needs and considerations regarding safety than patients with typical presentations of dementia due to AD. Delays in accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with atypical and young‐onset dementias may cause substantial distress, harm, and costs to patients, families, and society, especially when a patient is working and/or raising children at home.

3.4 Diagnostic test accuracy

The panel decided to use a brand‐agnostic approach to formulating recommendations due to the evolving nature of the field, but did synthesize evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of the selected tests versus selected reference standards in an associated systematic review.

Diagnostic test accuracy estimates across tests showed a high degree of variability. Notably, some tests did meet or exceed the panel's established thresholds, meaning a single cut‐point achieved the thresholds of 90% Sn and 75% Sp for triaging or 90% Sn and Sp for confirmatory testing. Across all 31 tests, pooled Sn ranged from 49.31% to 91.41%, and Sp ranged from 61.54% to 96.72%.

It is important to note that the panel evaluated only single cut‐point performance. Tests offering two‐cutoff approaches were not assessed due to limited peer‐reviewed evidence available. Summary of findings for all evaluated tests are reported in Table S2, and results of sensitivity analyses reported in Table S3. Full methodology and results are reported in the systematic review.

3.5 Certainty of the evidence of test accuracy

The certainty of the evidence for test accuracy across all tests ranged from moderate to very low, and for tests meeting the panel's predetermined thresholds for accuracy, certainty ranged from low to very low. Most tests were rated down due to serious issues of risk of bias, largely due to not using prespecified thresholds and/or not reporting whether index test results were interpreted without knowledge of reference test results and vice versa. Inconsistency and imprecision varied across tests for both Sn and Sp. Publication bias was not detected for any of the tests.

3.6 Desirable effects

The panel judged the desirable effects of using a BBM test to be large. Compared to current reference standards such as PET or CSF, BBM tests are minimally invasive and can significantly reduce the physical discomfort and anxiety often associated with lumbar puncture or PET imaging procedures. Additionally, blood testing may help streamline the diagnostic process, allowing for more timely identification of underlying AD pathology. This can lead to earlier clinical diagnosis, reduce delays between symptom onset and treatment initiation, and minimize the need for repeated consultations and referrals, thereby decreasing the burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system.

### Best practices for the interpretation and reporting of clinical whole genome sequencing [^31629ab8]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope of analysis and reporting

Test requisition and consent forms should clearly indicate that genetic variants relevant to any phenotype provided to the laboratory may be returned unless otherwise requested. Furthermore, in order to improve the precision of phenotype-driven analyses and variant reporting, it is recommended that the test ordering process enables physicians to specify the primary clinical question of interest. Laboratories should also consider giving patients the option to decline receiving information related to specific provided phenotypes (for example, a family history of early-onset dementia in a proband referred for an unrelated condition). However, we acknowledge that personalized reporting exclusions may be challenging. Pipelines that can dynamically integrate such preferences are desirable to accommodate these requests.

For trio or other multiple-family member sequencing approaches, consent forms should clarify how the data from auxiliary family members will be used and reported (i.e. is the parental data for a trio analyzed exclusively in the context of the proband, or might variants present only in the parents be analyzed and reported?). For reference, a sample WGS requisition form and a list of key elements of WGS consent is provided in the supplementary information (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Note 3).

Secondary and incidental findings

In the course of analyzing a patient's genome, variants expected to cause a disease unrelated to the primary indication for testing may also be identified. These unintentionally discovered variants are referred to as incidental findings (IF). Alternatively, laboratories may intentionally screen for disease-causing variants in a pre-specified set of genes that are unrelated to the indication for testing. This class of variants is referred to as secondary findings (SF). While IF and SF are generally intended to be medically actionable findings to justify their return, different approaches have been proposed to govern this process including guidance and recommendations from the ACMG, ClinGen, ESHG and other clinical and research programs –. Requisition and consent forms should clearly describe laboratory policies for SF analysis and SF and IF reporting. Ordering providers should review the laboratory's policy ahead of offering a WGS test to inform pre-test counseling, as there are significant differences in policy and practice across laboratories.

This summary focuses on recommendations, appropriate for any practice setting, forming core elements of a high-quality, evidence-supported evaluation process aimed at characterizing, diagnosing, and disclosing the patient's cognitive functional status, cognitive-behavioral syndrome, and likely underlying brain disease so that optimal care plans to maximize patient/care partner dyad quality of life can be developed; a companion article summarizes specialist recommendations. If clinicians use this guideline and health-care systems provide adequate resources, outcomes should improve in most patients in most practice settings.

2.8 When should FDG PET imaging be considered?

FDG PET is a measure of cellular glucose metabolism, which is usually reduced with particular patterns in patients with dementia due to AD, FTLD, LBD, and other neurodegenerative diseases, indicating synaptic dysfunction. As detailed in Recommendation 16, FDG PET may be considered in cognitively or behaviorally impaired patients in whom the etiological diagnosis is equivocal, when there is only an intermediate level of diagnostic confidence, or when having very high confidence in the etiological diagnosis is needed. Those may include individuals at very early clinical stages (e.g. early MCI) or those with atypical clinical presentations or syndromes. The interpretation of FDG PET images requires proficiency and clinical‐radiographic correlation; it is not always straightforward, and like other biomarkers, should incorporate pretest probability based on the clinical presentation and risk profile of the patient, and the possibility of multiple pathologies.

In 2004, CMS approved reimbursement of FDG PET for the purposes of differential diagnosis of AD versus FTLD. For differentiating AD versus FTLD, autopsy studies have shown that FDG PET has 80% to 99% sensitivity, 63% to 98% specificity, and 87% to 89.2% accuracy. For AD versus LBD, FDG PET has 70% to 92% sensitivity, 74% to 100% specificity, and 72% to 96% accuracy. The preponderance of high‐level evidence and consensus recommendations indicate that FDG PET adds value to the diagnostic workup of patients with MCI or dementia suspected of being due to neurodegenerative disease.

In symptomatic patients with AD (who are known based on biomarkers to have elevated brain amyloid and tau), the topography and magnitude of FDG PET abnormalities closely parallels the distribution and amount of tau pathology as measured by tau PET and atrophy as measured by MRI.FDG PET provides a topographic view of the extent of AD‐related neurodegenerative pathology that is useful for diagnosis and may also be useful for staging or prognosis. In addition, unlike the CSF or amyloid PET, FDG PET also offers the prospect of support for non‐AD "mimics" such as hippocampal sclerosisor TDP‐43 proteinopathy. On the other hand, amyloid PET and CSF amyloid/tau ratios (see next two sections) offer greater specificity than FDG PET for the biology of AD. Thus, FDG PET and CSF amyloid/tau ratios provide complementary information in some cases that increases confidence in diagnosis and prognosis.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^d6de1eae]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

At this stage, the panel has only considered individual biomarkers (including ratios that use a reference peptide as the denominator) rather than combinations of multiple biomarkers. The panel deliberately chose to focus on individual biomarkers initially to evaluate combinations in subsequent phases. The panel is aware that combinations of biomarkers, such as the p‐tau217/Aβ42 ratio or a fixed combination of Aβ42/Aβ40 and a p‐tau217 ratio, are being commercialized and provided to clinicians.

Because new BBM tests are continually becoming available to clinicians, the panel decided not to limit eligibility criteria to tests that were commercially available at the time of this review. As a result, the evidence base includes tests that may currently be commercially and not commercially available, including those that are clinically available, or for research use only.

Lastly, several studies have been published since our latest literature search update in November 2024. These newer studies were not included in the current analysis but will be considered for inclusion in future iterations of this guideline as part of ongoing efforts to ensure recommendations reflect the most up‐to‐date evidence.

Core element seven — diagnostic disclosure emphasizes that Recommendations 10 and 11 provide guidance regarding the seventh core element of the process — the communication of diagnostic findings and recommended management and follow-up care. The patient and care partner's understanding and appreciation of the illness — together with the clinician's judgment — should guide education, communication, and documentation of diagnostic findings and disclosure, and the clinician should honestly and compassionately communicate the name/stage of the syndrome and the disease causing it; treatment options and expectations; prognosis.

NIA-AA (National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer's Association) diagnostic criteria for dementia state that dementia is diagnosed when there are cognitive or behavioral symptoms that interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities, represent a decline from previous levels of functioning and performing, and are not explained by delirium or major psychiatric disorder; cognitive impairment is detected and diagnosed through history taking from the patient and a knowledgeable informant and an objective cognitive assessment; and impairment involves a minimum of two of the following domains: impaired ability to acquire and remember new information, impaired reasoning and handling of complex tasks with poor judgment, impaired visuospatial abilities, impaired language functions (speaking, reading, writing), or changes in personality, behavior, or comportment.

NIA-AA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia — diagnosis can be made when the patient "Meets criteria for dementia syndrome" and has "An insidious onset: symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days", with "Clear-cut history of worsening of cognition", and initial prominent deficits in an amnestic presentation or specified non-amnestic presentations. The amnestic presentation "is the most common syndromic presentation of AD dementia" with "impairment in learning and recall of recently learned information" plus another domain deficit, while non-amnestic variants include "Language presentation", "Visuospatial presentation", and "Executive dysfunction", each with additional domain deficits. The diagnosis "should not be applied" when there is evidence of substantial concomitant cerebrovascular disease, core features of dementia with Lewy bodies, prominent behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, prominent semantic variant or non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or another concurrent active disease/comorbidity/medication affecting cognition. "Biomarker evidence increases the certainty" that AD pathophysiology underlies the syndrome; if both amyloid-beta and neuronal injury biomarkers are present the "likelihood is high that dementia is due to AD", if either are absent it is "highly likely not due to AD", and if conflicting, likelihood is "intermediate".

RECOMMENDATION 18 — amyloid PET after CSF/imaging if uncertainty remains: If diagnostic uncertainty still exists after obtaining structural imaging with or without FDG PET and/or CSF Aβ42 and tau/p-tau, the dementia specialist can obtain an amyloid PET scan according to the appropriate use criteria to evaluate for cerebral amyloid pathology (Strength of Recommendation B).

Recommendation 11 — Communicating diagnostic findings — In communicating diagnostic findings the clinician should honestly and compassionately inform both the patient and their care partner of the specified elements using a structured process, including the name, characteristics, and severity of the cognitive–behavioral syndrome; the disease(s) likely causing the cognitive–behavioral syndrome; the stage of the disease; what can be reasonably expected in the future; treatment options and expectations; potential safety concerns; and medical, psychosocial, and community resources for education, care planning and coordination, and support services (Strength of Recommendation A). Diagnostic disclosure for patients with cognitive impairment presents important challenges and, in this case, the involvement of a care partner is critical, and the clinician should deliver the personalized education necessary for the patient and care partner to understand the diagnosis, its implications, and to develop the foundation for care planning.
