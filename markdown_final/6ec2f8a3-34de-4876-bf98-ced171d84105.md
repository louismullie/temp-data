## Question

How does encephalomalacia affect cognitive function in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how encephalomalacia affects cognitive function in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what encephalomalacia represents pathologically and how it differs from other white matter lesions. Then, I should verify the main etiologies in adults and the typical lesion patterns. Next, I will examine the mechanistic links between encephalomalacia and cognitive impairment, including network disconnection and secondary cortical effects. After that, I should review which cognitive domains are most commonly affected and why. Then, I will consider modifiers such as lesion size, location, laterality, and timing. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and management, and close with the strength of evidence and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the construct. Encephalomalacia literally means "softening of the brain" and reflects chronic liquefactive necrosis with cystic cavitation and tissue loss, typically evolving from infarction, hemorrhage, or severe traumatic injury. It is more destructive than many white matter hyperintensities and signals irreversible structural damage rather than reversible edema or demyelination, which is important for prognosis and mechanism of cognitive impact.

> I need to check the adult etiologies and patterns. In adults, encephalomalacia commonly follows ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or severe traumatic brain injury; it can also evolve from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the setting of cardiac arrest or critical illness, and occasionally from severe infections or inflammatory vasculopathies, with the final common pathway being focal parenchymal destruction and cavitation rather than diffuse small-vessel demyelination.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism. I initially thought encephalomalacia might act like confluent white matter hyperintensities, but wait, let me verify the distinction. WMHs often reflect small-vessel ischemia with demyelination and axonal loss and can impair processing speed and executive function via network disruption; however, encephalomalacia represents frank tissue loss with complete disconnection of tracts traversing the lesion, producing more severe and focal disconnection syndromes than typical WMHs, although both can degrade distributed cognitive networks [^1163wsPm] [^112j3voc] [^112t8XNP].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic pathways linking encephalomalacia to cognitive deficits. Direct destruction of white matter tracts interrupts long-range cortical–subcortical and interhemispheric connections, degrading network integration and producing domain-specific deficits tied to the lesioned circuitry; secondary cortical and subcortical atrophy can follow from deafferentation, compounding impairment beyond the lesion's borders, and these network-level effects are well described in focal injury models and tract-based studies of white matter damage [^112t8XNP] [^116QAWc8] [^1121WjPh].

> I will now examine which cognitive domains are most affected. Let me think about the evidence base. Executive dysfunction, slowed processing speed, and memory impairment are consistently reported after focal white matter injury and traumatic brain injury, with executive deficits particularly prominent when frontal-subcortical circuits are involved; language and visuospatial functions vary with lesion location, and global cognitive decline correlates with lesion burden and secondary atrophy, mirroring patterns seen in vascular cognitive impairment and TBI cohorts [^111Bs53P] [^112j3voc] [^116QAWc8] [^112Ln7uU].

> But wait, what if the lesion is small or in a "silent" area? Does it still matter? I should double-check the role of lesion size, location, and laterality. Larger lesions and those involving strategic hubs or long-range tracts (for example, anterior thalamic radiation, forceps major, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) exert disproportionate effects on attention, executive function, processing speed, and memory independent of total WMH burden; left-hemisphere lesions more often impair language, while right-hemisphere lesions more often impair visuospatial processing, and bilateral or multifocal lesions compound deficits via network-level disruption [^112AYzxR] [^112t8XNP] [^111Bs53P].

> I need to ensure I account for timing and age at injury. Earlier brain injuries tend to have more pervasive developmental consequences, but in adults, encephalomalacia superimposed on aging brains interacts with age-related white matter degeneration and atrophy, accelerating progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, adult-onset encephalomalacia can unmask or worsen executive dysfunction when frontal systems are involved, consistent with vascular cognitive impairment phenotypes [^1116EaeP] [^114TeQhv] [^111Bs53P].

> Let me consider clinical implications for diagnosis and attribution. I should confirm that MRI is the modality of choice to define encephalomalacia and its relationship to cognitive symptoms; standard protocols should include volumetric T1, T2/FLAIR, and T2✱-GRE to characterize cavitation, surrounding gliosis, and hemorrhagic components, and diffusion imaging can delineate tract disruption even when conventional sequences understate damage, aiding attribution of deficits to disconnection rather than solely to cortical atrophy [^112KmHrz] [^113Ts2hs] [^116QAWc8].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic considerations. The degree of tissue loss, involvement of strategic tracts, and presence of secondary cortical or thalamic atrophy predict worse cognitive outcomes. In contrast, isolated small lesions with preserved network hubs may show partial recovery or compensation, though encephalomalacia itself reflects irreversible structural loss, limiting the ceiling for spontaneous improvement and underscoring the importance of secondary prevention and rehabilitation planning [^112AYzxR] [^112t8XNP] [^114TeQhv].

> Next, I should review management principles. There is no disease-modifying therapy to reverse encephalomalacia, so care focuses on etiologic control, risk factor modification, and cognitive rehabilitation. Evidence for executive-function rehabilitation after acquired brain injury is mixed but guideline-concordant programs may improve functional independence, and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment guides individualized strategies and caregiver education, aligning with stroke and brain injury rehabilitation frameworks [^114sscq2] [^114sscq2] [^114Nk7SL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that encephalomalacia is simply a severe WMH. Let me reconsider and correct that. WMHs are typically patchy, often non-cavitating, and variably reversible in early stages, whereas encephalomalacia is cavitated, irreversible, and represents end-stage liquefactive necrosis. Both can impair cognition via network disruption, but encephalomalacia implies complete tract transection and greater disconnection severity, which helps explain more focal and sometimes more profound deficits when strategic tracts are involved [^1163wsPm] [^115NbzTY].

> In summary, encephalomalacia in adults impairs cognition primarily by destroying white matter tracts that integrate distributed brain networks, producing deficits in executive function, processing speed, and memory that scale with lesion size, location, and secondary atrophy. MRI confirms irreversible cavitation and tract injury, prognosis is guarded and location-dependent, and management centers on etiologic control and targeted rehabilitation, with the caveat that structural loss limits recovery potential compared with non-cavitating white matter disease [^112t8XNP] [^112AYzxR] [^112KmHrz] [^114sscq2].

Encephalomalacia in adults causes **cognitive deficits** via focal tissue loss and white matter disruption, with severity determined by lesion size, location, and laterality [^112t8XNP]. Common deficits include **executive dysfunction** (planning, inhibition, problem-solving), slowed processing speed, and memory impairment, especially when frontal, parietal, or temporal lobes are involved [^111Bs53P] [^116QAWc8]. Language and visuospatial deficits occur with left- and right-hemisphere lesions, respectively, and larger or bilateral lesions cause broader, more severe impairment. Cognitive decline is typically **irreversible**, though rehabilitation can help patients adapt and preserve function [^114sscq2].

---

## Cognitive domains affected by encephalomalacia

Encephalomalacia affects multiple cognitive domains, with the specific pattern depending on the **location and extent of brain tissue loss**:

| **Cognitive domain** | **Description of deficits** | **Brain regions involved** |
|-|-|-|
| Executive function | - Impaired planning <br/> - Problem-solving <br/> - Inhibition <br/> - Cognitive flexibility | - Prefrontal cortex <br/> - Anterior cingulate <br/> - Basal ganglia |
| Processing speed | Slowed information processing and reaction times | - Frontal lobes <br/> - Parietal lobes <br/> - White matter tracts |
| Memory | - Deficits in working memory <br/> - Episodic memory <br/> - And recall | - Temporal lobes <br/> - Hippocampus <br/> - Parietal lobes |
| Language | - Aphasia <br/> - Word-finding difficulties <br/> - Comprehension deficits | - Left frontal and temporal lobes (Broca's and Wernicke's areas) |
| Visuospatial skills | - Impaired spatial orientation <br/> - Construction <br/> - And navigation | - Right parietal and occipital lobes |
| Attention | - Difficulty sustaining attention <br/> - Selective attention deficits <br/> - And divided attention impairments | - Frontal lobes <br/> - Parietal lobes <br/> - Thalamus |

## Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment

Cognitive impairment in encephalomalacia arises from **several interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Focal tissue loss**: Direct destruction of cortical and subcortical structures disrupts neural circuits essential for cognition [^112t8XNP].

- **White matter disruption**: Damage to white matter tracts impairs communication between brain regions, leading to network dysfunction [^116QAWc8].

- **Secondary cortical atrophy**: Loss of subcortical white matter can cause secondary cortical atrophy, further exacerbating cognitive deficits [^1121WjPh].

- **Neuroinflammation and gliosis**: Chronic inflammatory responses and gliosis may contribute to ongoing neural dysfunction and cognitive decline [^1159vET7].

---

## Factors influencing severity of cognitive impairment

Several factors influence the **severity and pattern of cognitive impairment** in encephalomalacia:

- **Lesion size and location**: Larger lesions and those involving critical brain regions (e.g. frontal, temporal, parietal lobes) cause more severe cognitive deficits [^112Nxknu] [^112AYzxR].

- **Laterality**: Lesions in the dominant hemisphere (typically left) more profoundly affect language and executive function, while non-dominant lesions affect visuospatial and attentional processes.

- **Age at injury**: Younger adults may exhibit greater plasticity and potential for compensation, whereas older adults may experience more pronounced deficits due to reduced neuroplasticity and comorbidities [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Coexisting conditions such as vascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension can exacerbate cognitive impairment [^113Vd5uW].

---

## Clinical evidence of cognitive impairment

Numerous studies and clinical observations have documented cognitive impairment associated with encephalomalacia:

- **Executive dysfunction**: Patients frequently exhibit impaired planning, problem-solving, and inhibition, particularly with frontal lobe involvement [^111Bs53P].

- **Memory impairment**: Deficits in working memory, episodic memory, and recall are common, especially with temporal lobe involvement [^111Bs53P].

- **Processing speed**: Slowed information processing and reaction times are consistently observed, particularly with parietal and frontal lobe lesions [^notfound].

- **Language deficits**: Aphasia, word-finding difficulties, and comprehension deficits are typical with left hemisphere lesions [^notfound].

- **Visuospatial deficits**: Impaired spatial orientation, construction, and navigation are common with right hemisphere lesions [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and reversibility of cognitive impairment

Cognitive impairment resulting from encephalomalacia is **generally considered irreversible** due to permanent brain tissue loss. However, the brain's plasticity allows for some degree of compensation, particularly in younger individuals or those with smaller lesions. Cognitive rehabilitation, occupational therapy, and pharmacological interventions may help manage symptoms and improve functional independence, but complete recovery is rare [^113cHjHq].

---

## Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions

Accurate diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment in encephalomalacia involve a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI is the gold standard for identifying encephalomalacia and assessing lesion size, location, and extent of brain tissue loss [^113A5TuK].

- **Neuropsychological assessment**: Comprehensive neuropsychological testing is essential to evaluate specific cognitive deficits and guide rehabilitation planning [^114Nk7SL].

- **Cognitive rehabilitation**: Targeted cognitive rehabilitation programs can help patients develop compensatory strategies and improve daily functioning [^113cHjHq].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Medications may be used to manage specific symptoms such as attention deficits, memory impairment, or mood disturbances, although their effectiveness varies [^notfound].

---

Encephalomalacia in adults causes **cognitive impairment** through focal tissue loss and white matter disruption, with deficits in executive function, processing speed, memory, language, visuospatial skills, and attention. Severity depends on lesion size, location, and laterality, and impairment is generally irreversible, though rehabilitation can aid adaptation and functional preservation.

### White matter damage and cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury [^116QAWc8]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

White matter disruption is an important determinant of cognitive impairment after brain injury, but conventional neuroimaging underestimates its extent. In contrast, diffusion tensor imaging provides a validated and sensitive way of identifying the impact of axonal injury. The relationship between cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury and white matter damage is likely to be complex. We applied a flexible technique — tract-based spatial statistics — to explore whether damage to specific white matter tracts is associated with particular patterns of cognitive impairment. The commonly affected domains of memory, executive function and information processing speed were investigated in 28 patients in the post-acute/chronic phase following traumatic brain injury and in 26 age-matched controls. Analysis of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity maps revealed widespread differences in white matter integrity between the groups. Patients showed large areas of reduced fractional anisotropy, as well as increased mean and axial diffusivities, compared with controls, despite the small amounts of cortical and white matter damage visible on standard imaging. A stratified analysis based on the presence or absence of microbleeds (a marker of diffuse axonal injury) revealed diffusion tensor imaging to be more sensitive than gradient-echo imaging to white matter damage. The location of white matter abnormality predicted cognitive function to some extent. The structure of the fornices was correlated with associative learning and memory across both patient and control groups, whilst the structure of frontal lobe connections showed relationships with executive function that differed in the two groups. These results highlight the complexity of the relationships between white matter structure and cognition. Although widespread and, sometimes, chronic abnormalities of white matter are identifiable following traumatic brain injury, the impact of these changes on cognitive function is likely to depend on damage to key pathways that link nodes in the distributed brain networks supporting high-level cognitive functions.

### Alternative approaches to outcomes assessment: beyond psychometric tests [^116pMUoF]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Outcomes assessments in clinical trials involving cognition and behavior rely upon IQ and neuropsychological assessments. These procedures provide limited evaluations of everyday functions. Some participants cannot perform cognitive tasks because they are low functioning or may represent missing data because of inability to travel. Interview-based assessments of adaptive behavior yield results that reflect everyday functions and can be done by telephone regardless of level of cognitive functioning. The design of the neurobehavioral component of the follow-up study for the management of myelomeningocele fetal surgery trial is as an example of a clinical trial that incorporates these alternatives.

### Clinically asymptomatic vascular brain injury: a potent cause of cognitive impairment among older individuals [^113Vd5uW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular risk factors and stroke are highly prevalent with advancing age, and stroke may be more common than Alzheimer's disease, particularly among older men. While stroke mortality continues to decline, the prevalence of individuals with various vascular risk factors continues to rise and many are undiagnosed or undertreated. Asymptomatic cerebrovascular brain injury that includes asymptomatic brain infarction and white matter hyperintensities as well as accelerated brain atrophy is even more frequent than clinical stroke. Moreover, the impact of cerebrovascular risk factors on brain injury appears to begin in middle life and additively increases the likelihood of later life dementia. This review focuses on the use of neuroimaging and genetics to understand the impact of asymptomatic vascular risk factors on the trajectories of cognitive aging as well as incident cognitive impairment, stroke, and mortality. Results of this review emphasize the need for early detection and treatment of vascular risk factors to improve the cognitive health of our rapidly aging population.

### What are white matter hyperintensities made of? Relevance to vascular cognitive impairment [^114fmmdP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin, also referred to as leukoaraiosis, are a very common finding on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) in older subjects and in patients with stroke and dementia. They are associated with cognitive impairment, triple the risk of stroke and double the risk of dementia. Knowledge of their pathology derives mostly from post mortem studies, many from some years ago. These, by their nature, were generally small, sampled from selected brain regions and probably reflect late-stage disease. They focus on features of demyelination and axonal degeneration, which may be easier to detect histopathologically than changes in extracellular fluid. Here we review advances in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are revealing white matter hyperintensities at earlier stages, and changes in normal-appearing white matter that indicate tissue pathology, less marked than those found in WMH. These "pre-visible" changes show that altered interstitial fluid mobility and water content, which may be reversible, probably predate demyelination and axonal damage, which are less likely to be reversible and are probably a late-stage phenomenon. Neuroimaging is also revealing the dynamic nature of WMH, their interactions with other pathological features such as secondary cortical and long tract damage, and contribution to accumulating brain damage. These insights provide opportunities to improve understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of small vessel disease, and represents an enormous unfinished agenda for preventing accumulation of brain damage, and its associated cognitive and physical problems, from mid to later life. Recognizing the earliest stages leading to WMH development will provide important opportunities to prevent (or even reverse) brain damage due to small vessel disease at the earliest stages, and ameliorate its cognitive, physical, stroke and dementia consequences.

### Brain atrophy and progression from normal cognition to mild… [^114TeQhv]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The Kaplan-Meier survival curves are separately displayed for the groups with high and low levels of atrophy of the cortical gray matter and white matter and for those with high and low levels of enlargement of the ventricles and sulci. Shaded areas indicate 95% CIs for each group. Question What factors are associated with the acceleration of brain atrophy and progression to mild cognitive impairment based on long-term longitudinal data for individuals with normal cognition at baseline. The groups with high levels of atrophy in the white matter and enlargement in the ventricles had an earlier progression from normal cognition to MCI symptom onset. Significant differences were found between the participants with continued normal cognition and those with progression to MCI in age at baseline MRI scans, diabetes, and positivity of a low CSF Aβ42: Aβ40 ratio. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves visualized the estimated probability of progression from normal cognition to MCI for participants with high vs low rates of atrophy and enlargement of the regional brain volumes. The log-rank tests in the white matter and ventricles demonstrated earlier progression from normal cognition to MCI symptom onset in the groups with high levels of atrophy and enlargement compared with those in the groups with low levels of atrophy and enlargement. In line with this, some longitudinal studies32, 33 have shown that degeneration of the white matter started around 40 years of age and progressed with age-associated acceleration.

In addition to the results of these previous studies, the present longitudinal study demonstrated that individuals with higher change rates in the white matter volumes were more likely to develop onset of MCI symptoms over time. These findings highlight that white matter volume changes are closely associated with cognitive function in aging, suggesting that white matter degeneration may play a crucial role in cognitive decline. The authors are indebted to Karen Putnam, who provided documentation of the Geriatric Psychiatry Branch study procedures and the data files received from NIMH.

### The effects of the severity of periventricular leukomalacia on the neuropsychological outcomes of preterm children [^116zhxdY]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

This study investigates the developmental outcomes of preterm children according to severity of periventricular leukomalacia. One hundred preterm children with periventricular leukomalacia evident on brain magnetic resonance imaging and who had undergone neuropsychologic evaluation were selected. Intellectual disability was noted in 27.8% of the children with mild periventricular leukomalacia, 53.2% with moderate periventricular leukomalacia, and 77.1% with severe periventricular leukomalacia. The rates of major neurodevelopmental impairments such as cerebral palsy or intellectual disability were related to the severity of periventricular leukomalacia but not to gestational age or epilepsy. There were significant differences in the intelligence quotient (IQ) and social maturity quotient between 3 groups of periventricular leukomalacia. The performance IQ was significantly lower than the verbal IQ. Behavioral problems were noted in about one-third of the children but the rate was not related with the severity of periventricular leukomalacia. Our study revealed the significant associations between severity of periventricular leukomalacia and cognitive and social adaptive functions in the preterm children.

### Long-term neuroimaging follow-up of COVID-19-related leukoencephalopathy [^115NbzTY]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

More than a year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, long-term neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly being reported. The long-term sequelae of COVID-19-related leukoencephalopathy, however, remain unclear. Here, we present long-term neuroimaging follow-up in two cases of COVID-19-related leukoencephalopathy. The two cases demonstrate the utility of brain MRI for evaluating neurologic symptoms in critically ill patients with COVID-19, for diagnosis of underlying neural injury and prognostication of future recovery. The presence of leukoencephalopathy may result in chronic neurologic manifestations and may represent a poor prognosticator of neurologic recovery. The presence of leukoencephalomalacia on follow-up neuroimaging is potentially an indicator of irreversible white matter damage, which may be associated with more severe chronic deficits.

### Mechanisms underlying neurocognitive dysfunction following critical illness: a systematic review [^114SqXNs]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Included studies were anticipated to be exploratory and observational with multiple different hypothesised mechanisms; given the variation in reported outcomes, a meta‐analysis was not possible and therefore the data were synthesised in narrative format. The modalities used to identify potential mechanisms were discussed and grouped thematically, based on broad techniques used (such as biomarkers and neuroimaging) and subsets of these methods. Study results were categorised and assessed based on specific aetiologies underlying initial critical illness. Identified lesions on neuroimaging, changes from pre‐illness imaging or identified biomarkers and their reported associations with cognitive outcomes were pooled and discussed. No restrictions were placed on number of studies required for synthesis for investigating individual mechanisms.

### Long-term consequences: effects on normal development profile after concussion [^112ctPwP]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Each year in the United States, approximately 1.7 million people are diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), about 75% of which are classified as mild TBIs or concussions. Although symptoms typically resolve in a matter of weeks, both children and adults may suffer from postconcussion syndrome for months or longer. A progressive tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is believed to stem from repeated brain trauma. Alzheimer-like dementia, Parkinsonism, and motor neuron disease are also associated with repetitive brain trauma. Effective diagnoses, treatments, and education plans are required to reduce the future burden and incidence of long-term effects of head injuries.

### Brain volume abnormalities and clinical outcomes following paediatric traumatic brain injury [^113QJP3Z]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common, affecting between 42 and 280 per 100 000 children. It often causes long-term disability, although outcomes are difficult to predict. Persistent cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric problems are common, including impairments of memory, attention, executive function and emotional control. These can have a major impact on academic performance and quality of life. The impact of TBI evolves over many years and can interact in complex ways with normal childhood development. However, the remote effects of TBI can be overlooked as developmental changes can obscure the persistent effects of brain injuries. A failure to recognize the long-term effects of paediatric TBI is problematic as it can limit a child's access to appropriate healthcare and educational programmes, exacerbating the long-term effects of the injury. Hence, accurate methods to identify the degree and pattern of any significant brain injury are essential.

Neuroimaging is the main diagnostic tool for the evaluation of TBI. Brain injuries such as contusion and haemorrhage are usually readily apparent on routinely collected clinical imaging from CT and MRI, which is often acquired subacutely. These initial investigations provide useful and accurate information about the location and extent of many types of focal brain injury. However, diffuse injuries are not always apparent on standard imaging. This is particularly true for diffuse axonal injury, which is commonly produced by significant head injuries but is often missed on standard neuroimaging. Diffuse axonal injury is a key determinant of long-term clinical outcomes after TBI and can trigger progressive neurodegeneration. This may not be apparent on standard neuroimaging but can be assessed by measuring brain volumes using MRI. In adults, post-traumatic volume reductions in grey and white matter regions are seen in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, showing that brain atrophy also progresses for many years after TBI. This post-traumatic atrophy in adults is associated with cognitive impairment, such as reduced memory performance and behavioural problems.

### Brief overview and assessment of the role and benefits of cognitive rehabilitation [^117XH6xD]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Cognition is one of our most important attributes. Arresting its decline, whether in association with normal aging or a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, acquired brain injury, or dementia, concerns everyone, regardless of whether their role is that of spouse, child, or clinician. This article provides a brief, and by necessity, somewhat superficial appraisal of the status of our knowledge of the benefits of cognitive rehabilitation in these conditions and the authors' assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. In summary, there is support for the belief that participation in exercise as well as socially and cognitively stimulating activities (whether or not rehabilitative in nature) is beneficial for all but perhaps those with the most severe dementia. Focused efforts at cognitive training/rehabilitation also appear potentially helpful but are best established for those with acquired brain injury. There are, however, caveats to this assessment. For example, cognitive retraining is resource and time intensive while, even for those most likely to benefit, its impact on their daily activities and quality of life remains unclear. In addition, responses to training may vary from person to person and are likely to be influenced by factors such as an individual's acceptance of the need for assistance. Future research may benefit from continued efforts to treat the patient holistically, fit the treatment to those most likely to benefit, and encouraging the translation of training effects to functioning in the real world.

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^113jJEv1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease continuum — clinical staging (Table 6) defines seven stages with functional and cognitive criteria as follows: Stage 0 Asymptomatic, deterministic gene has no evidence of clinical change and biomarkers in normal range; Stage 1 Asymptomatic, biomarker evidence only has performance within expected range on objective cognitive tests with no evidence of recent cognitive decline or new symptoms; Stage 2 Transitional decline: mild detectable change, but minimal impact on daily function shows normal performance on objective cognitive tests with decline from previous level within the past 1 to 3 years that has been persistent for at least 6 months and individuals remain fully independent with no or minimal functional impact on activities of daily living (ADLs); Stage 3 Cognitive impairment with early functional impact has impaired/abnormal performance on objective cognitive tests with evidence of decline within prior year and individuals perform daily life activities independently but with detectable functional impact on some ADLs (may take more time or be less efficient but still can complete); Stage 4 Dementia with mild functional impairment shows progressive cognitive and mild functional impairment on instrumental ADLs with independence in basic ADLs; Stage 5 Dementia with moderate functional impairment shows progressive cognitive and moderate functional impairment on basic ADLs requiring assistance; and Stage 6 Dementia with severe functional impairment shows progressive cognitive and functional impairment with complete dependence for basic ADLs; a footnote notes that individuals with Down syndrome may not be fully independent even in stage 0 and that decline in functional independence from baseline may be a more appropriate indicator of stage.

### Does perinatal asphyxia impair cognitive function without cerebral palsy? [^114NB5ps]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2006). Low credibility.

Some studies on neurodevelopmental outcomes after neonatal encephalopathy have suggested that cognitive deficits do not occur in the absence of cerebral palsy. It is increasingly apparent that childhood survivors of overt neonatal encephalopathy may have cognitive impairments, even in the absence of functional motor deficits. The risk of cognitive deficits is related to the severity of neonatal encephalopathy and the pattern of brain injury on neuroimaging, particularly the watershed pattern of injury. A better understanding of the risk factors for cognitive abnormalities after neonatal encephalopathy will ultimately lead to interventions to prevent these deficits. Identifying the full spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes after neonatal encephalopathy will also allow care givers to identify children requiring early intervention to maximise their potential for independent function throughout development.

### Multimodal image analysis of clinical influences on preterm brain development [^113QzGkc]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in economically developed countries. 1 Preterm infants carry a profound risk of severe neurological disability along with a range of deficits across several domains, including cognition, motor coordination, and behavior. 2, 3 It is likely that long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes following preterm birth are predicated on early alterations to brain development, and the identification of modifiable risk factors at an early time point has the potential to improve continued clinical management in the preterm population. 4, 5

Preterm brain injury is a multifactorial disorder encompassing alterations to both cortical and subcortical gray matter, as well as white matter. 6 Quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) image (MRI) analysis has shown that, even in the absence of major focal destructive lesions, there are alterations across all tissue compartments following preterm birth, including: reduced white matter anisotropy 7; altered cortical volume and complexity 8, 9; tissue loss and microstructural disorganisation in the basal ganglia 10, 11; and ventricular enlargement. 12 The clinical significance of these observations is uncertain and clouded by the complex impact of genetic, environmental, and clinical factors. Aside from gestational age at birth, antenatal conditions, such as chorioamnionitis 13 and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) 14 and male sex, 15 familial factors, such as socioeconomic risk, 16 and postnatal clinical risk factors, including the need for respiratory support 17 and early nutrition, 18 have all been identified as potential risk factors in this population.

Most previous etiological research has focused upon the impact of specific neurological abnormalities: focal destructive brain lesions such as hemorrhagic parenchymal infarction (HPI) and periventricular leucomalacia (PVL). Although the clinical importance of focal lesions is well established, 19 the relative low incidence of HPI and PVL cannot explain the significant neurocognitive impairment observed in survivors of preterm birth. In contrast, diffuse MRI signal abnormalities are highly prevalent in preterm infants at term‐equivalent age, 19 but do not provide sensitive or specific prognostis of clinical outcomes. 20 It is clear that the current clinicopathological model of preterm brain injury is incomplete.

Selection of particular imaging markers a priori can bias observations and discards the rich data available from multiple imaging modalities. New approaches to data‐driven image analysis allow for nonsubjective analysis of multimodal data sets to discover new imaging markers and their relation to clinical events and outcomes.

### Motor and cognitive outcome after specific early lesions of the brain-a systematic review [^112tCBgS]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to study motor and cognitive outcome in infants with severe early brain lesions and to evaluate effects of side of the lesion, sex, and social economic status on outcome. A literature search was performed using the databases Pubmed and Embase. Included studies involved infants with either cystic periventricular leukomalacia (cPVL), preterm, or term stroke (i.e. parenchymal lesion of the brain). Outcome was expressed as cerebral palsy (CP) and intellectual disability (mental retardation). Median prevalence rates of CP after cPVL, preterm, and term stroke were 86%, 71%, and 29% respectively; of intellectual disability 50%, 27%, and 33%. Most infants with cPVL developed bilateral CP, those with term stroke unilateral CP, whereas after preterm stroke bilateral and unilateral CP occurred equally often. Information on the effects of sex and social economic status on outcome after specific brain lesions was very limited. Our findings show that the risk for CP is high after cPVL, moderate after preterm stroke, and lowest after term stroke. The risk for intellectual disability after an early brain lesion is lower than that for CP. Predicting outcome at individual level remains difficult; new imaging techniques may improve predicting developmental trajectories.

### Targeted suppression of claudin-5 decreases cerebral oedema and improves cognitive outcome following traumatic brain injury [^115ceBhc]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death in children and young adults globally. Malignant cerebral oedema has a major role in the pathophysiology that evolves after severe traumatic brain injury. Added to this is the significant morbidity and mortality from cerebral oedema associated with acute stroke, hypoxic ischemic coma, neurological cancers and brain infection. Therapeutic strategies to prevent cerebral oedema are limited and, if brain swelling persists, the risks of permanent brain damage or mortality are greatly exacerbated. Here we show that a temporary and size-selective modulation of the blood-brain barrier allows enhanced movement of water from the brain to the blood and significantly impacts on brain swelling. We also show cognitive improvement in mice with focal cerebral oedema following administration in these animals of short interfering RNA directed against claudin-5. These observations may have profound consequences for early intervention in cases of traumatic brain injury, or indeed any neurological condition where cerebral oedema is the hallmark pathology.

### Ideal cardiovascular health and cognitive aging in the Northern manhattan study [^114ShUMC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Participants were invited to return for a second neuropsychological assessment, with a mean time between the first and second neuropsychological assessments of 6 ± 2 years. For the changes in scores over time, composite scores for the changes in 4 domains were calculated by using regression‐based reliable change indices of the corresponding individual test, adjusting for age, education years, and the time interval between the 2 tests. 24

At the time of the first neuropsychological testing, a Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale was administered, and a score of ≥ 16 was considered positive for depressive symptoms. In addition, imaging was performed on a 1.5‐T MRI system (Philips Medical Systems) at the Hatch Research Center at the time of initial neuropsychological evaluation. Processing of magnetic resonance images to calculate white matter hyperintensity volumes and cerebral, lateral ventricular, and intracranial volumes and to identify MRI‐defined infarcts has been described previously. 25 Silent brain infarcts were rated as (1) cavitations of ≥ 3 mm in size on the fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery sequence (or similar characteristics on proton density and T2‐ and T1‐weighted sequences), distinct from a vessel (because of the lack of signal void on T2 sequence), and of equal intensity to cerebrospinal fluid in the case of lacunar infarction or (2) as superficial encephalomalacia affecting the cerebral cortex or cerebellum suggestive of thromboembolism.

### Long-range connections are more severely damaged and relevant for cognition in multiple sclerosis [^111NZFS5]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Relevance of long-range connections for cognition and brain function

It was also observed that damage in long-range connections (i.e. reduced white matter integrity) was more strongly associated with functional brain network than damage in short-range connections. These functional changes could arise from disrupted neuronal conduction due to damage to white matter tracts. Previous studies have already suggested that long-range connections may play an especially important role for the organization of functional brain modules. Our results might indicate that intact long-range connections are needed to maintain a functional network similar to that of healthy subjects. Furthermore, our findings indicate that cognitive impairment could be related to which extent long-range connections are damaged. A higher percentage of tracts affected by white matter lesions in long-range connections was the strongest predictor for cognitive dysfunction. This supports the hypothesis that especially long-range connections entail global integration and thus facilitate higher cognitive processes. Local integration entails specialized functional processing mediated by short-range connections, intrinsic to a module at any scale, whereas global integration subserves higher cognition, facilitated by long-range connections, such as extrinsic cortico-cortical connections. The stronger association between damage to long-range connections and structural network efficiency, functional network and cognition could also be explained by the fact that these longer connections are in the minority and therefore less redundant than short-range connections, which might explain the larger impact of connections that span larger distance. In addition to the explanations from the network-perspective, it could be that damage to long-range connections more closely reflects the overall level of multiple sclerosis-related damage, and thus is a better marker for diffuse damage compared to more localized heterogeneous damage. In this study, especially conventional measures of structural damage were examined, future studies are needed to investigate more advanced measures of structural damage, such as the effect of changes in specific tissue compartments (i.e. normal-appearing white matter fractional anisotropy, lesional fractional anisotropy, the effect of the severity of a lesion) and the effect of lesion orientation relative to the direction of the tract on network efficiency and clinical measures.

Based on our cross-sectional data, we can, unfortunately, only speculate about the order of events. Until now, computational modelling studies have investigated the influence of structural changes and functional brain changes, and vice versa. Future longitudinal in vivo studies are needed to investigate the temporal evolution of the involvement of short- and long-range connections, their interplay, and the impact on structural and functional network efficiency.

### Cognitive visual dysfunctions in preterm children with periventricular leukomalacia [^114wSBMX]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

Cognitive visual dysfunctions (CVDs) reflect an impairment of the capacity to process visual information. The question of whether CVDs might be classifiable according to the nature and distribution of the underlying brain damage is an intriguing one in child neuropsychology.

Method

We studied 22 children born preterm (12 males, 10 females; mean age at examination 8y, range 6–15y; mean gestational age 30wks, range 28–36wks) with periventricular leukomalacia, spastic diplegia, normal intelligence (mean Full-scale IQ 84; mean Verbal IQ 97; mean Performance IQ 74), and normal visual acuity, focusing on higher visual functions. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) were analysed to establish the presence of lesions along the primary optic pathway, in the occipitoparietal and occipitotemporal regions.

Results

Most children displayed an uneven cognitive profile, with deficits in visual object recognition, visual imagery, visual-spatial skills, and visual memory, and sparing of visual associative abilities, non-verbal intelligence, and face and letter recognition. Conventional brain MRI did not document major alterations of parietal and temporal white matter, or cortical alteration of areas involved in visual associative functions.

Interpretation

We suggest a widespread involvement of higher visual processing systems, involving both the ventral and dorsal streams, in preterm children with periventricular leukomalacia. The lack of major alterations on conventional MRI does not exclude the possibility of malfunctioning of higher visual processing systems, expressing itself through discrete CVDs. Possible mechanisms underlying these neuropsychological deficits are discussed.

Key points
- The effects of a moderate or severe TBI are different for each person and may change during recovery.
- Health problems that result from a moderate or severe TBI may be prevented or lessened.
- People with a moderate or severe TBI may experience chronic health problems. Signs and symptoms Most people with a moderate or severe TBI have one or more signs or symptoms after the injury. These may include: Thinking and Learning Difficulty understanding and thinking clearly Trouble communicating and learning skills Problems concentrating Difficulty remembering information Motor Skills, Hearing, and Vision Weakness in arms and legs Problems with coordination and balance Problems with hearing and vision Changes in sensory perception, such as touch.

Emotion/Mood Feeling more emotional than usual Nervousness or anxiety Feeling more angry or aggressive than usual Sadness, depression Behavior Trouble controlling behavior Personality changes More impulsive than usual. Long-term negative effects People with a moderate or severe TBI may experience chronic health problems.

### Cognitive outcomes in susac syndrome: a 2-year neuropsychological follow-up study [^112TvgdW]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This is the first prospective study to evaluate cognition in SuS over time and our data suggest normal cognitive functioning at a group level. Individual data showed interindividual variability, with most impairments being in attention, executive functioning and language. These improved after a 2‐year period, but patients only rarely performed normally in all cognitive domains over time. The high educational level of our patients, the treatment modalities and the activity of the disease, however, are factors that need to be taken into account. Patients reported significantly lower physical and mental well‐being, at the beginning of and throughout the disease course, emphasizing the importance of screening and treatment of these issues. Standardized multicentric testing is crucial to gain further insight into the impact of SuS on cognition.

### The relation between white-matter lesions and cognition [^1135Z4jX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent findings and developments in the field of the relation between white-matter lesions and cognition.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have provided further evidence that white-matter lesions exert a detrimental effect on cognitive profile. New magnetic-resonance techniques may help in clarifying the meaning and extent of this effect. Evidence is also increasing about lesion progression occurring over time, at least in patients with severe white-matter lesions, and this progression is one of the factors related to cognitive decline in the elderly. The need to delay or halt the progression of white-matter lesions has led to clarification of the role of some risk factors and to performance of therapeutic trials where white-matter lesions are used as a surrogate marker for the end point of small-vessel disease. In addition to cognitive effects, white-matter lesions have a role in the decline of other functional performances, and this places individuals with higher-grade lesions at increased risk of developing disability.

Summary

White-matter lesions cannot be considered as mere incidental findings, at least in patients who show severe lesions. The pathogenesis of white-matter lesions must be clarified further and strategies found to delay their progression.

### Towards the concept of disease-modifier in post-stroke or vascular cognitive impairment: a consensus report [^115rxr2N]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

International cohort-based consortia (Strokog or Metacohort) are sharing data on biomarkers (genetic, biological, neuroimaging) sampled in stroke patient cohorts with long-term follow-up to assess cognitive evolution. For example, the STROKDEM (Study of Factors Influencing Post-stroke Dementia; NCT01330160) and DEDEMAS (Determinants of Dementia After Stroke) studies are looking at biomarkers (neuroimaging, biological or genetic markers, endothelial function-derived factors) and interactions between vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms, with an emphasis on the impact of secondary prevention treatments. The Tel-Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort (TABASCO) trial, with up to 10 years follow-up after stroke, is focused on the association between predefined demographic, psychological, inflammatory, biochemical, neuroimaging, and genetic markers measured during the acute phase.

The relationship between stroke and cognitive disorders remains complex given that a stroke may induce cognitive impairment through several mechanisms that are often cumulative or synergistic; for example, (1) vascular brain lesions (infarcts or hemorrhages) can be symptomatic by themselves through a location in a strategic area in terms of cognitive functioning; (2) previous silent vascular lesions (leukoaraiosis, Binswanger leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds, silent infarcts, silent hemorrhages, atrophy) may contribute to the burden responsible for cognitive impairment through a cumulative effect or dysconnectivity; (3) accelerated evolution of pre-existing degenerative lesions through hypoxia mechanism; (4) direct effect of vascular or metabolic risk factors associated with stroke occurrence on cognitive functioning; (5) direct induction of neurodegeneration responsible for global or regional brain atrophy; (6) impairment of endothelium function and blood–brain barrier leakage; and (7) induction of neuroinflammation (Fig. 3).

### The effect of white matter lesions on cognition in the elderly – small but detectable [^112j3voc]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

The extent to which white matter changes affect brain function in elderly individuals is a matter for debate. Although there is a consensus that large confluent white matter lesions (WMLs) can be attributed to small-vessel disease and might denote anatomical damage to axons, the clinical effect of WMLs with regard to cognitive impairment is less certain. In this Review, we argue that WMLs are associated with greater detectable progressive cognitive deterioration than is normal aging, but other causes of progressive cognitive deterioration, such as Alzheimer's disease, are associated with greater cognitive decline than are WMLs. This view has important implications for the development of drugs for the treatment and prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia.

### Primary central white matter hypoplasia of the neocortex [^114XRk4z]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies, or diseases of the white matter, represent acute or ongoing damage to the oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system. Early childhood white matter disease is most commonly observed after hypoxic ischemic insults, with acute magnetic resonance imaging changes followed by atrophy or periventricular leukomalacia. Dysmyelination occurring in the setting of inborn errors of metabolism is characterized by progressive changes with high signal intensity in white matter on magnetic resonance imaging. This report presents a patient whose magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated hypoplasia of myelin in the telencephalon, without clinical or magnetic resonance imaging evidence of inflammatory dysmyelination. Clinical features included intractable seizures, severe hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features coupled with a static failure to gain developmental milestones. Together, the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings are evidence of a primary failure of myelination in the neocortex.

### Childhood brain insult: can age at insult help us predict outcome? [^1116EaeP]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Until recently, the impact of early brain insult (EBI) has been considered to be less significant than for later brain injuries, consistent with the notion that the young brain is more flexible and able to reorganize in the context of brain insult. This study aimed to evaluate this notion by comparing cognitive and behavioural outcomes for children sustaining EBI at different times from gestation to late childhood. Children with focal brain insults were categorized according to timing of brain insult, represented by six developmental periods: (i) Congenital (n = 38): EBI: first-second trimester; (ii) Perinatal (n = 33); EBI: third trimester to 1 month post-natal; (iii) Infancy (n = 23): EBI: 2 months-2 years post-birth; (iv) Preschool (n = 19): EBI: 3–6 years; (v) Middle Childhood (n = 31): EBI: 7–9 years; and (vi) Late Childhood (n = 19): EBI: after age 10. Groups were similar with respect to injury and demographic factors. Children were assessed for intelligence, academic ability, everyday executive function and behaviour. Results showed that children with EBI were at increased risk for impairment in all domains assessed. Furthermore, children sustaining EBI before age 2 years recorded global and significant cognitive deficits, while children with later EBI performed closer to normal expectations, suggesting a linear association between age at insult and outcome. In contrast, for behaviour, children with EBI from 7 to 9 years performed worse than those with EBI from 3 to 6 years, and more like those with younger insults, suggesting that not all functions share the same pattern of vulnerability with respect to age at insult.

### The impact of traumatic brain injury on later life: effects on normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases [^112qguP8]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

The acute and chronic effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been widely described; however, there is limited knowledge on how a TBI sustained during early adulthood or mid-adulthood will influence aging. Epidemiological studies have explored whether TBI poses a risk for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. We will discuss the influence of TBI and resulting medical comorbidities such as endocrine, sleep, and inflammatory disturbances on age-related gray and white matter changes and cognitive decline. Post mortem studies examining amyloid, tau, and other proteins will be discussed within the context of neurodegenerative diseases and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The data support the suggestion that pathological changes triggered by an earlier TBI will have an influence on normal aging processes and will interact with neurodegenerative disease processes rather than the development of a specific disease, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Chronic neurophysiologic change after TBI may have detrimental effects on neurodegenerative disease.

### White matter and cognition in traumatic brain injury [^1159vET7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability and produces a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences. The impact of TBI on cognition is among the most important questions in this field but remains incompletely understood. The immediate cognitive effects of concussion, while usually short-lived, may be profound and lasting in some individuals, and long-term sequelae of TBI may include dementia of several varieties including post-traumatic leukoencephalopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. Whereas the etiopathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction after TBI remains uncertain, a reasonable point to begin is a focus on the white matter of the brain, where the neuropathological lesion known as diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is routinely identified. White matter is not typically accorded the significance granted to cortical gray matter in discussions of cognitive dysfunction and dementia, but increasing evidence is accumulating to suggest that cognitive decline after TBI is a direct result of white matter injury, and that lesions in this brain component are crucial in the sequence of events leading ultimately to dementia of several types. In this review, we consider the topic of white matter and cognition in TBI, beginning with DAI and proceeding to the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction and dementia that can follow. A brief review of possible therapeutic options will also be offered, including the use of anti-inflammatory agents and the exploitation of white matter plasticity, to treat acute and post-acute injuries, and lower the incidence of dementia resulting from TBI.

### Cognitive impairment in adults with cancer (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^11363hr3]. NCI (2017). Low credibility.

- Impaired memory.
- Reduced concentration.
- Slower information processing.
- Reduced executive function. Subjective reports of cognitive impairment often do not correlate with the results of formal neuropsychological testing. In addition, the risk factors for subjective or objective cognitive impairment — such as age, preexisting cognitive function, type of cancer, type of chemotherapy, and the natural history of the impairments — remain a matter of active investigation. Although several domains were affected, the effect sizes were small. The affected domains included:

- Executive function.
- Memory.
- Verbal function and language skills. Insignificant effect sizes were observed for the following:

- Construction.
- Concept formation.
- Reasoning.
- Perception.
- Orientation and attention.

The authors noted a consistent but not universal trend of worse performance by patients who received chemotherapy compared with groups who received other types of treatment, received no treatment, or were healthy. Furthermore, longer time in treatment was associated with increased cognitive impairment, and longer time since completion of treatment was associated with cognitive improvement. Treatment with endocrine therapy was accompanied by deficits in verbal memory, verbal fluency, motor speed, attention, and working memory, but not psychomotor speed. However, findings were limited by the methodical heterogeneity of included studies and relatively short follow-up periods. P = 0.01; ES = 0. 34, P = 0.003) and executive function. In addition, compared with the exemestane group, the sequential group demonstrated ST decline on information processing speed and executive function and LT decline on verbal memory. The only significant effect detected was for visuomotor ability. There were no discernible negative effects on the other domains studied, which included the following:

- Attention/working memory.
- Executive functioning.
- Language.
- Verbal memory.
- Visual memory.
- Visuospatial ability.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease — MRI screening for silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) in HbSS or HbSβ0 thalassemia recommends at least a 1-time MRI screening, without sedation, for early-school-age children given the high prevalence in children (1 in 3); this is a strong recommendation based on moderate certainty in the evidence about effects (⊕⊕⊕◯). In adults with HbSS or HbSβ0 thalassemia, the panel suggests at least a 1-time MRI screening without sedation to detect SCI in these adults, which is a conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects (⊕⊕◯◯). The definition of a silent cerebral infarct–like lesion is an MRI signal abnormality at least 3 mm in 1 dimension and visible in 2 planes on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T2-weighted images (or similar 3-dimensional [3D] imaging) with no correlative neurological findings. After an infarct-like lesion is identified, the panel recommends neurological evaluation to assure lesions are classified as SCI rather than overt stroke; discussion of secondary prevention options including regular blood transfusions and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and cognitive screening assessment; and MRI surveillance every 12 to 24 months with discussion of the pros and cons of a step-up in therapy intensity if new infarcts are present.

### Tuberculous meningitis across the lifespan [^115u3pX9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS

Although this review cannot formally compare the differential risk of poor outcome between adults and children, poor outcomes in survivors appear to be more common in pediatric studies. This is consistent with the meta-analyses on treatment outcomes in adults and pediatric tuberculous meningitis, which found that neurological disability was present in 32% of adult survivors but 54% of pediatric survivors. In these studies, the mortality rates were similar, 23% in adults and 19% in children, but adult deaths were influenced by HIV coinfection (57% in patients with coinfection vs 16% in patients without HIV infection). Outcomes appear to be worse in children aged < 2 years and adults > 60 years, and factors that commonly contribute to poor outcome across the lifespan include brain infarcts and proxy markers of severe disease (like hydrocephalus, focal neurology, Glasgow Coma Scale, and perturbations in CSF parameters). Morbidity may improve with time.

Neurocognitive impairment and neurodevelopmental deficits are well reported in pediatric tuberculous meningitis, even when brain scans appeared normal. This may be influenced by age (greater vulnerability in younger children), likely reflecting critical stages of brain maturation and plasticity. Data on neurocognitive outcomes in adults are scarce. It seems that over half of surviving adult patients suffer cognitive impairments 6 months to 1 year after diagnosis. Similar to children, the main cognitive areas affected in adults are attention, executive function, working memory, and learning memory, with children also experiencing learning, attention, and behavior disorders. In adults and children, the cause of these impairments is likely cerebrovascular complications and infarction. The long-term consequences of these deficits are challenging for all patients, but the lifelong implications for children are greatest. The cumulative impact of the enduring need for special schooling and rehabilitation that frequently outstrips access and resources can present a much heavier burden for patient and family. There is a lack of standardization in the measurement of treatment outcomes; however, numerous age-appropriate tools have been recommended.

### Heterogeneity of white matter astrocytes in the human brain [^116aKzWU]. Acta Neuropathologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes regulate central nervous system development, maintain its homeostasis and orchestrate repair upon injury. Emerging evidence support functional specialization of astroglia, both between and within brain regions. Different subtypes of gray matter astrocytes have been identified, yet molecular and functional diversity of white matter astrocytes remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, their important and diverse roles in maintaining white matter integrity and function are well recognized. Compelling evidence indicate that impairment of normal astrocytic function and their response to injury contribute to a wide variety of diseases, including white matter disorders. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of astrocyte heterogeneity in the white matter of the mammalian brain and how an interplay between developmental origins and local environmental cues contribute to astroglial diversification. In addition, we discuss whether, and if so, how, heterogeneous astrocytes could contribute to white matter function in health and disease and focus on the sparse human research data available. We highlight four leukodystrophies primarily due to astrocytic dysfunction, the so-called astrocytopathies. Insight into the role of astroglial heterogeneity in both healthy and diseased white matter may provide new avenues for therapies aimed at promoting repair and restoring normal white matter function.

### White matter damage and cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury [^114mCRyT]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury often results in persistent disability, due particularly to cognitive impairments. Most survivors are young and have near-normal life expectancy. Hence, the burden on public health and social care is substantial. The cognitive domains of memory, executive function and processing speed are commonly affected. Despite much previous work, the underlying pathophysiology of these persistent impairments remains poorly understood.

Although focal brain injury often occurs as a result of traumatic brain injury, in many cases, the location and extent of this injury does not fully explain the patient's cognitive problems. This is likely to be because damage to brain connectivity is a critical factor in the development of cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury. Functions commonly impaired, such as memory and executive functions, depend on the coherent activity of widely distributed brain networks. 'Nodes' in these networks are connected by long white matter tracts that may be damaged in traumatic brain injury as a result of diffuse axonal injury. The pathology of diffuse axonal injury has been investigated in some detail, but, until recently, it has been difficult to study the location and extent of this damage, or its functional consequences in vivo.

Conventional CT and standard MRI underestimate the extent of white matter damage after traumatic brain injury. Standard MRI of traumatic brain injury includes the use of gradient-echo imaging that allows the identification of microbleeds. These are surrogate markers of diffuse axonal injury and their presence is associated with persistent cognitive impairment. However, pathological studies often show more extensive axonal damage, which is unlikely to be fully reflected in focal microbleed signal abnormalities.

Recently, it has become possible to study white matter damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI;). In the tensor model, DTI data are used to estimate the amount of water diffusion in a number of directions at each point (voxel) in the image. From this, metrics such as fractional anisotropy can be derived to quantify the degree of white matter disruption. Greater anisotropy, as indicated by a higher fractional anisotropy value, is believed to reflect more coherent tissue structure, whilst increased diffusivity suggests tissue damage. Experimental models of axonal damage and demyelination have implicated axial and radial diffusivities as potential biomarkers of axonal and myelin loss, respectively (e.g.;). Changes in fractional anisotropy persist after traumatic brain injury and predict functional outcome over and above patients' initial clinical state or focal lesion load.

### Assessing dysfunction using refined cognitive methods [^1159H923]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

Instruments currently being used to assess cognitive dysfunction do not grant us the granularity to pinpoint the specific cognitive impairments associated with various disorders. With the advent of sophisticated neuroimaging methods and lesion data, we are in a better position to understand the component processes of the various psychological functions. Here we describe 2 such functions and elucidate how the same refined cognitive methods that are being used to understand the processes underlying these functions can be applied to exploring dysfunctions associated with various psychological disorders.

### Cognitive outcomes in susac syndrome: a 2-year neuropsychological follow-up study [^111Gd8x1]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The major strength of this study is that all studies up until now only cross‐sectionally investigated cognition in SuS but did not monitor cognition over time. Furthermore, this study is only the second prospective study to examine neuropsychological functioning in a larger group of patients with SuS, whereas previous articles reported individual case studies. Another strength is the extensiveness of the neuropsychological test battery used in our study.

Our study also has limitations. First, patients with a high educational level and therefore a larger cognitive reserve were overrepresented. Second, the majority of our patients had inactive disease, both at baseline and follow‐up testing. This, in combination with a relatively short time between the two assessments, might explain why the cognitive impact and change over time was relatively small. Thirdly, we did not control for a possible effect of mood disorders on cognition.

Scientific and clinical implications

Future studies should include a larger sample size with different types of educational level and should monitor cognition over a period longer than 2 years, including cognitive evaluation during and in‐between relapses. In addition, the association with the intensity and type of treatment should be further investigated to explore whether this has a potential effect on cognition. It is also important to look at the association with the location and severity of structural brain lesions and atrophy and investigate whether there is an association with the presence of mood disorders.

Due to the rarity of SuS, collecting larger cognitive datasets is only possible by standardization of a cognitive battery to be applied in several centers. Consensus on a minimal and feasible cognitive battery in SuS is needed. Systematic and standardized cognitive and neuropsychiatric testing may be necessary for adequate intervention (e.g. cognitive rehabilitation and psychological guidance). Based on our current and previous research, emphasis on processing speed, executive functioning and language are key in this standard battery.

Experience from cohort observations suggest that systemic inflammation, as frequently experienced during COVID‐19 infection, is associated with subsequentcognitive declineand also results in persisting EEG changes and hippocampal atrophy. Many systemic infections and associated inflammation can result in acute, rapidly changing episodes of delirium. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, disorientation, memory complaints, impairments in consciousness and hallucinations. Approximately 30% of seniors over the age of 65 admitted to emergency care due to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection experience delirium. Delirium is the sixth most common COVID‐19 symptom experienced, and is so common that it should be included among diagnostic criteria. The presence of delirium increases requirements for ICU placement and death as an outcome. Importantly, approximately one‐third of these patients do not express typical respiratory symptoms. Delirium is also a harbinger of long‐term cognitive consequences, such as increased risk for developing AD. Delirium can induce more rapid decline in patients with preexisting dementia. Thus, COVID‐19 can have adverse effects on cognition secondary to the extreme inflammatory events associated with infections, especially in older patients.

Another significant finding from people dying from COVID‐19 is the increased degree of thrombosis. This primarily impacts lung tissue, but can include other organs such as liver, heart and the brain, where the thromboembolism can cause a stroke. Clearly this can add to other dementia‐inducing pathologies to both accelerate the course of cognitive impairment in those already diagnosed and increase subsequent risk.

Thus, it is critical to ascertain whether infection with SARS‐CoV2 increases the risk of subsequent, long‐term cognitive decline and/or accelerates the onset or progression of AD and AD‐related dementias. We must develop an understanding of short‐ and long‐term cognitive sequelae that contribute to decreased quality of life and cost to society, especially in diverse populations. If even a fraction of COVID‐19 infected individuals experience increased risk, there would be a great increase in cognitive decline and/or AD in the future. In this roadmap, we discuss research knowledge gaps and highlight strategies to help mitigate the effects of COVID‐19 on the brain, particularly in at‐risk populations.

### Novel neuroimaging evidence of brain lesions following transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111eCARf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

There was no clinical stroke or transient ischemic attack detected after TAVR. Cognitive assessments remained stable in the majority of patients although 4 demonstrated declines in 1 to 2 tests.

Nine patients underwent follow‐up MRI at a median of 89 (IQR, 45–201) days following TAVR. SWI lesions detected on day 6 showed no change in 6 patients, while 3 (33.3%) showed progressive change with an additional new SWI lesion compared with the post‐procedural MRI scan. Ischemic lesions remained stable in 4 of 9 patients (44.4%) and receded in others (encephalomalacia, n = 3; size reduction, n = 1; undetectable, n = 5).

This study presents novel evidence about a previously overlooked type of brain lesion after TAVR. Although intra‐patient spatial overlap may limit the determination of some lesions, we demonstrated that new SWI lesions can be identified in all patients after TAVR and seem to be more prevalent than ischemic lesions. SWI lesions had a different topological distribution of the brain from ischemic lesions. SWI lesions after TAVR remained unchanged during follow‐up (with moderate progression in some patients) whilst ischemic lesions frequently resolved. If the underlying entity is microbleeds, it is noteworthy that brain microbleeds have been associated with cerebrovascular events and even increased mortality. Our findings suggest the need of further evaluation on micro‐hemorrhagic events post‐TAVR and possible clinical sequalae, as patient management (eg, antithrombotic therapy) might need improvements.

### Brain networks under attack: robustness properties and the impact of lesions [^112t8XNP]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

A growing number of studies approach the brain as a complex network, the so-called 'connectome'. Adopting this framework, we examine what types or extent of damage the brain can withstand-referred to as network 'robustness'-and conversely, which kind of distortions can be expected after brain lesions. To this end, we review computational lesion studies and empirical studies investigating network alterations in brain tumour, stroke and traumatic brain injury patients. Common to these three types of focal injury is that there is no unequivocal relationship between the anatomical lesion site and its topological characteristics within the brain network. Furthermore, large-scale network effects of these focal lesions are compared to those of a widely studied multifocal neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, in which central parts of the connectome are preferentially affected. Results indicate that human brain networks are remarkably resilient to different types of lesions, compared to other types of complex networks such as random or scale-free networks. However, lesion effects have been found to depend critically on the topological position of the lesion. In particular, damage to network hub regions-and especially those connecting different subnetworks-was found to cause the largest disturbances in network organization. Regardless of lesion location, evidence from empirical and computational lesion studies shows that lesions cause significant alterations in global network topology. The direction of these changes though remains to be elucidated. Encouragingly, both empirical and modelling studies have indicated that after focal damage, the connectome carries the potential to recover at least to some extent, with normalization of graph metrics being related to improved behavioural and cognitive functioning. To conclude, we highlight possible clinical implications of these findings, point out several methodological limitations that pertain to the study of brain diseases adopting a network approach, and provide suggestions for future research.

### The impact of traumatic brain injury on neurocognitive outcomes in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qZPun]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the burden of paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) on neurocognition via a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Studies that compared neurocognitive outcomes of paediatric patients with TBI and controls were searched using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, between January 1988 and August 2019. We presented a random-effects model, stratified by TBI severity, time of assessment post injury and age.

Results

Of 5919 studies, 41 (patients = 3717) and 33 (patients = 3118) studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Studies mostly measured mild TBI (n = 26, patients = 2888) at 0–3 months postinjury (n = 17, patients = 2502). At 0–3 months postinjury, standardised mean differences between TBI and controls for executive function were -0.04 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.07; I² = 0.00%), -0.18 (95% CI -0.29 to -0.06; I² = 26.1%) and -0.95 (95% CI -1.12 to -0.77; I² = 10.1%) for mild, moderate and severe TBI, respectively; a similar effect was demonstrated for learning and memory. Severe TBI had the worst outcomes across all domains and persisted > 24 months postinjury. Commonly used domains differed largely from workgroup recommendations. Risk of bias was acceptable for all included studies.

Conclusion

A dose-dependent relationship between TBI severity and neurocognitive outcomes was evident in executive function and in learning and memory. Cognitive deficits were present for TBIs of all severity but persisted among children with severe TBI. The heterogeneity of neurocognitive scales makes direct comparison between studies difficult. Future research into lesser explored domains and a more detailed assessment of neurocognitive deficits in young children are required to better understand the true burden of paediatric TBI.

Neuropsychological evaluation for differential diagnosis: Psychologists, using specialized neuropsychological tests, assess cognitive and behavioral changes and distinguish typical changes from early signs of neuropathology. Neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remains the most effective differential diagnostic methods for discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression related, and other related disorders. Although biomarkers are used broadly in research and some clinical settings, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing are necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and response to disease-modifying therapies, and while biomarkers can detect the underlying neuropathologic changes, cognitive testing is necessary to determine how the disease is impacting one's functioning.

2.3 Sex differences

Risks and effects of cardiovascular disease differ greatly between males and females. Premenopausal women appear to have fewer strokes than age-matched men; however, rate and severity of strokes in postmenopausal women surpasses those of age-matched men. There is evidence that the regional distribution and contributing risk factors to WMH differs among older men and women and that WMH is more common in women. The impact of sex on risks and effects of cardiovascular disease might be attributed to sex-specific conditions, for example, pregnancy or menopause; a disproportionate effect of a disease or condition on one sex; and distinct causes, manifestations, outcomes, or treatments that are sex dependent.

2.4 Head injury

Acute and chronic traumatic encephalopathies (CTEs) as a result of one or more incidents of traumatic brain injury are gaining public and scientific notice as significant contributors to cognitive impairment and dementia. Following an acute insult, there can be severe vascular pathology including contusions, intracerebral hemorrhage, and vasoconstriction in response to blood products. Even in "closed head" injuries in which the skull remains intact or mild head trauma without readily apparent brain damage, there is injury to the vasculature and meninges due to the strain exerted on them by the impact. The study of pathologies ensuing from head injuries is evolving; current and future work will attempt to characterize the epidemiology, in vivo biomarkers, and pathologies of various types of traumatic brain injuries. Although criteria for staging of CTE are still in progress, CTE pathology is being recognized largely as accumulation of tau pathology at the depths of the sulci and perivascularly, suggesting a connection between insult to vasculature and subsequent tauopathy. Work has also begun to investigate possible therapeutic targets in the secondary immune reactions following vascular injury to ameliorate symptoms and progression of pathology.

### Thalamic changes in a preterm sample with periventricular leukomalacia: correlation with white-matter integrity and cognitive outcome at school age [^1145qPc8]. Pediatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thalamic abnormalities have been well documented in preterms with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), although their contribution to long-term cognitive dysfunctions has not been thoroughly investigated.

Results

Significant differences between groups were observed for global thalamic volume. Neuropsychological assessments showed that preterms with PVL scored within the normal range, although significantly below controls in the full intelligence quotient and the specific cognitive domains of processing speed and working memory. Correlations of several thalamic regions with Working Memory Index and FIQ were found in the PVL group. Moreover, thalamic atrophy correlated with white-matter (WM) damage indexes (fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity) assessed by diffusion tensor imaging.

Discussion

The findings suggest that thalamic damage is a common correlate of WM microstructural alterations and might be involved in the cognitive deficits seen in premature infants with PVL at school age.

Methods

We analyzed the impact of PVL-associated thalamic injury on cognitive status at school age and its correlation with WM integrity as measured by magnetic resonance imaging techniques. Thalamic volume and shape of 21 preterm children with PVL were compared with those of 11 preterm children of similar gestational age and birth weight with no evidence of focal WM abnormality.

### Cognitive dysfunction after isolated brain stem insult. An underdiagnosed cause of long term morbidity [^112Se18x]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction adversely influences long term outcome after cerebral insult, but the potential for brain stem lesions to produce cognitive as well as physical impairments is not widely recognised. This report describes a series of seven consecutive patients referred to a neurological rehabilitation unit with lesions limited to brain stem structures, all of whom were shown to exhibit deficits in at least one domain of cognition. The practical importance of recognising cognitive dysfunction in this group of patients, and the theoretical significance of the disruption of specific cognitive domains by lesions to distributed neural circuits, are discussed.

Clinical observations and the more or less systematic use of various test methods have led to broadly defined concepts of the areas of mental functioning which are disturbed as a result of brain injury. Departing from these concepts many "brain injury tests" have been designed with the aim of diagnosing the existence of a brain injury or measuring the degree of intellectual deterioration in brain injury cases. The observation that the ability to solve problems on an "abstract level" is often highly impaired has been utilized for the construction of some tests, e.g., by Goldstein and Scheerer17 and Grassi. 20 As memory disturbances of different kinds are often observed, memory tests have been used as diagnostic tools.

### Strategic white matter hyperintensity locations for cognitive impairment: a multicenter lesion-symptom mapping study in 3525 memory clinic patients [^112AYzxR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Impact of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on cognition likely depends on lesion location, but a comprehensive map of strategic locations is lacking. We aimed to identify these locations in a large multicenter study.

Methods

Individual patient data (n = 3525) from 11 memory clinic cohorts were harmonized. We determined the association of WMH location with attention and executive functioning, information processing speed, language, and verbal memory performance using voxel-based and region of interest tract-based analyses.

Results

WMH in the left and right anterior thalamic radiation, forceps major, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were significantly related to domain-specific impairment, independent of total WMH volume and atrophy. A strategic WMH score based on these tracts inversely correlated with performance in all domains.

Discussion

The data show that the impact of WMH on cognition is location-dependent, primarily involving four strategic white matter tracts. Evaluation of WMH location may support diagnosing vascular cognitive impairment.

Highlights

We analyzed white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in 3525 memory clinic patients from 11 cohorts The impact of WMH on cognition depends on location We identified four strategic white matter tracts A single strategic WMH score was derived from these four strategic tracts The strategic WMH score was an independent determinant of four cognitive domains.

### Rehabilitation of executive function in chronic paediatric brain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^112zjhYX]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Paediatric acquired brain injuries (pABIs), either traumatic brain injury (TBI) or non-traumatic (e.g. tumour, cerebrovascular accident, infection) are leading causes of childhood morbidity, mortality, and acquired disability. As pABI occurs during crucial brain development, the consequences go beyond the immediate brain injury, affecting social competence, behavioural functioning, and cognition. Indeed, executive dysfunction represents one of the most common and disturbing cognitive symptoms after pABI. Executive function (EF) refers to cognitive processes responsible for purposeful, goal-directed behaviour, operationalized in terms of three interrelated core processes: (a) updating (adding relevant and omitting non-relevant information from working memory), (b) shifting (switching between task sets), and (c) inhibition (suppressing or resisting pre-potent responses). Executive dysfunction has a substantial global negative impact on everyday life. Despite this, there is no consensus regarding cognitive rehabilitation of EF following pABI.

### Abnormal microstructure of the atrophic thalamus in preterm survivors with periventricular leukomalacia [^112mfh8C]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The neuroanatomic substrate of cognitive deficits in long-term survivors of prematurity with PVL is poorly understood. The thalamus is critically involved in cognition via extensive interconnections with the cerebral cortex. We hypothesized that the thalamus is atrophic (reduced in volume) in childhood survivors of prematurity with neuroimaging evidence of PVL and that the atrophy is associated with selective microstructural abnormalities within its subdivisions.

Materials and Methods

We performed quantitative volumetric and DTI measurements of the thalamus in 17 children with neuroimaging evidence of PVL (mean postconceptional age, 5.6 ± 4.0 years) who were born prematurely and compared these with 74 term control children (5.7 ± 3.4 years).

Results

The major findings were the following: 1) a significant reduction in the overall volume of the thalamus in patients with PVL compared with controls (P < .0001), which also correlated with the severity of PVL (P = 0.001); 2) significantly decreased FA (P = 0.003) and increased λ(⊥) (P = 0.02) in the thalamus overall and increased axial, radial, and mean diffusivities in the pulvinar (P < .03), suggesting injury to afferent and efferent myelinated axons; and 3) a positive correlation of pulvinar abnormalities with those of the parieto-occipital white matter in periventricular leukomalacia, suggesting that the pulvinar abnormalities reflect secondary effects of damaged interconnections between the pulvinar and parieto-occipital cortices in the cognitive visual network.

Conclusions

There are volumetric and microstructural abnormalities of the thalamus in preterm children with PVL, very likely reflecting neuronal loss and myelinated axonal injury. The selective microstructural damage in the pulvinar very likely contributes to abnormal cognitive visual processing known to occur in such survivors.

### Adults with mild-to-moderate congenital heart disease demonstrate measurable neurocognitive deficits [^112Utegw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive differences and developmental delay are recognized complications of congenital heart disease (CHD), detectable in school‐aged children with persistence into adolescence. 1, 2, 3 A diverse set of risk factors for neurocognitive deficits in children are well described, including perinatal risk factors, cyanosis, hypoperfusion, and perioperative complications that may manifest as impaired myelination and white‐matter brain injury in up to 50% of neonates with repaired CHD. 4, 5 The severity of neurological impairment is directly correlated with the complexity of CHD, with the most severe deficits observed in individuals with single ventricle defects. 6

With increasing survivorship to adulthood, individuals with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) have been observed to have an increased risk for depression, post‐traumatic stress disorder, decreased quality of life, and neurodegenerative disease. 1, 7 Previously, we have shown a substantially increased burden of cardiovascular risk and disease in a small subset of individuals with ACHD among a large British cohort study of volunteers. 8 While the deleterious effects of acquired cardiovascular disease on neurocognitive functioning in normal adults have previously been reported, 9, 10 data on the neurocognitive effects in the ACHD population are minimal. Here we report the performance of individuals with mild‐to‐moderate ACHD on 6 neurocognitive tests and specifically examine the impact of acquired cardiovascular disease upon these outcomes.

### Limitations on the developing preterm brain: impact of periventricular white matter lesions on brain connectivity and cognition [^111qkdfE]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Brain lesions to the white matter in peritrigonal regions, periventricular leukomalacia, in children who were born prematurely represent an important model for studying limitations on brain development. The lesional pattern is of early origin and bilateral, that constrains the compensatory potential of the brain. We suggest that (i) topography and severity of periventricular lesions may have a long-term predictive value for cognitive and social capabilities in preterm birth survivors; and (ii) periventricular lesions may impact cognitive and social functions by affecting brain connectivity, and thereby, the dissociable neural networks underpinning these functions. A further pathway to explore is the relationship between cerebral palsy and cognitive outcome. Restrictions caused by motor disability may affect active exploration of surrounding and social participation that may in turn differentially impinge on cognitive development and social cognition. As an outline for future research, we underscore sex differences, as the sex of a preterm newborn may shape the mechanisms by which the developing brain is affected.

### Cognitive rehabilitation for executive dysfunction in adults with stroke or other adult non-progressive acquired brain damage [^111Wdvwe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Executive functions are the controlling mechanisms of the brain and include the processes of planning, initiation, organisation, inhibition, problem solving, self monitoring and error correction. They are essential for goal-oriented behaviour and responding to new and novel situations. A high number of people with acquired brain injury, including around 75% of stroke survivors, will experience executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction reduces capacity to regain independence in activities of daily living (ADL), particularly when alternative movement strategies are necessary to compensate for limb weakness. Improving executive function may lead to increased independence with ADL. There are various cognitive rehabilitation strategies for training executive function used within clinical practice and it is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these interventions.

Objectives

To determine the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on executive dysfunction for adults with stroke or other non-progressive acquired brain injuries.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, August 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012), EMBASE (1980 to August 2012), CINAHL (1982 to August 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to August 2012), AMED (1985 to August 2012) and 11 additional databases. We also searched reference lists and trials registers, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials in adults after non-progressive acquired brain injury, where the intervention was specifically targeted at improving cognition including separable executive function data (restorative interventions), where the intervention was aimed at training participants in methods to compensate for lost executive function (compensative interventions) or where the intervention involved the training in the use of an adaptive technique for improving independence with ADL (adaptive interventions). The primary outcome was global executive function and the secondary outcomes were specific components of executive function, working memory, ADL, extended ADL, quality of life and participation in vocational activities. We included studies in which the comparison intervention was no treatment, a placebo intervention (i.e. a rehabilitation intervention that should not impact on executive function), standard care or another cognitive rehabilitation intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials. We undertook an assessment of methodological quality for allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, method of dealing with missing data and other potential sources of bias.

Main Results

Nineteen studies (907 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review. We included 13 studies (770 participants) in meta-analyses (417 traumatic brain injury, 304 stroke, 49 other acquired brain injury) reducing to 660 participants once non-included intervention groups were removed from three and four group studies. We were unable to obtain data from the remaining six studies. Three studies (134 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with sensorimotor therapy. None reported our primary outcome; data from one study was available relating to secondary outcomes including concept formation and ADL. Six studies (333 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with no treatment or placebo. None reported our primary outcome; data from four studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation on secondary outcomes. Ten studies (448 participants) compared two different cognitive rehabilitation approaches. Two studies (82 participants) reported the primary outcome; no statistically significant effect was found. Data from eight studies demonstrated no statistically significant effect on the secondary outcomes. We explored the effect of restorative interventions (10 studies, 468 participants) and compensative interventions (four studies, 128 participants) and found no statistically significant effect compared with other interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified insufficient high-quality evidence to reach any generalised conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on executive function, or other secondary outcome measures. Further high-quality research comparing cognitive rehabilitation with no intervention, placebo or sensorimotor interventions is recommended.

### ENIgMA brain injury: framework, challenges, and opportunities [^116Gphkh]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ENIGMA Brain Injury working group was formed in 2016 with the overall aim of finding reproducible neuroimaging biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) across the injury spectrum. TBI is defined as an alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force (Menon et al.). Injury severity ranges from devastating brain damage causing death or severe disability to milder injuries, including concussions and subconcussive impacts. TBI is a major public health issue around the world, with an estimated 70 million people sustaining a TBI each year (Dewan et al.). While some patients recover after TBI, others experience chronic physical, cognitive, and psychological dysfunction. Long‐term disability is more common in moderate and severe TBI (generally injuries with a Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] < 12), but a considerable proportion of persons with mild TBI experience persistent health problems. There is a considerable amount of variance in outcome that is not explained by typical injury‐related factors. It is likely that patient subgroups, even within defined patient populations (e.g. pediatric moderate/severe TBI patients), have different trajectories of recovery or different constellations of symptom burden.

### Effects of white matter lesions and lacunes on cortical function… [^111Bs53P]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Design Cross-sectional analyses of case series. Setting Multicenter, university-based study of subcortical vascular dementia. Patients Persons with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia and with and without lacunes on magnetic resonance images. Main Outcome Measures Regional cerebral glucose metabolism, normalized regional metabolic activity, and neuropsychological test scores. Major hypotheses were that volume of lacunes and WML correlate selectively with hypometabolism of prefrontal cortex and failure of executive cognitive ability. Conclusions The metabolic effects of lacunes and WML are most apparent in DLF, but the effects of WML are generalized and frontal hypometabolism correlates with memory and global impairment, cognitive as well as executive function. The effects of subcortical cerebrovascular disease appear to converge on the frontal lobes but are diffuse, complex, and of modest magnitude.

Hippocampal atrophy and cortical atrophy were measured because of their effect on cognition and putative links to AD. We hypothesized that lacunes correlate with hypometabolism of prefrontal cortex, executive dysfunction, and global cognitive impairment, whereas hippocampal atrophy and cortical atrophy correlate with hypometabolism of temporal and parietal cortex, memory failure, and global cognitive impairment. In these data, the functional impact of subcortical lesions was strongest in prefrontal cortex, particularly in DLF. Lacunes correlated with hypometabolism in DLF exclusively, and effects of WML on metabolic rates, while generalized, were strongest in DLF. In addition, lacunes and WML both correlated with diminished executive function. Because dysfunction both of medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe lead to impairments of executive function and memory, it is not surprising that metabolic activity in both regions also correlated with global cognitive ability.

Also, the effects of subcortical CVD on cortical metabolism are not restricted to the frontal lobes, and the effects of frontal hypometabolism may not be confined to executive function. Finally, WML and lacunes often occur in a setting of concomitant cortical and hippocampal atrophy that often represents effects of AD, although CVD may also cause atrophy of these structures. Regardless of etiology, both changes are likely deleterious to cognition. Thus, lacunes and WML contribute a frontal emphasis in the complexly determined clinical picture of vascular dementia.

### Neuropsychological outcome after acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: impact of age at illness onset [^11591ih5]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Recovery from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in childhood appears relatively uneventful, at least when looking at functional recovery parameters such as neurologic outcome. However, neuropsychology literature suggests that relatively transient illnesses affecting the central nervous system are associated with cognitive and social sequelae, particularly when the illness occurs during the preschool years. This study investigated the impact of timing of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis on intellectual, educational, and social functioning in children. Nineteen children (10 with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis before the age of 5 years), who had been admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne Australia, in the past 6 years underwent a brief neuropsychologic assessment. Performance was compared with 19 control subjects, stratified for age and socioeconomic status with the acute disseminated encephalomyelitis group. Children who sustained their illness before 5 years of age were particularly vulnerable to impairments in both cognitive and social domains. In particular, a higher incidence of severe behavioral and emotional problems was reported by parents of children who had experienced acute disseminated encephalomyelitis before 5 years of age. This finding suggests that there may be long-term complications in early childhood. A multidisciplinary approach to management post-illness is warranted in this age group.

Many older individuals experience or demonstrate cognitive impairment that is significantly abnormal for their age and education yet beneath the threshold for a diagnosis of dementia. This mild cognitive impairment causes minimal functional impairment and is often overlooked in clinical settings, yet affected individuals are at heightened risk for a range of adverse outcomes including conversion to dementia. The case of Ms E, a 60-year-old woman with mild memory impairment and white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, provides an opportunity to consider the questions that face patient, family, and clinicians when mild cognitive symptoms prompt a search for diagnosis and management options. Discussion of her case reviews mild cognitive impairment with emphasis on an evidence-based approach to evaluation and treatment, including management of comorbid medical conditions, lifestyle changes, and pharmacotherapy.

### Neurocognitive impairment in inherited metabolic disorders due to intoxication and energy defects: a systematic review [^114jPVyA]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

4.10 Future Directions and Neuropsychological Recommendations

Further neuropsychological studies are needed to understand better the underlying mechanisms of cognitive‐behavioral impairment in this population.

International protocols for neuropsychological assessment and treatment are also needed to standardize methodology, facilitate the comparison of studies, and establish guidelines for evidence‐based interventions addressing the frequent neurocognitive impairments associated with IMD.

Comprehensive, multicenter, and longitudinal studies are essential to evaluate treatment effects on neurodevelopmental endpoints. Given the wide‐ranging neurocognitive impairments observed in individuals with IMD, we recommend establishing standardized neuropsychological protocols to be used both at the time of diagnosis and during annual follow‐ups. These protocols should assess key cognitive areas, including global intelligence (using tools such as the Wechsler scales), fine motor skills (e.g. the Purdue Pegboard), attention and executive functions (e.g. the CPT‐3 or BRIEF), and social cognition (e.g. Theory of Mind or Affect Recognition tasks). By conducting thorough and repeated evaluations, we can facilitate the early detection of cognitive strengths and weaknesses, allowing for timely personalized interventions. This proactive approach can help prevent negative impacts on academic performance and daily functioning, enhancing the quality of life for individuals with IMDs and their families.

### Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy: a new classification for acute neurocognitive changes associated with hematopoietic cell transplantation from the ASTCT committee on practice guidelines [^113jPdwQ]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy (TAME) — classification and risk factors state, "We propose a new classification for acute neurocognitive changes that commonly complicate HCT and impact its trajectory of recovery". TAME "is an inclusive diagnosis, capturing those with acute encephalopathy, manifesting clinically as delirium and subsyndromal delirium, and occurring in early and late forms based on post-transplantation timing". The authors add that "Further research is needed to understand the acute and long-lasting cognitive risks of HCT and to design strategies to reduce the significant cognitive changes found early and after HCT", and that risks are "more common in older adults, especially those with lower functional status, cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities, [but] children and young adults are also at significant risk for developing TAME during their initial transplantation course". They note "Treatment factors also impact TAME risk and outcomes, and the care environment together with medication choices likely have critical roles", and that "Recognition of TAME as a potentially modifiable HCT-associated complication is the first step toward reducing its incidence and enhancing its recovery", with discussion with "care teams, patients, and their caregivers" supporting engagement to "optimize overall HCT outcomes".

4.9 Limitations

The main limitation of this review is the scarcity of papers on neurocognitive impairment. It is important to remark that IMDs often cause very severe encephalopathies, and patients are not suitable for detailed neuropsychological assessments. Consequently, the current body of literature may fall short of fully representing IMD's wide‐ranging complexity and diversity. This gap underscores the need for more comprehensive research to understand better the neurocognitive consequences associated with these conditions.

Moreover, the significant variability in the methodologies employed across the studies presents a complex challenge to drawing broad conclusions. Each research effort often utilizes different standardized measures, and the sizes of the samples vary considerably, further complicating the reliability of the results. The symptoms associated with each IMD also exhibit considerable heterogeneity, adding another layer of difficulty to generalization. These intricate factors underscore the need to interpret the data carefully. Additionally, it emphasizes the necessity of shifting the way cognitive functions are recorded and analyzed in the literature to more accurate representations and a deeper understanding of cognitive processes.

The classification of IMD and cognitive‐behavioral disorders may have changed over time as our understanding of these conditions has evolved. As a result, many studies utilize different classifications, which complicate the review process in terms of searching, organizing, and synthesizing information.

Many studies fail to clarify key clinical features relevant to neurocognitive outcomes. Important aspects to consider in future studies include the timing of diagnosis and treatment (whether early neonatal or late onset), the frequency of metabolic crises, neuroimaging data, and the biochemical profile of toxic metabolite accumulation associated with each disease‐specific profile. Addressing these factors would enhance our understanding of how treatments influence the development of cognitive deficits. As a consequence, the findings should only guide future research and personalized assessments based on the patient's history and daily functioning.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^1118AeKr]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Cognitive abilities — The individual's mental age and cognitive status (including IQ) can influence the ability to complete complex behavioral measures and may make interpretation difficult or render results invalid; in cases of questionable cognitive function or intelligence, the need for multidisciplinary assessment becomes imperative. Results of cognitive, neuropsychological, psychoeducational and speech-language assessments can inform whether to proceed with central auditory processing evaluation and how to interpret test results, and when critical assessment data are not available and a significant deficit is suspected, referral to another professional (e.g., psychologist, speech-language pathologist, neuropsychologist) may be warranted before a central auditory assessment is undertaken. Some young children and individuals with developmental delay or acquired brain injury may be unable to complete behavioral testing due to limited capacity to meet language, memory and/or attention demands, and elderly individuals may present with decreased memory or attention that can negatively impact performance on measures of central auditory function.

### Functional magnetic resonance imaging and cognition at the very early stage of MS [^115nSpJf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of high controlled information processing is present in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) right at the beginning of the disease. One hypothesis is that disruption of communication inside large-scale cortical networks, occurring as a consequence of white matter damage, may constitute the anatomical substrate of cognitive impairment at the very early stage of MS. Disturbance of interregional synchronization might be the main pathogenic factor in controlled information processing deficiency in early MS. Preliminary functional MRI studies (fMRI) have provided important clues to corroborate the connectivity hypotheses. First, brain connectivity assessed by fMRI has brought new data about the influence of diffuse white matter damage on connectivity efficiency inside large-scale networks. These studies have suggested that connectivity disturbances occur inside the working memory network in patients at the very early stage of MS and appear related to the extent of structural white matter damage. Also, fMRI studies have suggested that patients may partially compensate for connectivity impairment by a greater cognitive control. Such a compensatory mechanism could limit the determinant functional impact of diffuse white matter damage on high controlled information processing.

### Brain structure in prenatal stroke: quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis [^113A5TuK]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Neonatal stroke outcome studies demonstrate variable findings of either relatively spared intellectual function or persistent impairments. Volumetric measurement of the brain can provide more precise data on lesion-cognition outcomes. We studied 7 children with unilateral focal lesions from prenatal stroke. Whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed to produce volumes of cortical gray matter, total white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, lesion, and lesion constricted fluid, and we ascertained the relationship of morphometric variables to intellectual and clinical outcome. Children with cystic encephalomalacia plus atrophy had poorer outcomes than children with atrophy or gliosis alone. These children also demonstrated the largest lesion size, smallest gray matter volume, and greatest proportion of hyperintense white matter in the affected hemisphere. Findings suggest that the type and size of the lesion, in addition to the integrity of white matter and residual cortex, may be better predictors of intellectual functioning than either of these indices alone.

### Predictors of intellectual function after a unilateral cortical lesion: study of 635 patients from infancy to adulthood [^112Nxknu]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

This study investigated potential predictors of intellectual outcome in 417 children and 218 adults who had sustained a unilateral cortical lesion. Of these, 295 cases were collected from the scientific literature and 340 from medical records at seven hospitals in Canada Different sets of predictors emerged for the Wechsler Verbal and Performance IQ values, accounting for differing variances (i.e., 12.4% and 20.1%, respectively). The volume of the lesion was the factor that explained the most variance (i.e., 4.95% and 11.7%, respectively). Age at lesion onset was significantly and positively correlated with verbal intelligence scores. This variable, considered independently or in interaction with other predictors, did not account for a large portion of the variance explained in intelligence. This refutes the commonly held notion that early onset of the insults results in a better prognosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vascular cognitive impairment, more specifically with respect to brain imaging, EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend to make a diagnosis of vascular dementia only where the vascular lesions can explain the cognitive deficit. Reserve the 'mixed dementia' label for cases where both clinical features and diagnostic markers point to a mixed etiology.

### Chronic impact of traumatic brain injury on outcome and quality of life: a narrative review [^114cSB7e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Traditionally seen as a sudden, brutal event with short-term impairment, traumatic brain injury (TBI) may cause persistent, sometimes life-long, consequences. While mortality after TBI has been reduced, a high proportion of severe TBI survivors require prolonged rehabilitation and may suffer long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological disorders. Additionally, chronic consequences have been identified not only after severe TBI but also in a proportion of cases previously classified as moderate or mild. This burden affects the daily life of survivors and their families; it also has relevant social and economic costs. Outcome evaluation is difficult for several reasons: co-existing extra-cranial injuries (spinal cord damage, for instance) may affect independence and quality of life outside the pure TBI effects; scales may not capture subtle, but important, changes; co-operation from patients may be impossible in the most severe cases. Several instruments have been developed for capturing specific aspects, from generic health status to specific cognitive functions. Even simple instruments, however, have demonstrated variable inter-rater agreement. The possible links between structural traumatic brain damage and functional impairment have been explored both experimentally and in the clinical setting with advanced neuro-imaging techniques. We briefly report on some fundamental findings, which may also offer potential targets for future therapies. Better understanding of damage mechanisms and new approaches to neuroprotection-restoration may offer better outcomes for the millions of survivors of TBI.

### EFNS task force: the use of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of dementia [^1143LV23]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vascular cognitive impairment, more specifically with respect to brain imaging, EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend to recognize that it is particularly difficult to attribute clinical significance to evidence of cerebrovascular disease in patients with cognitive impairment, and vascular changes on CT or MRI do not preclude a diagnosis of degenerative dementia, especially in older age.

### Neuroimaging correlates of cognitive deficits in Wilson's disease [^115m7fEg]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

To conclude, we have identified neuroanatomical correlates for a range of cognitive deficits observed in WD and proposed a novel theory for the evolution of neurological involvement that raises questions about the use of a binary disease classification. Confirming that newly diagnosed patients without movement disorders have deficits in cognitive flexibility, recognition memory for faces, and associative learning relative to healthy controls and that associations with cortical atrophy and WM diffusion abnormalities persist in this group would provide further supporting evidence. Our hope is that this can be tested in parallel with other imaging biomarkers for neurological involvement in clinical trials for novel treatments in the coming years.

### White matter hyperintensities, cognitive impairment and dementia: an update [^1163wsPm]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in the brain are the consequence of cerebral small vessel disease, and can easily be detected on MRI. Over the past three decades, research has shown that the presence and extent of white matter hyperintense signals on MRI are important for clinical outcome, in terms of cognitive and functional impairment. Large, longitudinal population-based and hospital-based studies have confirmed a dose-dependent relationship between WMHs and clinical outcome, and have demonstrated a causal link between large confluent WMHs and dementia and disability. Adequate differential diagnostic assessment and management is of the utmost importance in any patient, but most notably those with incipient cognitive impairment. Novel imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging might reveal subtle damage before it is visible on standard MRI. Even in Alzheimer disease, which is thought to be primarily caused by amyloid, vascular pathology, such as small vessel disease, may be of greater importance than amyloid itself in terms of influencing the disease course, especially in older individuals. Modification of risk factors for small vessel disease could be an important therapeutic goal, although evidence for effective interventions is still lacking. Here, we provide a timely Review on WMHs, including their relationship with cognitive decline and dementia.

### Moyamoya disease: functional and neurocognitive outcomes in the pediatric and adult populations [^111m1V2n]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Moyamoya disease is an occlusive cerebrovascular disorder commonly resulting in neurocognitive impairment. The cognitive outcome parameters commonly affected are intelligence, memory, executive function, and quality of life. In this paper, the authors review the existing literature on cognitive and clinical outcomes in adult and pediatric moyamoya populations separately.

Methods

A systematic review of the cognitive and clinical outcome literature was performed using the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Outcomes data were contrasted between adult and pediatric populations.

Results

Intelligence is the main cognitive outcome parameter affected in pediatric patients with moyamoya disease, whereas adults most commonly suffer from executive function impairment. Memory has not been studied sufficiently in pediatric patients, and its dysfunction in the adult population remains controversial. Quality of life has not been studied appropriately in either population. Surgical revascularization is the only beneficial treatment option, and a combination of direct and indirect bypass techniques has shown benefit, but the impact on the above-mentioned parameters has not been sufficiently elucidated.

Conclusions

Moyamoya disease affects the cognition and daily function in pediatric patients to a greater extent than in adult patients. Due to the rarity of the disease, there is a distinct lack of high-level evidence regarding cognitive and clinical outcomes.

### ENIgMA brain injury: framework, challenges, and opportunities [^114uqRf6]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

In this article, we will discuss some of the challenges and open questions in the field of TBI neuroimaging research, including challenges specific to the meta‐ and mega‐analytical approaches of the ENIGMA Consortium. A wide range of factors can impact outcomes after brain injury, and this contributes to the large heterogeneity in outcome. Broadly speaking, heterogeneity is one of the largest challenges in TBI research as it complicates diagnosis and prognosis. However, this is also an opportunity, as we can reasonably assume that this heterogeneity is not random and likely indicates that there are individual factors or combinations of factors that play a role in outcome, perhaps in ways that are too subtle to have been detected yet. The ENIGMA Brain Injury group aims to uncover some of these factors, to improve the amount of variability in outcomes we are able to explain. Some of the challenges in TBI research discussed below include choice of comparison groups, consideration of lesions or other factors that may introduce significant distortion in various MRI sequences, inconsistently applied diagnostic criteria (particularly for mild TBI), and complexity and multiplicity of the underlying pathology. In addition to these general challenges in TBI research, there are a number of challenges in the ENIGMA approach. Data harmonization is a significant challenge and must be addressed carefully. If this is not done in a thoughtful way, we risk a "garbage in, garbage out" scenario that yields null results at best, or unreliable or inaccurate results at worst. Harmonization includes neuroimaging, demographic, clinical, and cognitive/neuropsychological data. These challenges and our approach to addressing them in the specific context of TBI are discussed further in the Challenges and Opportunities section below.

### Electrophysiological dynamics of antagonistic brain networks reflect attentional fluctuations [^112PtkJ3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Subjects

Data from 31 human subjects (S1–31) who were undergoing neurosurgical treatment for refractory focal epilepsy were included in analyses reported here. Data from S1–10 were collected at Stanford University Medical Center, whereas data from S11–31 were collected at Beijing Tian Tan Hospital (see Supplementary Table 1 for full demographic and other details). Subjects were implanted with intracranial electrodes that either were depth electrodes placed stereotactically within one or both hemispheres (29 subjects) or subdural electrodes arranged in grid and strip configurations over one hemisphere (two subjects). Electrode placement was decided based on clinical evaluation for resective surgery. Intracranial electrode monitoring took place over the course of multiple days. Subjects at all experiment sites provided verbal and written informed consent to participate in research. For procedures at Stanford, the Stanford Institutional Review Board approved all procedures described herein. For procedures at Beijing, the Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Tian Tan Hospital approved all procedures.

Subjects included in analyses presented here were selected from a cohort of 46 patients who participated in the cognitive task procedures herein. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) poor behavioral performance (criteria described below) that could indicate lack of compliance with task instructions or inability to perform the task successfully (n = 12); (2) major structural brain abnormalities that impeded MRI-based cortical surface reconstruction, including encephalomalacia and damage from prior resections (n = 3).

### Lifetime socioeconomic status, cognitive decline, and brain characteristics [^113AudPT]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is socioecomonic status (SES) across the lifespan associated with cognitive decline and brain characteristics?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study of 7303 participants, SES was lower throughout the lifespan for Black individuals compared with White individuals. Higher SES, mainly in adulthood, was associated with better cognitive function, less cognitive decline, and better brain characteristics, including white matter hyperintensities and total brain volume.

Meaning

These findings suggest that SES is an essential factor in brain health disparities and point to a need for interventions that improve SES throughout the lifespan.

### Cognitive domains affected post-COVID-19; a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138R7fU]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As seen in previous coronavirus epidemics, a significant proportion of patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 develop cognitive (neuropsychological) sequelae from the infection, and a significant proportion of these persist long term. Post‐COVID‐19 condition is defined by National Institutes of Health guidance as symptoms present 3 months from the onset of COVID‐19 with symptoms that have lasted at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Cognitive impairment appears to be common after recovering from COVID‐19 disease, with an estimated 18%–36% of people affected depending on whether subjective or objective measures are used, and 32% of patients reporting subjective 'brain fog' over 3 months after the initial infection.

Meta‐analysis demonstrates a prevalence of objectively measured global cognitive impairment of 22% at 12 weeks or more following COVID‐19 infection, compared to infected controls, and similar persistent cognitive impairment can be seen in formal testing even in those without persistent COVID‐19 symptomology. Early reports suggested that COVID‐19 patients suffered from a dysexecutive syndrome during acute infection; however, a detailed, domain‐specific phenotype of cognitive impairment occurring in individuals in this post‐acute phase is yet to be established.

An acute‐phase dysexecutive syndrome may suggest frontal lobe pathology, but the neurobiological basis of post‐COVID‐19 cognitive impairment remains unclear, with multiple and multifactorial aetiologies being proposed. Likely mediators include the well‐established cognitive sequelae of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, acute respiratory distress syndrome and delirium. The medium‐ and long‐term cognitive symptoms experienced by those with asymptomatic or mild effects from the initial infection suggest a separate aetiology to those seen in patients with more direct effects such as stroke or encephalitis. Although there is literature on how general severity of COVID‐19 illness may affect cognitive symptoms, fewer studies have explored how the presence of neurological sequelae in this context might affect outcomes.

Elucidating the pattern of cognitive impairment is key to understanding this pathophysiology, improving diagnosis and formulating management options for a condition that is likely to have an impact on quality of life, economic output and societal engagement.

The aims of this review were therefore (1) to identify which primary cognitive domains are impaired in this population and, if present, whether these change over time, (2) to identify which neuropsychological tasks were used and how impairment was defined and (3) to establish whether any demographic or clinical factors predict the presence, and/or severity, of this impairment.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in critically ill adults with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury [^114yNM5g]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury — prediction models — show the following classifications across outcomes: CRASH-basic is moderately reliable for Mortality at discharge and beyond and moderately reliable for Functional Outcome at 6 months and beyond, with no data for Quality of Life and Cognitive status; CRASH-CT is moderately reliable for mortality and reliable for functional outcome, with no data for Quality of Life and Cognitive status; IMPACT-core is moderately reliable for mortality and moderately reliable for functional outcome, with no data for Quality of Life and Cognitive status; IMPACT-extended is moderately reliable for mortality and reliable for functional outcome, with no data for Quality of Life and Cognitive status; IMPACT-lab is moderately reliable for mortality and moderately reliable for functional outcome, with no data for Quality of Life and Cognitive status; Marshall CT, Rotterdam CT, Helsinki CT, and Stockholm CT are each not reliable for mortality and not reliable for functional outcome, with no data for Quality of Life and Cognitive status.

### Identifying encephalopathies from acute metabolic derangements [^115hWDJj]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic derangements, when acute and severe, affect brain function. This presents mostly with a marked decline in the level of consciousness, resulting in impaired responsiveness, abnormal receptivity, impaired content, and loss of memory retention. The term metabolic encephalopathy has been used but is conjecture that can be challenged in the age of modern neuroimaging. We now recognize that many metabolic encephalopathies may involve structural lesions and at an early stage. Common clinical conundrums are the evaluation of the degree of brain injury and its recoverability. This review discusses the appropriate terminology for these conditions, the diagnostic approach, therapy recommendations, and prediction of recovery potential. In evaluating a presumed metabolic cause for encephalopathy, we must (1) search for and rule out structural injury to the brain despite an obvious explanatory metabolic derangement, (2) recognize that several confounding conditions often co-exist, and (3) acknowledge that resolution of brain dysfunction may be protracted despite normalization of laboratory values.

### The cerebral cortex overlying periventricular leukomalacia: analysis of pyramidal neurons [^1121WjPh]. Brain Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

The role of the cerebral cortex in the cognitive deficits in preterm survivors is poorly understood. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), the key feature of encephalopathy of prematurity, is characterized by periventricular necrotic foci and diffuse gliosis in the surrounding cerebral white matter. Here, we tested the hypothesis that reductions in the density of layer I neurons and/or pyramidal neurons in layers III and/or V are associated with PVL, indicating cortical pathology potentially associated with cognitive deficits in long-term survivors. In controls (23 gestational weeks to 18 postnatal months) (n = 15), a lack of significant differences in pyramidal density among incipient Brodmann areas suggested that cytoarchitectonic differences across functional areas are not fully mature in the fetal and infant periods. There was a marked reduction (38%) in the density of layer V neurons in all areas sampled in the PVL cases (n = 17) compared to controls (n = 12) adjusted for postconceptional age at or greater than 30 weeks, when the six-layer cortex is visually distinct (P < 0.024). This may reflect a dying-back loss of somata complicating transection of layer V axons projecting through the necrosis in the underlying white matter. This study underscores the potential role of secondary cortical injury in the encephalopathy of prematurity.

There is growing recognition that chemotherapy may have short and long term impact on cognitive function of cancer patients. However, the impact of chemotherapy on the cognition of adult patients with primary brain tumor has not been extensively studied.

### The chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19: the need for a prospective study of viral impact on brain functioning [^112oaMFn]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The increasing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 impact on the central nervous system (CNS) raises key questions on its impact for risk of later life cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other dementia.

Methods

The Alzheimer's Association and representatives from more than 30 countries-with technical guidance from the World Health Organization-have formed an international consortium to study the short-and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS-including the underlying biology that may contribute to AD and other dementias. This consortium will link teams from around the world covering more than 22 million COVID-19 cases to enroll two groups of individuals including people with disease, to be evaluated for follow-up evaluations at 6, 9, and 18 months, and people who are already enrolled in existing international research studies to add additional measures and markers of their underlying biology.

Conclusions

The increasing evidence and understanding of SARS-CoV-2's impact on the CNS raises key questions on the impact for risk of later life cognitive decline, AD, and other dementia. This program of studies aims to better understand the long-term consequences that may impact the brain, cognition, and functioning-including the underlying biology that may contribute to AD and other dementias.

### White matter injury and outcomes: what is the final verdict? [^111JbXbq]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This study is important as early MRI after NE (DOL 3–5) is becoming more commonplace, and understanding the significance (or insignificance) of isolated T2 hyperintensities on early MRI will improve the sensitivity of our counseling and prognostic efforts for families. We like to point an important limitation is the exclusion of infants with mild encephalopathy subject of current trials (COOL Prime)with controversies in timing of the insults. Notably, antepartum asphyxia may result in T2 hyperintensity and diffusion restriction on early MRI with evolution to cystic encephalomalacia over time, and may be associated with more significant neurodevelopmental impairment 21. Understanding the timing of asphyxia and pattern of injury on early MRI are important for accurate prognosis of long-term outcomes. Additional research is also needed to understand the significance of injury to the mamillary bodies in NE as some studies demonstrate correlation to long term cognitive outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vascular cognitive impairment, more specifically with respect to brain imaging, EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend to obtain MRI as the modality of choice for assessing patients with suspected dementia. Consider obtaining CT (ideally a multi-detector row CT) to exclude major space-occupying lesions, large infarcts, and hydrocephalus when MRI is not available or contraindicated.

### Neurocognitive impairment in inherited metabolic disorders due to intoxication and energy defects: a systematic review [^111QzHMA]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Disorders involving complex molecule defects, which are largely untreatable and tend to show a neurodegenerative progression with heterogeneous cognitive profiles, fall outside the scope of this review. Additionally, conditions related to small molecule deficiencies (such as amino acid, fatty acid, and metal deficiencies) are not included, as they usually present with severe encephalopathies, global psychomotor delay, and extensive neurological symptoms, making the assessment of higher cognitive functions challenging.

This systematic review provides a comprehensive synthesis of existing evidence on cognitive and behavioral impairments associated with intoxication‐type and energy‐related IMDs. Despite the variability in clinical manifestations, grouping these disorders into pathophysiological categories may help identify common neurocognitive features. Predicting cognitive trajectories in these patients can support the development of early detection strategies and therapeutic interventions; ultimately helping to prevent learning disabilities and neuropsychiatric disorders. By mitigating the cognitive and behavioral impact of IMDs, these efforts can significantly improve the quality of life for both patients and their families.

Developmental delay and cognitive impairment screening in sickle cell disease — the panel determined sufficient evidence to justify guidelines for initial screening and subsequent screening in individuals with SCD and provided rationales for age groups: the panel's recommendation for screening for developmental delay and cognitive impairment in children with SCD was based on 3 factors (American Academy of Pediatrics universal screening, high prevalence in SCD, and high impact for individualized education plans); similarly, the ASH guideline panel's conditional recommendation for screening for cognitive impairment in adults with SCD was based on at least 2 dominant factors (the strong recommendation by the American Academy of Neurology for screening for mild cognitive impairment in adults and the high prevalence of these impairments in adults with SCD); research in implementation science is required to define the optimal reach for detecting these impairments, and the ASH Guideline Panel endorsed the evidence-based recommendations by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine for cognitive rehabilitation.
