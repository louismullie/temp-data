## Question

How should Propafol be dosed for the treatment of esophageal cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how propofol should be dosed in the context of esophageal cancer care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying propofol's role versus definitive oncologic treatments. Then, I should map the clinical scenarios in which propofol is actually used. Next, I will detail dosing by scenario (general anesthesia for esophagectomy, endoscopic sedation, MAC), followed by patient-specific adjustments. After that, I need to ensure safety monitoring and administration guidance are precise. Finally, I should compare anesthetic strategies and provide a concise, dose-anchored summary, verifying each step with the highest-credibility sources available.

> Let me first confirm the core premise: propofol is not a treatment for esophageal cancer; it is an IV hypnotic used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia or procedural sedation during diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for patients who happen to have esophageal cancer, whereas cancer control relies on modalities such as chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and immunotherapy, for example, 50–50.4 Gy definitive chemoradiotherapy per ASTRO/STS, perioperative FLOT chemotherapy per ESMO, and PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, tislelizumab) in appropriate biomarker-selected advanced disease settings [^117Xd5RQ] [^111C1HHz] [^111CdhaC] [^112G6Zvx] [^112ks9f1] [^notfound].

> Next, I should delineate clinical scenarios that actually require propofol in this population; I will not jump to conclusions until I verify guideline support for each setting: general anesthesia for esophagectomy, sedation for diagnostic/therapeutic endoscopy (EGD, EMR/ESD, stenting), and monitored anesthesia care when appropriate, all of which are endorsed settings for propofol-based techniques when safety, comfort, or efficiency is improved, especially in complex interventions, with ASGE and society statements supporting propofol use under trained providers [^115DEGt2] [^115DrLbJ] [^116ovf1x].

> I will now examine induction and maintenance dosing for general anesthesia during esophagectomy; wait, let me verify adult induction ranges: for ASA I–II adults under 55 years, 2–2.5 mg/kg IV in 40 mg increments every 10 seconds is standard, while for older or ASA III–IV patients, 1–1.5 mg/kg in 20 mg increments is appropriate, with cardiac anesthesia variants of 0.5–1.5 mg/kg where hemodynamic reserve is limited; maintenance typically uses 100–200 mcg/kg/min in healthier adults and 50–100 mcg/kg/min in older/ASA III–IV patients, and in esophagectomy series, induction with about 1–2.5 mg/kg propofol with opioid adjuncts and either TIVA or volatile maintenance has been reported, including TCI strategies titrated to effect-site 3–6 μg/mL within BIS targets [^111TAuaw] [^111s8uBG] [^115t6HfF] [^114PnjUc] [^111LK6tc] [^1141Vxvr] [^112HXMMr].

> Hold on, I should verify the implications for endoscopic sedation where propofol's narrow therapeutic window requires disciplined titration; for diagnostic EGD, a validated low-dose nurse-administered bolus protocol uses 40 mg if under 70 years, 30 mg if 70–89, and 20 mg if 90 or older, with 10–20 mg increments as needed to a typical maximum of 120 mg, achieving high procedural success with minimal rescue interventions; for TCI-based deep sedation, effect-site targets of 2–4 μg/mL are common, but I need to emphasize that 3–4 μg/mL increases severe swallowing impairment risk, and elderly patients generally require lower targets around 1.4–1.6 μg/mL compared with approximately 2.1 μg/mL in younger adults; TCI approaches can also reduce hypotension and hasten recovery compared with manual infusion during bidirectional endoscopy [^116hhuB4] [^116k3F7u] [^117UTPvS] [^111Vnnme].

> For monitored anesthesia care, I should double-check the FDA-labeled dosing: initial 100–150 mcg/kg/min for 3–5 minutes or a slow 0.5 mg/kg injection, followed by maintenance 25–75 mcg/kg/min, with optional incremental boluses of 10–20 mg, and I should confirm that careful titration with adjuncts like low-dose midazolam can reduce propofol requirements while maintaining efficacy in complex endoscopy, with model-based work suggesting midazolam 1 mg plus alfentanil 500 μg and a propofol TCI effect-site of 2 μg/mL as a balanced regimen for rapid on–off deep sedation, keeping in mind clinical judgment and patient variability [^112SxBi2] [^115DrLbJ] [^111ZFRdx].

> Now, I need to ensure patient-specific adjustments are explicit; elderly patients exhibit greater pharmacodynamic sensitivity and generally need 20–40% reductions or lower TCI targets, ASA III–IV status warrants lower induction and maintenance rates, and obesity increases hypoxemia risk during propofol sedation, arguing for ideal or adjusted body weight dosing and proactive airway strategies; hepatic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease justify conservative dosing and vigilant hemodynamic monitoring, while, interestingly, long-term high-risk drinking alone did not substantially alter effective propofol dosing for gastroscopy in one study, though associated liver disease still demands caution [^117UTPvS] [^116hhuB4] [^111s8uBG] [^116k3F7u] [^112EAgbR] [^114rsKyB].

> Next, I should review administration and monitoring safeguards to avoid preventable cardiorespiratory events; syringe or volumetric pumps are recommended for controlled infusion with 3–5 minutes between adjustments to let the clinical effect equilibrate, titrating to BIS 40–60 or an equivalent clinical sedation target, while continuously monitoring SpO2, blood pressure, and ECG given quantifiable incidences of desaturation, hypotension, and bradycardia during TCI sedation; thresholds such as SpO2 under 90% warrant immediate intervention, and although advanced airway needs are rare, readiness is non-negotiable, consistent with endoscopy sedation guidance from ASGE emphasizing trained personnel and structured protocols [^115t6HfF] [^112HXMMr] [^117Agd1z] [^115DEGt2].

> But wait, what about the choice of anesthetic maintenance for esophagectomy — do volatiles or propofol lead to different pulmonary outcomes; an RCT in minimally invasive esophagectomy found a lower incidence and severity of pulmonary complications with volatile agents compared with propofol-based TIVA, whereas retrospective cohorts have reported no significant difference in postoperative pneumonia risk, so I should present this as nuanced and center-specific, with both approaches acceptable and non-airway management and analgesic strategies likely exerting large effects on pulmonary outcomes and recovery trajectories [^115wEwbo] [^116MT9go] [^111wom9x].

> Let me synthesize dosing by scenario in plain language while I double-check units and ranges; for esophagectomy under general anesthesia, induce with propofol 1–2.5 mg/kg IV depending on age/ASA and maintain at roughly 50–200 mcg/kg/min, titrating with adjuncts and BIS targets, acknowledging that some centers may prefer volatile anesthetics to potentially reduce pulmonary complications; for diagnostic EGD, either use low-dose boluses of 20–40 mg with 10–20 mg increments to a typical 120 mg maximum or a TCI effect-site around 2 μg/mL, taking care to avoid excessive targets that impair protective airway reflexes; for therapeutic endoscopy/ESD, TCI 2–4 μg/mL is common but should be individualized and generally lower in the elderly; for MAC, start 100–150 mcg/kg/min for 3–5 minutes or 0.5 mg/kg slowly, then maintain 25–75 mcg/kg/min with 10–20 mg boluses as needed, considering low-dose benzodiazepine/opioid co-administration to reduce propofol exposure and adverse events while preserving rapid recovery [^111TAuaw] [^114PnjUc] [^111LK6tc] [^116hhuB4] [^116k3F7u] [^117UTPvS] [^112SxBi2] [^111Vnnme] [^115wEwbo].

> Finally, I should confirm the overarching clinical message; propofol is a versatile anesthetic with predictable kinetics when infused via pumps and titrated with adequate time between adjustments, but it is not an antineoplastic therapy, and its safe use in esophageal cancer care hinges on matching dose and delivery method to the procedure and patient, employing rigorous monitoring, and selecting the intraoperative anesthetic strategy in concert with institutional experience and evolving randomized data on pulmonary outcomes after esophagectomy, all while ensuring definitive oncologic treatment follows guideline-concordant pathways [^115Mixhw] [^115t6HfF] [^115wEwbo] [^117Xd5RQ] [^111C1HHz].

Propofol is not a treatment for **esophageal cancer**; it is used for **sedation or anesthesia** during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures [^115DEGt2]. For **induction of anesthesia**, administer 1–2.5 mg/kg IV [^111TAuaw] as a bolus over 20–30 seconds, titrated to effect [^111s8uBG]. For **maintenance of anesthesia** [^114PnjUc], administer 100–200 mcg/kg/min (6–12 mg/kg/h). For **procedural sedation** [^111Vnnme], initiate at 100–150 mcg/kg/min (6–9 mg/kg/h) for 3–5 minutes [^112SxBi2], then maintain at 25–75 mcg/kg/min (1.5–4.5 mg/kg/h) or administer 10–20 mg incremental boluses [^116hhuB4]. Adjust doses for age, comorbidities, and procedure type [^111s8uBG]; monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and bradycardia [^113GUPTD] [^115DrLbJ]; and titrate to the minimum effective dose [^115t6HfF].

### Diprivan [^115t6HfF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Propofol blood concentrations at steady-state are generally proportional to infusion rates, especially in individual patients. Undesirable effects, such as cardiorespiratory depression, are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations, which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in the infusion rate. An adequate interval (3 minutes to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to assess the clinical effects.

	- Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing.

	- When administering Diprivan by infusion, syringe or volumetric pumps are recommended to provide controlled infusion rates. When infusing Diprivan to patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, metered control devices may be utilized if mechanical pumps are impractical.

	- Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and/or by increasing the infusion rate of Diprivan.

	- For minor surgical procedures (e.g. body surface), nitrous oxide (60% to 70%) can be combined with a variable rate Diprivan infusion to provide satisfactory anesthesia.

### Effects of combining epidural with general anesthesia on postoperative sleep and pain in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery: a prospective randomized trial [^112HXMMr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

General anesthesia (GA) was induced by intravenous injection of 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, 0.3 µg/kg sufentanil citrate, 1 mg/kg propofol, and 0.2 mg/kg cisatracurium. After full jaw relaxation, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were performed, and the tidal volume and ventilation volume were adjusted to maintain the end-expiratory carbon dioxide (ETCO2) pressure at 35–45 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained by continuous inhalation of 0.4 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) sevoflurane, intravenous target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil at effect-site concentrations of 3 µg/ml and 4 ng/ml, respectively, and intravenous infusion of cisatracurium 0.1 mg·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹.

For the general and epidural anesthesia (GEA) group, epidural catheterization was performed in the space T8–9 or T12-L1 according to the surgery type. The indwelling depth of epidural catheterization was approximately 3 cm, and 3–5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected as the experimental dose. GA was performed after epidural catheterization. Eight milliliters of 0.25% ropivacaine was injected into the epidural space 5 minutes before skin resection and pumped continuously at 6 ml/h. The induction and maintenance regimens were the same as those for the GA group. In both groups, the dosage of propofol was adjusted to maintain a BIS of 40–60. If the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or heart rate (HR) exceeded 20% above the corresponding baseline value for more than 1 minute or symptoms such as sweating and tearing occurred due to surgical stimulation, the target remifentanil concentration was titrated up by 1–2 ng/ml.

### Deep sedation using propofol target-controlled infusion for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures: a retrospective cohort study [^117Agd1z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Propofol sedation is effective for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures; however, its narrow therapeutic window highlights the importance of identifying an optimal administration technique regarding effectiveness and safety. This study aimed to determine the incidence of significant adverse events in adult patients scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy under anesthetist-performed sedation using propofol target-controlled infusion and determine the existence of associations between these events and potentially related variables.

- **Methods**: This single-center, retrospective cohort study took place in a tertiary referral university hospital. Medical records of 823 patients (age > 18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification scores I-III) who had undergone elective gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol target-controlled infusion sedation during September 2018 were reviewed. Outcomes included hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia events, requirement of vasoactive drugs, unplanned tracheal intubation or supraglottic device insertion, and the need for advanced cardiac life support.

- **Results**: The most frequently encountered adverse event was oxygen desaturation < 95%, with an incidence of 22.35%. Vasoactive drug administration, hypotension, and oxygen desaturation < 90% followed, with incidences of 19.2, 12.64, and 9.92%, respectively. Only 0.5% of patients required advanced airway management. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between hypotension events, colonoscopic procedures, and propofol doses (odds ratio: 3.08, 95% confidence).

### The role of surgery in the management of oesophageal cancer [^112gN1i5]. The Lancet Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

In the absence of medical contraindications to surgery, resection is the mainstay of treatment for localised oesophageal cancer. Advancements in preoperative staging and imaging, anaesthesia delivery, surgical technique, and postoperative care now enable the surgeon to safely operate on patients with oesophageal tumours and to tailor the procedure based on performance status, tumour location, and extent of disease. Over the past 10 years, several "minimally invasive" techniques, which aim to limit the extent of resection, have been introduced. These procedures are currently being investigated for use in both the staging and treatment of oesophageal malignant diseases.

Despite these accomplishments, overall 5-year survival remains disappointing, with less than 25% of patients living for 5 years after oesophagectomy. For patients with locally or regionally advanced disease (stage IIa, IIb, III, and IVa), combining several treatment approaches, either with or without surgery, can result in good objective responses and, in some patients, durable survival. The role of surgery in such combined modality approaches is still evolving, and some investigators have challenged its worth.

To provide a definitive review of the issues involved, we outline the types of surgery used to treat cancer of the oesophagus and summarise the available data about their effectiveness. Clinical outcomes, the value of preoperative chemoradiotherapy, and the use of surgery are all considered.

### Effects of intravenous anesthesia and inhalation anesthesia on postoperative inflammatory markers in patients with esophageal cancer: a retrospective study [^1141Vxvr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients**: Patients who underwent esophageal cancer resection at Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, were collected for this study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with esophageal tumors other than squamous and adenocarcinomas, (2) emergency surgery, (3) patients with preoperative metastases, (4) patients with non-two anesthesia methods, and (5) patients with incomplete clinical data. We obtained the medical records of all included patients and data were extracted by researchers who were not involved in the study or data analysis.

- **Anesthesia technique and grouping method**: According to the distinct anesthesia techniques, patients were divided into the total intravenous anesthesia group (TIVA) and the inhalational anesthesia group (INHA). In both groups, patients underwent anesthesia induction with midazolam 0.05 ~ 0.15 mg/kg, 0.5 µg/kg fentanyl, 0.15 ~ 0.2 mg/kg cisatracurium, and 1 ~ 2.5 mg/kg propofol. In the TIVA group, anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil, while in the INHA group, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The bispectral index (BIS) was maintained within the range of 40 to 60 for both anesthesia methods. During the anesthesia regimen, the mean systemic blood pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline or above 60 mmHg using appropriate doses of vasopressors or inotropics. Patients received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) at dosages of 3 µg/mL of fentanyl or 0.5 µg/mL of sufentanil for 72 to 120 hours after surgery.

### A simulation study of common propofol and propofol-opioid dosing regimens for upper endoscopy: Implications on the time course of recovery [^114u2KWg]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

The authors explored the published dosing schemes for endoscopy using propofol alone and in combination with selected opioids through simulation models. These models included respiratory compromise, loss of response to esophageal instrumentation, and loss of responsiveness. The hypothesis was that the models would predict adequate conditions for esophageal instrumentation and, once drug administration is terminated, a rapid return of responsiveness with minimal respiratory compromise.

- **Methods**: Four published dosing regimens of propofol alone or in combination with opioids were used to predict the probability of loss of response to esophageal instrumentation for a 10-minute procedure, as well as the probability of respiratory compromise and return of responsiveness once the procedure had ended.

- **Results**: Propofol alone provided a low probability (9–20%) and propofol-opioid techniques provided a moderate probability (15–58%) of loss of response to esophageal instrumentation. Once the procedure ended, all techniques provided a high likelihood of rapid return of responsiveness (less than 3 minutes). Propofol-opioid techniques required more time than propofol alone to achieve a high probability of no respiratory compromise (7 vs. 4 minutes).

- **Conclusions**: Propofol alone would likely lead to inadequate conditions for esophageal instrumentation but would provide a rapid return to responsiveness and a low probability of respiratory compromise once the procedure ended. The addition of remifentanil or fentanyl improved conditions for esophageal instrumentation and had an equally rapid return to responsiveness.

### Swallowing impairment during propofol target-controlled infusion [^116k3F7u]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Sedatives can impair the swallowing process. We assessed the incidence and severity of swallowing impairment in patients sedated with propofol at clinically relevant doses. We also identified factors predictive of swallowing impairment.

- **Methods**: In 80 patients scheduled to undergo elective gastrointestinal endoscopy under target-controlled infusion (TCI) propofol sedation, swallowing was evaluated by glottis videoendoscopy, using the Dysphagia Severity Score (DSS) and the Penetration and Aspiration Scale (PAS). The level of sedation was assessed with the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAAS) scale. Evaluations were obtained within each patient at three target effect-site propofol concentrations of 2, 3, and 4 μg/mL (Marsh model).

- **Results**: At 2 μg/mL TCI, the OAAS score was 2 in 21 (26.25%) patients and 1 in 59 (73.75%). The OAAS score was 1 in all patients at 3 and 4 μg/mL TCI target. At 3 μg/mL TCI target, 19 (24.36%) patients had a DSS of 3 and 18 patients (23.08%) had a PAS of 7–8, indicating severe swallowing impairment. DSS was associated with increasing age (5-year odds ratio [OR] 1.53 [1.22–1.93]; P < 0.001), body mass index (BMI; OR 1.24 [1.08–1.42]; P = 0.002), and TCI target (OR 15.80 [7.76–32.20]; P < 0.001). In an alternative model incorporating OAAS instead of TCI target, DSS was associated with increasing age (5-year OR 1.13 [1.02–1.24]; P = 0.014), BMI (OR 1.08 [1.02–1.15]; P = 0.006), and decreasing OAAS (OR 0.05 [0.006–0.36]; P = 0.003). PAS was associated with increasing age (5-year OR 1.09 [1.04–1.15]; P < 0.001) and BMI (OR 1.23).

### Long-term high-risk drinking does not change effective doses of propofol for successful insertion of gastroscope in Chinese male patients [^114rsKyB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

The latest reports released by the World Health Organization (WHO) show that the number of drinkers has reached 2.3 billion globally, and alcohol addiction has become a leading risk factor for personal death and disability. In China, the number of regular heavy drinkers has also been increasing rapidly. The risk levels of drinking are commonly defined by the WHO criteria, in which a low-risk drinking level for men and women is defined as alcohol consumption between 1–40 g/day and 1–20 g/day, respectively; a medium-risk drinking level is defined as between 41–60 g/day and 21–40 g/day; and a high-risk drinking level as more than 61 g/day and more than 41 g/day.

Individuals with high alcohol consumption often have comorbid liver diseases, such as alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. Since the liver is a major organ involved in drug metabolism, hepatic insufficiency can significantly alter the metabolism of anesthetic and analgesic drugs. Moreover, evidence indicates that alcohol consumption is closely related to the development of digestive tract diseases such as esophageal cancer, gastritis, esophagitis and/or Barrett's esophagus, and duodenal ulcers. Thus, the demand for painless gastroscopy by long-term drinkers has been rising for the early diagnosis and treatment of upper gastrointestinal diseases.

Propofol is a sedative agent with unique pharmacological properties, including rapid onset and satisfactory postoperative recovery, making it commonly used for sedation in painless gastroscopy. It has been shown that long-term drinkers maintain consistent requirements for propofol dosing.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on sedation in gastrointestinal endoscopy [^116UC4Ek]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

In a meta-analysis, overall sedation-related side effects were similar between groups of patients receiving propofol or general anesthesia. Propofol could be a safer alternative to general anesthesia. It remains unclear whether propofol or general anesthesia is safer than conscious sedation, but patients sedated with propofol recover more quickly than patients who receive conscious sedation.

### Precedex [^1165NDD6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Adult patients randomized to placebo received significantly more propofol than adult patients randomized to Precedex.

A significantly greater percentage of adult patients in the Precedex group, compared to the placebo group, maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 without receiving any propofol rescue.

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to adult patients in the Precedex and placebo groups. On average, Precedex-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.43 mg/h versus 0.89 mg/h). In addition, 41% (83 of 203 patients) of Precedex patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 15% (30 of 198 patients) in the placebo group.

In a controlled clinical trial, Precedex was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours. Precedex was not shown to be superior to midazolam for the primary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of time patients were adequately sedated (81% versus 81%). In addition, administration of Precedex for longer than 24 hours was associated with tolerance, tachyphylaxis, and a dose-related increase in adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Sedation during endoscopic procedures: A Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology position statement [^115DrLbJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

- **Section 5: The use of propofol**: The role of propofol in sedation during endoscopy has been extensively discussed. The use of propofol is considered superior to classical sedation drugs during interventional endoscopic procedures, as it results in greater patient satisfaction and shorter recovery times. Notably, only one round of voting was necessary to reach a unanimous agreement level of 100%.

Studies have demonstrated that propofol outperforms traditional sedation schemes involving benzodiazepines plus opioids, particularly in ERCP procedures. Higher post-procedure patient satisfaction is achieved with propofol compared to traditional sedation methods for colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and ERCP, although this is not the case for gastroduodenoscopy. Furthermore, the time to sedation and recovery is generally shorter with propofol.

- **Adverse effects**: While propofol may cause hypoventilation, hypotension, and bradycardia relatively frequently, severe adverse effects are extremely rare.

- **Synergistic sedation**: Combining low doses of intravenous midazolam with propofol significantly reduces the required dose of propofol and therefore diminishes the risk of complications. This method has been reported as an effective alternative to using propofol alone, and is similarly recommended for gastrointestinal endoscopy in children.

- **Controversy**: Despite adequate safety data supporting the administration of propofol by non-anesthesiologists, much of the anesthesiology community remains opposed to its use due to the drug's ability to swiftly induce deep sedation and general anesthesia.

### Effect of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services policy about deep sedation on use of propofol [^116JqRfA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

On 11 December 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a policy stating that deep sedation can only be administered by an anesthesiologist, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, or a trained medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy not involved in the performance of a medical procedure. Propofol is a popular sedation agent usually administered by anesthesia specialists in a service termed monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Monitored anesthesia care adds substantial new fees to procedural sedation. However, available evidence shows that propofol can be used safely by non-anesthesiologists for procedural sedation. The American Society of Anesthesiologists considers that propofol implies deep sedation and should only be administered by anesthesia specialists.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services policy on deep sedation can be viewed as supporting an ongoing conversion to MAC to deliver propofol for procedural sedation. However, the absence of an evidence base supporting a need for MAC to deliver propofol, combined with its high cost, suggests that alternatives to MAC to deliver propofol deserve fair and balanced evaluation.

### Propofol vs. inhalational agents to maintain general anaesthesia in ambulatory and in-patient surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cL4pm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data regarding the study population, sample size, interventions, comparators, potential biases in the conduct of the trial, and outcomes were extracted from eligible publications. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias (high/low) and covered aspects such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of assessments, attrition bias, and selective reporting. If insufficient detail was reported in the study, the risk of bias was judged as 'unclear'. The assessment was performed independently by two reviewers based on the Cochrane Handbook 2011.

Outcomes

For this review, the meta-analysis considered PONV as the primary outcome. Secondary, patient-relevant outcomes included time to recovery (awakening, respiratory recovery, orientation, reaching a recovery score, following simple instructions), post-operative pain, agitation on emergence, post-anaesthetic shivering, hospital length of stay, and haemodynamic instability requiring interventions. Additional outcomes on efficacy, safety, and resource consumption are listed in an additional file (Additional file 1).

Statistical analysis

Quantitative synthesis was performed for data from eligible RCTs as the primary meta-analysis. A secondary meta-analysis included information from additional observational studies. Common estimates were derived from fixed-effect models using the inverse-variance and Mantel-Haenszel approach for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. In the presence of high heterogeneity, random-effects models were applied.

### Satisfaction and safety using dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation during endoscopic oesophageal procedures: A randomised controlled trial [^117RigEZ]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). High credibility.

Dexmedetomidine possesses anxiolytic and hypnotic properties without respiratory side-effects, making it theoretically an ideal sedative agent for endoscopic procedures.

- **Objective**: We aimed to compare satisfaction and safety among outpatients receiving sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol for endoscopic oesophageal procedures.

- **Design**: A randomised controlled study.

- **Setting**: Endoscopic intervention suite at the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

- **Participants**: Patients aged at least 18 years, and American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status 1 to 3.

- **Intervention**: A total of 63 patients were randomised to receive either dexmedetomidine (D) or propofol (P). Pain was treated with alfentanil in both groups.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes were patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction levels measured by validated questionnaires (1 = very dissatisfied; 7 = highly satisfied). A secondary outcome was safety, determined by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation during and after the procedure, as well as respiratory rate and noninvasive cardiac output during the procedure.

- **Results**: Satisfaction of patients [median (IQR); group D, 5.0 (3.75 to 5.75) vs. group P, 6.25 (5.3 to 6.5)] and satisfaction of gastroenterologists [group D, 5.0 (4.4 to 5.8) vs. group P, 6.0 (5.4 to 6.0)] were lower in group D (both P < 0.001). More patients in group D would not recommend this form of sedation to one of their friends (group D, 15 of 32 vs. group P, 1 of 31; P < 0.001). Thirty minutes after the procedure, heart rate [group D, 60 bpm (52 to 69) vs. group…

### Impact of regional anesthesia on gastroesophageal cancer surgery outcomes: A systematic review of the literature [^115zDFWY]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Regional anesthesia may play a beneficial role in long-term oncological outcomes. Specifically, it has been suggested that it can prolong recurrence-free survival and overall survival after gastrointestinal cancer surgery, including gastric and esophageal cancer, by modulating the immune and inflammatory response. However, the results from human studies are conflicting.

The goal of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on the impact of regional anesthesia on immunomodulation and cancer recurrence after gastric and esophageal surgery. We conducted a literature search of five different databases. Two independent reviewers analyzed the quality of the selected manuscripts according to prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomized controlled trials were assessed for potential sources of bias by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

A total of six studies were included in the quality analysis and systematic review. A meta-analysis was not conducted for several reasons, including high heterogeneity among studies, low quality of the reports, and lack of standardized outcomes definitions. Although the literature suggests that regional anesthesia has some modulatory effects on the inflammatory and immunological response in the studied patient population, our systematic review indicates that there is no evidence to support or refute the use of epidural anesthesia or analgesia with the goal of reducing cancer recurrence after gastroesophageal cancer surgery.

### Fentanyl-induced hemodynamic changes after esophagectomy or cardiac surgery [^111JnK8h]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to characterize the hemodynamic response to propofol versus propofol with fentanyl when used for sedation after esophagectomy or cardiac surgery.

- **Design**: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.

- **Setting**: University Hospital, Intensive Care Unit.

- **Patients**: Thirty patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery and twenty-six patients undergoing esophagectomy were examined.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomized to receive propofol (0.5 mg/kg bolus over 10 minutes, followed by continuous infusion at 1 mg/kg per hour) with or without fentanyl (2.0 µg/kg per hour) to achieve sedation overnight while in the intensive care unit. Randomization was performed in a double-blind manner.

- **Measurement**: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was monitored throughout the treatment period, and sedation level was measured. Sedation level was targeted to achieve a Ramsay score of 4.

- **Main results**: The number of patients experiencing a greater than 20% drop in baseline MAP was higher in cardiac patients receiving propofol alone (11 of 15 patients, 73%) than in cardiac patients receiving propofol with fentanyl (4 of 15 patients, 27%). Furthermore, the time of optimal sedation was lower in the cardiac patients who received propofol than in cardiac patients who received propofol with fentanyl (propofol alone, 79%; propofol with fentanyl, 88%). In contrast, there was no difference in the number of esophagectomy patients experiencing a greater than 20% drop in baseline MAP or in the mean time of optimal sedation when comparing the two treatment regimens.

### Guide to enhanced recovery for cancer patients undergoing surgery: ERAS and oesophagectomy [^117R8NmB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Recommendations for anaesthetic management include the use of intermediate-acting neuromuscular blockades, crystalloid fluid replacement, balanced fluid replacement strategies, and lung-protective strategies such as low tidal volumes (6–8 ml/kg) and 2–5 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Both inhaled and intravenous anaesthesia are effective for anaesthesia maintenance.

There is currently insufficient evidence to provide recommendations on routine pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing, inspiratory muscle training, intra-operative pyloroplasty, or to advocate a specific route for post-operative enteral feeding. In this rapidly growing area of peri-operative research, it is important that protocols are regularly reviewed and adapted in light of the most recent available evidence. Over time, new concepts may be added, and previous elements removed or amended.

### Propofol-ketamine and propofol-fentanyl combinations for nonanesthetist-administered sedation [^117DMoru]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare propofol requirements between propofol-ketamine (PK) and propofol-fentanyl (PF) when administered as nonanesthetist-administered sedation during pediatric esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

- **Methods**: The study was a parallel-group, randomized, double-blind comparison examining the need for additional doses of propofol in the first minute after sedation induction between PK and PF. It involved rotating pediatric trainees for sedation during pediatric EGD. A total of 95 children, aged 3 to 12 years, classified as ASA class I to III, were randomized into two groups. Following midazolam premedication, children received either 0.5 mg/kg ketamine (PK) or 1 μg/kg of fentanyl (PF), followed by a mandatory 1 mg/kg of propofol. Additional doses of propofol (0.5 mg/kg each) were administered to achieve sedation induction (modified Ramsay scale level 6) and as needed during the procedure. A total of 92 children (PK, n = 47; PF, n = 45) were analyzed. A significance level of P < 0.05 was used.

- **Results**: There was no difference in the propofol dose required for successful scope introduction or in the need for additional propofol doses in the first minute after sedation induction. Pain during propofol injection was higher in the PF group (odds ratio 1.78). Adverse events and recovery times were similar between groups. No escalation of care, airway intubations, deaths, or disabilities occurred.

The study concludes that nonanesthetist-administered propofol-ketamine and propofol-fentanyl combinations are comparable in terms of propofol requirements and safety profile for sedation during pediatric EGD.

### The variability of response to propofol is reduced when a clinical observation is incorporated in the control: a simulation study [^111cP86a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

When using a target-controlled infusion of propofol to produce sedation, the operator assumes that the individual patient's pharmacokinetic parameters match those in the control system so that the specified effect-site target is achieved, and that the specified target is appropriate for the individual patient's sensitivity. These inaccuracies cascade, producing error in the desired level of sedation, termed "target error". To address this issue, we designed a control system that incorporates the operator's observation of loss of responsiveness to determine patient sensitivity. Our hypothesis was that this control system would reduce the impact of pharmacokinetic parameter error and uncertainty in sensitivity on the system's target error.

- **Methods**: A novel control system was implemented that produces a slow transition in the probability of loss of responsiveness, providing the operator with greater resolution to observe the time of this transition. The system uses the time of this transition to infer the effect-site concentration associated with loss of responsiveness, and the infusion sequence necessary to maintain this concentration. We used computer simulation to generate a population of 10,000 patients with randomly distributed pharmacokinetic parameters and sensitivity to propofol and compared the target error of our system with that of a target-controlled infusion system targeting the effect-site concentration associated with a 50% probability of loss of responsiveness.

- **Results**: Our system exhibited a target error of -0.75% ± 8.96%, compared with 0%.

### Chronic smoking is not associated with increased postoperative opioid use in patients with lung cancer or esophageal cancer [^111mt3UJ]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic smokers show differences in pain sensitivity compared to healthy non-smokers; yet, no study at the time of writing has examined whether smoker status has an effect on postoperative pain. We aimed to examine a possible correlation between preoperative smoking and postoperative opioid dose based on the hypothesis that smokers would use higher doses of opioids to manage increased postoperative pain.

- **Study design**: A retrospective observational cohort study.
- **Setting**: The National Cancer Center in Korea.
- **Methods**: We examined medical record data for patients who had undergone curative resection for either lung or esophageal cancer (lobectomy or bilobectomy for lung cancer or an Ivor Lewis operation for esophageal cancer) between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010. We examined the correlation between the total preoperative average number of packs per day multiplied by years of cigarette smoking (pack-years) and morphine equivalent daily doses administered to patients after surgery, considering each type of cancer both individually and together. Partial correlation and regression analyses were performed to determine the causality of a possible relationship between pack-years of cigarette smoking and postoperative opioid dose.
- **Results**: A total of 1,129 patients (871 with lung cancer and 258 with esophageal cancer) were included in the final analysis. There was no significant correlation between total pack-years of cigarette smoking and postoperative opioid dose for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, or both cancer types combined (r = 0.042, -0.012).

### Xeloda [^115FN6wT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended dosage for gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer is as follows:

- **Dosage for unresectable or metastatic cases**: 625 mg/m² orally twice daily on days 1 to 21 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 8 cycles, in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Alternatively, patients can be administered 850 mg/m² or 1,000 mg/m² orally twice daily for the first 14 days of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. This is to be used in combination with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m², administered intravenously on day 1 of each cycle. It is essential to individualize the dose and dosing schedule of Xeloda based on patient risk factors and observed adverse reactions.

- **Dosage for HER2-overexpressing metastatic cases**: The recommended dosage is 1,000 mg/m² orally twice daily for the first 14 days of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, used in combination with cisplatin and trastuzumab. For additional dosing information on agents used in combination, refer to the Prescribing Information.

- **Pancreatic cancer dosage**: The recommended dosage of Xeloda is 830 mg/m² orally twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 6 cycles. This is to be combined with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m², which is administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Refer to the Prescribing Information for gemcitabine for additional dosing details.

- **Dosage modifications for adverse reactions**: Monitor patients closely and adjust dosages as necessary based on individual patient response and tolerance to the treatment regimen.

### Target-controlled versus manually-controlled infusion of propofol for direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy [^1145r2EN]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Few studies have compared the clinical profile of target-controlled infusions of propofol with that of manually-controlled infusions. Fifty-four ASA physical status I or II patients scheduled for an elective otorhinolaryngology endoscopy, performed under general anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation, were enrolled in this prospective randomized study to compare the clinical outcome of such administrations. Before induction, all patients received a single alfentanil bolus dose (10 microg/kg). Propofol administration was adapted to maintain the absence of movement, hemodynamic stability, and efficient spontaneous ventilation.

When compared with the manually-controlled infusion group, in the target-controlled infusion group there were fewer movements at insertion of the laryngoscope (14.8% vs. 44.4%), improved hemodynamic stability (largest variations of mean arterial blood pressure < 10% of control values, versus 20%), fewer episodes of apnea, and less respiratory acidosis after endoscopy (pH = 7.37 ± 0.05 and PaCO(2) = 50 ± 7 mm Hg versus pH = 7.28 ± 0.06 and PaCO(2) = 58 ± 9 mm Hg); the recovery was also shorter (time to opening eyes or verbal response, 4.6 ± 2.0 min and 6.8 ± 2.5 min versus 10.8 ± 7.3 min and 15.7 ± 7.1 min). Propofol consumption was comparable in the two groups. Targeting the effect-site concentration improved the time course of the propofol drug effect during direct laryngoscopy performed during spontaneous ventilation when compared with manual infusion.

- **Implications**: This study compares the clinical profile of propofol anesthesia.

### Propofol sedation with a target-controlled infusion pump and bispectral index monitoring system in elderly patients during a complex upper endoscopy procedure [^117UTPvS]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Although the usefulness of propofol sedation during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasms was reported previously, information is limited on its use in elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of propofol sedation with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring system (TCI/BIS system) in elderly patients during gastric ESD.

- **Methods**: Included were 413 consecutive gastric ESD procedures involving 455 lesions (379 patients) performed under propofol sedation with a TCI/BIS system between October 2009 and September 2013. Patients were divided into three groups: group A, age < 70 years (n = 162); group B, age ≥ 70 and < 80 years (n = 171); and group C, age ≥ 80 years (n = 80). We compared the propofol dose and adverse events (e.g. hypotension and hypoxemia) during ESD.

- **Results**: Older groups required a lower target concentration of propofol (group A: median 2.1 μg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 1.9–2.3]; group B: median 1.6 μg/mL [IQR, 1.3–1.8]; and group C: median 1.4 μg/mL [IQR, 1.2–1.6]; P < .0001). Hypotension tended to occur in the younger group, and hypoxemia occurred at a significantly higher rate in the older groups, although the number of cases was small. Low preoperative systolic blood pressure (≤ 125 mm Hg) was associated with hypotension (odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.70; p = 0.013), and abnormal pulmonary function was associated with hypoxemia in groups B and C (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.01–31.5; p = 0.048).

- **Conclusions**: Elderly patients required lower target concentrations of propofol for sedation during gastric ESD, and attention should be paid to preoperative blood pressure and pulmonary function to manage potential adverse events effectively.

The aim of this study was to compare the recovery time, clinical presentations, and satisfaction between target-controlled infusion (TCI) and manually controlled infusion (MCI) in same-day bidirectional endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy followed by colonoscopy).

A total of 220 patients with American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1 or 2 were enrolled and randomized into the TCI or MCI groups. The clinical presentations, vasoactive drug demand, propofol consumption, and adverse events were recorded for both groups peri-procedurally. The concentrations of propofol in the plasma (Cp) and at the site of drug effect (Ce) by computerized simulation were also monitored in both groups. Finally, the satisfaction of patients, endoscopists, and nurse anesthetists was assessed by questionnaire after the examinations.

Compared with the MCI group, the TCI group had a faster recovery time (17.91 ± 7.72 minutes vs. 14.58 ± 8.55 minutes; P = 0.002), less moderate hypotension (7.37 ± 15.46% vs. 1.82 ± 5.15%; P < 0.001), and a shorter period of bradypnea (13.81 ± 15.92% vs. 9.18 ± 12.00%; P = 0.013). In addition, the TCI group reduced the relative risk of moderate desaturation by 50% compared with the MCI group (30.9% vs. 15.5%; 95% confidence interval 1.191–3.360; P = 0.007).

The study demonstrated that TCI of propofol combined with alfentanil was associated with a faster recovery time and reduced adverse effects compared to MCI methods during bidirectional endoscopy procedures.

### Effects of sevoflurane and propofol on the development of pneumonia after esophagectomy: a retrospective cohort study [^1127SZev]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

The baseline characteristics and intraoperative parameters of the included patients were presented according to the anesthetic type. Before propensity matching, there was an uneven distribution of confounders between the sevoflurane and propofol groups. More patients experienced preoperative chemoradiotherapy (P = 0.046) and fewer had a history of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.013) in the sevoflurane group compared with the propofol group. Additionally, patients in the propofol group were infused with more crystalloid, ensuring an even distribution of confounders between the two groups.

Comparisons of postoperative clinical outcomes before and after propensity score matching showed that before matching, 151 (9.6%) patients in the sevoflurane group and 7 (8.0%) in the propofol group developed postoperative pneumonia (PP). After propensity score matching, the incidences of PP were 7.7% and 6.4% in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference in the incidence of PP was found between the sevoflurane and propofol groups before or after matching.

### Cooperative-pfa: A three-arm randomized controlled trial [^113dwwYS]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Patients randomized to the TIVA arm were initially sedated with a slow propofol infusion and a sufentanil bolus. General anesthesia was induced after the transseptal puncture using a bolus of sufentanil and propofol administered via a target-controlled infusion system (PK model Schnider, Perfusor Space, B. Braun, Germany). The target plasma concentration was set at 5 to 8 µg/mL for induction and adjusted to 3 to 6 µg/mL for maintenance of anesthesia. After the administration of a reduced dose of rocuronium (0.2–0.4 mg/kg ideal body weight) to facilitate mechanical ventilation, the airway was secured with an iGel laryngeal mask airway (LMA).

The ventilator was set to a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.3 to 0.4, and minute ventilation was tailored to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) of 30 to 40 mm Hg. The target-controlled infusion could be adjusted as necessary, and the infusion was discontinued after the last ablation pulse. The LMA was removed upon return to consciousness. For a step-by-step description of each arm, see the study details.

### Low-dose propofol sedation for diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy: Results in 10,662 adults [^116hhuB4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). High credibility.

Use of propofol sedation during endoscopic procedures has increased in recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of nurse-administered low-dose propofol sedation for diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

- **Methods**: We prospectively assessed the outcome and complications of low-dose bolus propofol for endoscopic sedation for diagnostic EGD. Propofol was administered by bolus injection, with a standard protocol of 40 mg for patients under 70 years, 30 mg for patients aged 70–89 years, and 20 mg for patients 90 years or older. When required for adequate sedation, additional doses were given, with a maximum of 120 mg. The primary outcome measure was respiratory depression, defined as oxygen desaturation (SpO2 < 90%) continuing for more than 20 seconds. Secondary measures included successful procedures, full recovery within 60 minutes of the procedure, and complications.

- **Results**: All procedures were successful; 8,431 of 10,662 patients (79.1%) completed diagnostic EGD with a single bolus of propofol. Only 0.26% (28 patients) required a transient supplemental oxygen supply; neither mask ventilation nor endotracheal intubation was needed. Full recovery occurred in 99.9% of patients 60 minutes after the procedure. Men and younger patients required significantly higher doses of propofol than women and older patients (men vs. women, 46.5 ± 19 vs. 42.7 ± 15 mg, P = 0.0008; age 40–49 vs. age 50–59, 51.5 ± 16 vs. 46.3 ± 13 mg, P < 0.0001). Of the 400 patients, 368 (92%) wanted to drive home or to their offices, and all did so without incident.

### Deep sedation using propofol target-controlled infusion for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures: a retrospective cohort study [^115efJZi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures (GIEPs) under propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) sedation combined with fentanyl were not exempted from experiencing cardiovascular or respiratory unplanned events. Specifically, grade II and III obese patients showed a significant dose-effect relationship with SpO2 < 90% events. Nonetheless, propofol TCI sedation appears to be an effective sedative strategy for GIEPs, offering benefits such as acceptable rates of unplanned adverse events, short discharge times, and rapid patient turnover. Further prospective studies should be conducted to accurately assess patient comfort and the quality of sedation for this type of procedure.

### Deep sedation using propofol target-controlled infusion for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures: a retrospective cohort study [^112Siz3K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Propofol sedation is effective for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, but its narrow therapeutic window highlights the importance of identifying an optimal administration technique regarding effectiveness and safety. This study aimed to determine the incidence of significant adverse events in adult patients scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy under anesthetist-performed sedation using propofol target-controlled infusion and determine the existence of associations between these events and potentially related variables.

- **Methods**: This single-centre, retrospective cohort study took place in a tertiary referral university hospital. Medical records of 823 patients (age > 18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification scores I–III) who had undergone elective gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol target-controlled infusion sedation during September 2018 were reviewed. Outcomes included hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia events, requirement of vasoactive drugs, unplanned tracheal intubation or supraglottic device insertion, and need for advanced cardiac life support.

- **Results**: The most frequently encountered adverse event was oxygen desaturation < 95% with an incidence of 22.35%. Vasoactive drug administration, hypotension, and oxygen desaturation < 90% followed, with incidences of 19.2%, 12.64%, and 9.92%, respectively. Only 0.5% of patients required advanced airway management. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between hypotension events, colonoscopic procedures, and propofol doses (odds ratio: 3.08, 95% confidence interval…).

### Tailoring esophageal cancer surgery [^115CDuft]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer is a significant source of major mortality worldwide and is increasing dramatically in incidence. Without treatment, this disease leads rapidly to death, but intervention also carries significant risk. Therefore, a carefully tailored approach must be used to maximize oncological efficacy while minimizing the negative consequences of intervention.

Careful patient selection based on histologic and anatomic staging, consideration of each patient's clinical variables, appropriately timing chemo- and radiation therapy, and minimizing the morbidity of surgical intervention may significantly improve a patient's chances of surviving this disease. Each of these steps must be carefully orchestrated with a tailored approach to treatment. This review will serve as a guide to tailoring surgery for esophageal cancer.

### Esophageal cancer and the esophagus: Challenges and potential strategies for selective cytoprotection of the tumor-bearing organ during cancer treatment [^116ChzB2]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer is treated optimally with a combined-modality approach according to most clinical investigators. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and ionizing radiotherapy, given in a concomitant schedule, have yielded superior survival rates compared with radiotherapy alone. However, mucosal toxicity from such treatment may compromise quality of life and may mandate an unscheduled break in therapy in some patients who do not respond readily to standard treatments, such as antacids; combinations of viscous xylocaine, aluminum hydroxide-magnesium carbonate, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride; oral liquid morphine sulfate, hydrocodone bitartrate, or acetaminophen. Hence, a number of alternative strategies that are designed to either prevent or limit toxicity to normal tissues without diminishing the antitumor effect are being tested. These include the use of conformal radiotherapy treatment planning techniques, amifostine (Ethyol, WR-2721), gene therapy via intratumoral injection of manganese superoxide dismutase-plasmid/liposome, glutamine, melatonin, omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, transforming growth factor, flavonoid compounds, probucol, and keratinizing growth factor. An ongoing phase 2 trial by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) may help clarify a role for cytoprotectants in patients receiving combined-modality therapy for esophageal cancer.

### Chemoradiation therapy for oesophageal cancer with airway stenosis under mechanical ventilation with light sedation using dexmedetomidine alone [^115ew5Q3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

For malignant tumours, treatment is rarely indicated in cases requiring mechanical ventilation management because such intensive care would engender a decrease in performance status. However, light sedation using dexmedetomidine might enable chemoradiation while accommodating activities of daily living. We experienced two cases of fatal tracheal invasion and airway stenosis of stage IV oesophageal cancer that were treated with chemoradiation or radiation under mechanical ventilation (one case was differential lung ventilation) with dexmedetomidine alone, and rehabilitation was performed under a ventilator. Early mobilisation by light sedation with dexmedetomidine can inhibit performance status decline attributable to mechanical ventilation. Bridging tracheal intubation with light sedation by dexmedetomidine for temporary chemoradiation therapy to reduce tumour volume might present a good alternative for patients with malignant tumour.

### Effect of volatile anesthesia versus intravenous anesthesia on postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy: A randomized clinical trial [^115wEwbo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). High credibility.

The effect of intraoperative anesthetic regimen on pulmonary outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is yet undetermined. This study aimed to determine the effect of volatile anesthesia (sevoflurane or desflurane) compared with propofol-based intravenous anesthesia on pulmonary complications after minimally invasive esophagectomy.

- **Methods**: Patients scheduled for minimally invasive esophagectomy were randomly assigned to one of three general anesthetic regimens (sevoflurane, desflurane, or propofol). The primary outcome was the incidence of pulmonary complications within seven days postoperatively, which was a collapsed composite endpoint including respiratory infection, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, atelectasis, respiratory failure, bronchospasm, pulmonary embolism, and aspiration pneumonitis. The severity of pulmonary complications, surgery-related complications, and other secondary outcomes were also assessed.

- **Results**: Of 647 patients assessed for eligibility, 558 were randomized, and 553 were analyzed. A total of 185 patients were assigned to the sevoflurane group, 185 in the desflurane group, and 183 in the propofol group. Patients receiving a volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane or desflurane) had a significantly lower incidence (36.5% vs. 47.5%; odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–0.91; p = 0.013) and lower severity grade of pulmonary complications (P = 0.035) compared to the patients receiving propofol. There were no statistically significant differences in other secondary outcomes between the two groups.

### Deep sedation using propofol target-controlled infusion for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures: a retrospective cohort study [^112EAgbR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

During the post-anaesthetic period, the most frequent adverse event was arterial hypotension, with an incidence of 4.6% (38/823), followed by oxygen saturation (SaO₂) < 90% events. This association depicted a strong dose–effect relationship; taking non-obese patients as a reference, the risk for those with BMI 30–35 (grade 1 obesity) was almost double, with an OR of 1.68 (CI 95%: 0.84 to 3.32). Patients with BMI 35–40 (grade 2, severe obesity) and BMI ≥ 40 (grade 3, morbid obesity) were three times (OR 2.85, CI 95%: 1.09 to 7.46) and nine times (OR 10.22, CI 95%: 2.83 to 36.99) more likely to experience SaO₂ < 90% events, respectively.

### A new method for comprehensive analysis of benzodiazepine, opioid, and propofol interactions and dose selection rationales in gastrointestinal endoscopy sedation [^111ZFRdx]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to explore a new method for determining optimal dosing regimens for combinations of propofol, midazolam, and an opioid to achieve rapid onset and offset of deep sedation.

- **Methods**: We simulated 16 published dosing regimens using a well-validated pharmacodynamic model. The study was divided into two parts. First, the regimen that best provided deep sedation and rapid recovery was selected. A deep sedation-time area-under-the-curve (AUC) method was used to compare published dosing regimens; a higher AUC indicated better sedation and faster recovery. Second, a subgroup analysis of the best-performing dosing regimen was undertaken to better understand how each drug affected patient recovery.

- **Results**: The AUC method identified a combination of midazolam 1 mg, alfentanil 500 µg, and propofol target infusion effect-site concentration (Ce) 2 µg/mL as the optimal regimen. In contrast, midazolam 3 mg greatly prolonged recovery.

- **Conclusions**: This study used a clinically relevant method and model simulation to determine suitable sedation regimens for use in gastrointestinal endoscopy. A balanced propofol, midazolam…

### Effects of sevoflurane and propofol on the development of pneumonia after esophagectomy: A retrospective cohort study [^111wom9x]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the effects of anesthetics on the release of inflammatory markers, without providing sufficient data on postoperative clinical outcomes. Esophagectomy may induce a greater systemic stress response and cause less alveolar injury compared to pulmonary surgery. To our knowledge, few studies have systematically compared the effects of propofol and sevoflurane on the development of postoperative pneumonia (PP) after esophageal surgery. Our study found that two different anesthesia methods had similar effects on the PP rate in patients undergoing esophagectomy. This finding aligns with Lee's study, where sevoflurane was not proven to be superior to propofol in reducing postoperative pulmonary complications, despite its attenuation of increases in inflammatory markers at the end of esophageal operations. It appears that the inflammatory-modulating effects of sevoflurane and propofol may not persist into the postoperative period.

In this study, we also demonstrated that alcohol use, surgical procedure, and surgeon experience were independent risk factors for PP, while patients with increased BMI appeared to be less likely to develop PP. However, since the BMI of most patients in this study remained within the normal range, the effect of BMI on PP should be considered of merely statistical significance, with its clinical relevance potentially requiring further investigation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and preoperative pulmonary infections are critical factors in PP development. However, these conditions were rare in our hospital. Only 14 (0.8%) patients were affected (all in the sevoflurane group).

### Diprivan [^115Mixhw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a three-compartment linear model, with compartments representing the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly equilibrating tissues. Following an IV bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset of anesthesia. Plasma levels initially decline rapidly as a result of both distribution and metabolic clearance. Distribution accounts for about half of this decline following a bolus of propofol. However, distribution is not constant over time; it decreases as body tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated. The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate and duration of the infusion. When equilibration occurs, there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between tissues and plasma.

Discontinuation of the recommended doses of Diprivan after maintaining anesthesia for approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day, results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations and rapid awakening. Longer infusions (10 days of ICU sedation) result in the accumulation of significant tissue stores of propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is slowed, and the time to awakening is increased.

By daily titration of Diprivan dosage to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration, rapid awakening within 10 to 15 minutes can occur even after long-term administration. If, however, higher-than-necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time, propofol re…
