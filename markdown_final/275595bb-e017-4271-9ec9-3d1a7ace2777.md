## Question

Signs and symptoms of piriformis syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs and symptoms of piriformis syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and epidemiology to anchor what we are calling piriformis syndrome. Then, I should verify the characteristic patient-reported symptoms and how they are aggravated. Next, I will review the physical examination signs and specific provocative maneuvers, along with their diagnostic accuracy. After that, I need to ensure I address the role of imaging and adjunct tests, keeping in mind that this is largely a clinical diagnosis. Finally, I should confirm key differentials and red flags that mandate alternative diagnoses or urgent action, so we don't miss lumbar radiculopathy or cauda equina syndrome.

> Let me first confirm the construct. Piriformis syndrome is commonly grouped under deep gluteal syndrome, characterized by extrapelvic sciatic nerve entrapment around the infrapiriformis space, but its existence and strict diagnostic criteria remain debated, which means I should not jump to conclusions and must keep a high bar for exclusion of alternatives [^115LxdfY] [^114Pp8ZA] [^113FeAc4]. Wait, I should verify prevalence claims to avoid overstating frequency: estimates range widely, with reports that 5%–36% of low back pain might be attributed to piriformis-related mechanisms and that over 6% of "sciatica" presentations may be due to this entity, though these figures are contested and context dependent [^112PUgqz] [^114zWm4h]. I need to ensure I also consider anatomical variants and muscular hypertrophy as contributing factors, because such variations can predispose to sciatic nerve irritation in this region [^116VHjxT] [^112PUgqz]. Demographically, it is reported more often in middle-aged adults and is unusual in those younger than 20, which helps set pretest probability in clinic [^112gfukW].

> Next, I should review the hallmark patient-reported symptoms. The core complaint is unilateral deep buttock pain, often with posterior-lateral hip discomfort and sciatica-like radiation down the posterior thigh that may extend toward the calf, and I need to remember patients often describe the pain as aching with intermittent sharp exacerbations [^112gfukW] [^114zWm4h]. Hold on, let me verify aggravating factors: symptoms are classically worsened by prolonged sitting (commonly beyond 30 minutes), uphill walking or stairs, and maneuvers that increase piriformis tension, which is consistent across case series and reviews [^112gfukW] [^114zWm4h]. I should confirm associated sensory phenomena as well: paresthesias or numbness can follow the sciatic distribution, while gross focal motor deficits are atypical in isolated piriformis syndrome, and limited hip mobility with discomfort during daily activities is commonly reported [^114zWm4h] [^114JsPVP].

> I will now examine the physical exam signs. I need to check for focal tenderness over the piriformis line, from the greater trochanter toward the greater sciatic foramen, and specifically over the greater sciatic notch, because those palpation findings often reproduce the patient's pain and support the clinical impression when combined with provocative testing [^112gfukW] [^116YsWL6]. Wait, I should verify the neurologic profile: unlike lumbosacral radiculopathy, reflex changes and dermatomal weakness are typically absent, although a straight-leg raise can be positive in piriformis syndrome due to sciatic irritation rather than root compression, which can be misleading if I don't correlate carefully [^114zWm4h]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost assumed the straight-leg raise is broadly sensitive here, but in piriformis-focused series its sensitivity has been reported as low as 15% with high specificity around 95%, underscoring that a negative result does not exclude piriformis involvement and should be interpreted in context [^111xZWFd].

> Next, I should review the provocative maneuvers and their diagnostic characteristics. Let me double-check the common tests: FAIR (hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation), Pace (resisted seated abduction), Freiberg (passive internal rotation of the extended hip), and Beatty (pain with active elevation of the flexed thigh in side-lying) are frequently used and increase tension on the piriformis to reproduce pain, but individually they can be variably sensitive, with earlier literature noting approximately two-thirds positivity rates in suspected cases [^112gfukW] [^114zWm4h]. I should confirm the more quantifiable metrics: the active piriformis test shows sensitivity around 0.78 and specificity around 0.80, the seated piriformis stretch test around 0.52 sensitivity and 0.90 specificity, and combining an active test with a seated stretch increases sensitivity to about 0.91 with specificity near 0.80, which improves the overall diagnostic yield in clinic [^114zWm4h] [^111xZWFd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there is also electrophysiologic FAIR H-reflex prolongation work with reported sensitivity 0.881 and specificity 0.832 supporting a pathophysiologic signal in carefully phenotyped patients, but I need to ensure this is interpreted alongside a normal paraspinal EMG to avoid mislabeling radiculopathy as piriformis syndrome [^113RfnHv]. But wait, what if I need a structured clinical framework? The Michel scoring system that integrates symptoms, signs, and maneuvers has been reported with sensitivity 96.4% and specificity 100%, though such performance likely reflects spectrum and setting effects and should be applied judiciously [^112gfukW].

> Let me consider imaging and adjunct tests. I should confirm that diagnosis remains primarily clinical, even though pelvic MRI can sometimes demonstrate an enlarged piriformis with anterior displacement of the sciatic nerve, and ultrasound can show increased muscle thickness and cross-sectional area with fairly strong discrimination of symptomatic from asymptomatic sides, which helps in equivocal cases and for guiding interventions [^113ZNk7c] [^1116Z6rN]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of ultrasound data: AUROCs for increased thickness and cross-sectional area have been reported at approximately 0.88 and 0.95, respectively, and intrarater reliability for CSA can be high, but studies are small and selection-biased, so these findings should complement, not replace, a thorough clinical assessment [^1116Z6rN] [^111BgyB3]. I need to ensure I keep perspective that imaging can assist in excluding other causes and in planning injections, yet the absence of a single definitive test means clinical synthesis remains paramount [^116YsWL6] [^112gfukW].

> Now, I should review the broader diagnostic approach and differentials. I need to ensure lumbar spine pathology is carefully excluded because piriformis syndrome is fundamentally a diagnosis of exclusion; lumbar MRI is often appropriate when radicular symptoms or back findings are prominent, and misclassification is common without a deliberate search for disc herniation or stenosis [^114Pp8ZA] [^111xZWFd]. Hold on, I should verify common mimics by level and region to avoid anchoring: multiple musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve disorders can reproduce leg pain patterns attributed to L5 or S1 radiculopathy, so correlating dermatomal deficits, reflex changes, and paraspinal EMG with focal gluteal tenderness and piriformis-provoked pain is essential to prevent overdiagnosis [^114qNwGW]. Let me also consider the broader deep gluteal syndrome framework, because entrapment can occur at multiple sites beyond the piriformis and may require pelvic MRI to localize pathology when initial evaluation is inconclusive [^115LxdfY].

> I should confirm the red flags that argue against piriformis syndrome and demand alternative evaluation or urgent care. True motor weakness with myotomal distribution, reflex asymmetry, progressive neurologic deficits, saddle anesthesia, or bowel and bladder dysfunction point to lumbosacral root or cauda equina involvement and should prompt immediate spine imaging and surgical consultation rather than a peripheral entrapment workup [^112PtcP9]. But wait, what if the pain cannot be reproduced by piriformis-specific maneuvers and there is prominent midline back pain preceding leg symptoms? In that setting, lumbar pathology becomes more likely, and I need to revisit the differential comprehensively rather than forcing a piriformis label [^114Pp8ZA] [^114zWm4h].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize to ensure internal consistency. Clinically, piriformis syndrome presents with unilateral deep buttock pain that often radiates down the posterior thigh, worsens with sitting and activities that tension the piriformis, features focal tenderness over the piriformis line or greater sciatic notch, and reproduces pain on tests such as FAIR, Pace, Freiberg, Beatty, and the active piriformis test, while neurologic examination typically lacks dermatomal weakness or reflex loss and imaging remains adjunctive, not definitive [^112gfukW] [^114zWm4h] [^116YsWL6] [^1116Z6rN]. I should double-check that my summary aligns with the evidence that combined provocative testing improves sensitivity, ultrasound and MRI can document morphological changes, and the condition remains controversial and primarily one of exclusion, with careful attention to lumbar and deep gluteal differentials and to red flags suggesting central causes that require urgent action [^111xZWFd] [^1116Z6rN] [^113FeAc4] [^114Pp8ZA] [^112PtcP9].

Piriformis syndrome presents with **buttock pain** radiating down the posterior thigh [^112gfukW], often mimicking sciatica [^115LxdfY], and is typically worsened by sitting, climbing stairs, or prolonged hip flexion [^114zWm4h]. Patients may report **numbness or tingling** in the leg [^114zWm4h], tenderness over the piriformis muscle [^113JnUS7], and pain reproduced by provocative tests such as FAIR, Pace, or Freiberg maneuvers [^113RfnHv] [^116YsWL6]. Symptoms are usually unilateral [^112gfukW] and aggravated by activities that tension the piriformis [^114Pp8ZA]; motor weakness is uncommon but may occur with significant sciatic compression [^114zWm4h] [^113FeAc4].

## Pain characteristics

- **Buttock pain**: The hallmark symptom [^112gfukW], typically deep, aching, or sharp, localized to the gluteal region [^114JsPVP].

- **Radiating pain**: Pain often radiates down the posterior thigh [^114zWm4h], sometimes extending to the calf or foot, mimicking sciatica [^115LxdfY].

- **Unilateral presentation**: Symptoms are usually unilateral, corresponding to the affected piriformis muscle [^112gfukW] [^114Pp8ZA].

- **Aggravating factors**: Pain is exacerbated by prolonged sitting [^112gfukW], climbing stairs, squatting, or activities involving hip flexion and internal rotation [^111bv5xy].

---

## Neurological symptoms

- **Paresthesia**: Numbness, tingling, or burning sensations along the sciatic nerve distribution [^114Pp8ZA] [^114zWm4h].

- **Sensory disturbances**: Altered sensation or hypoesthesia in the posterior thigh, calf, or foot [^112gfukW] [^114zWm4h].

- **Motor weakness**: Less common, but may occur if significant sciatic nerve compression is present [^114zWm4h] [^113FeAc4].

---

## Physical examination findings

- **Tenderness**: Palpable tenderness over the piriformis muscle, typically midway between the sacrum and greater trochanter [^112gfukW] [^113JnUS7].

- **Positive FAIR test**: Pain reproduced with hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation [^113RfnHv] [^114zWm4h] [^111TmJHn].

- **Positive Pace test**: Pain elicited during resisted hip abduction and external rotation [^113JnUS7] [^116YsWL6].

- **Positive Freiberg test**: Pain induced by passive internal rotation of the extended thigh [^116YsWL6] [^113JnUS7].

---

## Functional limitations

Patients may exhibit **gait disturbances** such as limping or altered gait due to pain and muscle spasm [^112gfukW]. There is typically **reduced hip mobility** — particularly in internal rotation and abduction [^114JsPVP] — and many patients experience discomfort or an inability to sit for prolonged periods [^111bv5xy].

---

## Associated symptoms

Piriformis **muscle spasm or tightness** is common [^1132CbqX]. Patients may also experience **low back pain** due to altered biomechanics and compensatory movements [^115LxdfY], and pain may interfere with sleep, particularly when lying on the affected side [^112gfukW].

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^113JnUS7]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Low credibility.

Piriformis muscle syndrome (PS) is a disorder encompassing a constellation of symptoms, including buttock or hip pain. It has been described for over 500 years, yet it remains controversial. PS is more frequently encountered in middle-aged patients and is rarely seen in patients younger than 20 years of age.

There are several methods for the diagnosis of PS. Clinically, tenderness with palpation over the piriformis muscle is common. In the Pace test, pain is elicited on resisted leg abduction while seated. The Freiberg test is a passive maneuver in which a forceful internal rotation of the extended thigh induces buttock pain by stretching the piriformis muscle. Notably, the Freiberg and Pace tests are positive in only 67% of patients. Michel et al. proposed a scoring system consisting of clinical symptoms, signs, and several provocative maneuvers for PS diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of this system were 96.4% and 100%, respectively.

Ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to diagnose PS. It is difficult to visualize subtle changes in muscle and soft tissue with CT, and MRI provides a far more detailed evaluation. US, which exhibits promise in guiding muscle injections, is more convenient, with no radiation exposure. However, only a few case report studies have used US for PS diagnosis, and a systematic study of US diagnosis evaluation of the piriformis muscle in PS has not yet been reported.

### The clinical features of the piriformis syndrome: A systematic review [^112gfukW]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome, sciatica caused by compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle, has been described for over 70 years; yet, it remains controversial. The literature consists mainly of case series and narrative reviews.

The objectives of the study were to make the best use of existing evidence to estimate the frequencies of clinical features in patients reported to have piriformis syndrome and to identify future research questions. A systematic review was conducted of any study type that reported extractable data relevant to diagnosis. The search included all studies up to 1 March 2008 in four databases: AMED, CINAHL, Embase, and Medline. Screening, data extraction, and analysis were all performed independently by two reviewers.

A total of 55 studies were included: 51 individual studies, 3 aggregated data studies, and 1 combined study. The most common features found were buttock pain, external tenderness over the greater sciatic notch, aggravation of the pain through sitting, and augmentation of the pain with maneuvers that increase piriformis muscle tension. Future research could start with comparing the frequencies of these features in sciatica patients with and without disc herniation or spinal stenosis.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^114zWm4h]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome, sometimes termed deep gluteal syndrome, refers to buttock and/or leg pain caused by impingement of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle where the muscle crosses the sciatic notch, coinciding with where the sciatic nerve exits the pelvis. This diagnosis is somewhat controversial, and its prevalence is debated. In one prospective study, more than 6% of patients presenting with "sciatica" and low back or buttock pain had piriformis syndrome. In studies examining patients with piriformis syndrome, 35%–100% of patients with this condition had radiation of symptoms to the leg, mimicking radiculopathy. Importantly, the supine straight leg raise test, frequently used in radiculopathy, is often positive in persons with piriformis syndrome.

Patients with piriformis syndrome report buttock and/or radicular pain that is often worse with sitting and with increased tension on the piriformis muscle. Reproduction of buttock and/or leg symptoms using physical exam maneuvers that increase tension on the piriformis muscle, such as passive hip internal rotation and adduction with the hip flexed (the FAIR test), and resisted hip abduction with the hip flexed, support the diagnosis. For instance, the active piriformis test, in which patients lie on the contralateral side and tension the piriformis muscle by abducting and externally rotating their hip while the examiner resists these movements, has a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.80. In the passive (seated) piriformis test, tension on the piriformis muscle is generated by having the patient…

### Unveiling appendicitis [^115VKQQn]. Contemporary Nurse (2003). High credibility.

Acute appendicitis is a disease that can be associated with various symptoms including feeling sick, nausea, and elevated CRP. Patients may experience pain in the left lower quadrant (LLQ), vomiting, and abdominal pain. Characteristic signs such as Dunphy's sign, Rovsing's sign, and Rosenstein's sign are also observed. Other symptoms include loss of appetite, periumbilical abdominal pain, suprapubic pain, and sometimes even associations with cancer. Laboratory findings may show an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), while the appendix is often blocked. Patients could suffer from epigastric abdominal pain, fever, poorly localized abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain.

Additional signs of inflammation include right lower quadrant (RLQ) tenderness and Aaron's sign. Diffuse abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and pain at McBurney's point are commonly reported symptoms. Other diagnostic signs include Markle's sign, obturator sign, an elevated Alvarado score, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and pain in Sherren's triangle.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rotator cuff disorders, particularly in relation to the history and physical examination, the APTA 2025 guidelines recommend identifying any signs or symptoms of serious pathology or systemic involvement in patients with shoulder pain. This includes suspicious deformity, fever and/or chills, signs or symptoms suggesting cardiovascular or visceral impairment, and a history or suspicion of cancer.

Laboratory tests: Because serious gastrointestinal tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their complete blood count and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, etc), or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, piroxicam capsules should be discontinued.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: A comprehensive review [^111xZWFd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome occurs when the piriformis muscle compresses or irritates the sciatic nerve, causing symptoms such as buttock and leg pain, altered sensations along the nerve's path, and discomfort while sitting. This condition is more commonly discussed in hip preservation literature, with a few reports in patients post-total hip arthroplasty (THA).

- **Clinical presentation**: Patients often present with vague symptoms that considerably overlap with those of other hip, pelvic, and lumbar spine pathologies, making precise clinical assessment challenging. Multiple clinical tests have been described: the straight leg raise test has a sensitivity of 15% and a specificity of 95%; the active piriformis test shows a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 80%; and the seated piriformis stretch test has a sensitivity of 52% and specificity of 90%. Furthermore, combining the active piriformis test with the seated piriformis stretch test yields a reported sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 80%.

- **Diagnosis studies**: A lumbar MRI examination should be considered to rule out underlying back pathology. Improved MRI resolution, the use of ultrasound-guided injections, and increased awareness may enhance the accuracy of diagnosing piriformis syndrome. However, in our experience, no single diagnostic tool is reliably accurate when used in isolation. The diagnosis is most accurately confirmed when guided injections are used in cases with a high degree of clinical suspicion.

- **Treatment**: Initial management of piriformis syndrome involves rest, activities modifications, NSAIDs, and guided steroid injections, which typically yield positive responses.

### Co-existence of Blau syndrome and NAID? Diagnostic challenges associated with presence of multiple pathogenic variants in NOD2 gene: a case report [^115yhcf1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 7-year-old girl with co-existing symptoms of two rare diseases. Clinical characteristics of Blau syndrome and NAID are listed in Table 1, along with the signs and symptoms present in our patient. As shown in the table, the clinical phenotype of our patient, with overlapping manifestations of NAID and Blau syndrome, correlated with her genotype. Molecular tests demonstrated that our patient carried two alterations characteristic of NAID (1007 fs, IVS8 +158), as well as a genetic anomaly previously found in a child with Blau syndrome (P268S).

Early-onset sarcoidosis (EOS) was also considered during the differential, although, in line with the currently used classification system, this condition represents a sporadic form of Blau syndrome. Principal diagnostic criteria of NAID include recurrent, self-limiting episodes of inflammation lasting days to weeks, the presence of fever of unknown etiology, and/or dermatitis. While our patient satisfied all these criteria, she was much younger than previously reported subjects with NAID. To the best of our knowledge, to date, NAID has not been reported in a pediatric patient. According to the literature, the youngest patient with NAID was aged 17 years, and this condition is typically diagnosed at 40–45 years of age.

However, early onset is typical for another autoinflammatory disease, Blau syndrome. Indeed, some symptoms present in our patient, such as uveitis, granulomatous dermatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, neurological manifestations, and adenopathy, were not typical for NAID but have been previously associated with Blau syndrome.

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^1116Z6rN]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Low credibility.

Piriformis muscle syndrome (PS) is a disorder encompassing a constellation of symptoms, including buttock and hip pain. In this study, we aimed to assess the value of ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of PS.

- **Methods**: Thirty-three clinically diagnosed PS patients and 26 healthy volunteers underwent a clinical PS scoring examination and US and MRI assessment of the bilateral piriformis muscles. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the US parameters (i.e. increased thickness [iTh] and increased cross-sectional area [iCSA]) for the piriformis muscle were evaluated.

- **Results**: On US and MRI, the thickness and CSA were increased in PS patients. The AUROCs for the iTh and iCSA for discriminating stage 0 (healthy volunteers) from stage 1 through stage 3 (PS patients) were 0.88 and 0.95, respectively.

- **Discussion**: US may be a reliable technique for the clinical diagnosis of PS.

### Cauda equina syndrome [^112PtcP9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Cauda equina syndrome is a relatively uncommon condition typically associated with a large, space-occupying lesion within the canal of the lumbosacral spine. The syndrome is characterized by varying patterns of low back pain, sciatica, lower extremity sensorimotor loss, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The pathophysiology remains unclear but may be related to damage to the nerve roots composing the cauda equina from direct mechanical compression and venous congestion or ischemia. Early diagnosis is often challenging because the initial signs and symptoms frequently are subtle. Classically, the full-blown syndrome includes urinary retention, saddle anesthesia of the perineum, bilateral lower extremity pain, numbness, and weakness. Decreased rectal tone may be a relatively late finding.

Early signs and symptoms of a developing postoperative cauda equina syndrome are often attributed to common postoperative findings. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary in the postoperative spine patient with back and/or leg pain refractory to analgesia, especially in the setting of urinary retention. Regardless of the setting, when cauda equina syndrome is diagnosed, the treatment is urgent surgical decompression of the spinal canal.

### Oculobulbar involvement is typical with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^114dsNPb]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Oculobulbar symptoms and/or signs were present in 18 of 23 (78%) of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) patients evaluated at the Lahey Clinic. Sixty-five percent (15 of 23) of our patients had ptosis and/or diplopia, each present in 11 individuals. Bulbar signs and symptoms, including dysarthria in 10 and dysphagia in 8 patients, were also observed among our LEMS population. More than one prereferral oculobulbar feature occurred in 13 of our LEMS patients. Prereferral diagnostic considerations included myasthenia gravis, myopathies, and psychiatric disorders. These findings suggest that these atypical characteristics served to dissuade some colleagues from a diagnosis of LEMS. Thus, the presence of oculobulbar symptoms and signs cannot be used to exclude LEMS from the differential diagnosis.

### Guillain-Barré syndrome presenting with COVID-19 infection [^112pSjzL]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A construction worker in his 30s presented three times in four days with progressive upper and then lower limb weakness. On the first two occasions, he had no systemic symptoms, but on the third presentation, he had fever and cough, starting from day four of weakness. Examination identified weakness in all four limbs and areflexia, suggesting a peripheral neuromuscular disorder. Investigations were consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome and additional COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The patient improved after immunoglobulin treatment.

At least four cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported in the literature with concurrent COVID-19 illness in which respiratory signs appeared a few days after the onset of neurological signs. With the incubation period for COVID-19 respiratory symptoms believed to be up to 14 days, it is possible that neurological symptoms could develop before respiratory and other symptoms. During the pandemic, the presence of concurrent COVID-19 infection needs to be considered in patients presenting with Guillain-Barré syndrome.

### Is there an association between serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels and syndrome severity in persistent complex regional pain syndrome [^114WPyen]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The median CRPS syndrome duration was 84 months (Q3 − Q1: 180 − 48 months). In total, 52 out of 53 patients had persistent CRPS with a syndrome duration of more than 1 year (98%). Only one patient had early CRPS with a duration of 5 months. The CRPS duration in years of the included CRPS patients is depicted in a histogram (Figure 2). The mean CRPS severity score was 11 (SD ± 2.3). Fifty-two of the 53 patients (98%) had symptoms of allodynia and/or hyperalgesia. Hyperalgesia to pinprick was observed in 42 out of 53 patients (79%), and allodynia was observed in 48 out of 53 patients (91%). Temperature asymmetry symptoms were reported by 51 out of 53 patients (96%). Twenty-four (45%) patients had signs of a cooler affected side, and five (9%) patients had a warmer affected side. All 53 patients exhibited symptoms of motor abnormalities. Signs of weakness were observed in 44 patients (83%), and a decreased active range of motion was observed in 37 patients (70%).

The study provides a comprehensive overview of the symptoms and signs of the included CRPS patients, as shown in Table 2.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: A pictorial review [^114Pp8ZA]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

The sciatic nerve arises from the anterior divisions of the L4 to S3 nerve roots and exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen at the inferior border of the piriformis muscle. It provides motor supply to the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and the hamstring portion of the adductor magnus. The sciatic nerve divides into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve, which provide motor and sensory supply to the anterior, lateral, and posterior lower leg, as well as to the sole of the foot.

The proximal sciatic nerve may be compromised by trauma, tumors, hematomas, and compression in the subgluteal space, which is termed deep gluteal syndrome. Causes of this include piriformis syndrome, ischiofemoral impingement, and fibrovascular bands. The distal branches can be damaged by fractures, bandages, or tumors such as ganglion cysts.

Piriformis syndrome (illustrated in Fig. 1) is a controversial diagnosis, with no consensus about diagnostic criteria. Hence, the diagnosis is typically one of exclusion. In particular, it is important to exclude lumbar spinal pathology before diagnosing piriformis syndrome.

- **Etiology**: The syndrome is caused by nerve compression or irritation in the greater sciatic foramen due to disorders related to the piriformis muscle.
	- Primary causes include intrinsic piriformis muscle pathology, such as hypertrophy.
	- More commonly, it is secondary to other pathology at the level of the greater sciatic foramen, for example, space-occupying lesions or edema from sacroiliitis.

In a minority of patients, the sciatic nerve…

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: Current concept [^112PUgqz]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The piriformis muscle originates from the anterior surface of the sacrum and inserts into the upper part of the greater trochanter, passing out of the pelvis through the greater sciatic notch. Contracture of the piriformis muscle has been thought to cause the "piriformis syndrome", which is associated with a well-known clinical picture presenting sciatica-like symptoms.

In 1928, Yoeman reported that sciatica might be caused by a periarthritis involving the anterior sacroiliac ligament, the piriformis muscle, and the adjacent branches of the sciatic nerve. In 1947, Robinson introduced the term "piriformis syndrome". The incidence of "piriformis syndrome" among patients with low back pain has been reported to range from 5% to 36%. One MRI report involving 61 patients revealed a lack of nerve root compression in the lumbar spine despite symptoms of sciatica in 16.4% of the patients; 4.9% of all 61 patients were found to have the "piriformis syndrome".

It has been argued that the piriformis muscle may irritate the sciatic nerve due to an anatomical abnormality, such as a hypertrophic muscle. The entrapment and irritation of the sciatic nerve in the hip region have largely been thought to be influenced by the piriformis muscle. Anatomical variations, such as a bipartite piriformis muscle and the piriformis muscle lying anterior to the nerve, have been described as irritating the sciatic nerve.

The etiology of "piriformis syndrome" is not clearly known, although it has been argued that the pain syndrome may be caused by trauma to the pelvis or buttock, in addition to anatomical variations.

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^116YsWL6]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Low credibility.

This was a cross-sectional study. Ethics approval was granted by the institutional clinical research ethics committee of Qianfoshan Hospital. We collected written consent from all subjects before the examinations. From March 1, 2015, to February 28, 2017, we enrolled patients from Qianfoshan Hospital with complaints of chronic pain in their buttocks, thighs, and lower limbs.

- **Inclusion criteria**: To be eligible, the patients had to be 20–80 years old and have no evidence of clinically significant lumbar disk herniation or lumbosacral radiculopathy on MRI. Inclusion criteria for the PS group were the presence of one or more positive PS physical examinations, whereas inclusion in the group of healthy volunteers required a normal physical examination for PS.

- **Physical examination**: PS was defined by the following criteria: (1) tenderness upon palpation of the greater sciatic notch or piriformis muscle line over the upper edge of the piriformis muscle and stretching from the greater trochanter to the superior boundary of the greater sciatic foramen; (2) a positive FAIR test (hip flexion–adduction–internal rotation maneuver test); (3) a positive Pace maneuver test; (4) a positive Beatty maneuver test (buttock pain when the leg was flexed and elevated while the patients were lying on their asymptomatic side); and (5) a positive Freiberg maneuver test.

### Methadose [^113cZBB9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use but may occur later. Discontinue Methadose if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible.

If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover, and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

### Movement disorders with neuronal antibodies: Syndromic approach, genetic parallels and pathophysiology [^1177mVSA]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Later in adulthood, paraneoplastic chorea comes into the differential diagnosis. It occurs mainly in association with CRMP5 or Hu antibodies, typically combined with other neurological signs, and features on MRI characteristic fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities in the white matter, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobes. Sometimes, however, these red flags are lacking, and paraneoplastic chorea may resemble Huntington's disease, including caudate atrophy on MRI.

Finally, LGI1 or CASPR2 antibodies can also cause isolated or combined chorea/hemichorea, with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms, but typically without any underlying malignancy. Akin to the patients with NMDAR antibodies, over time these patients often develop a more typical encephalopathy with multiple clinical features.

- **Dystonia**: Dystonia (sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal movements or postures) is the only sign in primary/isolated dystonias, but it is associated with other symptoms in a variety of conditions such as heredodegenerative, metabolic, infectious, and autoimmune disorders. Antibody-related dystonia does not mimic primary dystonia, which follows a characteristic pattern in its anatomical distribution and age at onset. For example, young-onset primary dystonia typically features limb onset with subsequent generalization. In contrast, there are a few reports of children and young adults who harbored NMDAR antibodies and had hemidystonia or craniocervical dystonia as the most prominent feature. More often, antibody-related dystonia is one symptom among others in a broader clinical picture.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^1138ALj2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Algorithm for the symptomatic management of FACP, designed for use by physicians: FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen. It lasts for seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, in the absence of any "red flag" signs or symptoms of structural organic disease, and any strong association with defecation, which might indicate IBS. Typically, it does not significantly interfere with daily activities. FACP indicates functional abdominal cramping pain; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antidepressant.

In view of the prevalence of self-care among patients experiencing FACP, we propose how this algorithm might be adapted for pharmacists and patients. This adaptation could help support improved self-management of FACP, raise awareness of "red flag" signs and symptoms that should prompt referral to or consultation with an appropriate physician, and highlight alternative approaches that patients might not consider intuitively. These algorithms could form the basis of the pharmacist and patient education needed to facilitate the recognition and effective self-treatment of FACP.

Regarding the medical management for Behçet's syndrome, specifically in terms of managing CNS involvement, the BAD/BSR 2024 guidelines recommend considering the following when diagnosing neuro-Behçet's:

- **Parenchymal presentation**: In patients with suspected neuro-BS, there is typically a subacute onset of brainstem syndrome, cerebral hemispheric syndrome, spinal cord syndrome, or a combination of these. This can manifest through a multitude of signs and symptoms, such as ophthalmoplegia, cranial nerve deficit, speech impairment, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, myelopathy, sphincter symptoms, headaches, meningoencephalitis, encephalopathy, seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes. The course may follow a relapsing-remitting pattern or a primary or secondary progressive course.

- **Nonparenchymal presentation**: Patients with suspected neuro-BS may present with headaches and visual impairment secondary to intracranial hypertension, cerebral thrombophlebitis, cerebral vascular accident, arterial thrombosis, dissection, or aneurysm. This is usually a monophasic illness, although relapses can occur.

- **Combination presentation**: Neuro-BS can present as a combination of parenchymal and nonparenchymal forms.

### Neurological soft signs, clinical symptoms and treatment reactivity in patients suffering from first episode schizophrenia [^1127xTMp]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was twofold: (a) to investigate the correlation between clinical symptoms and neurological soft signs in patients suffering from their first episode of schizophrenia and (b) to examine the relationship between soft signs and the reactivity of first episode treatment.

The methods involved a trial with 92 male patients undergoing a first episode of schizophrenia. Clinical symptoms were rated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to assess psychomotor poverty, disorganization, and reality distortion syndromes. Neurological soft signs were evaluated using the Neurological Evaluation Scale.

Results indicated significant positive correlations between neurological soft signs and negative symptoms, as well as a reduced treatment response.

The conclusion of our study corroborates findings from previous trials, establishing a correlation between neurological soft signs and the negative symptomatic dimension of schizophrenia. Furthermore, neurological soft signs were associated with a poorer response to the treatment of the first episode of schizophrenia.

### Piriformis syndrome: A real pain in the buttock [^113FeAc4]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Herein, we provide an unbiased review of piriformis syndrome (PS), a highly controversial syndrome for which no consensus exists regarding diagnostic criteria or pathophysiology.

- **Methods**: A review of the literature in the English language.

- **Results**: A nonpartisan review of the medical literature pertaining to PS revealed that the existence of this entity remains controversial. There is no definitive proof of its existence despite reported series with large numbers of patients.

- **Conclusion**: PS remains a controversial diagnosis for sciatic pain. The debate regarding the clinical significance of PS remains active. Nonetheless, there may be a subset of patients in whom the piriformis muscle is a source of pain. The syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unilateral lower extremity pain.

### Failure of surgical decompression for a presumed case of piriformis syndrome. Case report [^113td5xH]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of piriformis syndrome is difficult and its precise definition is highly controversial. In this article, the authors present the case of a patient who had clinical features suggestive of piriformis syndrome. During surgery, the patient was found to have a rare variation in anatomical structures, in which the peroneal nerve was displaced by the piriformis muscle. Surgical decompression did not alleviate the patient's symptoms.

### Prevalence of clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities at diagnosis of acromegaly: A systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines [^112tprGD]. Pituitary (2023). High credibility.

This is the first systematic review reporting on the prevalence of clinical signs, symptoms, and comorbidities at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly. Acromegaly is a chronic multisystemic condition, leading to a wide variety of possible symptoms and complaints. While pathognomic symptoms are lacking, delineating a disease-specific presentation that should raise suspicion of acromegaly is essential. Due to the diagnostic delay, many symptoms, clinical signs, and comorbidities can already be present at the time of diagnosis. During physical examination, changes in physical appearance, such as acral enlargement and typical facial and oral features, combined with complaints of skin changes, including thicker and oilier skin and hyperhidrosis, seem to be most disease-specific.

More general complaints such as headache, fatigue, snoring, voice changes (hoarseness and voice deepening), arthralgia, and depression can also be found. The rate of comorbidities before treatment of acromegaly is high, mainly comprising common conditions such as hypertension, thyroid disorder, and polyps of the digestive tract. In contrast, the presence of left ventricle hypertrophy, fatty liver disease, (pre)diabetes, and sleep apnea are typical and more specific for acromegaly. Noteworthy, the clinical presentation regarding cardiovascular comorbidities — left ventricle hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, and dyslipidemia — substantially improved over the years in comparisons of old versus recent studies. Carpal tunnel syndrome, colorectal carcinoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma were not common, but have been noted.

### Endocrine withdrawal syndromes [^1115zZrJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Hypersecretion of endogenous hormones or chronic administration of high doses of the same hormones induces varying degrees of tolerance and dependence. Elimination of hormone hypersecretion or discontinuation of hormone therapy may result in a mixed picture of two syndromes: a typical hormone deficiency syndrome and a generic withdrawal syndrome. Thus, hormones with completely different physiological effects may produce similar withdrawal syndromes, with symptoms and signs reminiscent of those observed with drugs of abuse, suggesting shared mechanisms.

This review postulates a unified endocrine withdrawal syndrome, with changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the central opioid peptide, in which noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems of the brain act as common links in its pathogenesis. Long-term adaptations to hormones may involve relatively persistent changes in molecular switches, including common intracellular signaling systems, from membrane receptors to transcription factors.

The goals of therapy are to ease withdrawal symptoms and expedite weaning of the patient from the hormonal excess state. Clinicians should resort to the fundamentals of tapering hormones down over time, even in the case of abrupt removal of a hormone-producing tumor. In addition, the prevention of stress and the administration of antidepressants may ameliorate symptoms and signs of an endocrine withdrawal syndrome.

### Piriformis syndrome: Anatomic considerations, a new injection technique, and a review of the literature [^116VHjxT]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome can be caused by anatomic abnormalities. Treatments for piriformis syndrome include steroid injections into the piriformis muscle and near the area of the sciatic nerve. These techniques use either fluoroscopy and muscle electromyography to identify the piriformis muscle or a nerve stimulator to stimulate the sciatic nerve.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a cadaver study and noted anatomic variations of the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve. To standardize their injection technique, they also measured the distance from the lower border of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) to the sciatic nerve. They retrospectively reviewed the charts of 19 patients who had received piriformis muscle injections, documenting the site of needle insertion in terms of the distance from the lower border of the SIJ and the depth of needle insertion at which the motor response of the foot was elicited. The authors tabulated the response of the patients to the injection, any associated diagnoses, and previous treatments the patients had before the injection. Finally, they reviewed the literature on piriformis syndrome, a rare cause of buttock pain and sciatica.

- **Results**: In the cadavers, the distance from the lower border of the SIJ to the sciatic nerve was 2.9 ± 0.6 (1.8–3.7) cm laterally and 0.7 ± 0.7 (0.0–2.5) cm caudally. In 65 specimens, the sciatic nerve passed anterior and inferior to the piriformis. In one specimen, the muscle was bipartite, and the two components of the sciatic nerve were separate, with the tibial nerve passing below the piriformis.

### Establishing diagnostic criteria for Perry syndrome [^114HPHh9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To establish international diagnostic criteria for Perry syndrome, a disorder characterized by clinical signs of parkinsonism, depression/apathy, weight loss, respiratory symptoms, mutations in the DCTN1 gene, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology.

- **Methods**: Data from the published literature and newly identified patients were gathered and analyzed during and after the International Symposium on Perry syndrome in Tokyo to identify diagnostic criteria for Perry syndrome.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven patients with Perry syndrome carrying DCTN1 mutations from 20 families were included in this study, and common signs of the disorder were identified, including parkinsonism (95.2% of patients), depression/apathy (71.4%), respiratory symptoms (66.7%), and weight loss (49.2%).

- **Conclusions**: Based on our findings, we propose the following definitive diagnostic criteria for Perry syndrome: the presence of four cardinal signs of Perry syndrome, accompanied by a mutation in DCTN1; or a family history of the disease, parkinsonism, and a mutation in DCTN1; or the presence of four cardinal signs and pathological findings that include nigral neuronal loss and TDP-43 pathology. As patients with Perry syndrome present with uniform clinical, genetic, and pathological features, we further propose the disorder be termed 'Perry disease'.

### Truncating mutations in exons 20 and 21 ofcan cause primary ciliary dyskinesia without associated syndromic symptoms [^1164hkxC]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a motile ciliopathy, characterized by symptoms such as airway infections, male infertility, and situs inversus. Beyond typical forms of PCD, rare syndromic PCD forms exist. Mutations of the X-linked OFD1 gene lead to several syndromic ciliopathies, including oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1, Joubert syndrome type 10 (JBTS10), and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2. The latter results in the X-linked syndromic form of PCD, with neurological and skeletal symptoms whose severity depends on the mutation's location within the gene.

- **Objectives**: To elucidate the role of motile cilia defects in the respiratory phenotype of PCD patients with C-terminal OFD1 mutations.

- **Methods**: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a group of 120 Polish PCD patients, alongside mutation screening of the OFD1 coding sequence, analysis of motile cilia, and magnetic resonance brain imaging.

- **Results**: Four novel hemizygous OFD1 mutations in exons 20 and 21 were identified in men exhibiting a typical PCD presentation, albeit without severe neurological, skeletal, or renal symptoms characteristic of other OFD1-related syndromes. Magnetic resonance brain imaging in two patients did not reveal the molar tooth sign typical for JBTS10. Cilia in the respiratory epithelium were sparse, unusually long, and displayed a defective motility pattern.

### A case of pain, motor impairment, and swelling of the arm after acute herpes zoster infection [^112BKWst]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) represent neuropathic pain syndromes that may appear with similar clinical signs and symptoms. Medical history and clinical distribution of symptoms and signs (PHN typically at the thorax; CRPS typically at the limbs) are obvious in most cases, helping to discriminate between both disorders. Here, we present a patient suffering from CRPS II following PHN of one upper extremity. This case demonstrates that both etiology and the part of the body affected by neuropathy influence the pain phenotype.

### Signs and symptoms of childhood cancer: a guide for early recognition [^111rwYxL]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although cancer in children is rare, it is the second most common cause of childhood mortality in developed countries. It often presents with nonspecific symptoms similar to those of benign conditions, leading to delays in the diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment. Primary care physicians should have a raised index of suspicion and explore the possibility of cancer in children who have worrisome or persisting signs and symptoms.

- **Red flag signs**
- **Leukemia or lymphoma**: Include unexplained and protracted pallor, malaise, fever, anorexia, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hemorrhagic diathesis, and hepatosplenomegaly.
- **Central nervous system tumors**: New onset or persistent morning headaches associated with vomiting, neurologic symptoms, or back pain.
- **Abdominal, soft tissue, and bone tumors**: Palpable masses in the abdomen or soft tissues, and persistent bone pain that awakens the child are red flags.
- **Retinoblastoma**: Leukokoria is a red flag.
- **Endocrine symptoms**: Such as growth arrest, diabetes insipidus, and precocious or delayed puberty may indicate endocranial or germ cell tumors.
- **Paraneoplastic manifestations**: Such as opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, rheumatic symptoms, or hypertension may be indicative of neuroblastoma, leukemia, or Wilms tumor, respectively.

Increased suspicion is also warranted for conditions associated with a higher risk of childhood cancer, including immunodeficiency syndromes and previous malignancies, as well as certain genetic conditions and familial cancer syndromes such as Down syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and others.

### Associations between signs and symptoms of dry eye disease: A systematic review [^112LoUMy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were searched for English-language articles published up to February 28, 2014 (no lower limit was set), reporting associations between signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED), and the primary data supporting those findings were identified. The search terms used were (dry eye syndrome [Medical Subject Heading (MeSH)] or "dry eye disease") AND ([test OR tests OR sign OR signs] AND [symptom OR symptoms]) AND (correlation OR association). The search was limited to humans and English language. The MeSH dry eye syndrome (PubMed) and dry eye (Embase) include keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and xerophthalmia.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, titles and abstracts of all articles were reviewed, and articles for full-text review were further identified. Bibliographies of full-text publications and literature on file also were reviewed for additional evidence.

### Rare presentation of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome with predominantly cutaneous findings [^115eReNY]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, in about 400 cases reported, typical poikiloderma was associated with various other symptoms and signs. Erythema and bullae typically develop on both cheeks at age 3 to 6 months. The rash subsequently spreads to the extremities and buttocks, and poikiloderma develops on the affected areas. The characteristic findings in this case strongly suggest RTS, even without hair, dental, or bone anomalies. Genetic analysis confirmed RTS. Few cases of RTS have presented with mild symptoms, but no reported case only had cutaneous symptoms. Several possible mechanisms of this rare presentation include tissue differential expression of RECQL4 variants, incomplete penetrance of the gene, or presence of pathogenic variants in genes modulating RECQL4 gene function or expression. Further investigations for clarification of the pathophysiology are needed.

Although the c.2059–3C > G variant in the RECQL4 gene has not been reported thus far, the possible effect on the protein through missplicing can be assumed. In addition to the in silico analysis result of this variant, particularly short introns in the RECQL4 gene may increase the chance of missplicing of such an intronic mutation. The other variant, c.3042C > A, is known to be rare with a low minor allele frequency (MAF, A = 0.0001/15), which tends toward mutation rather than polymorphism. Thus, these mutations probably are pathogenic for RTS in this case.

Mutations of the RECQL4 gene are also responsible for the RAPADILINO and Baller-Gerold syndrome. Unlike RTS, RAPADILINO syndrome does not manifest ectodermal symptoms.

### The symptoms and signs of upper airway resistance syndrome: a link to the functional somatic syndromes [^114m6aTB]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to examine the relationship between the symptoms associated with functional somatic syndromes and the severity of sleep-disordered breathing. This was achieved by determining the prevalence of various symptoms and signs in patients with sleep-disordered breathing.

- **Design**: The research was a descriptive study without intervention.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at a university sleep-disorders center located in a suburban setting.

- **Patients or participants**: The study involved three groups, each consisting of 25 consecutively collected patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The groups were classified based on their apnea-hypopnea indexes (AHIs): upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) with AHI less than 10 events per hour, mild-to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (OSA/H) with AHI between 10 and 40 per hour, and moderate-to-severe OSA/H with AHI greater than or equal to 40 per hour.

- **Measurements and results**: Patients underwent thorough medical histories, physical examinations, and full-night polysomnography. The diagnosis of UARS required quantitative measurement of inspiratory airflow and effort, demonstrating inspiratory flow limitation. The percentage of women among the patients with sleep-disordered breathing (p = 0.001) and the prevalence of sleep-onset insomnia (p = 0.04), headaches (p = 0.01), irritable bowel syndrome (p = 0.01), and alpha-delta sleep (p = 0.01) were correlated with decreasing severity of the AHI group.

- **Conclusions**: It was concluded that patients with UARS, mild-to-moderate OSA/H, and moderate-to-severe OSA/H differ in their presenting symptoms and signs. The symptoms and signs of UARS closely resemble those of functional somatic syndromes with uncertain etiology.

### Editorial commentary: Piriformis syndrome is a complex condition that requires precise diagnosis and can be adequately treated by sciatic neurolysis and release of the piriformis tendon [^111bv5xy]. Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is characterized by extrapelvic compression of the sciatic nerve at the infra-piriformis canal. Recently, it has been grouped with other extrapelvic sciatic compression syndromes under the term "deep gluteal syndrome". Patients typically present with posterior gluteal pain that radiates to the posterior thigh, which is frequently triggered or exacerbated by sitting for prolonged periods (30 minutes or more). Although piriformis syndrome is well understood, its diagnosis is typically made through exclusion, where other causes of sciatica, including lumbosacral pathology, are ruled out. A comprehensive history and physical examination, combined with a variety of studies, are often employed to eliminate differential diagnoses and accurately identify piriformis syndrome.

Ultrasound-guided injections with local anesthetics, optionally combined with glucocorticoids, serve as a powerful tool for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Initially, treatment is conservative, involving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, gabapentin or pregabalin, and physical therapy. Surgical intervention targeting the piriformis tendon is considered after conservative therapies fail. Both open and endoscopic techniques have been described for the release of the piriformis tendon and neurolysis of the sciatic nerve, with each method demonstrating adequate success rates and similar complication profiles.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^114qNwGW]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

- **Musculoskeletal mimics of radiculopathy by level**: Landmarks for palpation tenderness relevant to the assessment of these conditions are illustrated in Figure 2. Musculoskeletal mimics of L1 radiculopathies tend to cause pain in the inguinal region; epidemiologically, L1 radiculopathies are rare, and clinicians should strongly consider the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Similarly, L2 radiculopathies are rare; for patients with pain in the groin and proximal thigh referred for suspected L2 radiculopathy, the examining clinician should strongly consider other diagnoses.

	- Radiculopathy affecting the L3 nerve root, which typically causes pain in the medial knee, is uncommon, whereas musculoskeletal conditions that reproduce pain in this region are common. Radiculopathies affecting the L4 nerve root, which causes pain in the medial leg, are also uncommon compared to L5 and S1 radiculopathies, but more common than L1–L3 radiculopathies. Although L5 and S1 radiculopathies, which typically cause pain in the anterolateral leg and posterior thigh, respectively, comprise the bulk of lumbosacral radiculopathies, conditions that mimic radicular pain in these distributions are also common. Common musculoskeletal mimics of radiculopathy are summarized in Table 2.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in piriformis syndrome: A case report [^113ZNk7c]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is an unusual cause of sciatica. Due to the lack of strict diagnostic criteria, it remains a controversial clinical entity. The diagnosis of PS is still primarily clinical, as no diagnostic tests have been definitively proven. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman affected by severe scoliosis, who developed persistent buttock pain resembling that of PS. The clinical suspicion was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis, which showed an enlargement of the left piriformis muscle with an anterior displacement of the sciatic nerve. The role of MRI in the diagnosis, clinical definition, and therapeutic approach to PS is discussed.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^114TKnep]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Gluteus medius is the largest and perhaps the most complex of the three hip abductors. This muscle has three areas of origin: the gluteal fossa, the gluteal aponeurosis, and the posterior inferior edge of the lip of the iliac crest. There are also three points of insertion of the gluteus medius tendon (Fig. 2c). The tendinous portion of the aponeurosis inserts onto the superolateral facet of the greater trochanter, whilst the remainder inserts along an anteroinferior oblique line running on the lateral facet. In Flack's cadaveric investigation, the majority of muscle fascicles inserted onto the deep portion with a more proximal insertion on the greater trochanter than the superficial part of the tendon. A small cadaveric series found that the tendon length was significantly longer in males, but the gross muscle volume was not significantly different on a gender basis.

Innervation of the gluteus medius is from branches of the superior gluteal nerve, which passes between the gluteus minimus and medius, pierces, and then branches in the gluteus medius, and finally enters the tensor fasciae lata (TFL) at its mid-length. Gluteus medius abducts and internally rotates the hip joint, stabilizing the pelvis during locomotion, thereby preventing a pelvic drop. Tsutsumi et al. evaluated 25 hips in 15 Japanese cadavers and found that the anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon was thin compared to the posterior part, which may well be the reason for this area being more prone to tears.

The origin of the gluteus minimus is largely bony from the gl…

### Musculoskeletal mimics for lumbosacral radiculopathy. Part 2: Specific disorders [^114UsEV6]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Lumbosacral radiculopathy is a common disorder evaluated by the electrodiagnostic medicine (EDX) consultant. This evaluation is complicated by the presence of numerous radiculopathy mimics. While peripheral neurologic mimics are common, musculoskeletal mimics, though less familiar, are not rare among EDX consultants. Awareness of these common musculoskeletal mimickers — particularly key historical and physical examination features that distinguish them from radiculopathies — can lead to an accurate diagnosis for the patient and referring provider.

Part 1 of this monograph addressed theoretical issues surrounding the occurrence of radiculopathy mimics. Part 2 reviews the most prevalent musculoskeletal mimics, including facet arthropathy, myofascial pain syndrome, hip pathology, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, hamstring pathology, iliotibial band syndrome, and plantar fasciitis. Diagnosing these musculoskeletal mimickers is complicated by nonspecific physical examination and imaging findings, often requiring diagnostic injections for confirmation.

Treatment for most mimics involves physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, guided injections, and other conservative measures, with surgical intervention being rare. EDX consultants can efficiently integrate a few high-yield maneuvers into their physical examinations, guided by the pain's location, to provide solutions for patients presenting with a musculoskeletal mimic of a lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^116jYe5p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Indications and usage:

Attention deficit disorders and narcolepsy are the primary conditions for which Methylphenidate HCl oral solution is indicated. Historically, attention deficit disorders were referred to as minimal brain dysfunction in children. Other terms used to describe the behavioral syndrome include hyperkinetic child syndrome, minimal brain damage, minimal cerebral dysfunction, and minor cerebral dysfunction.

Methylphenidate HCl is recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment program, which generally includes other remedial measures such as psychological, educational, and social interventions. This approach aims to stabilize children exhibiting developmentally inappropriate symptoms, such as moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. It is crucial that the diagnosis of this syndrome should not be conclusively made if these symptoms have only recently manifested. Although non-localizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disabilities, and abnormal EEGs may or may not be present, the potential diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction must be considered carefully.

- **Special diagnostic considerations**: The specific etiology of this syndrome remains unknown, and no single diagnostic test is available. An adequate diagnosis requires utilizing medical, psychological, educational, and social resources. Commonly reported characteristics include chronic short attention span, distractibility, emotional lability, impulsivity, moderate-to-severe hyperactivity, minor neurological signs, and abnormal EEG. Learning impairment may or may not be part of the diagnosis.

### Deep gluteal syndrome as a cause of posterior hip pain and sciatica-like pain [^115LxdfY]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Deep gluteal syndrome is an increasingly recognized disease entity, caused by compression of the sciatic or pudendal nerve due to non-discogenic pelvic lesions. It includes the piriformis syndrome, gemelli-obturator internus syndrome, ischiofemoral impingement syndrome, and proximal hamstring syndrome. The concept of deep gluteal syndrome extends our understanding of posterior hip pain due to nerve entrapment beyond the traditional model of piriformis syndrome.

Nevertheless, there has been terminological confusion, and deep gluteal syndrome has often been undiagnosed or mistaken for other conditions. Careful history-taking, a physical examination including provocation tests, an electrodiagnostic study, and imaging are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. After excluding spinal lesions, MRI scans of the pelvis are helpful in diagnosing deep gluteal syndrome and identifying pathological conditions entrapping the nerves.

- **Treatment options**: It can be conservatively treated with multidisciplinary treatment including rest, the avoidance of provoking activities, medication, injections, and physiotherapy. Endoscopic or open surgical decompression is recommended in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms after conservative treatment or in those who may have masses compressing the sciatic nerve.

Many physicians remain unfamiliar with this syndrome, and there is a lack of relevant literature. This comprehensive review aims to provide the latest information about the epidemiology, aetiology, pathology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment.

### An unusual case of Parinaud's syndrome [^112hZUVc]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old man presented with blurred vision, headache, and dizziness. Upon questioning, there was also a history of a preceding diarrhoeal illness. Initial investigations were normal. However, following a week, he represented with Parinaud's syndrome. In view of the preceding diarrhoea, the transient unsteadiness, and the areflexia on examination, anti-GQ1b antibodies were requested. The resulting titre was positive, confirming the suspected diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome. He responded to intravenous immunoglobulins with full resolution of his symptoms and signs. Although various unusual neuro-ophthalmological signs have been reported localizing to the brainstem, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of Parinaud's syndrome being the presenting symptom of Miller Fisher syndrome.

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^111BgyB3]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 33 clinically diagnosed piriformis syndrome (PS) patients (mean age 45 years; 16 males) and 26 healthy volunteers (mean age 54 years; 15 males) were included. Demographic data are presented in the study, with no significant differences in age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), or gender ratio between patients and healthy volunteers. Clinical presentations and physical examinations were significantly different between PS patients and healthy volunteers. Clinical assessment scores are provided in the research.

- **Intrarater reliability**: The intrarater reliability of cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was high (left ICC1, 1 = 0.90; right ICC1, 1 = 0.99). Comparative studies of imaging parameters revealed significant differences in piriformis muscle thickness, with the symptomatic piriformis muscle being thicker than the asymptomatic side in PS patients. There were significant differences in CSA between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in PS patients. Conversely, neither muscle thickness nor CSA were significantly different between the two sides of healthy volunteers.

In addition, 25 patients exhibited increased echo intensity of the epimysium and surrounding adipose tissue, and 16 patients showed a visible increase in piriformis muscle echo intensity compared to the asymptomatic side.

### Atypical Cogan's syndrome: A case report [^113s3Vm1]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Cogan's syndrome is a rare, presumed autoimmune disorder characterized by nonsyphilitic interstitial keratitis and progressive audiovestibular symptoms. The initial report by David G. Cogan in 1945 was modified by Haynes et al. in 1980, who proposed diagnostic criteria for patients with other ocular or vestibular symptoms and suggested this to be atypical Cogan's syndrome. In a more typical presentation of Cogan's syndrome, ocular and audiovestibular signs and symptoms usually appear alone and are bilateral. We report a case of a 50-year-old woman with atypical Cogan's syndrome, manifested by unusual, relatively rapid clinical deterioration.

### Dry eye syndrome in elderly Tibetans at high altitude: A population-based study in China [^115sLVq5]. Cornea (2008). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence of dry eye syndrome, analyze the relationship between dry eye symptoms and signs, and identify associated risk factors for dry eye syndrome in an elderly Tibetan population at high altitude, a population-based survey was conducted from October 2006 to December 2006. A stratified, clustered, random sampling procedure was used to select 2632 native Tibetan people aged 40 years and older. Symptoms of dry eye were assessed using a six-item validated questionnaire. Dry eye syndrome was diagnosed in subjects reporting one or more symptoms often or all the time. Positive signs included a tear film breakup time of ≤ 1 second. Correlations between symptoms and signs were analyzed.

Of a total of 2632 eligible subjects, 2229 (84.69%) were examined. The data of 1840 participants were analyzed. Of these 1840 participants, 52.4% (95% confidence interval: 50.2–54.7) were symptomatic. A tear film breakup time of ≤ 1 second was seen in 5.8% (95% confidence interval: 4.7–6.9). The correlations between dry eye symptoms and signs were statistically significant. Independent risk factors for dry eye syndrome included positive dry eye signs, increased age, low education level, low socioeconomic status, and higher altitude.

This study indicates a high prevalence rate of dry eye syndrome among elderly Tibetans at high altitude.

### Piriformis syndrome: Diagnosis, treatment, and outcome — a 10-year study [^113RfnHv]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

To validate an operational definition of piriformis syndrome based on the prolongation of the H-reflex with hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FAIR), this study assessed the efficacy of conservative therapy and surgery for symptom relief and disability reduction.

- **Design**: Before-after trial of cohorts identified by operational definition.

- **Setting**: Outpatient departments of two hospitals and four physicians' offices. Surgery was performed at three hospitals.

- **Patients**: The study involved a consecutive sample of 918 patients (1014 legs) with follow-up data available for 733.

- **Intervention**: Patients with significant (3 standard deviations [SDs]) FAIR tests received injection, physical therapy, and serially reported pain and disability assessments. Forty-three patients (6.47%) underwent surgery.

- **Main outcome measures**: Likert pain scale and subjective estimates of disablement in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.

- **Results**: At 3 SDs, the FAIR test demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of .881 and .832, respectively. Seventy-nine percent (514/655) of FAIR test positive (FTP) patients showed 50% or more improvement from injection and physical therapy at a mean follow-up of 10.2 months, with an average improvement of 71.1%. In 385 FTP patients with disability data, mean disability decreased from 35.37% prestudy (SD = .2275) to 12.96% poststudy (SD = .1752), marking a 62.8% improvement. Among 28 surgical FTP patients, 68.8% achieved 50% or greater improvement, with an average improvement of 68% at a mean follow-up of 16 months. Surgery reduced the mean FAIR test to 1.35 ± 2.17 months postoperatively. FTP patients generally improved by 10% to 1.

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barré syndrome in ten steps [^115BENez]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Some patients have a distinct and persistent clinical variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) that does not progress to the classic pattern of sensory loss and weakness. These variants include weakness without sensory signs (pure motor variant); weakness limited to the cranial nerves (bilateral facial palsy with paraesthesias), upper limbs (pharyngeal–cervical–brachial weakness), or lower limbs (paraparetic variant); and the Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), which in its full manifestation consists of ophthalmoplegia, areflexia, and ataxia. In general, GBS variants are rarely 'pure' and often overlap with the classic syndrome or show features typical of other variant forms.

- **Pattern of symptoms**:
	- Graphic representation of the pattern of symptoms typically observed in the different clinical variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Symptoms can be purely motor, purely sensory (rare), or a combination of motor and sensory. Ataxia can be present in patients with Miller Fisher syndrome, and both decreased consciousness and ataxia can be present in patients with Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Symptoms can be localized to specific regions of the body, and the pattern of symptoms differs between variants of GBS. Although bilateral facial palsy with paraesthesias, the pure sensory variant, and Miller Fisher syndrome are included in the GBS spectrum, they do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for GBS.

### Piriformis syndrome: Correlation of muscle morphology with symptoms and signs [^1132CbqX]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the relation of symptoms and pain provocation tests to abnormal piriformis morphology among people with chronic buttock pain.

- **Design**: Each of two clinical symptoms and two clinical signs were compared with the abnormal morphology found on ultrasound. The pain-free side was used as an internal control.

- **Setting**: A tertiary referral center.

- **Participants**: A series of 27 consecutive patients (26 women, 1 man; average age 48 years) with chronic low lumbosacral or buttock pain, who presented to a musculoskeletal clinic over a 12-month period, underwent ultrasound assessment of piriformis muscle morphology. Four patients were excluded because their body mass index was in excess of 30 kg/m².

- **Intervention**: The symptomatic piriformis muscle was injected with bupivacaine after pain was assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS), using the resisted abduction test.

- **Main outcome measure**: A 70% reduction of pain on the VAS was considered positive for pain in the piriformis muscle.

The results showed that odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing each of the signs and symptoms with normal morphology. The highest ORs were found for pain on walking up inclines (10.8), referred pain (5.3), and pain on needling the piriformis muscle (6.0).

In conclusion, this study did not provide a criterion standard for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome; however, it supported the syndrome as a contributing factor in chronic buttock pain and very low back pain.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: Guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^117PECFx]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The term Parkinson's disease (PD) can be used both in the presence of a clinically established Parkinson syndrome and in the context of specific symptom constellations that indicate the future development of a Parkinson syndrome, such as premotor or prodromal PD. In the vast majority of cases, PD is non-inheritable and referred to as "sporadic PD". Sporadic PD is a Lewy body disease that results in a Parkinson syndrome.

In rare cases, mutations (e.g. in the genes SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA1) can be identified, which are then classified as "hereditary Parkinson syndromes". Parkinson syndromes associated with mutations in other genes (e.g. VPS35, DJ1, PARKIN, and PINK1) typically do not exhibit the typical histopathological features of Lewy body disease. Hereditary PD should be reported with the specific nomenclature recommended by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force, such as PARK-VPS35.

- **Preclinical PD**: Defined as Lewy body disease in a very early stage that does not yet exhibit obvious motor or non-motor clinical signs.

- **Premotor PD**: Characterized by Lewy body disease in an early stage that, at the time of examination, only presents non-motor symptoms, such as REM sleep behavior disorder, olfactory dysfunction, and/or depression.

- **Prodromal PD**: Refers to Lewy body disease in an early stage that, at the time of examination, exhibits non-motor symptoms and only mild-motor symptoms but does not yet meet the criteria for the diagnosis of classical Parkinson syndrome.

PD with dementia (PDD) is defined as advanced Lewy body disease.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^112RDizr]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome affects approximately 3 percent of adults in the United States. Pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve are the classic symptoms. While Tinel's sign and a positive Phalen's maneuver are classic clinical signs of the syndrome, hypalgesia and weak thumb abduction are more predictive of abnormal nerve conduction studies. Conservative treatment options include splinting the wrist in a neutral position and ultrasound therapy. Orally administered corticosteroids can be effective for short-term management (two to four weeks), but local corticosteroid injections may improve symptoms for a longer period. A recent systematic review demonstrated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pyridoxine, and diuretics are no more effective than placebo in relieving the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. If symptoms are refractory to conservative measures or if nerve conduction studies show severe entrapment, open or endoscopic carpal tunnel release may be necessary. Carpal tunnel syndrome should be treated conservatively in pregnant women because spontaneous postpartum resolution is common.

### Ultrasound-guided dry needling decreases pain in patients with piriformis syndrome [^114JsPVP]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). High credibility.

Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is a disorder that can lead to symptoms of buttock pain and limited hip joint mobility, which may impact quality of life.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two patients with PMS were randomized into the treatment group, which included three sessions of ultrasound-guided dry needling (DN) of the piriformis muscle (n = 16), or a waitlist control group (n = 16). The primary outcome was pain intensity measured on the visual analog scale recorded at baseline, then at 72 hours and 1 week after treatment.

- **Results**: At 1-week follow-up, pain intensity was significantly less in the DN group than in the waitlist control group (-2.16 [-1.01 to -3.32], P = 0.007) by an amount consistent with clinically meaningful improvement.

- **Discussion**: The findings suggest that DN resulted in clinically meaningful short-term improvement in pain intensity for patients with PMS.

### Electrophysiologically identified piriformis syndrome is successfully treated with incobotulinum toxin A and physical therapy [^111TmJHn]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). High credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is the entrapment of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle.

- **Methods**: In this article, we describe a 56-person randomized, double-blind, controlled study involving physical therapy and incobotulinum toxin A or placebo. Inclusion criteria were a 3-SD delay of posterior tibial (PT) or fibular (FN) H-reflexes on flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FAIR) testing, and normal paraspinal electromyographic findings. Outcome measures included adverse side effects, visual analog scale (VAS) findings, and H-reflex delay on the FAIR test.

- **Results**: Mean intervention VAS score decreased significantly more compared with placebo at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks post-injection (P < 0.0001). FAIR test scores for PT, but not FN, decreased significantly more compared with placebo at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post-injection (PT: P = 0.038, 0.003, 0.003, and 0.046). Adverse effects were minimal. VAS slope and PT FAIR test results varied significantly (P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusion**: Incobotulinum toxin A chemodenervation may be useful for treating piriformis syndrome as identified by the FAIR test. Muscle & Nerve 56: 258–263, 2017.

### Clinical criteria of central sensitization in chronic pelvic and perineal pain (Convergences PP criteria): Elaboration of a clinical evaluation tool based on formal expert consensus [^117Qm7a2]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Some patients with chronic pelvic and perineal pain (CPP) present complex manifestations, comprising pain and dysfunction that are not confined to a single organ system, such as the lower urinary tract, lower gastrointestinal tract, or genital tract. These syndromes can be associated with varying degrees of symptoms suggestive of bladder pain syndrome, dyspareunia, and/or irritable bowel syndrome.

Patients sometimes also experience pain with a neuropathic component, including sensations of burning, tingling, prickles, and perineal allodynia. Physical examinations may reveal muscle trigger points, such as piriformis, obturator internus, levator ani, and iliopsoas, which are suggestive of myofascial pain.

The gap between clinical symptoms and pathological signs is a constant feature of these pain syndromes. The patient's description of the pain often appears disproportionate to the limited findings on physical examination and/or complementary investigations (such as imaging, endoscopy, or infectious work-ups), and observed anatomical lesions or variants cannot, on their own, explain the patient's pain.

This type of pain is disconcerting and can sometimes be a source of discouragement for both the patient and the various organ specialists involved, including gynecologists, urologists, gastroenterologists, and pain physicians. The absence of a visible lesion capable of explaining the patient's pain can lead to misunderstanding for both the patient and doctor. This misunderstanding can contribute to treatment failures, alteration of the patient-doctor relationship, or even excessive psychiatric diagnoses.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: A Delphi-based consensus paper from the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) - part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^112Rkiv9]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Several studies in patients with piriformis syndrome have shown that ultrasound (US)-guided perisciatic injection of anesthetic-corticosteroids is a safe procedure that provides good symptom relief. In up to 50% of patients, symptoms may relapse, and additional perisciatic injections are warranted. A prospective randomized controlled study in patients with piriformis syndrome demonstrated that the addition of corticosteroids to the anesthetic does not provide additional benefit. Conversely, a recent uncontrolled study on 30 patients suggested that US-guided piriformis injection of corticosteroid-anesthetic appears effective for both somatic and neuropathic pain in piriformis syndrome patients at 1 week and 1 month.

US-guided injection of botulinum toxin A into the piriformis muscle might offer a long-term management option for piriformis syndrome, but evidence is limited; thus, its application in daily practice is still questionable. In a small case series by Rodríguez-Piñero et al, six months after the injection, three patients were asymptomatic and three were feeling better. Multiple injections may be administered over the course of treatment. It has been shown that symptom relief after US-guided injections of botulinum toxin A into the piriformis muscle may result from atrophy and fatty infiltration of the muscle.

US-guided lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block can provide effective post-operative regional analgesia. The volume of local anesthetic affects the size of the blocked sensory area.

### Multiple sclerosis prevalence in the United States commercially insured population [^111V3QnX]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis can be associated with various symptoms and conditions. These include paresthesia, central vein sign, and optic neuritis. Factors like female sex and vitamin D deficiency may also contribute. Symptoms such as facial numbness, diplopia, muscle weakness, and decreased visual acuity are common. Cognitive impairment, relative afferent pupillary defect, and muscle spasms frequently occur, as well as transverse myelitis and limb weakness.

Other associated symptoms include tingling, tobacco use, hypoesthesia, painful eye movements, and Charcot's neurologic triad. There may also be links to inflammatory bowel disease, fecal incontinence, tremor, and gait disturbance. Signs such as the ependymal "Dot-Dash" sign, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and Epstein-Barr virus infection are associated.

Additional symptoms include ataxia, sleep disorders, vertigo, fatigue, and vision loss. Positive Uhthoff's phenomenon and dysarthria may appear, along with eye pain, dysesthesia, color vision impairment, and restless legs syndrome. Oscillopsia, speech disturbance, and neck stiffness may also manifest.

Some individuals may experience the open ring sign, facial pain, and binocular diplopia. Facial hypoesthesia, depression, and nystagmus are possible, as is internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Dysphagia and psoriasis, along with Dawson's fingers and positive Lhermitte's phenomenon, are observed. Patients may report low sex drive, urinary incontinence, and obesity. Lastly, limb paresis, hemiparesis, and various visual disturbances are often noted among affected individuals.
