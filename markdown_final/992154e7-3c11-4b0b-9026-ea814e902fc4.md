## Question

clonidine indications

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for clonidine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and ensure I separate them by formulation and route. Then, I should verify any age or population nuances for ADHD and check that the epidural indication is formulation-specific. Next, I will examine major guideline-supported off-label uses and make sure to qualify the evidence level. After that, I need to consider conditions where clonidine is not recommended despite historical use. Finally, I should summarize and, before closing, double-check safety caveats that often accompany how we "indicate" clonidine.

> Let me first confirm the core FDA-approved labeled indications, and I should be precise about the product. Clonidine immediate-release oral tablets and transdermal systems are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, used alone or with other antihypertensive agents, whereas clonidine extended-release tablets are indicated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy or adjunctive to stimulants, and epidural clonidine (Duraclon) is indicated in combination with opioids for severe cancer pain not adequately relieved by opioids alone, particularly neuropathic cancer pain [^113cVWGs] [^113MZ4wH] [^115QBtBc].

> Wait, let me verify formulation specificity so I don't overgeneralize. ADHD labeling applies to clonidine extended-release tablets, not to the immediate-release form or the transdermal patch, whereas hypertension labeling applies to the immediate-release and transdermal systems but not to the ADHD ER labeling, and the analgesia indication is specific to epidural clonidine and is restricted to selected cancer patients after adequate opioid trials, with broader use not recommended by the label [^115QBtBc] [^113MZ4wH] [^112FLrzk] [^notfound]. I should confirm dosing frameworks to emphasize they are distinct: oral IR for hypertension typically starts at 0.1 mg twice daily with titration, the transdermal patch is applied weekly at 0.1–0.3 mg/day, and the ER ADHD product is taken twice daily per label instructions, which are not interchangeable with IR or patch dosing [^112FLrzk] [^113MZ4wH] [^114FEWiK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neuropsychiatric indications. I initially thought Tourette's syndrome might be labeled, but I should double-check; in fact, Tourette's and PTSD-related nightmares are listed as off-label in FDA drug information summaries and are not FDA-approved indications, so I need to keep those clearly separated from labeled uses [^111WXr49]. That correction matters because the question is "indications", and clinicians often conflate common use with labeled status, which can mislead therapy selection and coverage discussions.

> Next, I should review major guideline-endorsed off-label uses that are clinically relevant. For opioid withdrawal, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine are recommended options when methadone or buprenorphine are contraindicated, unacceptable, or unavailable; ASAM and VA/DoD both support this role, with practical dosing ranges reflected in SPL and monographs, although methadone and buprenorphine remain more effective for most outcomes [^115oZ5dY] [^111LAyq8] [^111MjgWW] [^112Cp9fK]. I need to ensure I emphasize that this is withdrawal management rather than ongoing OUD treatment, which requires MOUD, to avoid therapeutic drift [^115oZ5dY].

> I will now examine alcohol withdrawal, because I recall clonidine being used adjunctively. ASAM 2020 and the Canadian CRISM 2023 guidelines note clonidine as an adjunct to benzodiazepines for autonomic hyperactivity when benzodiazepines alone are insufficient, and they suggest considering clonidine in low-risk patients in outpatient settings; this is adjunctive and off-label, not monotherapy for moderate to severe withdrawal risk [^1177PDHt] [^116r7DHV] [^1116VQ9v]. Let me double-check that I am not overstating its role; yes, benzodiazepines remain first-line, with clonidine primarily targeting adrenergic symptoms rather than preventing seizures or delirium tremens [^1177PDHt].

> Let me consider other common off-label indications that patients ask about. Clonidine is used for vasomotor menopausal symptoms with low-dose oral regimens and appears in SPL dosing guidance and reviews, though its effect size is modest and side effects can limit tolerability, so this remains an off-label option typically after or when hormone therapy is not preferred or contraindicated [^114Wsj3R] [^116dVcUM]. I should confirm dosing; SPL notes 0.05 mg twice daily for a short trial period, aligning with conservative practice [^114Wsj3R].

> I should also review smoking cessation and PTSD-related nightmares, since they come up frequently. Cochrane suggests clonidine may improve quit rates versus placebo but with dose-dependent adverse effects, and SPL lists facilitation of smoking cessation as an off-label use with divided daily dosing recommendations, underscoring that while there is some efficacy signal, side effects and better-supported options often relegate clonidine to a secondary role [^112yWgrD] [^117Wape1]. For PTSD-associated nightmares, SPL documents off-label use, but the evidence base is limited compared with agents like prazosin; clinicians should weigh hypotension and sedation risks if considering clonidine for this purpose [^111WXr49].

> But wait, what about perioperative and ICU sedation uses often seen in practice — do those count as indications? Despite broad perioperative literature showing hemodynamic benefits and reduced shivering, these are not FDA-approved indications for clonidine, and large pragmatic data have shown mixed or negative results for some analgesic endpoints, while recent ICU sedation RCTs comparing clonidine-based sedation to propofol did not show superiority in extubation timing and noted bradycardia risk, reinforcing that these are practice uses rather than labeled indications [^113p7hpN] [^115ZZ5Rc]. I should be careful not to conflate "can be used" with "indicated", especially for formulary and consent purposes.

> Next, I should review conditions where clonidine is specifically not recommended despite historical interest. In decompensated cirrhosis management for ascites and portal hypertension, EASL advises against adding clonidine to diuretic therapy, which is helpful to note when clinicians consider sympathetic modulation in that setting without outcome benefit [^111ScHbF]. This helps prevent misapplication of off-label logic where guidelines discourage use [^111ScHbF].

> I need to ensure I close with key safety qualifiers that are integral to "indication" discussions because they shape when and how we choose clonidine. Abrupt discontinuation can precipitate rebound hypertension and, rarely, severe sequelae; patients on beta-blockers require careful sequencing when stopping therapy, and patient education is essential across all indications, including transdermal systems where adherence issues can trigger withdrawal physiology [^116KLVZG] [^115HCK7p] [^1111L6uc]. This is especially pertinent when using clonidine off-label for withdrawal syndromes or sleep, where missed doses are more likely and hypertensive rebound may be overlooked initially [^116KLVZG].

> In summary, the FDA-labeled indications are: hypertension with immediate-release oral and transdermal formulations; ADHD with clonidine extended-release tablets as mono- or adjunctive therapy; and severe cancer pain not adequately relieved by opioids with epidural clonidine in selected cancer patients, while common off-label, guideline-supported uses include opioid withdrawal management when MOUD is not an option and adjunctive management of alcohol withdrawal autonomic symptoms, with additional off-label uses such as vasomotor menopausal symptoms, facilitation of smoking cessation, and PTSD-associated nightmares supported by variable evidence and side-effect tradeoffs; it is not recommended for ascites management in decompensated cirrhosis, and across all uses, rebound hypertension risk and formulation-specific labeling require careful counseling and monitoring [^113cVWGs] [^113MZ4wH] [^112FLrzk] [^115QBtBc] [^1172CMT1] [^115oZ5dY] [^111LAyq8] [^1177PDHt] [^116r7DHV] [^1116VQ9v] [^114Wsj3R] [^117Wape1] [^111WXr49] [^111ScHbF] [^116KLVZG].

Clonidine is indicated for **hypertension** (oral/transdermal) [^113cVWGs] and **ADHD** (extended-release, monotherapy or adjunct) [^115QBtBc]. It is also used off-label for **opioid withdrawal** (second-line when methadone/buprenorphine are unsuitable) [^111LAyq8], **alcohol withdrawal** (adjunct to benzodiazepines) [^1177PDHt], and **severe cancer pain** (epidural with opioids) [^1172CMT1]. Additional off-label uses include menopausal hot flashes [^114Wsj3R], PTSD-related nightmares [^111WXr49], and smoking cessation [^112yWgrD]. It is contraindicated in hypersensitivity [^112T4ET2] and should be tapered gradually to avoid rebound hypertension [^116KLVZG].

## FDA-approved indications

### Hypertension

In adults, hypertension can be treated with oral or transdermal clonidine [^113MZ4wH], either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensives [^113cVWGs]. Its central alpha-2 agonism reduces sympathetic outflow and **lowers blood pressure** [^113MfgAE].

---

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

Clonidine, in its extended-release formulation, is indicated for ADHD as monotherapy or as an adjunct to stimulants [^115QBtBc]. Alpha-2 agonism reduces norepinephrine release [^116BVsLn], **improving attention and impulse control**.

---

## Off-label indications

### Opioid withdrawal syndrome

Clonidine is a second-line option [^115oZ5dY] for opioid withdrawal when methadone or buprenorphine are unsuitable [^111LAyq8]. It reduces sympathetic hyperactivity and **alleviates withdrawal symptoms** [^113MfgAE].

---

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome

Clonidine is used as an **adjunct to benzodiazepines** [^1177PDHt] to manage autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety during alcohol withdrawal [^116r7DHV]. It reduces sympathetic outflow, easing withdrawal symptoms [^113MfgAE].

---

### Severe cancer pain

Clonidine may be administered epidurally as an adjunct to opioids for severe cancer pain, particularly neuropathic pain [^1172CMT1]. Alpha-2 agonism provides analgesia and can **reduce opioid requirements** [^117UYwuK].

---

### Menopausal vasomotor symptoms

Clonidine can be used for **menopausal hot flashes** [^111WXr49] [^116dVcUM]. It reduces sympathetic activity, easing vasomotor symptoms [^113MfgAE].

---

### Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nightmares

Clonidine may be used for PTSD-related nightmares [^111WXr49] [^116cxNsD]. It reduces sympathetic hyperarousal, **improving sleep** [^113MfgAE].

---

### Smoking cessation

Clonidine can facilitate **smoking cessation** [^112yWgrD] by reducing withdrawal symptoms [^111WXr49]. It decreases sympathetic activity, easing nicotine withdrawal [^113MfgAE].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Contraindication**: Known hypersensitivity to clonidine or formulation components [^112T4ET2].

- **Precaution**: Gradual taper over 2–4 days [^116KLVZG] to avoid rebound hypertension [^115HCK7p].

### Duraclon [^1172CMT1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Duraclon is indicated in combination with opiates for the treatment of severe pain in cancer patients that is not adequately relieved by opioid analgesics alone. Epidural clonidine is more likely to be effective in patients with neuropathic pain than somatic or visceral pain (see clinical trials).

The safety of this drug product has only been established in a highly selected group of cancer patients and only after an adequate trial of opioid analgesia. Other use is of unproven safety and is not recommended. In a rare patient, the potential benefits may outweigh the known risks (see warnings).

### Clonidine hydrochloride [^116KLVZG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients should be instructed not to discontinue therapy without consulting their physician. Sudden cessation of clonidine treatment has, in some cases, resulted in symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, headache, and tremor, accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma. The likelihood of such reactions to the discontinuation of clonidine therapy appears to be greater after the administration of higher doses or the continuation of concomitant beta-blocker treatment, and special caution is therefore advised in these situations. Rare instances of hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accidents, and death have been reported after clonidine withdrawal. When discontinuing therapy with clonidine hydrochloride tablets, the physician should reduce the dose gradually over 2 to 4 days to avoid withdrawal symptomatology.

An excessive rise in blood pressure following the discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride tablets therapy can be reversed by the administration of oral clonidine hydrochloride or by intravenous phentolamine. If therapy is to be discontinued in patients receiving a beta-blocker and clonidine concurrently, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride tablets.

Because children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, they may be particularly susceptible to hypertensive episodes resulting from abrupt inability to take medication.

### The interaction between propofol and clonidine for loss of consciousness [^115KxCgb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Clonidine premedication reduces the intraoperative requirement for opioids and volatile anesthetics. Clonidine also reduces the induction dose of IV anesthetics. There is no information, however, regarding the effect of oral clonidine premedication on the propofol blood concentrations required for loss of consciousness and the interaction between propofol and clonidine.

We randomly administered target effect-site concentrations of propofol, ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 microg/mL, using computer-assisted target-controlled infusion to three groups of healthy male patients: Control (n = 35), 2.5 microg/kg Clonidine (n = 36), and 5.0 microg/kg Clonidine (n = 36) groups. Nothing was administered to the Control group. Clonidine (2.5 or 5.0 microg/kg) was administered orally 90 minutes before the induction of anesthesia in the Clonidine groups. After equilibration between the blood and effect-site for 15 minutes, a verbal command to open their eyes was given twice to the patients. Arterial blood samples for analysis of serum propofol and clonidine concentrations were taken immediately before verbal commands were given.

Measured serum propofol concentrations in equilibrium with the effect-site at which 50% of the patients did not respond to verbal commands (EC50 for loss of consciousness) were determined by logistic regression. The EC50 ± SE values in the Control, 2.5 microg/kg Clonidine, and 5.0 microg/kg Clonidine groups were 2.67 ± 0.18, 1.31 ± 0.12, and 0.91 ± 0.13 microg/mL, respectively. The EC50 in the 2.5 and 5.0 microg/kg clonidine groups was significantly sm

### Safety of intrathecal clonidine as an adjuvant to spinal anesthesia in infants and children [^112gGXpX]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

The introduction of clonidine as an effective adjuvant to spinal anesthesia in neonates and infants has been suggested by preliminary clinical studies. However, these previous studies had a limited cohort size of 80–100, potentially limiting an accurate measure of its safety. The methods of our study involved a retrospective examination of our 5–6-year experience using clonidine as an adjuvant to spinal anesthesia in a substantial cohort of neonates and infants.

The results showed that the study cohort included 1,420 patients, with ages ranging from newborn to 36 months (median age 7 months). Ninety-five percent of the patients tolerated spinal anesthesia without requiring conversion to general anesthesia, and over 73% of the patients did not require any additional intraoperative sedation. Hypotension (sBP ≤ 60 mmHg) was the most common intraoperative event (17%), with one patient requiring the administration of an anticholinergic agent for bradycardia. No serious intraoperative adverse events were noted. The Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) Phase I was bypassed in 75% of cases, and the postoperative admission rate was 7%, with the majority (85%) being planned admissions. Fifty-six patients (4%) returned to the hospital during the first seven postoperative days, primarily for surgical concerns.

In conclusion, based on this retrospective, observational study, clonidine appears to be a safe adjuvant to spinal anesthesia for ambulatory surgical procedures in infants and children. We observed a low incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications.

### Efficacy and safety of clonidine for the treatment of impulse control disorder in Parkinson's disease: A multicenter, parallel, randomised, double-blind, Phase 2b clinical trial [^113owSJ7]. Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The mechanism of impulse control disorders (ICDs) is not entirely understood, but dysfunction of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathway plays a key role. Abnormal sensitization of the limbic dopaminergic system, combined with relatively preserved dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic pathways and reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in the ventral striatum, has been clearly shown. Beyond the dopaminergic system, glutamatergic and opioidergic neurotransmission dysfunction could also participate in ICD pathophysiology, which has led to clinical trials with controversial or negative results.

A small clinical trial with amantadine showed positive results on pathological gambling, as it was hypothesized that dyskinesia and ICDs depend on common mechanisms involving alterations of glutamate homeostasis. However, amantadine was also demonstrated to be associated with the development of ICDs. Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, was tested in ICDs due to its efficacy in alcohol dependence, but the study failed to demonstrate any efficacy.

Recently, evidence in Parkinson's disease (PD) has pointed to early neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary component of the noradrenergic system. This system is involved in functions such as arousal, behavioural flexibility, executive function, learning, memory, and wakefulness. In addition, noradrenergic dysfunction is implicated in some non-motor symptoms of PD, such as depression and dysexecutive symptoms, as well as in proactive inhibition that is disproportionate in PD, favoring akinesia. Specifically, clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, has been found to…

### Efficacy and safety of clonidine for the treatment of impulse control disorder in Parkinson's disease: a multicenter, parallel, randomised, double-blind, Phase 2b clinical trial [^113yZsZU]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

This study found that clonidine was well tolerated by PD patients, and the results indicate that a phase 3 trial should be conducted. Although the rate of success was not significantly different between groups, patients receiving clonidine had a greater and faster reduction of the total QUIP-RS score at 8 weeks; it is of note that this phase 2b study was not calibrated to conclude on clonidine efficacy but to conduct a phase 3 study. The pathophysiology of ICD in PD, being still controversial and complex, suggests that targeting only the noradrenergic system could be insufficient to suppress ICD. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the importance of the placebo effect, which has been reported to be strong in PD. This suggests that patients can modify their addictive behavior through close follow-ups, regular neuropsychologist interviews, neurological follow-ups, and support. It would be interesting to evaluate more precisely the impact of psychological intervention for the treatment of ICDs.

In terms of tolerance, induced orthostatic hypotension was not an issue and was found in three patients in the clonidine arm and two in the placebo arm, despite the reduction of peripheral vascular resistance induced by clonidine. Moreover, the Epworth score at 8 weeks was slightly better in the clonidine group, and only one case of sleepiness was reported in the clonidine arm (compared to two in the placebo group), which was another potential limitation for the use of this drug in PD patients. Finally, PDQ39 was better in the clonidine group after 8 weeks.

### Clonidine does not reduce pain or opioid consumption after noncardiac surgery [^113p7hpN]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Clonidine is an α2-adrenoceptor agonist with analgesic properties. However, the analgesic efficacy of perioperative clonidine remains unclear. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that clonidine reduces both pain scores and cumulative opioid consumption during the initial 72 hours after noncardiac surgery.

- **Methods**: Six hundred twenty-four patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general and spinal anesthesia were included in this substudy of the PeriOperative ISchemia Evaluation-2 trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.2 mg oral clonidine or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery, followed by a 0.2 mg/d transdermal clonidine patch or placebo patch maintained until 72 hours after surgery. Postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption were assessed for 72 hours after surgery.

- **Results**: Clonidine had no effect on opioid consumption compared with placebo, with an estimated ratio of means of 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.38); P = 0.92. Median (Q1, Q3) opioid consumption was 63 (30, 154) mg morphine equivalents in the clonidine group, which was similar to 60 (30, 128) mg morphine equivalents in the placebo group. Furthermore, there was no significant effect on pain scores, with an estimated difference in means of 0.12 (95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.26); 11-point scale; P = 0.10. Mean pain scores per patient were 3.6 ± 1.8 for clonidine patients and 3.6 ± 1.8 for placebo patients.

- **Conclusions**: Clonidine does not reduce opioid consumption or pain scores in patients recovering from noncardiac surgery.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111W8QUn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses, is it best to go beyond the treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, is it best to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine, or can you cross-taper?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the order of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young people may be able to tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that the sedation has additional benefits for sleep and comorbidities. Therefore, in these children, higher doses may be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. As clonidine can also be divided into two or three doses, quite often children who are sensitive to guanfacine side effects find that a BD (twice daily) or TDS (three times daily) regime of clonidine suits them better than the once-daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, whereas guanfacine appears to be more potent at postsynaptic receptors, which translates into increased prefrontal activity and impulse control regulation, and improvement in behavior regulation. Therefore, in the case of comorbidities where behavioral modification is desired, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines indicate 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day, suggesting that a rough equivalency is: guanfacine 1 mg = clonidine 100 mcg. If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective, it might be best to reduce and withdraw clonidine first before initiating guanfacine.

### Clonidine as monotherapy for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: A randomized trial [^114wZUKW]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

We sought to determine whether clonidine, a non-opioid α-2-adrenergic agonist, would effectively treat neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).

This was an intention-to-treat randomized clinical trial. Enrollment criteria included prenatal opioid exposure, age ≤ 7 days, gestational age ≥ 35 weeks, no other medical condition, and need for pharmacotherapy. The primary outcomes were the length of treatment and neurobehavioral performance.

A total of 1107 patients were screened for enrollment. Of these, 645 were ineligible, 91 parents or staff were unavailable, 216 declined, and 155 consented. Out of the 155 infants, 120 required treatment and were randomized to receive either oral clonidine (n = 60) at 1 µg/kg/dose or morphine (n = 60) at 0.06 mg/kg/dose every 3 hours. Infants with no improvement had their doses increased by 25% of the initial dose every 12 to 24 hours. Those still without improvement by the fourth dose increase received adjunct therapy.

The length of treatment did not differ significantly between the morphine and clonidine groups, with median (95% confidence interval [CI]) days of 15 (13–17) for morphine and 17 (15–19) for clonidine, P = 0.48. Moreover, more clonidine-treated infants (45%) needed adjunct therapy compared to 10% in the morphine group, with an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 8.85 (2.87–27.31). Following treatment completion, NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales summary scores did not differ between clonidine-treated and morphine-treated infants.

In conclusion, the length of pharmacologic treatment and final neurobehavioral performance did not significantly differ between the clonidine- and morphine-treated groups.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^116BVsLn]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The α-2-adrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine have long been known to assist in treating ADHD. Recently, once-daily extended-release guanfacine has proven effective in both short-term and long-term studies. Sedation is a common side effect, which diminishes over time.

Response to single-agent treatment for ADHD often falls short of full remission. Recent studies have shown that adding clonidine to methylphenidate, extended-release guanfacine to stimulants, or OROS methylphenidate to atomoxetine improved residual ADHD symptoms and was well tolerated. The FDA has recently approved a long-acting form of clonidine to be used in monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications.

Treatment of ADHD can result in the alleviation of comorbid depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, and/or aggression. However, when this is not the case, polypharmacy targeting each condition may have added benefits without unacceptable side effects. Examples include the use of atomoxetine or methylphenidate in children being treated for bipolar spectrum disorders or borderline personality disorder, and atypical antipsychotics or valproic acid preparations for children with ADHD and aggression or bipolar disorder. For patients with autistic spectrum disorder, optimal results may require stimulants, SNRIs, antipsychotics, and α-2-agonists.

A number of reports have been published about the use of alternative and complementary medicines in the treatment of ADHD. In a small study, traditional Chinese medicines were found to compare favorably with methylphenidate.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^116XnHAe]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Guanfacine is a medication in the same drug class as clonidine (α2-adrenergic agonist), and some practitioners may prefer trying guanfacine before clonidine. Guanfacine is FDA-approved for ADHD in children but is used off-label for sleep disturbances. The short-acting guanfacine can be prescribed at a starting dose of half of a 1 mg tablet (0.5 mg) and can be increased by 0.5–1 mg every 3 to 5 days as tolerated, up to 2 mg for sleep disturbances. Long-acting guanfacine preparations can be effective for sleep maintenance. If the short-acting preparation is effective with sleep onset and the patient can swallow a pill, then guanfacine ER can be tried. Dosing of guanfacine ER should start with 1 mg (these tablets cannot be broken or chewed) and can be increased every 5–7 days until achieving the desired clinical response or reaching a maximum dose of 4 mg/day.

Trazodone, a 5-HT2 antagonist, was initially FDA-approved for the treatment of depression in adults and was found to be too sedating. It is thus frequently used for sleep disturbance in adults and children with mood and anxiety disorders. There are no RCTs of trazodone in children with ASD, yet clinically, it is a very effective medication for improving sleep onset and maintenance. Side effects, including prolonged erection of the penis (priapism), should be explained to patients and families. Start with half of a 50 mg tablet (25 mg) at bedtime and increase weekly by 25 mg to a maximum dosage of 100–150 mg at bedtime, depending on body weight.

Mirtazapine is a central presynaptic α2-adrenergic antagonist and serot.

### Clonidine as an adjuvant to intrathecal local anesthetics for surgery: Systematic review of randomized trials [^1111Rx4v]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Clonidine is added to intrathecal local anesthetics to improve intraoperative analgesia and increase the duration of sensory and motor block. The aim of this systematic review is to quantify the beneficial and harmful effects of clonidine when used as an adjuvant to intrathecal local anesthetics for surgery.

- **Methods**: We included data from 22 randomized trials (1,445 patients) testing a large variety of doses of clonidine, added to intrathecal bupivacaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, or tetracaine.

- **Results**: Clonidine 15 to 150 microg prolonged, in a linear, dose-dependent manner, the time to 2 segment regression (range of means, 14 to 75 minutes) and the time to regression to L2 (range of means, 11 to 128 minutes). The time to first analgesic request (median 101 minutes, range 35 to 310) and of motor block (median 47 minutes, range 6 to 131) was prolonged without evidence of dose-responsiveness. Time to achieve complete sensory or motor block and extent of cephalic spread remained unchanged. There were fewer episodes of intraoperative pain with clonidine (relative risk, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.64; number needed to treat, 13) but more episodes of arterial hypotension (relative risk, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.44–2.28; number needed to harm, 8) without evidence of dose-responsiveness. The risk of bradycardia was unchanged.

- **Conclusions**: This study may serve as a rational basis to help clinicians decide whether or not to combine clonidine with an intrathecal local anesthetic for surgery. The optimal dose of clonidine, however, remains unknown.

### Clonidine and dexmedetomidine for controlled hypotension during functional endoscopic sinus surgery: a comparative study [^116yPwmh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

This study was a randomized controlled trial comparing clonidine to dexmedetomidine for controlled hypotension during FESS. The study identified both drugs as potential agents for controlled hypotension during anesthesia, with some dissimilarities. Age, gender, and duration of surgery were similar in both groups. Our results are similar to those observed by Escamilia et al. in Spain.

MAP in both groups was comparable from baseline to the end of the surgery. The targeted MAP (55–65 mmHg) was reached and maintained in both groups during surgery without the need for additional drugs to decrease blood pressure. However, HR was lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared to the clonidine group, but it did not reach severe bradycardia from baseline to the end of the surgery. Our results are similar to those of Suggala et al. and Bafna et al.

Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine or dexmedetomidine) induce a decrease in HR and MAP due to the inhibition of central sympathetic outflow by stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which reduce norepinephrine release. Dexmedetomidine has higher selectivity to alpha-2 receptors (α2:α1 ratio of 1620:1) compared to clonidine (α2:α1 ratio of 200:1), making dexmedetomidine eight times more potent than clonidine regarding their pharmacological action on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.

Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation cause reflex sympathetic stimulation (hypertension and tachycardia), known as the pressor response. In our study, both drugs provided acceptable conditions for laryngoscopy and intubation by blunting the pressor response.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: A proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^115Askn5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

One small, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that transdermal clonidine reduced hyperarousal symptoms in patients with ASD. A small, placebo-controlled study of oral clonidine in children with ASD had mixed findings. There are no RCTs of clonidine ER in the ASD population. Potential side effects of clonidine include somnolence, fatigue, and reductions in pulse and blood pressure. Clonidine tends to be more sedating than guanfacine. Of note, α2-adrenergic agonists can worsen constipation, which is a common issue in the ASD population. Patients can experience rebound hypertension with abrupt discontinuation of α2-adrenergic agonists.

Research indicates that α2-adrenergic agonists have a lower effect size than psychostimulants for treating symptoms of ADHD in non-autistic children and adolescents. Nonetheless, they can be attractive options for patients presenting with significant co-occurring issues, such as irritability, anxiety, disruptive behavior, tics, and sleep disturbances. It is advisable to start with the IR preparations of guanfacine or clonidine for patients who cannot swallow tablets whole or who require a smaller initial dose.

Guanfacine IR is available in 1 mg and 2 mg tablets. The starting dose for ADHD is 0.5 mg (half of a 1 mg tablet), administered in the morning. The medication can be titrated up by 0.5 mg every few days as tolerated and divided into twice-daily dosing. Some individuals may respond better to three or four times daily dosing. The maximum daily dose varies by weight and is 2 mg/day for patients weighing 27 to 40.5 kg, and 3 mg/day for patients weighing more.

### Clonidine and dexmedetomidine increase the pressor response to norepinephrine in experimental sepsis: a pilot study [^1113KsiR]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

During septic shock, vasopressors are a cornerstone of therapy. In septic shock, very high doses of vasopressors sometimes have to be used due to vascular desensitization, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. This study assesses whether α-2 agonists increase pressor responsiveness following lipopolysaccharide administration.

- **Design**: Parallel groups of animals (n = 7 per group) subjected to pharmacologic interventions.

- **Setting**: Physiology laboratory.

- **Subjects**: Rats.

- **Interventions**: In anesthetized rats, the pressor responses to increasing doses of norepinephrine (norepinephrine-systolic pressure curve) were assessed during a baseline period, after injection of saline or lipopolysaccharide, and after subsequent injection of saline, dexmedetomidine (100 μg/kg IV), or clonidine (200 μg/kg IV).

- **Measurements and main results**: Differences in the slopes of the norepinephrine-pressure curves were assessed across drug treatments and intervals. The pressor dose of norepinephrine necessary to increase systolic pressure by 33 and 100 mm Hg (pressor dose 33 and pressor dose 100) was determined. Pressor responsiveness to norepinephrine decreased slightly over time in the saline-saline group (saline 1 or 2 vs baseline: mean decrease of the slope, 2 mm Hg/μg/kg norepinephrine; p < 0.05), whereas there was a large decrease after lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide vs baseline: mean decrease of the slope, 7.2; p < 0.001). Clonidine alone had no effect, but when administered following lipopolysaccharide, it caused a striking increase in pressor responsiveness.

### Clonidine for smoking cessation [^112yWgrD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Clonidine was originally used to lower blood pressure. It acts on the central nervous system and may reduce withdrawal symptoms in various addictive behaviors, including tobacco use.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review is to determine clonidine's effectiveness in helping smokers to quit.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for trials of clonidine. The date of the most recent search was May 2004.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized trials of clonidine versus placebo with a smoking cessation endpoint assessed at least 12 weeks following the end of treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and duration of clonidine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least 12 weeks of follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effect model.

- **Main results**: Six trials met the inclusion criteria, with three trials of oral clonidine and three of transdermal clonidine. Some form of behavioral counseling was offered to all participants in five of the six trials. There was a statistically significant effect of clonidine in one of these trials. The pooled odds ratio for success with clonidine versus placebo was 1.89 (95% confidence interval 1.30 to 2.74). There was a high incidence of dose-dependent side effects reported by participants.

### Moxonidine for tramadol withdrawal symptoms during detoxification [^115JLb5S]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

It is well documented in the literature that noradrenergic pathways are key in the manifestation of opioid withdrawal symptoms, which is why clonidine is used as an off-label agent in opioid detoxification regimens given its anti-sympathetic properties. Moxonidine is a selective I1-imidazoline receptor agonist, similar to clonidine but with no α2-adrenergic agonist activity and subsequently fewer side effects. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with a 15-year history of tramadol use who was admitted voluntarily for detoxification. She was started on moxonidine and had an uneventful detoxification. Two months after discharge, the patient maintained tramadol abstinence with good tolerability to moxonidine. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been previously reported in the medical literature.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^1122vAnT]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Clonidine is a versatile, well-tolerated, and cost-effective medication with broad utility in managing agitation and associated conditions across diverse patient populations. Its specific pharmacological properties, including alpha-2 adrenergic agonism, enable it to provide sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia while preserving respiratory function and minimizing the risks associated with antipsychotics, such as exacerbation of Parkinsonism or prolongation of delirium. Clonidine's inexpensive oral formulation makes it an accessible option in resource-limited settings, and its use is associated with a lower likelihood of prolonged hospital stays compared to antipsychotics.

Beyond agitation, clonidine demonstrates efficacy in treating conditions such as ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, PTSD-related nightmares, and hyperactive delirium. This allows it to be used in situations where diagnostic clarity has not yet been attained. Despite its established role in certain domains, there remains a need for more robust research to clarify optimal dosing strategies and expand its evidence base, particularly in populations with cognitive impairments or complex medical conditions. Clonidine represents an invaluable tool for clinicians seeking effective and safer alternatives for managing agitation and related symptoms.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^113jTDov]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Agitation, anxiety, akathisia**: Due to its nature as a sympatholytic, clinicians have used clonidine to target hyperactive symptoms such as anxiety and agitation in various settings. It has been used to improve akathisia, whether it is drug-related or not. For example, in one case of a woman with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and agitation complicated by risperidone-induced akathisia, clonidine 0.025 mg BID was successfully utilized to resolve akathisia and was well-tolerated. Other studies have replicated this finding in this population.

	- Clonidine has also been shown to be well-tolerated for agitation in other sensitive populations. For example, patients with TBI are sensitive to benzodiazepines and anticholinergics, so when considering an agent to treat akathisia in a patient where beta-blockers may be contraindicated (such as those with asthma, diabetes, or COPD), reasonable options include bromocriptine or clonidine. Another case describes a patient with Alzheimer's Disease, a population notoriously sensitive to certain medications, who had a positive response to clonidine for agitation. Another study reported an Alzheimer patient that had a decreased requirement for benzodiazepines and restraints after administration of clonidine 0.1 mg BID, and a case of a patient with a major neurocognitive disorder.

The transdermal formulation of clonidine is superior for anxiety. Compared to its oral form, the transdermal form provides a slow release of medication, thereby preventing sedation from peak levels and avoiding rebound anxiety related to the rapid metabolism of the oral form.

### Excessive blood pressure response to clonidine in hospitalized patients with asymptomatic severe hypertension [^1164njiy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

There are limited and nonconcordant data on the rapidity and safety of blood pressure response to clonidine in the setting of asymptomatic severe hypertension. We evaluated the blood pressure response to clonidine in hospitalized patients with asymptomatic severe hypertension.

- **Methods**: We performed a review of hospitalized, noncritically ill patients receiving clonidine within 6 hours of developing asymptomatic severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > 180 or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > 110 mm Hg in the absence of acute hypertension-mediated target organ damage). The incidence of mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction by ≥ 30% at 4 hours after clonidine was the primary endpoint.

- **Results**: We identified 200 relevant patient encounters (median age 63 years, 48.5% women). Median time to clonidine following asymptomatic severe hypertension was 2.8 hours. A total of 20 (10%) patients had ≥ 30% MAP reduction within 4 hours after clonidine, and 32 (16%) patients had ≥ 30% reduction in either SBP, DBP, or MAP. Older age, female sex, and preexisting vascular disease were associated with ≥ 30% MAP reductions (P < 0.05). Only patient sex and clonidine dose of 0.3 mg were significant in multivariable models. There were 14 adverse events observed within 24 hours of administration of clonidine; most (9) were acute kidney injury. There were no ischemic (myocardial, cerebrovascular) events.

- **Conclusions**: A substantial minority of hospitalized patients with asymptomatic severe hypertension experience precipitous blood pressure decline with clonidine, and though blood

### Low-dose clonidine infusion to improve sleep in postoperative patients in the high-dependency unit. A randomised placebo-controlled single-centre trial [^1138NNd8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

From 20 December 2018 to 14 September 2020, we randomized 83 patients out of 1169 patients scheduled for elective surgery followed by planned HDU admission. The most common reasons for inability to participate in the trial were the unavailability of a research coordinator, the inability to contact the patient preoperatively, and refusal of consent. Only 9.5% of potentially eligible patients had a relative clinical contraindication to clonidine. Three randomized patients had no sleep data recorded due to study protocol errors and were excluded from the analysis. Three out of 39 (8%) clonidine patients and one of 41 (2%) placebo patients did not receive the allocated intervention for at least two hours. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by treatment received, excluding these four patients. No patients received open-label α2 agonists, and no clinician requested that a patient allocation be unblinded.

Study patients had low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores. Almost all had undergone general anesthesia, and approximately 30% had received small doses (45–60 μg) of clonidine intraoperatively. Almost all (92–95%) were prescribed only oral analgesia for the postoperative period. Approximately two-thirds received opioids, typically at a low dose (median 75–160 μg fentanyl equivalents over the HDU admission), with no significant differences between study groups.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^113VueVM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Clonidine exhibits sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties due to its agonist activity at endogenous alpha receptors. Moreover, it is relatively inexpensive, well-tolerated, and has high oral bioavailability. These characteristics are largely attributed to clonidine's greater affinity for alpha-2 over alpha-1 receptors. The half-life of clonidine varies significantly between patients, with reported ranges from 5 to 25.5 hours. Metabolism is primarily facilitated through the hepatic CYP2D6 system; however, some clonidine is excreted via the kidneys without undergoing metabolism.

Its activity at alpha-2 receptors leads to decreased norepinephrine release and a resultant shift in autonomic activity towards the parasympathetic nervous system. This modulation manifests as sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic effects. Furthermore, clonidine's high bioavailability makes it suitable for oral administration.

### Intracranial hemorrhage following a single dose of yohimbine in a chronic user of clonidine [^115UBbE6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist found in various supplements, has been historically used to treat libido, erectile dysfunction, xerostomia, and as a weight loss enhancement. Yohimbine toxicity causes a sympathomimetic syndrome, as demonstrated by the case of a female who developed an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) following ingestion of yohimbine.

- **Case**: This case follows a 39-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of nausea, emesis, and flushing after ingesting a female sexual enhancement supplement labeled to contain yohimbine (BioXgenic Nature's Desire) one hour prior. The patient took her prescribed 0.1 mg of clonidine when the symptoms commenced. Upon arrival, the patient's blood pressure was 198/93 mmHg. She developed neurological sequelae, including a left-sided facial droop and weakness of her right extremities. A computed tomography scan demonstrated an acute basal ganglia hemorrhage with mild mass effect and mild subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was transferred to a regional referral hospital and discharged 16 days later to a rehabilitation center with persistent neurological sequelae.

- **Discussion**: This patient exhibited sympathetic toxicity temporally associated with yohimbine ingestion. Our patient also had various risk factors that increased the likelihood of a poor outcome with yohimbine. Chronic use of clonidine is known to down-regulate alpha-2 receptors. This leads to dependence on clonidine to maintain adrenergic homeostasis and could potentiate the effects of yohimbine.

### Clonidine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: II. ECG changes and adverse events analysis [^111q9QZJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or in combination with methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to receive clonidine (n = 31), methylphenidate (n = 29), clonidine and methylphenidate (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30). Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0.6 mg/day for clonidine and 60 mg/day for methylphenidate, both with divided dosing. Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs.

The results indicated more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine (17.5% versus 3.4%; p = .02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. There were no interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects receiving clonidine (79.4% versus 49.2%; p = .0006), but these were not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal. Drowsiness was common with clonidine but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks.

In conclusion, clonidine, used alone or with methylphenidate, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD. Physicians prescribing clonidine should monitor for bradycardia and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial drowsiness.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^116cxNsD]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). High credibility.

This review explores clonidine as a potential treatment for agitation across various clinical contexts, focusing on its application in patients with limited cognitive reserve, hyperactive delirium, or conditions where standard treatments may exacerbate underlying symptoms, such as Parkinsonism. It evaluates the pharmacological properties, efficacy, and practical considerations for using clonidine in managing agitation, including its role in other psychiatric and medical conditions.

- **Recent findings**: Clonidine, a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reduces norepinephrine release, leading to sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without significant respiratory depression. Recent studies and case reports highlight its utility in managing agitation, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, dementia, and hyperactive delirium. Clonidine has demonstrated advantages over antipsychotics in preserving cognitive function and minimizing delirium duration. Additionally, it shows promise in treating PTSD-related nightmares and as an adjunct in anesthesia and analgesia.

- **Summary/takeaway**: Clonidine offers a well-tolerated, cost-effective alternative to antipsychotics for managing agitation, particularly in vulnerable populations. Its diverse applications, favorable safety profile, and minimal impact on Parkinsonism make it a valuable tool in psychiatry and medicine. Further research is needed to refine dosing protocols and expand its indications in managing agitation and related symptoms.

### Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in diabetes: A clinical perspective [^112etBm3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Clonidine, an α-2 antagonist, produces a central sympatholytic effect and a consequent decrease in blood pressure. Patients with severe cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) have little central sympathetic efferent activity, and the use of clonidine (0.1–0.6 mg/day) could result in an increase in venous return without a significant increase in peripheral vascular resistance. Its use is limited by the inconsistent hypertensive effect and serious side effects.

Somatostatin analogs (25–200 μg/day) may attenuate orthostatic hypotension in patients with CAN by inhibiting the release of vasoactive gastrointestinal peptides, enhancing cardiac output, and increasing forearm and splanchnic vascular resistance. However, severe cases of hypertension were reported with their use in patients with diabetic CAN.

Pyridostigmine bromide, a cholinesterase inhibitor, was recently shown to ameliorate orthostatic hypotension by enhancing ganglionic transmission without worsening supine hypertension.

### Clonidine facilitates controlled hypotension in adolescent children [^115AbJzo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we investigated whether clonidine lessened the requirements for isoflurane, fentanyl, and labetalol to provide controlled hypotension in children who underwent oromaxillofacial surgery. We also studied preoperative sedative effects, the hemodynamic response to nasotracheal intubation, and recovery characteristics.

Thirty-nine healthy children, aged 10–16 years, received clonidine 5 micro g/kg or placebo the night before surgery and 90 minutes before surgery. By self-assessment, children in both groups showed similar anxiety, whereas observers rated clonidine patients as more sedated (P < 0.01). Heart rate during induction remained significantly decreased in clonidine patients compared with placebo patients (P < 0.001), as did arterial blood pressure before induction (P < 0.01) and peak pressure after intubation (P < 0.001).

Children who took clonidine required significantly less isoflurane to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of 60 ± 4 mm Hg (mean isoflurane concentration, clonidine 0.99% versus placebo 1.33; P = 0.0004) and required less fentanyl than placebo patients (P = 0.002). Fewer treatment patients received labetalol (clonidine, n = 3 versus placebo, n = 13; P = 0.004). There was a trend toward faster recovery in the clonidine group, with a shortened recovery room stay (P = 0.03).

We conclude that clonidine is a useful adjunct for controlled hypotension in children.

- **Implications**: This study shows that adolescents having major jaw surgery are helped by the blood pressure-decreasing drug clonidine.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^113i8BCT]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Clonidine is an α 2 -adrenergic agonist used more often in the past to treat CRPS when "sympathetically maintained pain" was thought to be a more uniform feature than it is now. It can be given orally, transdermally, or epidurally (level 3 evidence). Adverse effects include sedation, dizziness, headache, and hypotension. Although a case series showed that transdermal clonidine benefitted local CRPS-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia (level 4 evidence), a systematic review found no convincing support for clonidine (level 1 evidence) and, indeed, it is only rarely used for CRPS. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, has a strong mechanistic rationale for managing vasoconstriction (level 4 evidence), and two uncontrolled case series found doses of up to 60 mg/day useful for CRPS.

Phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine are α-adrenergic antagonists sometimes discussed as third-line agents for CRPS. Two case series provide very preliminary support for efficacy from treatment with phenoxybenzamine. Phentolamine is expensive, in limited supply, and administered by continuous intravenous infusion, and it is not widely used.

Calcitonin, a polypeptide hormone produced by the thyroid, appears to have beneficial effects in CRPS independent of its effects on bone. It is usually administered intra-nasally and is without significant adverse effects in normocalcemic individuals. Calcitonin is one of few CRPS treatments studied in multiple RCTs, and meta-analysis of a limited number of controlled studies (level 1) demonstrates the value of this treatment approach.

### Pediatric regional anesthesia: A practical guideline for daily clinical practice [^113gTpPi]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

A number of drugs are available that, when used as additives to local anesthetics, can increase the duration of nerve blockade. For caudal blocks, two α2-receptor agonists are eligible, with clonidine being more widely used, while dexmedetomidine (the more selective agonist) is gaining popularity. Added at the usual dose level of 1 to 2 µg/kg, either drug can extend analgesia to twice its normal duration. While clonidine has been associated with respiratory depression in (former) neonates, our in-house standard of monitoring newborns up to and including 60 weeks of postgestational age for more than 24 hours after surgery allows these events (usually manifesting as prolonged episodes of apnea) to be detected and adequately managed. Sedation, mainly observed with dexmedetomidine at doses greater than 2 µg/kg, is a desirable side effect of α2-receptor agonists intraoperatively but can lead to protracted stays in the recovery room.

Lipophilic opioids can also be used as additives for pediatric caudal blockade, with fentanyl typically added at a dose of 1 µg/kg. While offering a prolongation effect on postoperative analgesia similar to clonidine, side effects are more prevalent, including respiratory depression, vomiting, or bradycardia. Other additive drugs that have been described for caudal blockade in children, like preservative-free S(+)-ketamine or tramadol, have never gained a foothold in daily clinical practice.

Thanks to exact research, pediatric caudal blockade has evolved into a technique that covers a broad spectrum of clinical indications in a growing number of cases.

### Safety of intrathecal clonidine as an adjuvant to spinal anesthesia in infants and children [^115EtuEZ]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding the decision to utilize premedication before the procedure for anxiolysis or sedation for lumbar puncture, we do not find that this is routinely required. There is some concern that these patients are difficult to immobilize during the administration of spinal anesthesia, and other centers endorse that the routine use of premedication will improve conditions for a successful procedure. We find that the most important factor in the success of spinal placement is proper patient positioning and preparation of all members of the perioperative team before the patient arrives in the operating room. Education of nurses and patient families, focused anesthesiologist training, availability of supplies, optimization of surgical scheduling, and having consistent backup plans all will translate to positive clinical outcomes.

Unfortunately, our methods of data collection had limitations that might have impacted our findings and the context of their interpretation. Notably, monitor artifacts captured by the electronic medical record may have been recorded as oxygen desaturation, increasing the uncertainty of the actual incidence of hypoxemia experienced by these patients. Additionally, supplemental oxygen administration differs based on individual anesthesia provider practices and might not truly reflect the patients' need for oxygen supplementation. Another challenge to our data collection was defining the parameters of "hypotension" and "bradycardia" as our measurements of adverse events. We considered a systolic blood pressure lower than 60 mmHg to be "hypotension".

### Catapres-TTS-3 [^115HCK7p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be cautioned against interrupting Catapres-TTS® (clonidine transdermal system) therapy without their physician's advice. Since patients may experience a possible sedative effect, dizziness, or accommodation disorder with the use of clonidine, they should be advised on the risk of engaging in activities such as driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery. Additionally, inform patients that this sedative effect may be increased by concomitant use of alcohol, barbiturates, or other sedating drugs.

Patients who wear contact lenses should be cautioned that treatment with Catapres-TTS® may cause dryness of the eyes. Patients should be instructed to consult their physicians promptly about the possible need to remove the patch if they observe moderate to severe localized erythema and/or vesicle formation at the site of application or a generalized skin rash.

If a patient experiences isolated, mild localized skin irritation before completing 7 days of use, the system may be removed and replaced with a new system applied to a fresh skin site. If the system begins to loosen from the skin after application, the patient should be instructed to place the adhesive cover directly over the system to ensure adhesion during its 7-day use.

Used Catapres-TTS® patches contain a substantial amount of their initial drug content which may be harmful to infants and children if accidentally applied or ingested. Therefore, patients should be cautioned to keep both used and unused Catapres-TTS® patches out of the reach of children. After use, Catapres-TTS should be folded.

### A randomized controlled trial of clonidine added to psychostimulant medication for hyperactive and aggressive children [^116RbSBM]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). High credibility.

To compare clonidine with placebo added to ongoing psychostimulant therapy for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, a study was conducted involving children aged 6 to 14 years who were recruited from 2000 to 2001. They were randomized to receive clonidine syrup 0.10 to 0.20 mg/day (n = 38) or placebo (n = 29) for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measures were the Conduct and Hyperactive Index subscales of the parent-report Conners Behavior Checklist. Side effects were monitored using physiological measures and the Barkley Side Effect Rating Scale.

Evaluable patient analysis showed that significantly more clonidine-treated children than controls were responders on the Conduct scale (21 of 37 versus 6 of 29; chi2(1) = 8.75, p < 0.01), but not on the Hyperactive Index (13 of 37 versus 5 of 29). Compared with placebo, clonidine was associated with a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure measured standing and with transient sedation and dizziness. Clonidine-treated individuals had a greater reduction in a number of unwanted effects associated with psychostimulant treatment compared with placebo.

The findings support the continued use of clonidine in combination with psychostimulant medication to reduce conduct symptoms associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Treatment is well tolerated and unwanted effects are transient.

### How new developments in pharmacology receptor theory are changing (our understanding of) hypertension therapy [^113MfgAE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

- **Alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonists**: This is a discrete class of drugs that have been used since approximately 1965.

	* **FDA-approved drugs**: clonidine, guanfacine.
	* **Primary mechanism of action**: This class of drugs has been used almost exclusively to inhibit the central drive of blood pressure by stimulating inhibitory presynaptic α2 adrenergic receptors, ultimately leading to a reduction in sympathetic nervous system drive. This is thought to be mediated predominantly through inhibitor G-protein mechanisms (Gi/o signaling).
	* **New mechanisms of action**: Clonidine can also activate Gs and β-arrestin biased pathway through human α2a or α2C adrenergic receptors, recombinantly expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. While guanfacine was not tested, guanabenz also showed the ability to activate both Gs and β-arrestin pathways. It is unknown whether these other signal transduction pathways contribute to the antihypertensive effects of these two drugs.

- **Alpha1 adrenergic receptor antagonists**: This class of drugs is recognized as effective antihypertensive medications.

	* **FDA-approved drugs**: doxazosin, phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, terazosin.
	* **Primary mechanism of action**: These antagonists reduce total peripheral resistance by antagonizing the α1 adrenergic receptor that receives stimulation from the sympathetic nervous system, the endogenous agonists of which are norepinephrine and epinephrine.
	* **New mechanisms of action**: Many of the above antagonists have been investigated for inverse agonism. In vitro studies support that at least prazosin and terazosin have moderate to strong inverse agonism.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115oZ5dY]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, particularly in the context of alpha-adrenergic agonists, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of α-2 adrenergic agonists, such as lofexidine or clonidine, for managing opioid withdrawal. However, it is recognized that methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, retaining patients in withdrawal management, and supporting the completion of withdrawal management.

### Safety of intrathecal clonidine as an adjuvant to spinal anesthesia in infants and children [^111Ww1Je]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Clonidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist originally applied clinically for the treatment of hypertension. More recently, it has been shown to be a safe and effective adjuvant for neuraxial anesthesia in adults, especially within obstetrical practice. However, there is less understanding regarding its use for neuraxial anesthesia in infants and children.

Spinal anesthesia has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia (GA) for certain surgical procedures. This may be particularly beneficial in pediatric populations, as it avoids the need for airway manipulation and alleviates parental concerns about the perceived risks of general anesthesia. An impediment to the use of spinal anesthesia in infants is its short duration of action compared to adults. Clonidine has been shown to prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia as well as reduce the intraoperative requirements for sedation and analgesics.

Regarding its safety profile, Walker et al. previously demonstrated that intrathecal clonidine did not produce signs of spinal cord toxicity in rat pups, even at super-therapeutic dosages. While preliminary clinical studies in humans have also indicated that clonidine is safe to use as an intrathecal adjuvant in spinal anesthesia, these cohorts have generally been limited to fewer than 100 patients. Although adverse effects including bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression have been reported, the smaller cohort size may limit an accurate evaluation of the safety and adverse effect profile of clonidine.

### Topical clonidine for neuropathic pain in adults [^114rYSpZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Clonidine is a presynaptic alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist that has been used for many years to treat hypertension and other conditions, including chronic pain. Adverse events associated with systemic use of the drug have limited its application. Topical use of drugs has been gaining interest since the beginning of the century, as it may limit adverse events without loss of analgesic efficacy. Topical clonidine (TC) formulations have been investigated for almost 20 years in clinical trials. This is an update of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 8, 2015.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of TC compared with placebo or other drugs in adults aged 18 years or above with chronic neuropathic pain.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid) databases, as well as reference lists of retrieved papers and trial registries. We also contacted experts in the field. The most recent search was performed on 27 October 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing TC versus placebo or other active treatment in adults with chronic neuropathic pain.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author if necessary. Where required, we contacted trial authors to request additional information.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^113M6dnQ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Within the domain of consultation psychiatry, a common consult is for assistance with the treatment of agitation. Agitation is a non-specific term that describes a wide range of behaviors. In patients with limited cognitive capacity secondary to acute or chronic traumatic insults — or other etiologies — agitation may represent non-cooperation with nursing staff. It may also be a sign of hyperactive delirium. Regardless of the underlying etiology, antipsychotics are commonly used for agitation; however, these have the untoward side effect of worsening Parkinsonism and may increase mortality in certain subsets of elderly patients. Many also have off-target anticholinergic effects that run the risk of precipitating or worsening delirium in patients with low cognitive reserve. There is a paucity of recent literature on other pharmacologic methods of agitation management, especially in patients with frontal encephalomalacia. We discuss the extant literature available on clonidine's utilization in psychiatric and other domains to facilitate identification of scenarios in which this inexpensive and widely available drug may be helpful.

Management of agitation in patients with significant Parkinsonism can be particularly difficult, as medications favored for this indication (such as olanzapine and haloperidol) are highly anti-dopaminergic. One way to circumvent this problem is via antipsychotics that work primarily through serotonergic antagonism, such as quetiapine or pimavanserin. However, when these medications are ineffective, the modulation of other neurotransmitters may be necessary.

### Intranasal clonidine as a premedicant: three cases with unique indications [^115JyK9y]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Clonidine is increasingly used in the pediatric population as a sedative and analgesic due to its central alpha2-adrenergic agonism. We report three cases of preoperative use of intranasal clonidine in pediatric patients, each for a different indication: One patient was treated for preoperative agitation and hallucinations associated with oral midazolam; another was given clonidine as a premedicant; the third patient was treated for preoperative agitation and hypertension. All three patients experienced subjective resolution of their indicated symptoms, and none experienced adverse outcomes.

### Dexmedetomidine- or clonidine-based sedation compared with propofol in critically ill patients: The A2B randomized clinical trial [^115ZZ5Rc]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

The study A2B (clonidine vs. propofol) was published in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to weaning from mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, open-label, RCT.
- **Population**: 947 patients (338 female, 609 male). Inclusion criteria were adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Key exclusion criteria were acute brain injury, neuromuscular paralysis, bradycardia, and expected survival no longer than 24 hours.
- **Interventions**:
	- **Clonidine group**: n = 476 (starting dose 1.0 mcg/kg/h, maximum dose 2.0 mcg/kg/h).
	- **Propofol group**: n = 471 (no specific dose guidance given).
- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in median time to successful extubation (146 hours vs. 162 hours).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in death at day 180 (30% vs. 30%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.31).
	- No significant difference in time to first day with optimum sedation (3 days vs. 3 days; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.1).
- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference in sedation-related adverse events. However, there was a significant difference in severe bradycardia (33%).

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^117Rwajw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Stimulants (e.g. amphetamine-based and methylphenidate-based agents) and non-stimulants (e.g. atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine) are licensed as pharmacological treatments for ADHD. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line treatment due to their greater efficacy. However, the recommendations from international clinical guidelines are inconsistent with respect to the order in which the stimulants should be offered, with some guidelines advocating for methylphenidate over amphetamines in children while other guidelines make no distinction between the stimulants. The non-stimulant atomoxetine is recommended by guidelines as a second- or third-line treatment. Consequently, consumption patterns of different ADHD medications across geographical locations may differ but remain unclear.

We previously reported the prevalence of ADHD medication use in thirteen countries and one special administrative region between 2001 and 2015 and found an increasing trend in all studied sites, with methylphenidate being the most commonly used ADHD medication in most countries. However, existing literature on global ADHD medication use beyond 2015, particularly from middle-income countries as well as geographical regions such as Africa, Central and South America, Southern and Western Asia, remains scarce. A recent study examined psychotropic medicine consumption in 65 countries and regions and found that geographical locations and income levels are explanatory factors for between-country/region consumption disparities. Furthermore, guanfacine and clonidine were not licensed for ADHD in most countries.

### Clonidine for pain in non-ventilated infants [^114M2A6H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Critically ill newborn infants undergo a variety of painful procedures or experience a variety of painful conditions during their early life in the neonatal unit. In the critically ill pediatric and neonatal population, clonidine is prescribed as an adjunct to opioids or benzodiazepines aiming to reduce the doses of these drugs that are required for analgesia or sedation, or to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation. It has been shown that clonidine premedication might have a positive effect on postoperative pain in children.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefit and harms of clonidine for the prevention or treatment of procedural pain, postoperative pain, or pain associated with clinical conditions in non-ventilated neonates.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the CENTRAL, MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to December 2018. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials. We ran an updated search from 1 January 2018 to 11 March 2020 in CENTRAL via CRS Web, MEDLINE via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCOhost.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing clonidine to placebo or no treatment, opioids, paracetamol, dexmedetomidine, or non-pharmacological pain-reducing interventions for the management of procedural pain, postoperative pain, and pain associated with clinical conditions in preterm and term newborns.

### What is the place of clonidine in anesthesia? Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^117UYwuK]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). High credibility.

The place of clonidine has been suggested for various indications in perioperative medicine. The aim of this systematic review and these meta-analyses is to systematically and quantitatively evaluate these potential indications of clonidine.

- **Design, setting, patients, and interventions**: We selected and analyzed (qualitatively and, when possible, quantitatively) the available literature published on PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane database. Inclusion criteria included human randomized controlled trials involving adults who received perioperative systemic (oral, intramuscular, transdermal, and intravenous) clonidine for every type of surgery.

- **Measurements and main results**: We identified 775 trials, excluded 718, and analyzed 57 trials concerning a total of 14,790 patients, of whom 7,408 received clonidine and 6,836 received a placebo. The most important results indicate that, in both qualitative and quantitative analyses, clonidine vs. placebo reduces analgesic consumption (159 vs. 154 patients: 24%, 95% CI [16%-32%]; p < 0.001), reduces nausea and vomiting (risk ratio, in 180 vs. 181 patients: 0.35, 95% CI [0.25–0.51]; p < 0.001), and improves hemodynamic stability (reduction of heart rate: 14.9 bpm, 95% CI [10.4–19.5]; p < 0.001; reduction of mean arterial pressure: 12.5 mmHg, 95% CI [7.14–17.86]; p < 0.001) one minute after tracheal intubation in 67 vs. 68 patients. It also prevents postoperative shivering (risk ratio, in 140 vs. 140 patients: 0.17, 95% CI [0.10–0.29]; p < 0.001). However, clonidine does not have any influence on renal and cardiac outcomes, as measured by adverse event rates in 5,873 vs. 5,536 patients receiving clonidine and placebo, respectively.
