## Question

A 45-year-old woman presents to your clinic for evaluation of a newly discovered adnexal mass. She has no significant past medical history. On further questioning, she reveals that her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 48, and her maternal aunt died of ovarian cancer at age 52. The patient is anxious about her risk and asks about next steps.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient regarding her risk for hereditary cancer syndromes?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing a 45-year-old woman with a new adnexal mass and a concerning family history for hereditary cancer risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether her family history meets criteria for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) risk assessment. Then, I should verify which brief familial risk tools are acceptable and how to apply them. Next, I will confirm the referral pathway to genetic counseling and whether testing should precede or follow counseling. After that, I need to consider the immediate evaluation of the adnexal mass itself and whether it changes the timing of genetics. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, prioritized recommendation with supporting guidelines and citations.

> Let me first confirm the risk profile. Her mother had breast cancer at 48 and her maternal aunt had ovarian cancer at 52; both are first- or second-degree relatives with cancers at early ages, which raises concern for HBOC due to BRCA1/2 and meets multiple referral triggers in common brief tools and professional society criteria, so she should undergo formal hereditary risk assessment rather than routine screening or no action [^51d3d519] [^edd7b8db] [^2576e20e].

> Wait, let me verify the tool-based thresholds. The USPSTF-endorsed seven-item screen flags for referral with even one positive response about early-onset breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer, breast plus ovarian cancer, or clustering of breast/ovarian cancers, which she meets via early-onset maternal breast cancer and maternal aunt with ovarian cancer; similarly, the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool assigns high scores for first-degree breast cancer under 50 and ovarian cancer, again supporting referral at or above commonly used thresholds [^51d3d519] [^5f620c78].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing before counseling. I should confirm the sequence: current standards require genetic counseling first, with pre-test education on risks, benefits, limitations, and potential results, followed by testing only if indicated and consented; this is emphasized by ACOG/SGO, NCCN, and NSGC, and aligns with USPSTF's B recommendation to screen with a brief tool, provide counseling, and then test if indicated [^288596cb] [^2576e20e] [^a1aa2c76] [^1e2b3d3c].

> I need to check the immediate adnexal mass workup and whether it should delay genetics. The ovarian mass needs prompt evaluation with appropriate imaging and tumor markers, and referral to gynecologic oncology if features are suspicious or risk is high; however, genetic counseling and testing results do not need to precede surgical planning, so I should not delay necessary oncologic evaluation while awaiting genetics, even though the genetics referral should be initiated now in parallel [^e5b26236] [^3e8a2dc9].

> Let me consider the testing strategy. Initially, I thought single-gene BRCA1/2 testing might suffice given the classic HBOC phenotype, but wait, I should verify current practice: multigene panels that include BRCA1/2 and other actionable genes are now standard when clinical suspicion is high or when more than one gene could explain the pattern, because they can detect additional pathogenic variants that change management; this is supported by ACOG/SGO and contemporary genetics practice resources [^288596cb] [^f318039d].

> I should double-check the downstream implications if a pathogenic variant is found. Identification of a BRCA1/2 or other actionable variant would inform her breast and ovarian cancer risk management, including consideration of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy and enhanced breast surveillance, and would enable cascade testing for relatives; this is precisely why guidelines prioritize identifying such patients through structured risk assessment and counseling [^06e85964] [^2576e20e].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is to perform a brief familial risk assessment now, which she will screen positive on, and immediately refer her for genetic counseling with consideration of multigene panel testing if indicated after counseling; concurrently, evaluate the adnexal mass with appropriate imaging and tumor markers and refer to gynecologic oncology if high-risk features are present, without delaying necessary surgical management for genetics results [^1e2b3d3c] [^288596cb] [^e5b26236] [^3e8a2dc9].

The most appropriate next step is to **refer for genetic counseling** [^2eb7c141] because the patient has a first-degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 and a second-degree relative with ovarian cancer, which meets criteria for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) risk assessment [^51d3d519] [^2576e20e]. Genetic counseling should occur **before any genetic testing** [^288596cb] to discuss risks, benefits, and implications of results, and to guide test selection (typically a multigene panel including BRCA1/2) [^288596cb]. Concurrently, evaluate the adnexal mass with ultrasound and tumor markers (CA-125, HE4) [^e5b26236] and refer to gynecologic oncology if features suggest malignancy [^e5b26236].

---

## Rationale for genetic counseling referral

- **Family history criteria**: The patient meets established criteria for genetic counseling due to a first-degree relative (mother) with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 and a second-degree relative (maternal aunt) with ovarian cancer [^3b2e3302] [^2576e20e].

- **Increased risk**: This family pattern significantly increases the likelihood of a hereditary cancer syndrome, particularly HBOC due to BRCA1/2 mutations [^1f151e2c].

- **Guideline support**: Multiple professional organizations (ACOG, SGO, NCCN, USPSTF) recommend genetic counseling for individuals with such family histories [^288596cb] [^2576e20e] [^1e2b3d3c].

---

## Role of genetic counseling

Genetic counseling is essential to:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate personal and family history to estimate the likelihood of a hereditary cancer syndrome [^a1aa2c76].

- **Education**: Explain the risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic testing, including potential psychological and familial implications [^a1aa2c76].

- **Test selection**: Guide the choice of appropriate genetic tests, typically multigene panels including BRCA1/2 and other relevant genes [^288596cb].

- **Informed consent**: Ensure the patient understands and consents to testing after counseling [^2576e20e].

---

## Concurrent evaluation of the adnexal mass

While arranging genetic counseling, the adnexal mass should be evaluated with **ultrasound** to characterize morphology and vascularity [^notfound], and with **tumor markers** (CA-125, HE4) to assess malignancy risk [^notfound]. Refer to gynecologic oncology if ultrasound features are suspicious or tumor markers are elevated [^e5b26236].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Refer for genetic counseling | Meets HBOC risk criteria; guideline-supported [^3b2e3302] [^2576e20e] |
| 2 | Ultrasound and tumor markers (CA-125, HE4) | Evaluate adnexal mass for malignancy risk [^notfound] |
| 3 | Refer to gynecologic oncology if indicated | Suspicious features or elevated markers [^e5b26236] |

---

The most appropriate next step is to **refer for genetic counseling** [^2eb7c141] due to the strong family history, while concurrently evaluating the adnexal mass with ultrasound and tumor markers [^d41db6e4]. This approach ensures timely assessment of hereditary risk and appropriate management of the mass.

Assessing heritable risk (Recommendation 1.3) — During the diagnosis for women with ovarian masses, the guideline stresses that the most important risk-related intervention is taking family history and related counseling, in all settings, and family history includes the patient's age, cancer history, childbearing status and preferences, and that of close relatives (especially first- and second-degree relatives). First-degree relatives include a patient's mother, father, sister, brother, daughter, or son; second-degree relatives are the first-degree relative(s) of a patient's first-degree relatives (grandparents, grandchildren, parent(s)'s siblings and their children, and half-siblings). In basic-resource settings, clinicians evaluating women for ovarian masses in basic-resource settings should obtain a comprehensive family cancer history, and families of women with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer seeking genetic counseling should be referred to a higher-level center with clinicians trained in cancer risk management. In limited-resource and enhanced-resource settings, clinicians should be mindful that to offer genetic testing, actionable next steps should be available, for example, follow-up counseling and genetic marker–based treatment(s), and guidelines such as SIGN state with a low level of evidence that screening for ovarian cancer in high-risk groups without confirmed diagnosis of personal or family history of cancer should only be offered in the context of a research study (Source: informal consensus on the basis of Expert Panel opinion).

Discussion

This guideline is not focused on screening and/or genetic tests (the prespecified population in this guideline does not include asymptomatic individuals; ASCO has a maximal setting guideline for testing for women with a personal history of ovarian cancer but acknowledges that there is no global resource to inform what is available, accessible, and paid for by population-level care in each country and/or region). Assessing heritable risk of ovarian cancer is a part of diagnosis, but the overall population for this umbrella group of recommendations is women with ovarian masses, independent of potential individual heritable risk, and does not include populations that are asymptomatic. During the diagnosis for women with ovarian masses, the guideline stresses that the most important risk-related intervention is taking family history and related counseling, in all settings, recognizing that genetic counseling is not accessible to most women outside of maximal-resource settings. A 2015 ASCO policy statement "affirms that the recognition and management of individuals at inherited risk for cancer is a core element of oncology practice. The skills required to provide cancer risk assessment services are not specific to a discipline but rather incorporate elements from oncology, medical genetics and genetic counseling, and other disciplines. ASCO recommends continued education of oncologists and other health care professionals in the area of cancer risk assessment and management of individuals with an inherited predisposition to cancer".

Family history includes the patient's age, cancer history, childbearing status and preferences, and that of close relatives (especially first- and second-degree relatives). First-degree relatives include a patient's mother, father, sister, brother, daughter, or son; second-degree relatives are the first-degree relative(s) of a patient's first-degree relatives (grandparents, grandchildren, parent(s') siblings and their children, and half-siblings). Recommendations on genetic testing and how to best manage results are still equivocal in both resource-rich and resource-constrained settings.

Basic-resource settings

Clinicians evaluating women for ovarian masses in basic-resource settings should obtain a comprehensive family cancer history. Recognizing the heritable risk of ovarian cancer, family history of ovarian cancer are key supportive data to guide diagnosis. Families of women with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer seeking genetic counseling should be referred to a higher-level center with clinicians trained in cancer risk management.

### The perils of single-site genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes in the era of next-generation sequencing [^f318039d]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

A challenge in counseling patients with a family history suggesting a hereditary cancer syndrome is deciding which genetic tests or panels to order. In this article, we discuss the identification of multiple familial mutations through genetic counseling and panel testing. For patients meeting National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for clinical genetic testing, providers should consider expanded panels to provide a more complete assessment of one's genetic risk. The continued use of expanded panel testing in the clinical setting will help inform optimal management of cancer patients, as well as the management of their unaffected family members. The mutation discovered in this case was in the ATM gene. The clinical significance of the mutation, potential therapeutic targets, and proper clinical management are discussed.

Key Points

With single-site genetic testing, there is the potential to miss hereditary genetic syndromes that can be managed clinically. Between 4% and 6% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes are caused by genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2. ATM is a DNA mismatch repair gene associated with double-stranded DNA break repair and cell cycle checkpoint arrest. The risk of developing female breast cancer by age 50 and by age 80 in ATM heterozygotes is 9% and 17%-52%, respectively.

FAMILY HISTORY OF EARLY-ONSET BREAST CANCER

Assessment of family history is essential when evaluating young women accessing primary care. Understanding a woman's family history of breast cancer can identify individuals at elevated risk for hereditary breast cancer or women who would benefit from increased breast cancer surveillance. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the National Institute of Health Care Excellence, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have published guidelines recommending assessment of family history and screening for patients at increased risk of breast cancer. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that screening should include at minimum a personal cancer history and first- and second-degree relatives' cancer history that includes a description of the type of primary cancer, the age of onset, and the lineage of the family member. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical guidelines recommend genetic assessment for all patients with first- and second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer younger than age 50 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening of women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer using one of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing. Genetic counselors can help determine which of the many available panels of genetic testing are most appropriate and cost-effective.

Summary of recommendations (Level C) — risk assessment and genetic testing: "Evaluating a patient's risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome should be a routine part of obstetric and gynecologic practice. Initial risk evaluation should include a personal medical history and family history". Regarding testing, "Genetic testing is recommended when the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome for which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management". Testing options are specified: "The two main genetic testing options for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome are BRCA mutation testing and multigene panel testing that includes both BRCA and other genetic mutations". Additionally, "Multigene panel testing may be useful when more than one gene may be associated with an inherited cancer syndrome or when a patient has a personal or family history that is consistent with an inherited cancer susceptibility, but single-gene testing has not identified a pathogenic variant".

### Practice bulletin No 182: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome [^7c08aa8f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome — definition, testing, and referral — is described as an inherited cancer-susceptibility syndrome characterized by multiple family members with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or both, and in this document ovarian cancer also refers to fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Clinical genetic testing for gene mutations allows more precise identification of those women who are at an increased risk of inherited breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and for these individuals, screening and prevention strategies can be instituted to reduce their risks. Obstetrician–gynecologists play an important role in identification and management, and if the obstetrician–gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider does not have the necessary knowledge or expertise in cancer genetics to counsel a patient appropriately, referral to a genetic counselor, gynecologic or medical oncologist, or other genetics specialist should be considered.

### Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: an updated primer for OB / GYNs [^b7a15248]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This article provides an update on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) associated with pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA1/2. While many new genes have been identified and are included in testing panels, HBOC will serve as the primary example to illustrate the main concepts involved in genetic testing and management for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer We provide practical information regarding collecting a family history, cancer risk assessment, genetic testing and result interpretation, BRCA-associated cancer prognosis and treatment, screening recommendations, and prevention strategies. We also introduce implications of more recently identified cancer genes, polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and tumor genomic profiling. Evidence-based management strategies have been shown to reduce cancer incidence and improve survival in HBOC and other high penetrance syndromes. Obstetricians and gynecologists familiar with these concepts can identify and improve the quality of care for women and families impacted by hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer.

### Practice bulletin No 182: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome [^c17d697e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome — management when no documented mutation: Women with a personal or family history but without a documented mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, or another associated gene "should be managed based on their family history". Preliminary data note that in families with only breast cancer and no identified BRCA mutation, risk of breast cancer remains increased but not ovarian cancer. Testing era affects residual risk assessment: "If women were tested before 2009, they may not have had large gene rearrangement testing in the BRCA genes", and "women tested before 2013 would not have had access to multigene panel testing"; for these patients, "further consultation with a specialist in cancer genetics may help to clarify their residual risk and the need for additional testing". Ongoing follow-up is emphasized: "It is important for high-risk individuals to stay in contact with clinicians experienced in the care of women at increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer".

### A young woman with bilateral breast cancer: identifying a genetic cause and implications for management [^cbf16b29]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is a common manifestation of an underlying genetic susceptibility to cancer, and 5% to 10% of all breast cancers are associated with a germline mutation in a known risk allele. Detection of mutations has implications for targeted screening and prevention strategies for probands, and for genetic counseling and testing of their family members. This report presents a case involving a 35-year-old woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer who presented with a palpable right breast lump. Imaging revealed multiple bilateral breast masses and right axillary adenopathy, and core needle biopsies showed invasive ductal carcinoma in both the right and left breast. This report discusses the appropriate genetics evaluation for a patient with bilateral breast cancer at a young age, including testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, followed, if negative, by consideration of testing for mutations in TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Given the specialized counseling and testing needs of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and the implications for targeted screening strategies if a mutation is found, referral to a cancer genetics expert is strongly recommended.

### Risk assessment and genetic counseling for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^5fc29062]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2007). Low credibility.

These cancer genetic counseling recommendations describe the medical, psychosocial and ethical implications of identifying at-risk individuals for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) through cancer risk assessment, with or without genetic susceptibility testing. They were developed by members of the Practice Issues Subcommittee of the National Society of Genetic Counselors' Familial Cancer Risk Counseling Special Interest Group. The information contained in this document is derived from extensive review of the current literature on cancer genetic risk assessment as well as the professional expertise of genetic counselors with significant experience in education and counseling regarding hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Critical components of the process include the ascertainment of medical and family histories, determination and communication of cancer risk, assessment of risk perception, education regarding the genetics of HBOC, discussion of molecular testing for HBOC if appropriate (including benefits, risks and limitations) and any necessary follow-up. These recommendations do not dictate an exclusive course of management or guarantee a specific outcome. Moreover, they do not replace the professional judgment of a health care provider based on the clinical situation of a client.

Table 3 — Risk-reducing surgical options indicate that risk reducing mastectomy may be considered depending upon screening quality or patient concern, reduces the risk of breast cancer by at least 90%, and has no standard recommended age across 'breast cancer genes'; counseling should always include degree of protection, reconstruction options, risks, and consideration of family history, residual breast cancer risk with age, and life expectancy; risk reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended between the ages of 35–40 or after childbearing, and because ovarian cancer onset in BRCA2 P/LPVs is an average of 8–10 years later than in BRCA1 P/LPVs, it is reasonable to delay RRSO until age 40–45 y in patients with BRCA2 P/LPVs; salpingectomy alone is not the standard of care for risk reduction.

### Risk assessment and management of high risk familial breast cancer [^acd84f67]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

The demand for genetic services by women with a family history of breast cancer has increased exponentially over the last few years. It is important that risks to women are accurately assessed and that processes are in place for appropriate counselling and management. The classification of risk into average, moderate, and high, depending upon the assessed lifetime risk of breast cancer, allows for the management of moderate risk women within cancer units and high risk women within the regional genetic centres. Management of high risk women includes discussion of options including screening, chemoprevention, and preventive surgery. The majority of these options are still unproven in the long term and continuing research is needed for their evaluation. Mutation screening and predictive testing are now a reality for a minority of families, allowing for a more informed basis for decisions regarding management options.

### Hereditary cancer syndromes and risk assessment: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION SUMMARY, number 793 [^2eb7c141]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

A hereditary cancer syndrome is a genetic predisposition to certain types of cancer, often with onset at an early age, caused by inherited pathogenic variants in one or more genes. Most hereditary cancer syndromes exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance. The most common hereditary cancer syndromes related to women's cancer include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. A hereditary cancer risk assessment is the key to identifying patients and families who may be at increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. Assessments should be performed by obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric-gynecologic care providers and should be updated regularly. An assessment includes information on personal and family history, including pathology, imaging reports, and evaluation of other medical risk factors for cancer. If a hereditary cancer risk assessment suggests an increased risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome, referral to a specialist in cancer genetics or a health care provider with expertise in genetics is recommended for expanded gathering of family history information, risk assessment, education, and counseling, which may lead to genetic testing and tailored cancer screening or risk reduction measures, or both. Currently, genetic testing is guided by personal history, family history, pedigree analysis and, in some cases, risk models that may include pathology reports and confirmation of cancer diagnoses with medical records, death certificates, or both. Counseling before and after genetic testing is an important part of the process to discuss rationale for any genetic testing, disclose results, define other cancer risks, identify educational needs, and secure referrals if necessary for ongoing management. This revision includes updates related to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, cascade testing, and referrals to genetics specialists.

3.000000000000000e+00 Simplifying eligibility criteria to universal testing at 5% mutation likelihood

a. Testing at 5% mutation likelihood for unaffected patients with an FDR/SDR with OC

Making the same assumptions around cancer confirmations as in (1) but assessing all adult (≥ 18) patients equally, 229 patients are eligible for testing, and we would identify approximately 11 carriers (figure 1, table 1). This would be around four patients per month equating to a half-day clinic per month.

b. Testing at 5% mutation likelihood for patients without an FDR/SDR without OC

2338 females and 184 males meet testing criteria prior to any cancer confirmations being undertaken, with approximately 126 carriers identified (figure 1). This would equate to ~46 patients per month.

c. Testing at 5% mutation likelihood for patients with BC

All women with a BC diagnosis under the age of 50 meet a testing threshold of 5% mutation likelihood. Approximately 4884 women between the ages of 45 and 49 are diagnosed with BC in the UK each year. 2573 women between 40 and 44 are diagnosed with BC in the UK each year(figure 1). With a population of 3.8 million people, SWTCG covers ~6% of the UK population, with ~447 newly diagnosed women with BC per year or ~37 per month. If we assume at least a 5% mutation pick-up across this cohort, testing would detect around 22 carriers.

### Risk assessment and genetic counseling for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes-practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^b4bb6f00]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2021). High credibility.

Published guidelines for referral and testing in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer — genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes is generally only offered to patients with high probability of carrying P/LPVs, yet once a patient has been identified as an appropriate candidate for genetic testing, the testing options should be fully explained. It is imperative for the healthcare professional to explain why the test is being offered; what type(s) of testing is/are available; including the potential cost and insurance coverage issues; how the results might affect the patient's risk for cancer; what medical management options may be offered based on the results; and the importance of sharing results with family members. Even in instances when a patient presents with a 'negative' direct-to-consumer test report, healthcare providers must continue using traditional criteria for referral for genetic evaluation, as there are limitations to these analyses. For those who are at high risk, population-based genetic testing may not be appropriate and might not replace targeted single-gene or panel testing coordinated by a genetics professional. Identification of a P/LPV may dramatically alter the course of medical management as well as treatment options for a patient whose prior probability of a P/LPV is low, and genetic test results often confirm the underlying molecular etiology of cancer risk in the family and allow for at-risk relatives to be identified by testing for the known familial variant. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines suggest that the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider experienced in cancer genetics should be relied upon to determine the appropriateness of genetic testing, as opposed to using a numerical threshold.

### Risk assessment and genetic counseling for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes-practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^80c3aa68]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2021). High credibility.

Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) tumor and germline testing — referral, negative tumor test limitations, and variant of uncertain significance (VUS) management are outlined as follows: Clinicians should be aware of whether tumor, germline, or both have been conducted, and adequately interpret this information for patients. Current NCCN guidelines recommend that any individual, at any age, with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (P/LPV) in a cancer-susceptibility gene on tumor testing be referred for genetics evaluation. Conversely, the absence of a P/LPV on a tumor test does not rule out a germline variant, and individuals with normal or negative tumor testing should still undergo germline analysis if they meet established criteria or clinical suspicion of hereditary cancer. In the case of a germline VUS, patients should be managed based on personal and family history, and individualized management may include increased surveillance and possibly other interventions, such as surgery or chemoprevention, depending on their history rather than the test result. Typically, family members are not tested for the VUS. Some VUS will be reclassified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, and patients should be re-contacted for discussion of cancer risks; procedures and policies regarding re-contacting patients are challenging, and ideally it is a shared responsibility between healthcare providers, laboratories, and patients, respecting previously obtained patient consent.

Patient Story

The proband (Fig. 1, III6), a 53-year-old woman, was diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Supplementary Table S1). She was admitted to the hospital at age 50 after experiencing symptoms of a pelvic mass that had been enlarging for 3 months. A pelvic ultrasound examination revealed a 63% increase in the diameter of a mixed mass in the right adnexal area, from 3.0 to 4.9 cm over 3 months. Four days after admission, she underwent a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. When ovarian adenocarcinoma was diagnosed by intraoperative pathological examination, the patient also underwent abdominal radical hysterectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Genetic counseling was conducted for the proband, revealing a significant familial predisposition of cancer, characterized by 4 documented individuals with ovarian cancer and 1 with rectal adenocarcinoma. Notably, patient III6 represented the fourth woman in her family to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Her mother (II3, Fig. 1) was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 45 and succumbed to liver metastases from ovarian cancer at age 50. II9, the maternal aunt of III6 and the younger sister of II3, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 44. Despite undergoing surgical intervention and receiving paclitaxel-carboplatin therapy, II9 succumbed to cancer 2 years later. Furthermore, the proband's cousin (III3), the daughter of her maternal uncle, was diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer at the age of 38 and died at age 42. In addition, III3's father was diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma at age 77 and died at age 79. Notably, 1 year following the proband's diagnosis, another cousin (III11) was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a right radical mastectomy.

### Consensus guidelines on genetic ` testing for hereditary breast cancer from the American Society of Breast Surgeons [^c03d2dde]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this consensus guideline is to outline recommendations for genetic testing that medical professionals can use to assess hereditary risk for breast cancer.

Methods

Literature review included large datasets, basic and clinical science publications, and recent updated national guidelines. Genetic testing to assess hereditary risk of cancer is a complex, broad, and dynamic area of medical research. The dominant focus of this guideline is limited in scope to breast cancer.

Results

There is a lack of consensus among experts regarding which genes among many should be tested in different clinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the understanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in many genes.

Conclusions

Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer. Recent data are reviewed that support genetic testing being offered to each patient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic testing is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with other genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local treatment recommendations. Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. Genetic testing should be made available to patients without a history of breast cancer who meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Finally, variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable and these patients should be managed based on their individual risk factors.

The 5-year experience since the identification of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes has shown that genetic evaluation and testing can increase understanding of cancer risks for individuals with a personal or family history of early onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer. However, testing needs to be undertaken in a clinical setting where pretest counseling, including likelihood of identifying a mutation and risks and benefits of the process are provided. Identifying women who carry mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 has implications for prevention, screening and treatment of these cancers.

### Committee opinion no. 634: hereditary cancer syndromes and risk assessment [^b23810f2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

A hereditary cancer syndrome is a genetic predisposition to certain types of cancer, often with onset at an early age, caused by inherited mutations in one or more genes. Cases of cancer commonly encountered by obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric-gynecologic providers — such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer — are features of specific hereditary cancer syndromes. The most common hereditary cancer syndromes related to gynecologic cancer include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. A hereditary cancer risk assessment is the key to identifying patients and families who may be at increased risk of developing certain types of cancer. Screening should include, at minimum, a personal cancer history and a first- and second-degree relative cancer history that includes a description of the type of primary cancer, the age of onset, and the lineage (paternal versus maternal) of the family member. In addition, a patient's ethnic background can influence her genetic risk. If a hereditary cancer risk assessment suggests an increased risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome, referral to a specialist in cancer genetics or a health care provider with expertise in genetics is recommended for expanded gathering of family history information, risk assessment, education, and counseling, which may lead to genetic testing.

ACMG Practice Resource — CHEK2 case #3 illustrates applied testing and surveillance decisions: a 45-year-old woman with atypical ductal hyperplasia confirmed as low-grade DCIS had genetic testing because of a maternal family history of cancer and was found to have a CHEK2 likely pathogenic splice-donor variant c.1461+1G > T. Discussion points specify that the CHEK2 likely pathogenic variant was inherited from the side of the family without any history of breast cancer; testing for her siblings, particularly her sister, would be recommended, and testing her brother may also be relevant; the maternal family history of breast cancer would further increase the patient's breast cancer risk; breast cancer surveillance recommendations should be guided by CanRisk assessment; breast cancer risk management should be recommended based on country-specific surveillance guidelines; and, in the absence of a family history of colorectal cancer, colonoscopy surveillance should be offered in accordance with population-based guidelines.

### Practice bulletin No 182: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome [^edd7b8db]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical considerations and recommendations — genetic counseling indications and risk assessment — Genetic counseling is recommended for all women with ovarian epithelial cancer (this includes fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer) and for individuals who have a personal or family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, and evaluating a patient's risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome should be a routine part of obstetric and gynecologic practice. Initial risk evaluation should include a personal medical history and family history, and at minimum should include a personal cancer history and a family cancer history that includes first-degree and second-degree relatives from the paternal and maternal lineages, a description of the type of primary cancer, the age of onset, and the lineage of the family member; a patient's ethnic background can influence her genetic risk. When evaluating a family history, predisposing genes for breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer can be transmitted through the father as well as the mother and therefore paternal family history should be obtained, and adoption, hysterectomy or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or few female members may limit risk assessment. Women from high-risk groups with a higher rate of BRCA mutations (eg, Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians, and Icelanders) should have a lower threshold for referral for genetic counseling. Guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the National Society of Genetic Counselors, the National Comprehensive Care Network, and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology provide specific clinical criteria to assist health care providers in determining which patients would benefit from genetic counseling, and familial risk stratification models also may be used in initial risk screening for BRCA-related cancer; these brief risk tools are primarily intended for use by nongenetic specialists to guide patient referrals, although there is insufficient evidence to recommend any particular risk model or a specific risk threshold for referral. Genetic counseling is recommended before initiation of genetic testing.

### Personalized early detection and prevention of breast cancer: ENVISION consensus statement [^67597792]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Women with pathogenic germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes — that is, in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) — may opt to undergo prophylactic bilateral mastectomy; primary chemoprophylaxis with tamoxifen or other selective oestrogen receptor modulators has also been recommended in this group, albeit the uptake is low. Historically, members of this high-risk group have been identified on an opportunistic basis following self-referral of women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or on the basis of an ancestry associated with an increased prevalence of clinically significant pathogenic variants of BRCA1/2 (for example, in those of Jewish descent). Currently, genetic testing remains somewhat restricted for women with breast cancer; those with triple-negative, bilateral or young-onset disease might be offered a test at diagnosis, but most will be offered testing only if they also have a noted family history of the disease. The 2019 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations expand the population in which eligibility for genetic testing should be assessed to include women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer, in addition to women who have an ancestry associated with pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants.

At present, the mammographic screening programmes used for early detection of breast cancer in most high-income countries are based on the results of trials conducted at least 20–30 years ago – and have age as the only entry criterion, although the starting and stopping ages (varying from 40 to 74 years) and the frequency of screens (yearly to triennially) differ between countries. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach does not take into account the heterogeneity of the breast cancer subtypes and of the risk in the population. Three decades of mammographic early detection have witnessed an increase in the incidence of early stage cancers with a low-risk tumour biology and an increase in the detection of in situ disease, without a concomitant proportionate decrease in incidence of advanced-stage disease. Increasingly, calls have been made for a new approach to early detection with a focus on the identification of more consequential cancers and on avoiding the detection of indolent or ultra-low-risk disease.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^639b57a5]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

There is frequent concern among survivors that pregnancy after a cancer diagnosis may increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence. However, retrospective studies have not demonstrated worsening of disease outcomes with a subsequent pregnancy. Adjuvant endocrine therapy for 5–10 years substantially decreases the risk of cancer recurrence in patients with hormone positive disease but during this period ovarian reserve decreases and pregnancy is contraindicated. Recent studies show that even for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, pregnancy after appropriate cancer treatment and follow-up has no safety implications for the mother or baby, although longer follow up is needed. In the recently reported POSITIVE trial, women less than 43 years of age (mostly stage I and II) who completed 18–30 months of endocrine therapy and wanted to become pregnant held endocrine therapy for up to 2 years. These patients then resumed endocrine therapy to complete 5–10 years of treatment after pregnancy and breastfeeding or following an unsuccessful trial of conception. The study showed no increase in short-term risk of breast cancer events and temporary interruption of endocrine therapy may be incorporated as a safe option in the appropriate patient population. Longer follow-up data from this trial will be critical in determining the optimal approach for patients on endocrine therapy who wish to become pregnant. Following the diagnosis of cancer, the live birth rate after embryo cryopreservation is estimated at 40–50% while after oocyte preservation ranges between 30–40% per transfer.

Women with hereditary breast and ovarian syndromes are recommended to undergo risk-reducing gynecological surgeries at an early age adding to the already complex decision-making process for these patients. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended between 35–40 years of age for BRCA 1 carriers and 40–45 years for BRCA 2 carriers or once their family is completed. A recent global study shows that risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy improved overall survival outcomes among young woman who have a previous history of early-onset breast cancer and who carry the BRCA mutation. Preliminary data shows reduced ovarian reserve at breast cancer diagnosis in the presence of BRCA 1/2 pathogenic variants (PV) compared to women without genetic defects. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy and safety of various fertility preservation options after breast cancer diagnosis in patients carrying BRCA PV.

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^fe3ef14e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on genetic risk assessment and BRCA mutation testing for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for potentially harmful BRCA mutations in asymptomatic women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer but no personal history of cancer or known potentially harmful BRCA mutations in the family. The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing. (B recommendation)The USPSTF recommends against routine genetic counseling or BRCA testing for women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. (D recommendation).

Impact of Genetic Testing Results on Management Recommendations

Identification of patients with pathogenic variants in these genes can influence patient management in terms of high-risk screening and risk reduction as well as therapeutic options related to surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies.–For example, identifying that a breast cancer patient has a BRCA1 pathogenic variant provides that patient the opportunity to learn of her elevated risk for contralateral breast cancer as well as of ovarian cancer and to make educated decisions to reduce those risks. Studies are underway to determine whether these patients also might benefit from PARP inhibitors being included in their adjuvant therapy regimen. Another example is that radiation is relatively contraindicated in patients with TP53 pathogenic variants (associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) due to their increased risk of developing radiation-induced secondary malignancies.

Identifying a patient who has a pathogenic variant that indicates high hereditary breast cancer risk can have a profound impact on that patient's health and management. Additionally, it has potential impact on that patient's family members who should be counselled to consider testing for the mutation identified in the family, the result of which can guide their risk of breast cancer development and consideration of risk management strategies.

Just because a hereditary pathogenic mutation that predisposes to breast cancer is identified does not mean that the risk-reducing mastectomy is indicated. Risk-reducing mastectomy can be considered in BRCA1, BRCA 2, PTEN, and TP53. Consideration may also be appropriate for patients with mutations in other genes when combined with a significant family history of breast cancer.

Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants should consider risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy after child-bearing or between the ages of 35–40 years to reduce ovarian and fallopian tube cancer risk. Women with BRCA1 should consider oophorectomy between ages 35–40 years, whereas BRCA2 carriers should consider it between ages 40–45 years.

Prophylactic oophorectomy in premenopausal women with BRCA2 pathogenic variants also has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer by approximately 50%. There also is breast cancer risk reduction from RRSO in BRCA1 patients but to a lesser degree.

### When to consider risk-reducing mastectomy in BRCA1 / BRCA2 mutation carriers with advanced stage ovarian cancer: a case study illustrating the genetic counseling challenges [^aa04dcff]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

BRCA1/BRCA2 -associated cancer risk management includes increased cancer surveillance and risk reduction strategies. For breast cancer risk, additional screening using mammography and MRI is recommended with the aim of detecting cancer at an early stage (Kriege et al.). The most significant breast cancer risk reduction strategy involves bilateral mastectomy, usually combined with breast reconstruction. Risk reducing surgery is usually most relevant between approximately ages 30–60, during the years when relative breast cancer risk is high and the risk-benefit balance is more likely to be favourable. In countries with BRCA1 and BRCA2 management guidelines, discussion with women on the risks as well as the potential benefits associated with surgery is recommended (Easton et al.). A woman's age and general health have a critical impact on these risks.

Risk reduction strategies are most relevant to women identified as carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who have not yet developed cancer and the role of risk-reducing surgery in the management of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is already well established (Hartmann and Lindor). However, identification of a hereditary BRCA1 / BRCA2 mutation in a family is often via initial diagnostic testing in an individual with cancer. The benefits of identifying a germline mutation soon after diagnosis can have implications for early treatment decisions and access to more effective therapies, e.g. poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (Konecny and Kristeleit).

In the UK, as in other countries, there is movement towards offering more women with non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2, irrespective of family history (George). In our center, genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is automatically offered to every woman with epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed below age 70 years. This is based on research showing that 12% of women diagnosed below age 70 years in our region have a germline mutation, without taking family history into account (Plaskocinska et al.).

This type of unselected genetic testing in newly diagnosed women with epithelial ovarian cancer is leading to more families without a strong history of breast cancer being found with germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. In these families, there may not have been any prior anticipation of an increased breast cancer risk, given the absence of any family history of breast cancer. Women with ovarian cancer in whom the pathogenic variant has been identified may be adjusting to information about a high breast cancer risk for themselves and other family members at a vulnerable time, if this comes shortly after an ovarian cancer diagnosis.

### The effect of personal medical history and family history of cancer on the uptake of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy [^58570731]. Familial Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Women with an increased lifetime risk of ovarian cancer are advised to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to reduce risk of adnexal cancer. We investigated the uptake of RRSO and evaluated the influence of personal medical history of (breast) cancer, risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and family history of ovarian and/or breast cancer on the RRSO decision. This single center retrospective observational cohort study was performed in a tertiary multidisciplinary clinic for hereditary cancer of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands. Women ≥ 35 years old with an estimated lifetime risk of ovarian cancer ≥ 10%, who had completed childbearing, were eligible for RRSO. Uptake and timing of RRSO were analyzed. Influence of personal medical history and family history on RRSO decision making, were evaluated with logistic regression. The study population consisted of 218 women (45.0% BRCA1 mutation carrier, 28.0% BRCA2 mutation carrier, 27.0% with familial susceptibility) with 87.2% RRSO uptake. The median age at RRSO was 44.5 (range 28–73) years. Of the women undergoing RRSO, 78.3% needed ≤ 3 consultations to reach this decision. Multivariable analysis showed a significant difference in RRSO uptake for women with a history of RRM [OR 3.66 95% CI (1.12–11.98)], but no significant difference in women with a history of breast cancer [OR 1.38 95% CI (0.50–3.79)], nor with a family history of ovarian and/or breast cancer [OR 1.10 95% CI (0.44–2.76)]. We conclude that RRSO counseling, without the alternative of screening, is effective. The uptake is increased in women with a history of RRM.

Summary of recommendations (Level B) — genetic counseling and risk-reducing surgery: "Genetic counseling is recommended for all women with ovarian epithelial cancer (this includes fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer) and for individuals who have a personal or family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer". For breast cancer risk, "Women with BRCA mutations or who carry another actionable deleterious mutation that is predisposing to breast cancer should be offered risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy". For ovarian cancer risk, "Women with BRCA mutations or who carry another actionable deleterious mutation predisposing to ovarian cancer should be offered risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy", with timing individualized; "Typically, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended at age 35–40 years for BRCA1 carriers with the highest lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, whereas women with BRCA2 may consider delaying until age 40–45 years because of later onset of ovarian cancer". Procedural standards for risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are that "all tissue from the ovaries and fallopian tubes should be removed", "Thorough visualization of the peritoneal surfaces with pelvic washings should be performed", and "Complete, serial sectioning of the ovaries and fallopian tubes is necessary, with microscopic examination for occult cancer".

### Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and other hereditary syndromes: using technology to identify carriers [^085218bd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose and Methods

Most patients who harbor a genetic mutation for hereditary breast cancer have not been identified, despite the availability of genetic testing. Developing an effective approach to the identification of high-risk individuals is the key to preventing and/or providing early diagnosis of cancer in this patient population. This educational review addresses these issues.

Results and Discussion

Using data available on the internet, and making assumptions regarding the types and results of genetic testing, we have estimated the number of mutation carriers in the country and the number who have been tested and identified as such. Overall, our ability to fund and more effectively manage carriers is weak. A technological solution is discussed.

### Breast cancer risks in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer who have tested negative for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation [^9faaaa0e]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In Ontario and British Columbia, women with a strong family history of breast cancer are eligible for genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, for most families who exhibit the characteristics of hereditary transmission of breast cancer, a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is not detected. For women in these families, questions remain about their breast cancer risk and the appropriate risk management strategies. In this study, we report that women with a family history of breast cancer (i.e. two or more breast cancers under the age of 50 years, or three or more breast cancers at any age) are at elevated risk of breast cancer. In many centres, a negative BRCA report is reported as 'non-informative' (i.e. no mutation can be detected). This implies that the risk of cancer is most likely higher than those with a 'true negative' (i.e. those with a negative genetic test result in a family with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) genetic test result. However, it is unclear to what extent a woman's cancer risk is increased when faced with a 'non-informative' genetic test result. Our study confirms that women with a family history of breast cancer do have an increased risk of breast cancer; however, it should be noted that there was no evidence for an increase in the risk of ovarian or any other cancer. Surveillance and preventive measures should be directed towards breast cancer.

In an earlier study, reported on breast and ovarian cancer risk in 165 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative hereditary breast cancer families. They reported an SIR for breast cancer that was similar to ours (SIR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.9–4.9; P < 0.001). Again, no significantly increased risk was seen for ovarian cancer (SIR = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.02–8.5; P = 0.5). However, age-specific risks were not presented (likely due to the small sample size). In addition, 23% of the probands in their study were unaffected with breast cancer. This may explain why the SIR for breast cancer reported bywas lower than ours (SIR = 4.3).
