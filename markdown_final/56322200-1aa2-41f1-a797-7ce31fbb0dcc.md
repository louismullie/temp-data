## Question

At what hemoglobin A1c level is diabetes diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what hemoglobin A1c level diabetes is diagnosed at and the key conditions around its use and confirmation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, current guideline source. Then, I should verify the exact A1c cut point and the assay requirements. Next, I need to check confirmation rules for diagnosis, including handling of discordant tests. After that, I will review testing conditions and point-of-care limitations. I should then consider exceptions where A1c is unreliable and what to use instead. Finally, I will differentiate prediabetes thresholds from diabetes, note sensitivity issues in type 1 diabetes and pediatrics, and summarize the rationale for the chosen threshold based on retinopathy risk.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative source to anchor the diagnostic threshold. The American Diabetes Association Standards of Care 2025 are the most current, comprehensive, and high-credibility reference for screening and diagnosis, and I should rely primarily on these sections for HbA1c-based diagnosis and related caveats.

> Now, the primary diagnostic threshold: I need to ensure the exact cut point and method are correct. Diabetes is diagnosed at HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol), provided the test is performed in a laboratory using a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program–certified method that is standardized to the DCCT assay, which I should double-check is explicitly stated in the 2025 ADA text and consistent with prior standards [^114kB3Pu] [^112bAriw] [^114kWJK4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single result being sufficient. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, I should confirm that ADA requires a second abnormal result on a different day, preferably repeating the same test to improve concordance; for example, an initial A1c of 7.0% followed by 6.8% still confirms diabetes, and concordant elevation of two different tests (e.g. A1c and FPG) also confirms the diagnosis, which I should verify across both legacy and current guidance [^115oeite] [^116xiHbV] [^1112nrRw].

> I need to ensure the testing conditions and platform are appropriate. A1c for diagnosis must be performed in a certified laboratory using NGSP/DCCT-standardized methods; point-of-care devices are restricted to those FDA-cleared for diagnosis and should be used only by trained personnel in CLIA-certified laboratories of moderate complexity or higher, and I should verify this nuance because it is easy to overstate a blanket prohibition on point-of-care use [^117QG6Tr] [^1154km5Y] [^114kB3Pu].

> Wait, I initially thought point-of-care A1c should never be used for diagnosis, but I need to correct that. ADA 2025 allows POC A1c for diagnostic purposes only when the device has FDA approval for diagnosis and testing is conducted in appropriately certified settings with trained personnel, so I should be precise about that limitation rather than categorical in my wording [^117QG6Tr] [^1154km5Y].

> Next, I should review situations where A1c is unreliable and what to do then. When the relationship between A1c and glycemia is altered — such as in hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease, during pregnancy in the second or third trimesters and postpartum, with G6PD deficiency, in HIV, on hemodialysis, with recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or EPO therapy — ADA recommends using plasma glucose criteria rather than A1c for diagnosis, and I need to keep that front-of-mind clinically [^113FtkYW] [^113RwGrs].

> I should also confirm how to handle consistent and substantial discordance between fingerstick or CGM glucose values and laboratory A1c. ADA advises evaluating for possible assay interferences or biological factors when there is such discordance, which prompts me to double-check both the A1c method reliability and the glucose measurements before finalizing a diagnosis [^111zru9N] [^1167MvKp].

> Let me think about the differentiation from prediabetes so I do not conflate thresholds. Prediabetes is defined by A1c 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol), whereas diabetes is A1c ≥ 6.5%, and I should be clear that the prediabetes range signals elevated risk but is not itself diagnostic of diabetes, which affects follow-up intervals and preventive strategies [^114V3E6i].

> But wait, what about sensitivity concerns for type 1 diabetes and in pediatrics. I should acknowledge that A1c can be less sensitive in early or presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, and many individuals diagnosed through antibody and OGTT-based surveillance have normal or near-normal A1c at onset; thus, relying solely on A1c may miss early T1D, supporting ADA's emphasis on glucose-based diagnosis and risk-stage monitoring in presymptomatic T1D [^117HRxdL] [^112JRkyQ] [^114D3CP7].

> I will now examine the rationale for the 6.5% threshold to ensure it aligns with pathophysiology and outcomes. The cut point is anchored to the inflection in risk for diabetic retinopathy across cohorts, recognizing that glycemic risk is continuous rather than dichotomous; this supports A1c ≥ 6.5% as a pragmatic diagnostic boundary while acknowledging biological variability and the need for confirmation [^114kWJK4] [^111n9ELU] [^113QTWNn].

> Putting it all together, I should confirm the final clinical statement: Diabetes is diagnosed when HbA1c is ≥ 6.5% using an NGSP-certified, DCCT-standardized laboratory assay, with confirmatory testing on a separate day unless classic hyperglycemic symptoms or crisis are present; use plasma glucose criteria when A1c is unreliable or discordant, and remember that A1c 5.7–6.4% indicates prediabetes, not diabetes [^114kB3Pu] [^115oeite] [^113FtkYW] [^114V3E6i].

---

The diagnostic A1c threshold for diabetes is **≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)** [^114kB3Pu] [^112bAriw], measured with an NGSP-certified, DCCT-standardized laboratory method [^114kWJK4] [^114kB3Pu]. Confirm the result with a repeat **A1c** [^115oeite] or an **alternative glucose-based test** unless hyperglycemia is unequivocal or there is a hyperglycemic crisis [^114ycGUw]. Use **glucose-based criteria** [^113FtkYW] instead of A1c in conditions that alter the A1c–glycemia relationship, including hemoglobinopathies, pregnancy, recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or erythropoietin therapy [^113RwGrs] [^114dkPgY].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus

According to the ADA 2025 guidelines [^114kB3Pu], diabetes mellitus can be diagnosed by **any of the following criteria**. Criteria include: HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) measured with an NGSP-certified, DCCT-standardized laboratory method; fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) after at least 8 hours of fasting; 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during a 75-g OGTT using the WHO protocol [^112bAriw]; or random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or a hyperglycemic crisis [^116aRn5e].

---

## Confirmation of diagnosis

In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, confirm the diagnosis with a repeat A1c [^116xiHbV] or an alternative glucose-based test [^115oeite]. If results are discordant, repeat the test that exceeded the diagnostic threshold and base the diagnosis on the confirmed result [^1112nrRw].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Several factors can **affect the accuracy** of A1c measurements, including [^114dkPgY]:

- Hemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell disease) [^114kWJK4]
- Pregnancy (second and third trimesters, postpartum) [^113RwGrs]
- G6PD deficiency
- HIV infection
- Hemodialysis
- Recent blood loss or transfusion
- Hemolysis
- Erythropoietin therapy [^113FtkYW]

In these conditions, **use glucose-based criteria** (FPG, OGTT, or random plasma glucose) for diagnosis [^114kWJK4].

---

## Clinical implications of the A1c threshold

The A1c threshold of ≥ 6.5% [^114kB3Pu] is based on its association with increased risk of **microvascular complications**, particularly retinopathy [^111n9ELU]. This threshold balances sensitivity and specificity, identifying individuals at risk for diabetes-related complications [^114kWJK4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Diagnose diabetes** with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) using a certified, standardized laboratory method [^114kB3Pu].
- **Confirm the diagnosis** with a repeat A1c or alternative glucose-based test unless hyperglycemia is unequivocal [^115oeite].
- **Use glucose-based criteria** in conditions that affect A1c accuracy [^113FtkYW].

---

The A1c threshold for diagnosing diabetes is **≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)** and should be confirmed by repeat testing or an alternative glucose-based test, with consideration of factors that may affect A1c accuracy [^116aRn5e].

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^116xiHbV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, as this increases the likelihood of concurrence. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if both different tests are above the diagnostic threshold, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. On the other hand, if the results are discordant, the test with the result above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis should be based on the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes. In most circumstances, the "nondiabetic" test is typically in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test result above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C and somewhat more likely for FPG.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly focusing on HbA1c and blood glucose, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining blood glucose for the diagnosis of diabetes in conditions associated with an altered relationship between HbA1c and glycemia. These conditions include hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), G6PD deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or EPO therapy.

### How do we identify people at high risk of type 2 diabetes and help prevent the condition from developing [^111D3knz]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Identifying individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between epidemiological and clinical risk factors, as well as laboratory test results. Despite the acceptance of diagnostic thresholds for type 2 diabetes, there is no international consensus on how to classify those at high risk. Globally, these relationships may vary within and between countries and populations in ways that are not fully understood.

Debates continue regarding which tests to use, the appropriate inclusion thresholds for high risk, and how the affordability of preventive interventions might influence threshold determination in different populations. Formal classifications often depend on laboratory test results, employing one or more of three tests to define diagnostic and high-risk thresholds. These tests are the 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose value, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value, and HbA1c value. Individuals may be classified as high risk, and thus eligible for targeted interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes, based on their test values falling between the high risk inclusion and diagnostic thresholds for any of the tests.

- **High risk classifications**: This involves test values between high risk inclusion and diagnostic thresholds for applicable tests. The specific descriptors of high risk using each test or combination of tests, along with their definitions, were originally outlined in a deleted table.

### Impact of HbA1c testing at point of care on diabetes management [^1148Gzip]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a highly prevalent disease also implicated in the development of several other serious complications such as cardiovascular and renal disease. HbA1c testing is a vital step for effective diabetes management. However, given the low compliance to testing frequency and the common delay in corresponding treatment modification, HbA1c testing at the point of care (POC) offers an opportunity to improve diabetes care. In this review, based on data from 1999 to 2016, we summarize the evidence supporting the further implementation of HbA1c testing at POC, discuss its limitations, and propose recommendations for further development.

### Pitfalls in hemoglobin A1c measurement: When results may be misleading [^114dkPgY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Since its clinical debut in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was expanded in 2010 when the American Diabetes Association included A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Given hemoglobin A1c's vital role in diagnosis and treatment, it is crucial to identify clinical scenarios and interfering factors that can lead to false results. This review aims to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may result in erroneous outcomes, and explore alternative laboratory biomarkers.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes screening and new-onset diabetes prediction: a 6-year community-based prospective study [^115BXPSF]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The study investigates the A1C cutoff for detecting undiagnosed diabetes and predicting progression to diabetes. Table 2 indicates the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of A1C levels for this purpose at cutoff values between 5.0% and 6.6%.

For detecting undiagnosed diabetes, an A1C cutoff of 5.9% yielded the maximum sum of sensitivity (68%) and specificity (91%) according to ROC analysis. The positive and negative predictive values for this cutoff were 34% and 98%, respectively.

- **Table 2: Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values**: Increasing A1C cutoff levels to detect undiagnosed diabetes and predict type 2 diabetes incidence at a 6-year follow-up.

For predicting incident diabetes at 6 years, an A1C level of 5.6% was the optimal cutoff. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for this cutoff were 59%, 77%, 31%, and 91%, respectively.

To test the reliability of the A1C cut points in predicting future diabetes, the cohort was randomly divided into two groups. One half was used to define the cut point, while the other half was used to test reliability by calculating the incidence and adjusted RRs. The incidences and RRs were 31.7%, 37.6%, 46.5%, 53.3%, 58.9%, 67.6%, and 89.7% and 4.9, 5.9, 8.0, 9.4, 10.8, 13.8, and 51.5 at the A1C cutoffs of 5.6%, 5.7%, 5.8%, 5.9%, 6.0%, 6.2%, and 6.6%, respectively.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^112bAriw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes:

- **A1C ≥ 6.5%**: The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay.

- **Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)**: Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours.

- **2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**: The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.

- **In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)**: In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, results should be confirmed by repeat testing.

### Contributions of glucose and hemoglobin A1c measurements in diabetes screening [^1178QS3D]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Given the long-term consequences of untreated diabetes, patients benefit from timely diagnoses. Payer policies often recognize glucose but not hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for diabetes screening. This study evaluates the different information that glucose and HbA1c provide for diabetes screening.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of national clinical laboratory testing during 2020 when glucose and HbA1c were ordered for routine diabetes screening, excluding patients with known diabetes, out-of-range glucose, or metabolic syndrome.

- **Results**: Of 15.47 million glucose and HbA1c tests ordered simultaneously, 672,467 (4.35%) met screening inclusion criteria; 116,585 (17.3%) were excluded because of diabetes-related conditions or the specimen was nonfasting, leaving 555,882 result pairs. More than 1 in 4 patients 60 years of age or older with glucose within range had an elevated HbA1c level. HbA1c claims were denied more often for Medicare beneficiaries (38,918/65,273 [59.6%]) than for other health plans combined (23,234/291,764 [8.0%]).

- **Conclusions**: Although many health plans do not cover HbA1c testing for diabetes screening, more than 1 in 4 glucose screening patients 60 years of age or older with an in-range glucose result had an elevated HbA1c result. Guideline developers and health plans should explicitly recognize that glucose and HbA1c provide complementary information and together offer improved clinical utility for diabetes screening.

### The national clinical care commission report to Congress: Leveraging federal policies and programs to prevent diabetes in people with prediabetes [^111PU7fA]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

Individuals with an elevated fasting glucose level, elevated glucose level following a glucose challenge, or elevated hemoglobin A1c level below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes (collectively termed prediabetes) are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. More than one-third of U.S. adults have prediabetes, but fewer than one in five are aware of the diagnosis. Rigorous scientific research has demonstrated the efficacy of both intensive lifestyle interventions and metformin in delaying or preventing the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.

The National Clinical Care Commission (NCCC) was a federal advisory committee charged with evaluating and making recommendations to improve federal programs related to the prevention of diabetes and its complications. In this article, we describe the recommendations of an NCCC subcommittee that focused primarily on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes. These recommendations aim to improve federal diabetes prevention activities by:

- **Increasing awareness of and diagnosis of prediabetes** on a population basis.
- **Increasing the availability of, referral to, and insurance coverage for the National Diabetes Prevention Program** and the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program.
- **Facilitating Food and Drug Administration review and approval of metformin for diabetes prevention**.
- **Supporting research to enhance the effectiveness of diabetes prevention**.

Cognizant of the burden of type 1 diabetes, the recommendations also highlight the importance of research to advance our understanding of the etiology of and opportunities for treatment.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend restricting point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. FDA. Testing should be conducted at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratories performing testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel.

### Diabetes mellitus: Screening and diagnosis [^111fpLCj]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diagnoses made by family physicians. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure, and vascular and heart disease. Screening patients before signs and symptoms develop leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment but may not reduce rates of end-organ damage. Randomized trials show that screening for type 2 diabetes does not reduce mortality after 10 years, although some data suggest mortality benefits after 23 to 30 years. Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions decrease progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.

Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese, and repeating testing every three years if results are normal. Individuals at higher risk should be considered for earlier and more frequent screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes annually in patients 45 years and older, or in patients younger than 45 years with major risk factors.

The diagnosis can be made with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater; an A1C level of 6.5% or greater; a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater; or a 75-g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test with a plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater. Results should be confirmed with repeat testing on a subsequent day; however, a single random plasma glucose level o

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112Y2Ggc]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically with respect to indications for screening in the general population, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with prediabetes (HbA1c ≥ 5.7%, ≥ 39 mmol/mol; impaired glucose tolerance; or impaired fasting glucose) for the development of T2DM at least annually. The frequency of testing should be modified based on individual risk assessment.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114kWJK4]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

**Use of HbA1c for diabetes screening/diagnosis**: The role of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes has been considered for several years. In the past, the lack of standardization was a major barrier. With improved standardization through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), and new data demonstrating the association between HbA1c concentrations and the risk for retinopathy, the International Expert Committee recommended the use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes. In making its recommendation, the Committee also considered several technical advantages of HbA1c testing compared with glucose testing, such as its preanalytical stability and decreased biological variation. Finally, the clinical convenience of the HbA1c assay, which requires no patient fasting or tolerance tests compared with glucose-based diagnosis, convinced the Committee to recommend HbA1c testing for diagnosis. A value of ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered diagnostic based on the observed relationship with retinopathy. For diagnosis, a positive test result [≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)] should be confirmed with a repeat assay. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) indicates that although either an HbA1c assay or a glucose assay (FPG or OGTT) can be used as the confirmatory test, repeating the same test is preferred. The frequency of HbA1c testing for diagnosis has not been established, but guidelines similar to those for glucose-based testing seem appropriate. Only NGSP-certified HbA1c methods should be used to diagnose (or screen for) diabetes. The ADA cautions that point-of-care devices for measuring HbA1c should not be used for diagnosis.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^114R3ZDQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and the public at large about the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to enhanced detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests that are somewhat inconvenient to patients and clinicians, and therefore often not optimally implemented.

In this issue of *Diabetes Care*, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by either of these associations (or other organizations), it represents a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), handy, and ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been complicated by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state, as most people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state, or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, i.e. the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes screening and new-onset diabetes prediction: a 6-year community-based prospective study [^112gYkAw]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly. In the US, over 13% of adults have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and a similar prevalence has been reported in Asia. Up to 25% of newly diagnosed diabetic patients already had microvascular complications, suggesting a 6- to 7-year delay between the onset and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

Considering the clinical implications of diabetes and its complications, it is important to identify individuals with undiagnosed diabetes or those at risk of developing it soon. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening asymptomatic individuals at 3-year intervals using a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, conducting the OGTT in primary practice is challenging, and it is debatable whether the FPG concentration alone provides an accurate diagnosis of diabetes, as indicated by the estimated 40% of people with undiagnosed diabetes.

The hemoglobin A1c (A1C) level is measured in a standardized test that produces data consistent with both the international A1C-derived average glucose and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. The A1C level provides a reliable measure of chronic glycemic control without requiring a fasting or timed sample. It also correlates well with the risk of long-term diabetes complications and mortality. Several population-based studies have investigated the utility of the A1C level for detecting undiagnosed diabetes and its potential as an effective screening tool.

### Sensitivity and specificity of glycated hemoglobin as a diagnostic test for diabetes and prediabetes in Arabs [^111HfcLQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) has been recommended by the American Diabetes Association for the diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes. The diagnostic utility of A1C has not been evaluated in Arabs, a population at increased risk for developing diabetes. Our objective was to examine the sensitivity and specificity of A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes in Arabs.

In this cross-sectional study, glucose tolerance was classified by the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria specified for A1C, fasting plasma glucose, and the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. A population-based representative sample of 482 randomly selected adult Arabs without known diabetes was studied.

- **Main outcome measures**: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of A1C diagnostic cutpoints for diabetes and prediabetes were calculated. κ Coefficients were used to test for agreement between A1C categorization and glucose-based diagnoses.

- **Results**: A1C testing correctly identified 5% of individuals diagnosed with diabetes by oral glucose tolerance test, 13% by fasting plasma glucose, and 41% by both criteria. A1C alone identified 14% of individuals diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance, 9% with impaired fasting glucose, and 33% with both abnormalities. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 19% (16–23%), 100% (99–100%), and 77% (69–85%) for diabetes A1C cutpoint and 14% (11–17%), 91% (89–94%), and 57% (52–62%) for prediabetes A1C range.

### Management of type 2 diabetes: Are we making progress [^112bvCUs]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

In recent years, efforts to manage type 2 diabetes have focused on optimizing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The main goals include improving patient outcomes and reducing complications. However, challenges remain regarding patient adherence and medication side effects.

- **Patient adherence**: Many patients struggle to maintain adherence to treatment plans due to various personal and socioeconomic barriers. These include the complexity of medication regimens and the need for lifestyle changes.

- **Medication side effects**: Side effects from medications can deter patients from continuing treatment. Efforts are being made to develop drugs with fewer adverse effects and to better tailor treatments to individual patient needs.

While progress is being made, the need for innovative strategies and patient-centered care remains critical. Addressing these challenges is essential for improving the management of type 2 diabetes.

### Contributions of glucose and hemoglobin A1c measurements in diabetes screening [^113yh1Mq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest that glucose and HbA1c are complementary when screening for glucose abnormalities, and excluding either test could delay diagnosis and management in many patients. Further studies should assess the time delay caused by routinely excluding HbA1c as part of diabetes screening and the magnitude of the differences. We encourage guideline developers and health plans to recognize that glucose and HbA1c provide complementary information and together offer improved clinical utility for diabetes screening.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^114ycGUw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) obtained in close temporal proximity. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, changes over time, or because A1C, FPG, and post-challenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. When an elevated A1C coincides with a "nondiabetic" FPG, it may indicate greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia. Conversely, in the scenario of a high FPG but an A1C below the diabetes cut-off point, augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result indicating diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear based on clinical grounds, such as in patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. Preferably, the same test should be repeated for confirmation, as this increases the likelihood of consistent results. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, when results from two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient, and both are above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^1112nrRw]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize those patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In the setting of an elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, there is a likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia. Conversely, in a scenario of high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point, augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or a hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^116bGH72]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple laboratory tests are used to diagnose and manage patients with diabetes mellitus; however, the quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these tests varies substantially.

- **Approach**: An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for the use of laboratory testing for patients with diabetes. A new system was developed to grade the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Draft guidelines were posted on the internet and presented at the 2007 Arnold O. Beckman Conference. The document was modified in response to oral and written comments, and a revised draft was posted in 2010 and again modified in response to written comments. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry and the Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine Committee of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry jointly reviewed the guidelines, which were accepted after revisions by the Professional Practice Committee and subsequently approved by the Executive Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

- **Content**: In addition to long-standing criteria based on measurement of plasma glucose, diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased blood hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations. Monitoring of glycemic control is performed by self-monitoring of plasma or blood glucose with meters and by laboratory analysis of HbA(1c). The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and other analytes are addressed.

### Haemoglobin A1c in the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus [^116pDsu3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is due to celebrate its 40th anniversary. Many argue that the clinical studies relating the test to diabetes complications during its late 20s are likely its finest achievement. This article examines how HbA1c has matured and discusses in detail how its many strengths and idiosyncrasies as a marker of glycaemic risk have become more clearly understood in its third decade. As HbA1c approaches middle age, this paper describes how the test appears to be experiencing a mid-life crisis, as debate over how its results should be expressed seems likely to divide opinion among clinicians for some time to come.

### Diabetic subjects diagnosed through the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1) are often asymptomatic with normal A1C at diabetes onset [^112JRkyQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Several laboratory results were examined for those diagnosed during the study. Of the 246 people diagnosed, 177 (72.0%) had an A1C within 30 days of diagnosis, and 158 (89.3%) of these A1C tests were within one week of diagnosis. The mean A1C was 6.41 ± 1.15%, with 2 of 177 (1.13%) having an A1C greater than 10%. Additionally, 90 subjects (50.8%) had an A1C in the normal range (less than 6.2%) near the time of diagnosis. The mean A1C of the group with normal A1C at onset of diabetes was 5.7%, ranging from 4.9% to 6.1%.

- **Age-related comparisons**: A1C at diagnosis was normal for 53% of subjects under 18 years of age and 39% of those older than 18 years. A1C at diagnosis was compared with the last reported A1C of individuals randomized in the study but not diagnosed with diabetes. The mean A1C for this group was 5.38 ± 0.41%, which was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) when compared with those diagnosed with diabetes.

- **ROC analysis**: An A1C of 6.05% was identified as achieving optimal sensitivity (53.7%) and specificity (96.7%) from the analysis.

### Performance of A1c versus OGTT for the diagnosis of prediabetes in a community-based screening [^116Gtp7b]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The reliable identification of individuals at risk for developing diabetes is critical to instituting preventative strategies. Studies suggest that the accuracy of using hemoglobin A1c as a sole diagnostic criterion for diabetes may be variable across different ethnic groups. We postulate that there will be a lack of concordance between A1c and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diagnosing prediabetes across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations.

A total of 218 asymptomatic adults at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) were assessed with A1c and OGTT for the diagnosis of prediabetes. Glucose homeostasis status was assigned as no diabetes (A1c 6.4% [46 mmol/mol]). Inclusion criteria were age > 18 years and at least one of the following: a family history of diabetes, a history of gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, non-Caucasian race, or obesity. Subjects received a fasting 75-g OGTT and A1c on the same day. Bowker's test of symmetry was employed to determine agreement between the tests.

Data from 99 Hispanic patients and 79 NHW patients were analyzed. There was no concordance between A1c and OGTT for Hispanic (P = 0.002) or NHW individuals (P = 0.003) with prediabetes.

A1c is discordant with OGTT among Hispanic and NHW subjects for the diagnosis of prediabetes. Sole use of A1c to designate glycemic status will result in a greater prevalence of prediabetes among Hispanic and NHW New Mexicans.

Abbreviations: A1c = hemoglobin A1c, BMI = body mass index.

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1C-based diagnostic criteria [^113iAKCS]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Although A1C screening may be of limited value, better test characteristics appear to be provided by measuring random plasma glucose or glucose 1 hour following a 50-g oral glucose challenge; either could be obtained opportunistically during office visits, at any time of day, and without a prior fast. Other tests or combinations of tests may also be useful, and it is possible that health economics analyses would identify one test or another as being more cost-effective in different patient populations and clinical settings. We still need to identify previously unrecognized diabetes and pre-diabetes to initiate preventive management.

### Can 'personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^114Jt8NH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes as well as for cardiovascular complications increases along a continuum, rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of a preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce here the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal on a population-based norm. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. That the first-line therapies are so effective, safe, and simple makes these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114kB3Pu]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to diagnosis, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend diagnosing diabetes based on HbA1c or plasma glucose criteria. This includes using either the fasting plasma glucose value, the 2-hour plasma glucose value during a 75-g OGTT, or a random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms or crises criteria:

- **HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol)**: Performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay.

- **Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L)**: With no caloric intake for at least 8 hours.

- **2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT**: Performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.

- **Random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L)**: In patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, obtained at any time of the day without regard to time since the previous meal.

### Hemoglobin A1c is a reliable criterion for diagnosing type 1 diabetes in childhood and adolescence [^113sUnn4]. Pediatric Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Little is known about the use of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test for the diagnosis of diabetes in childhood and adolescence. The aim is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c at the onset of childhood type 1 diabetes.

- **Methods**: A total of 184 children and adolescents with blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) were included: 84.8% (n = 156, mean age 9.0 years) with new onset of type 1 diabetes, and 15.2% (n = 28, mean age 6.1 years) with transient hyperglycemia. HbA1c was measured using the Bayer® DCA2000 analyzer.

- **Results**: Patients with new onset of type 1 diabetes (n = 156) had HbA1c values between 6.6% and > 14% (mean (SD) 11.4 (2.0)%; IQR, interquartile range 9.8–13.3%). All patients suffered from typical symptoms of hyperglycemia, i.e. polyuria and polydipsia. In the patient group with transient hyperglycemia (n = 28), HbA1c values ranged between 4.5% and 6.1% (mean (SD) 5.3 (0.4)%; IQR 5.0–5.6%). None of these patients reported typical symptoms of diabetes. All patients with HbA1c values greater than 6.35% had new onset of type 1 diabetes. Sensitivity of HbA1c at the onset of childhood type 1 diabetes was calculated to be 100%. In patients with HbA1c values less than 6.35%, the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes could be excluded. Thus, specificity of HbA1c as a diagnostic criterion was 100%.

- **Conclusions**: Childhood type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed and excluded with high reliability by means of HbA1c testing.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^115qMjyB]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize those patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests, such as FPG and A1C, obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and post-challenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In the setting of an elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, the likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia may be present. In the opposite scenario, where there is a high FPG yet A1C is below the diabetes cut point, augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or a hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests, such as FPG and A1C, are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^1142JUxn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular and neuropathic complications of diabetes and, if implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes, is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease. Therefore, a reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults is < 7%.

Because additional analyses from several randomized trials suggest a small but incremental benefit in microvascular outcomes with A1C values closer to normal, providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals for selected individual patients, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Such patients might include those with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant cardiovascular disease.

Conversely, less stringent A1C goals may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, and those with longstanding diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite diabetes self-management education, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin.

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1C-based diagnostic criteria [^113L7Xdj]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

An International Expert Committee (IEC) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed diagnostic criteria for diabetes and pre-diabetes based on A1C levels. We hypothesized that screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with A1C measurements would differ from using oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).

- **Research design and methods**: We compared pre-diabetes, dysglycemia (diabetes or pre-diabetes), and diabetes identified by the proposed criteria (A1C ≥ 6.5% for diabetes and 6.0–6.4% [IEC] or 5.7–6.4% [ADA] for high risk/pre-diabetes) with standard OGTT diagnoses in three datasets. Non-Hispanic white or black adults without known diabetes who had A1C and 75-g OGTT measurements were included from the prospective Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance study (n = 1,581) and from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (n = 2014), and NHANES 2005–2006 (n = 1,111).

- **Results**: OGTTs revealed pre-diabetes in 35.8% and diabetes in 5.2% of combined study subjects. A1C provided receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas for diabetes of 0.79–0.83, but ROC curve areas were ≤ 0.70 for dysglycemia or pre-diabetes. The proposed criteria missed 70% of individuals with diabetes, 71–84% with dysglycemia, and 82–94% with pre-diabetes. Compared with the IEC criteria, the ADA criteria for pre-diabetes resulted in fewer false-negative and more false-positive results. There were also racial differences, with false-positive results being more common in black subjects and false-negative results being more common in white subjects.

### Executive summary: Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114F16N1]. Diabetes Care (2023). Low credibility.

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in patients with diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments in the full version of the guideline). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the patients measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114V3E6i]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically concerning diagnosis, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend diagnosing prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals based on HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG) criteria, or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT):

- **HbA1c**: 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol)
- **Fasting plasma glucose**: 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L)
- **2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT**: 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L)

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^113QTWNn]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The International Expert Committee is indeed careful to point out that the threshold does not identify an A1C level below which risk is nil but, instead, one below which risk is lower: an inflection point in a continuous positive relationship rather than a true step function. However, the outcome used is retinopathy, i.e. one of the microvascular complications. It is natural to wonder whether a different threshold might have been chosen if the outcome considered had been atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Available data on the relationship between A1C and CVD risk may be less defined than those relating to retinopathy, but CVD events are more prevalent than microvascular events in type 2 diabetes. Admittedly, recent trial results showing an uncertain link between lowering glucose and macrovascular complications add to the complexity of defining risk using solely one feature (i.e.g.lucose) of a multidimensional metabolic disease. It would be reassuring if a critical analysis of the evidence converged on the same — or very close to the same — A1C level to be posited as the diabetes diagnostic threshold carrying definite risk for both micro- and macroangiopathy.

The lack of an A1C value for a formal definition of "pre-diabetes" is likely to raise further and related concerns. Here again, other methods, including the use of glucose values, may be helpful, but there continues to be little consensus on the best test to use in predicting diabetes. A variety of mathematical models, questionnaires, and risk engines can be used to define the risk of diabetes.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^11627gHn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Testing frequency**: There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of HbA1c testing. The ADA recommends, "For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician". In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, expert opinion recommends HbA1c testing "at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control)… and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals". These testing recommendations are for nonpregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients with diabetes who are admitted to a hospital should have HbA1c measured if the results of testing in the previous 2–3 months are not available. Diabetes quality-assurance programs, such as the Provider Recognition Program and HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set), have generally required documentation of the percentage of diabetic patients who have had at least one HbA1c measurement during the preceding year. Studies have established that serial HbA1c measurements (quarterly for 1 year) produce significant improvements in HbA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.

- **Interpretation**: HbA1c values in patients with diabetes constitute a continuum. They range from within the reference interval in a small percentage of patients whose mean plasma glucose concentrations are close to those of nondiabetic individuals, to markedly increased values.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^1174PUGe]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The relation of A1C to average glucose levels, while good, is not perfect. It is conceivable that this "glycation gap" may actually offer an advantage as it might better predict the risk of complications in individuals more susceptible to nonenzymatic glycation of various proteins, including those fundamentally important to vascular biology. Nevertheless, a significant amount of controversy is expected in this regard.

Cost and lack of standardization of the A1C test in some countries are likely to be additional contentious issues following the recommendations of the committee. However, the experts recognize the difficulty and envision a reasonably balanced approach. For those unable to obtain a standardized or affordable A1C test, it is suggested to continue using well-established methods of glucose testing — fasting and postchallenge glucose — the older diagnostic criteria of which will remain in place. A similar approach should apply to individuals with hemoglobinopathies or other disorders of red cell life span, particularly common in certain ethnic groups, as A1C measurement may be unreliable here.

There is likely to be some initial debate concerning the cut point — A1C of 6.5% — chosen to define diabetes. This is a problem whenever a diagnosis, which must be dichotomous by definition, is coerced from a continuous variable. However, one might argue that even the fasting glucose threshold of 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l), while not entirely arbitrary, represents a point along a continuum of metabolic derangement.

### Point-of-care HbA1c in clinical practice: Caveats and considerations for optimal use [^111QPPKS]. Diabetes Care (2024). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is widely used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Accurate measurement of A1C is necessary for optimal clinical value. Assay standardization has markedly improved the accuracy and consistency of A1C testing. Devices to measure A1C at point of care (POC) are commercially available, allowing rapid results when the patient is seen.

In this review, we describe how standardization of A1C testing was achieved, leading to high-quality results in clinical laboratories. We address the use of POC A1C testing in clinical situations and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of POC A1C testing. We emphasize the importance of considering the limitations of these devices and following correct testing procedures to ensure that accurate A1C results are obtained for optimal care of patients.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with presymptomatic T1DM for disease progression using HbA1c approximately every 6 months and 75-g OGTT (fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose) annually. The frequency of monitoring should be modified based on individual risk assessments, which take into account factors such as age, the number and type of autoantibodies present, and glycemic metrics.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^114LCLN7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

As was the case with FPG and 2-h PG, defining a lower limit of an intermediate category of A1C is somewhat arbitrary, as the risk of diabetes with any measure or surrogate of glycemia is a continuum that extends well into the normal ranges. To maximize the equity and efficiency of preventive interventions, such an A1C cut point should balance the costs of "false negatives" (failing to identify those who are going to develop diabetes) against the costs of "false positives" (falsely identifying and then spending intervention resources on those who were not going to develop diabetes anyway).

Several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5% and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes, with 5-year incidences ranging from 9% to 25%. An A1C range of 6.0–6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% and 50% and a relative risk 20 times higher compared to an A1C of 5.0%. In a community-based study of Black and White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose. Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with a similar diabetes risk to the high-risk participants in the DPP. Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7–6.4% as identifying those at high risk.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^113DzGPX]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In the setting of an elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, the likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia may be present. In the opposite scenario (high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point), augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1C assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^115zDRad]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

For the identification of individuals at high risk for diabetes, individuals with an A1C level ≥ 6% but < 6.5% are likely at the highest risk for progression to diabetes. However, this range should not be considered an absolute threshold at which preventative measures are initiated. The classification of subdiabetic hyperglycemia as pre-diabetes is problematic because it suggests that all individuals so classified will develop diabetes and that individuals who do not meet these glycemia-driven criteria, regardless of other risk factor values, are unlikely to develop diabetes — neither of which is the case.

Moreover, the categorical classification of individuals as high risk (e.g. IFG or IGT) or low risk, based on any measure of glycemia, is less than ideal because the risk for progression to diabetes appears to be a continuum. The glucose-related terms describing subdiabetic hyperglycemia will be phased out of use as clinical diagnostic states as A1C measurements replace glucose measurements for the diagnosis of diabetes.

When assessing risk, implementing prevention strategies, or initiating a population-based prevention program, other diabetes risk factors should be taken into account. In addition, the A1C level at which to begin preventative measures should reflect the resources available, the size of the population affected, and the anticipated degree of success of the intervention. Further analyses of cost-benefit should guide the selection of high-risk groups targeted for intervention within specific populations.

### Diabetic subjects diagnosed through the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1) are often asymptomatic with normal A1C at diabetes onset [^117HRxdL]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Upon diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, patients are usually symptomatic, and many have ketoacidosis. Screening for islet autoantibodies (IAs) has been shown to decrease A1C levels and the rate of hospitalization at diabetes onset. Metabolic tests and the presence of symptoms were described at diabetes onset during the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1).

- **Research design and methods**: The DPT-1 screened relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes for islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs). Those with positive ICAs had intravenous and oral glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs and OGTTs) and were randomized into one of two prevention trials. Throughout the DPT-1 parenteral and oral insulin study, 246 people were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

- **Results**: Of the 246 subjects diagnosed with diabetes, 218 had data regarding the presence of symptoms, and 138 (63.3%) reported no symptoms suggestive of diabetes. Eight subjects (3.67%) presented with ketosis. Subjects presented with a mean ± SD A1C of 6.41 ± 1.15%. At diagnosis, 90 subjects (50.8%) had A1C in the normal range (< 6.2%). OGTT data at the time of diagnosis indicate that 35.4% had a glucose result of < 100 mg/dl at 0 min.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of subjects diagnosed with type 1 diabetes through the DPT-1 were asymptomatic at onset and had normal fasting glucose and A1C levels. This suggests that intermittent screening (IA followed by OGTT) may allow the diagnosis of diabetes before severe metabolic decompensation. Screening with A1C will miss identifying many of the subjects with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in this cohort.

### Diagnosis of diabetes using hemoglobin A1c: Should recommendations in adults be extrapolated to adolescents [^1173aXZh]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

To compare test performance of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for detecting diabetes mellitus/pre-diabetes for adolescents versus adults in the United States, individuals were defined as having diabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-hour plasma glucose [2-hr PG] ≥ 200 mg/dL) or pre-diabetes (100 ≤ FPG < 126 mg/dL; 140 ≤ 2-hr PG < 200 mg/dL). HbA1c test performance was evaluated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses.

Few adolescents had undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (n = 4). When assessing FPG to detect diabetes, an HbA1c of 6.5% had sensitivity rates of 75.0% (30.1% to 95.4%) and 53.8% (47.4% to 60.0%) and specificity rates of 99.9% (99.5% to 100.0%) and 99.5% (99.3% to 99.6%) for adolescents and adults, respectively. Additionally, when assessing FPG to detect diabetes mellitus, an HbA1c of 5.7% had sensitivity rates of 5.0% (2.6% to 9.2%) and 23.1% (21.3% to 25.0%) and specificity rates of 98.3% (97.2% to 98.9%) and 91.1% (90.3% to 91.9%) for adolescents and adults, respectively. ROC analyses suggested that HbA1c is a poorer predictor of diabetes mellitus (area under the curve, 0.88 versus 0.93) and pre-diabetes (FPG area under the curve, 0.61 versus 0.74) for adolescents compared with adults. Performance was poor regardless of whether FPG or 2-hr PG measurements were used.

Use of HbA1c for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes in adolescents may be premature until information from more definitive studies is available.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: A systematic review [^111n9ELU]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Use of A1c for the identification of persons with undiagnosed diabetes has been investigated for a number of years. A1c better reflects long-term glycemic exposure than diagnostic tests based on point-in-time measures of fasting and postload blood glucose, and it has improved test-retest reliability. In addition, A1c requires no fasting or 2-hour wait for the oral glucose tolerance test. These advantages should lead to increased identification and more timely treatment of persons with diabetes.

Recently, an American Diabetes Association (ADA)-organized international expert committee recommended the adoption of the A1c assay for the diagnosis of diabetes at a cut point of 6.5%. This cut point was primarily derived from a review of studies that examined the association of A1c values with incident retinopathy, with some of the most influential data obtained from recently published prospective studies. Retinopathy was chosen as the ultimate criterion because it is among the main complications of diabetes. Identifying the point on the A1c distribution most closely related to future retinopathy will identify persons in greatest need of interventions for the prevention of diabetes complications.

In addition to utility and convenience, A1c could help identify persons at increased risk of developing diabetes. This is an important public health priority since a structured lifestyle program or the drug metformin can reduce the incidence of diabetes by at least 50% and 30%, respectively.

### Moving to an A1c-based diagnosis of diabetes has a different impact on prevalence in different ethnic groups [^111jNUTe]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To compare screen-detected diabetes prevalence and the degree of diagnostic agreement by ethnicity with the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-based and newly proposed A1c-based diagnostic criteria.

- **Research design and methods**: Six studies (1999–2009) from Denmark, the U.K. Australia, Greenland, Kenya, and India were tested for the probability of an A1c ≥ 6.5% among diabetic case subjects based on an OGTT. The difference in probability between centers was analyzed by logistic regression adjusting for relevant confounders.

- **Results**: Diabetes prevalence was lower with the A1c-based diagnostic criteria in four of six studies. The probability of an A1c ≥ 6.5% among OGTT-diagnosed case subjects ranged widely (17.0–78.0%) by study center. Differences in diagnostic agreement between ethnic subgroups in the U.K. study were of the same magnitude as between-country comparisons.

- **Conclusions**: A shift to an A1c-based diagnosis for diabetes will have substantially different consequences for diabetes prevalence across ethnic groups and populations.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^115bQfZz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically concerning indications for screening (choice of test), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose during the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or HbA1c to screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is advised to ensure an adequate carbohydrate intake of at least 150 grams per day for three days prior to obtaining an OGTT.

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^1144eEyC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

At symptomatic stages, the diagnosis of diabetes is traditionally based on measurements of dysglycaemia, including elevated haemoglobin A1c levels and elevated fasting or random plasma glucose levels. Haemoglobin A1c is a measure of glycated haemoglobin, providing an indirect estimate of the average glucose level over the preceding 2–3 months. Although convenient as a screening tool, it has lower sensitivity than other methods and limited utility in individuals with certain hemoglobinopathies or increased red blood cell turnover, such as pregnant women or those with anaemia. It can also be affected by liver or kidney disease and certain medications.

Diagnosis can also be made based on plasma glucose levels measured fasting, as part of an oral glucose tolerance test, or with elevated random levels in the setting of symptomatic hyperglycaemia. Given that fasting and random glucose levels can be influenced by transient factors such as physical activity levels, illness, or an acute stress response, oral glucose tolerance testing may be required to identify individuals with mild or moderate hyperglycaemia.

- **Clinical tools used for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes**: The oral glucose tolerance test is typically performed by measuring plasma glucose levels 2 hours after administering a 75-gram glucose load to a fasting patient. The increased sensitivity makes the oral glucose tolerance test preferable for screening certain individuals, including those at risk for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.
